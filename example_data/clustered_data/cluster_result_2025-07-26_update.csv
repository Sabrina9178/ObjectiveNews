0,NBC_1,"U.S. economy grew at a 2.8% pace in the second quarter, much faster than expected",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/us-economy-gdp-q2-2024-faster-than-expected-rcna163606,"Economic activity in the U.S. was considerably stronger than expected during the second quarter, according to an initial estimate Thursday from the Commerce Department.
Real gross domestic product, a measure of all the goods and services produced during the April-through-June period, increased at a 2.8% annualized pace adjusted for seasonality and inflation. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for growth of 2.1% following a 1.4% increase in the first quarter.
Consumer spending helped propel the growth number higher, as did contributions from private inventory investment and nonresidential fixed investment.
Personal consumption expenditures, the main proxy in the Bureau of Economic Analysis report for consumer activity, increased 2.3% for the quarter, up from the 1.5% acceleration in Q1. Both services and goods spending saw solid increases for the quarter.
On the downside, imports, which subtract from GDP, jumped 6.9%, the biggest quarterly rise since Q1 of 2022.
Stock market futures drifted higher following the report while Treasury yields moved lower.
There was some good news on the inflation front: the personal consumption expenditures price index, a key measure for the Federal Reserve, increased 2.6% for the quarter, down from the 3.4% move in Q1. Excluding food and energy, core PCE prices, which the Fed focuses on even more as a longer-term inflation indicator, was up 2.9%, down from 3.7% in the prior period.
The so-called chain-weighted price index, which takes into account changes in consumer behavior, increased 2.3% for the quarter, below the 2.6% estimate.
One other key variable, final sales to private domestic purchasers, which the Fed considers a good indicator of underlying demand, accelerated at a 2.6% pace, the same as in the prior quarter.
However, the report also indicated that the personal savings rate continues to decelerate, at 3.5% for the quarter, compared to 3.8% in Q1.
There have been signs of cracks lately in the consumer picture.
A report Wednesday from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed credit card balances at an all-time high for data going back to 2012. Revolving debt balances also reached a new high even as banks reported tightening credit standards and declining new card originations.
However, retail sales numbers have continued to climb indicating that consumers are weathering the headwinds of high interest rates and persistent inflation.
There also is pressure in the housing market: Sales are declining while home prices continue to climb, putting pressure on first-time homebuyers.
Federal Reserve officials are expected to hold interest rates steady when they meet next week, though market pricing is pointing to the first cut in four years in September. Policymakers have been circumspect about when they might start reducing rates, though recent comments indicate more of a willingness to start easing policy and most central bankers have said they see further increases as unlikely.Jeff Cox is a finance editor with CNBC.com where he covers all aspects of the markets and monitors coverage of the financial markets and Wall Street.

0,WaPo_40,"U.S. economy grew 2.8% in second quarter, a robust unexpected strengthening",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/25/gdp-q2-economy/,"The U.S. economy grew at a surprisingly robust 2.8 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, capping two years of solid expansion, despite some signs of softening.Gross domestic product for the quarter ending in June was double the 1.4 percent reading in the previous quarter, but reflects a general cool-down from last year’s brisk pace, according to Commerce Department data released Thursday morning.“Economic growth is solid, not too hot and not too cold,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at Fwdbonds, a financial research firm. “The soft patch we had at the beginning of the year has gone away and with it, the risks of a recession are dying on the vine.” Consumer spending and business investments drove almost all of the second quarter’s growth. Continued government spending at the federal, state and local levels also helped prop up the GDP reading, which sums up goods and services produced in the United States.However, a slowdown in home construction and other residential investments, and an increase in imports, dragged down economic growth — a turnaround after three straight quarters of solid growth.“GDP came in significantly stronger than anticipated,” Matt Peron, global head of solutions at Janus Henderson Investors, wrote in a note to clients. But, he added, “The economy does seem to be downshifting and that may cause continued volatility in the coming months.”Consumer spending, which slowed earlier in the year in part as cold winter temperatures kept shoppers at home, came roaring back in the second quarter. Americans spent heartily on goods such as cars, recreational vehicles and furniture. But economists say those spending jumps aren’t likely to be sustainable — income growth has weakened, pandemic-era savings have run out, and more people are falling behind on loan payments. The rapid post-pandemic recovery has recently lost steam, as high borrowing costs force households and businesses to rethink spending. Home sales have stalled, manufacturing is slowing and factories are seeing a drop-off in demand for U.S.-made goods. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate — at 4.1 percent as of June — has edged up for three straight months.Still, economists say a gradual cool-down is a welcome reprieve from years of too-hot growth that stoked inflation. The labor market remains strong and consumers are still spending, albeit with less gusto than they were a year ago.The surprisingly upbeat GDP report adds new uncertainty to whether the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates in September, as previously expected. The central bank has kept borrowing costs at a two-decade high since last summer to temper inflation. In congressional testimony this month, Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said the United States is “no longer an overheated economy,” thanks in large part to a moderating labor market. “Conditions have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic: strong, but not overheated,” he added.Although much of the economy is humming along, some pockets, such as housing and construction, have retreated more dramatically. Sales of new homes are down 7.4 percent from a year ago, while existing-home sales have fallen by 5.4 percent, according to fresh data this week.In Seattle, new business at home-remodeling firm Gasper’s Construction has dropped 30 percent in the past year. Clients, who tend to rely on home-equity lines of credit, have pulled back in response to higher interest rates.“Remodel projects are smaller and people are not willing to extend themselves as much,” owner Sarah Henry said.Even so, Henry is optimistic. She’s looking to add three more people to her staff of 57, and says the Seattle housing market has been surprisingly resilient. Plus, the Fed appears poised to ease monetary policy in the coming months.“Interest rates are going to give and, at some point, they’re going to come down,” she said. “That is very much going to help us.”"

Harris will visit Atlanta, Georgia next week, a source familiar with her travel plans told NBC News.
The Harris campaign views the battleground state as in better play with her at the top of the ticket as they hope to mobilize Southern Black voters.
Days before Biden announced his withdrawal from the race, one Democratic strategist last week said Harris’ “path is different” compared to Biden’s election strategy, NBC News reported.
The strategist said some believe Harris’ path could be more focused on mobilizing Black voters in Southern states such as Georgia and North Carolina compared to Biden’s strategy, which largely worked to lock down support in key Midwest swing states such as Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan.

During an interview on “Fox & Friends” this morning, Trump, without evidence, suggested there was a Democrat-led “coup” that ultimately forced Biden to withdraw from the race.
“Well, I think it was a coup. They didn’t want him running,” Trump said. “He was way down in the polls, and they thought he was going to lose. They went to him and they said, ‘You can’t win the race,’ which I think is true.”
Trump claimed that he has “very good information” from people “on the other side” that Democrats were “trying to do a coup.”
“You know, I have it from very good information. I know a lot of people on the other side, too, that they went and they forced him out, between Pelosi and Obama and some others that you see on television,” he said. “It’s interesting. I watched them on television, and they act so nice. ‘Oh yes, we love Joe. We love Joe.’ Behind the scenes, I know for a fact they were brutal.”
Biden had faced mounting calls from Democrats to step aside after his dismal debate performance last month. NBC News reported that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had quietly pushed efforts to nudge Biden out of the race after his poor debate performance. But Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who had joined calls for Biden to step aside, on Sunday denied that there was coordinated effort by Democrats to pressure Biden to leave the race.
Later in the interview, Trump again accused Democrats of election interference amid the legal battles he faces, saying “every single court case that I have is pushed on by them.”
“Just so you know, they push all these cases on me. They’re the ones that start it. And then they say, ‘I’m a prosecutor, he’s a criminal,’” he said. “They’re the ones. Every case is started by them, and I’m winning the cases.”
Trump was charged in a criminal case related to his efforts to halt the peaceful transfer of power in the days leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack amid his baseless claims of a stolen 2020 election. But the case has been delayed as a result of the Supreme Court’s decision this month that said Trump has  immunity for some of his conduct as president in his federal election case.

The House voted without opposition Wednesday for a resolution to establish a bipartisan task force to investigate the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump.
The task force will investigate federal, state and local law enforcement and agency actions in the lead-up to the attempt on Trump’s life on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania. Four hundred-sixteen members voted in favor of the resolution, and 16 members did not vote.
Seven Republicans and six Democrats will serve on the committee, House party leaders said in a statement.
The resolution text said the task force must issue a final report to the House by Dec. 13, noting that it should include “any recommendations for legislative reforms necessary to prevent future security lapses.”
In a statement after the vote, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said that “protecting the safety and security of our nation’s leaders is a responsibility that transcends party lines.”
Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., announced their intention Tuesday to create the task force, which will have subpoena authority.

Former President Barack Obama and Vice President Kamala Harris have been in close touch since she announced her presidential candidacy Sunday, having multiple conversations this week as she kicks off her campaign, according to four people familiar with their discussions.
Obama privately has fully supported Harris’ candidacy and plans to endorse her soon, these people said.
“He has been in regular contact with her and thinks she’s been off to a great start,” one of them said.
Obama is one of the only high-profile Democrats in the country who is yet to endorse Harris. While other party leaders have stepped forward to publicly back her, he has so far kept his support private.
The people familiar with the discussions didn’t know the precise timing of his endorsement. One of them said Obama didn’t want it to overshadow Biden’s moment, particularly his Oval Office address to the nation last night.
Another person familiar with the discussions said Obama and Harris, who is seeking to maintain the momentum her campaign has enjoyed among Democrats since she entered the race, wanted his endorsement to stand as its own moment.

The Harris campaign released its first official video, titled “We Choose Freedom,” which focuses on Americans’ rights and freedoms as the core issue at stake in the November election.
In the ad, which features Beyonce’s song “Freedom,” Harris paints Trump and his allies as people who “think we should be a country of chaos, of fear, of hate” and urges Americans to join her in choosing “something different.”
“The freedom not just to get by, but get ahead. The freedom to be safe from gun violence. The freedom to make decisions about your own body,” Harris says in the ad. “We choose a future where no child lives in poverty. Where we all can afford health care, where no one is above the law.”
“We believe in the promise of America and we are ready to fight for it,” she adds. “Because when we fight, we win. So join us.”

Trump, speaking at his first campaign rally since Biden ended his re-election bid, redirected a torrent of attacks yesterday at Harris, the de facto Democratic nominee.
“As you know, three days ago, we officially defeated the worst president in the history of our country, Joe Biden,” Trump told his crowd in Charlotte, North Carolina. “So now we have a new victim to defeat: lyin’ Kamala Harris … the most incompetent and far-left vice president in American history.”

Harris has looked at the vetting process from both sides now. But she doesn’t have much time to spare.
It was only Sunday that Biden abandoned his campaign and effectively handed it to her, leaving two weeks for Democrats to nominate her and a running mate if they hope to beat an Aug. 7 deadline to ensure their ticket appears on ballots in every state. Modern candidates usually have months to decide, as Biden did when he dragged his feet in picking her in 2020 and as Trump did holding a virtual public pageant this year before he put Sen. JD Vance of Ohio on his ticket.

Another person familiar with the discussions said Obama and Harris, who is seeking to maintain the momentum her campaign has enjoyed among Democrats since she entered the race, wanted his endorsement to stand as its own moment.
Aides to Obama and Harris also have discussed arranging for the two of them to appear together on the campaign trail, though no date has been set, three of the people familiar with the discussions said. 
Michelle Obama also supports Harris’ candidacy, two people familiar with the matter said.
""President Obama looks forward to helping Democrats up and down the ballot make the case to voters this fall,"" said Eric Schultz, a senior adviser to Obama. ""Our strategy will be based on driving impact, especially where and when his voice can move the needle.""
During their conversations in recent days, Obama has offered Harris his counsel on setting up a campaign and on other aspects of mounting a successful bid for the White House, which he has done twice, the people familiar with their discussions said.
From Obama’s perspective, Harris has taken on a lot in a very short time, and he sees himself as a resource and a sounding board for her as she navigates a high-stakes campaign with about just 100 days until Election Day, according to two of the people familiar with their discussions. 
Obama views his utility in the campaign as helping unify his party and moving Democrats forward, and he's expected to be a fixture on the campaign trail this fall.
The only publicly known phone call between Obama and Harris took place Sunday, when Biden announced he was ending his re-election campaign and swiftly endorsed Harris.
Obama issued a statement Sunday praising Biden and supporting a process to select a new Democratic nominee, but he didn't endorse Harris.
""We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead,"" Obama said in the statement. ""But I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges.""
Harris then quickly received endorsements from across the country, and no one has stepped up to challenge her for the nomination.
Since Biden’s June 27 debate performance, Obama had privately expressed concerns about his former vice president’s ability to defeat former President Donald Trump in November, NBC News has reported. He didn't publicly or privately urge Biden to remain in the race, though he defended his debate performance by writing on X that he understood what it was like to have a poor presidential debate.
Obama and Harris have known each other for years. She was an early supporter of his 2008 campaign and was given a speaking role at his 2012 nominating convention. Obama campaigned for Harris when she was running for attorney general in California and supported her when she ran for the Senate in 2016.Carol E. Lee is the Washington managing editor.

            Former President Barack Obama is expected to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris soon and his team has been in touch with the campaign, a source told CNN.
    

            Obama and Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, have been in touch regularly, and he is serving as a sounding board for her as he has over the 20 years they’ve known each other, the source said.
    

            Obama, who didn’t immediately endorse Harris following President Joe Biden’s announcement on Sunday that he was not seeking reelection, believed it was important for the Democratic Party to have a legitimate process through which delegates select their new nominee, and he thinks Harris is off to an impressive start, the source said.
    

            News of Obama’s expected endorsement was first reported by NBC News.
    

            Regarding Obama’s statement on Sunday, an adviser told CNN that the former president was taking the same approach as he did in the 2020 Democratic primary, watching closely with the intent of being able to unify the party when a nominee is chosen – whether it was Harris or someone else.
    

            Obama’s statement was intended to keep the focus on Biden on the day he announced he was no longer seeking a second term, the adviser said.
    

            The former president was supportive of Biden’s reelection campaign as he attended multiple fundraisers that raised millions of dollars, along with participating in moderated conversations with Biden and sending messages encouraging supporters to chip in as part of fundraising efforts.
    

            Democrats have been moving quickly in the process to nominate Harris as the party adopted the rules on Wednesday that they will use to choose their presidential nominee, with voting to officially nominate Harris likely to begin on August 1.
    

            The rules call for ceremonial votes for president and vice president, as well as a vote on the party platform, during the Democratic convention, which is scheduled to take place in Chicago from August 19-22. While the ceremonial presidential vote will be conducted as a roll call, the vote for vice president is likely to be a voice vote. Harris has not yet selected a running mate.

12,CNN_11,House votes to set up bipartisan task force to investigate Trump assassination attempt,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/house-vote-bipartisan-task-force-assassination-attempt/index.html,"
            The House voted on Wednesday to create a bipartisan task force to investigate the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump.
    

            The move comes as lawmakers seek answers and accountability after the 2024 Republican presidential candidate was shot at during a rally in Pennsylvania this month. A resolution to establish the task force was approved in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 416 to 0.
    

            The House task force will be made up of seven Republicans and six Democrats and will have subpoena authority, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries announced this week.
    

            Johnson told CNN on Wednesday that the appointments to the task force will be announced on Thursday. Jeffries’ nominations to the task force will be handled “after consultation” with Johnson.
    

            The work of the task force will be done “quickly, efficiently, effectively, and that’s what the American people demanded,” Johnson said Wednesday.
    

            It will issue a final report on its findings no later than December 13, 2024, “including any recommendations for legislative reforms necessary to prevent future security lapses,” according to the text of the resolution the House passed.
    

            Congress has moved swiftly to investigate the security failures that led to the shooting on July 13. After mounting pressure and calls from lawmakers to step down, US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned this week.
    

            On Monday, Cheatle was grilled at length by the House Oversight Committee over security failures related to the assassination attempt. On Tuesday, a Pennsylvania state police commissioner offered striking testimony about the security failures that led to the near assassination of Trump. And on Wednesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified that Trump’s would-be assassin searched for details of the John F. Kennedy shooting from his laptop and flew a drone in the area near the rally just two hours before the former president took the stage.
    

            The task force “will move quickly to find the facts, ensure accountability, and make certain such failures never happen again,” Johnson and Jeffries said in a joint statement earlier this week.
    

            According to the resolution establishing the task force, it will “investigate and fully examine all actions by any agency, department, officer, or employee of the federal government, as well as state and local law enforcement or any other State or local government or private entities or individuals, related to the attempted assassination of Donald J. Trump on July 13, 2024 in Butler, Pennsylvania.”
    

            The task force will also be empowered to issue interim reports “it deems necessary.” In addition to having subpoena power, the task force can take depositions, according to the resolution.

15,NBC_16,Yellowstone closes Biscuit Basin for the season after hydrothermal explosion,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/yellowstone-closes-biscuit-basin-season-hydrothermal-explosion-rcna163564,"An area of Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming where a hydrothermal explosion launched steam and debris into the air Tuesday will be closed for the rest of the season because more blasts may occur, officials said.
No one was hurt in the blast at around 10 a.m. Tuesday in Biscuit Basin, 2 miles northwest of Old Faithful. Video showed some visitors running after the explosion.
The hydrothermal explosion was caused by “water suddenly transitioning to steam in the shallow hydrothermal system beneath Black Diamond Pool,” the U.S. Geological Survey said.
“Given the recent changes to the hydrothermal plumbing system, small explosions of boiling water from this area in Biscuit Basin continue to be possible over the coming days to months,” the USGS said in a statement.
Biscuit Basin will be closed for the rest of the 2024 season as a result, the park said. The Grand Loop Road remains open to vehicles and other thermal basins in the area are also open.
The geyser was hundreds of feet high, and rocks the size of grapefruit were found as far as hundreds of feet away, officials said. A boardwalk was also destroyed. 
""Some blocks closest to the explosion site are about 3 feet (1 meter) wide and weigh hundreds of pounds,"" the USGS statement said.
Hydrothermal explosions are relatively common on Yellowstone National Park, which is known for its hot springs and other thermal features, officials said.
Hydrothermal explosions happen in the park a few times a year, the USGS said, although often they happen in remote backcountry areas.Phil Helsel is a reporter for NBC News."
15,CNN_53,Yellowstone’s popular Biscuit Basin is closed for the summer after hydrothermal explosion,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/travel/yellowstone-biscuit-basin-explosion/index.html,"
            Yellowstone National Park’s Biscuit Basin will remain closed for the remainder of the 2024 season following a hydrothermal explosion Tuesday morning that launched debris hundreds of feet in the air and damaged the surrounding area, officials with the National Park Service and the US Geological Survey said in a statement Wednesday.
    

            Biscuit Basin – located about 2 miles northwest of the famed Old Faithful geyser in Wyoming – was shuttered for the rest of the summer out of concern for visitor safety, according to park officials.
    

            The officials said the explosion, near the Sapphire Pool around 10 a.m. local time Tuesday, destroyed the walkway that surrounds the basin.
    

            “The explosion, which sent steam and debris to a height of hundreds of feet above the ground, destroyed a nearby boardwalk and ejected grapefruit-sized rocks tens to hundreds of feet from the source,” the USGS said in a Wednesday news release. “Some blocks closest to the explosion site are about 3 feet (1 meter) wide and weigh hundreds of pounds.”
    

            No injuries were reported after the incident, officials said.
    

            The explosion altered the shape of the park’s famous Black Diamond Pool, officials noted. The Black Opal Pool was also affected.
    

            “Both pools are murky due to debris, and the unstable ground around their edges occasionally slides into the water,” the release said. “Given the recent changes to the hydrothermal plumbing system, small explosions of boiling water from this area in Biscuit Basin continue to be possible over the coming days to months.”
    

            Geologists with the USGS and the National Park Service continue to monitor conditions at Biscuit Basin – mapping the debris field, and sampling water to assess any changes in the shallow hydrothermal plumbing system.
    

            Officials say Grand Loop Road, which surrounds Biscuit Basin and other notable sites in the park, remains open to vehicles. Other nearby thermal basins, like Black Sand Basin, are open as well, the release said.

Hydrothermal explosion leads to closure of parts of Yellowstone National Park


            A handful of hydrothermal explosions occur in the park each year, according to the USGS, however those typically occur in more remote areas.
    

            “Hydrothermal explosions are violent and dramatic events resulting in the rapid ejection of boiling water, steam, mud, and rock fragments,” according to the USGS.
    

            They “occur where shallow interconnected reservoirs of fluids with temperatures at or near the boiling point underlie thermal fields. These fluids can rapidly transition to steam if the pressure suddenly drops. Since vapor molecules take up much more space than liquid molecules, the transition to steam results in significant expansion and blows apart surrounding rocks and ejects debris,” the agency said.
    

            Biscuit Basin and other popular geysers have experienced similar explosions in the past, officials said.
    

            “Although smaller, hydrothermal explosions took place in 1989 at Porkchop Geyser in Norris Geyser Basin, and on April 15, 2024, from the Porcelain Terrace Area of Norris Geyser Basin,” the USGS said.
    

            Additionally, a small hydrothermal explosion occurred from Wall Pool, in Biscuit Basin, in 2009, according to officials.
    

            Large hydrothermal explosions occur on an average of every 700 years, the USGS said.
    

            Tuesday’s explosion does not indicate a volcanic eruption is imminent, the USGS said in an earlier release. “Monitoring data show no changes in the Yellowstone region. Today’s explosion does not reflect activity within (the) volcanic system, which remains at normal background levels of activity. Hydrothermal explosions like that of today are not a sign of impending volcanic eruptions, and they are not caused by magma rising towards the surface.”
    

            “Although large hydrothermal explosions are rare events on a human time scale, the potential for additional future events of the sort in Yellowstone National Park is not insignificant. Based on the occurrence of large hydrothermal explosion events over the past 16,000 years, an explosion large enough to create a 100-(meter)- (328-ft-) wide crater might be expected every few hundred years,” the USGS added.

16,NBC_17,Trump turns his focus to Harris at his first rally after Biden's exit from the 2024 race,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-turns-focus-harris-first-rally-bidens-exit-2024-race-rcna163496,"Donald Trump, speaking at his first campaign rally since President Joe Biden ended his re-election bid, redirected a torrent of attacks Wednesday at the de facto Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.
“As you know, three days ago, we officially defeated the worst president in the history of our country, Joe Biden,” Trump told his crowd in Charlotte, North Carolina. “So now we have a new victim to defeat: lyin’ Kamala Harris … the most incompetent and far-left vice president in American history.”
Trump acknowledged at the top of his 90-minute speech that he was leaving behind the sunnier persona and themes of unity that he and other Republicans had suggested they would stick to after he survived an assassination attempt July 13. He repeatedly mispronounced Harris’ first name and at one point, using the catchphrase from his old NBC reality show “The Apprentice,” declared: “Kamala, you’re fired!”
“You know, I was supposed to be nice,” he said. “They say something happened to me when I got shot; I became nice. And when you’re dealing with these people, they’re very dangerous people — when you’re dealing with them, you can’t be too nice. You really can’t be. So if you don’t mind, I’m not going to be nice.”
The audience did not mind, cheering loudly, and for the next hour-plus, Trump was unsparing in his criticism of Harris’ long career in public service. 
Trump mocked Harris for failing the bar exam on her first try. He targeted her work as San Francisco’s district attorney, arguing that she made the city worse, even though the good old days he recalled there came during Harris’ tenure, from 2004 to 2011.
“San Francisco, 20 years ago, was the greatest city in our country,” Trump said. “Today, it’s not a livable city.”
In a statement, Harris campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said: “Unity is over for Donald Trump — he is back with an unhinged, weird, and rambling speech complete with praise for the ‘late great’ Hannibal Lecter.”
Trump ran down a list of the progressive policy proposals, such as expanded health care coverage, that Harris advocated for as a senator from California and in her last presidential campaign, which ended before the 2020 primaries began. He placed her to the political left of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the democratic socialist who also ran for president that year.
“So if you want socialist health care, nation-wrecking inflation, the death of American energy and a lying radical left liberal San Francisco extremist as your commander in chief, then Kamala Harris is your candidate,” Trump said. “She’s the one for you.”
Trump also advanced a central GOP accusation against Harris — that she failed as a “border czar” after Biden tasked her with leading the administration’s efforts to address causes of migration from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Because of the assignment, Republicans have tied Harris to illegal border crossings. 
“No person who deliberately lets these kinds of savage criminals into America should ever be trusted with power again, should ever be trusted to be the president of our country,” Trump said. 
At one point, Trump invited Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, a labor union representing U.S. Border Patrol agents, to speak. Judd criticized Harris, saying she “refused to implement” policies that he recommended.
“This is the man for the presidency,” Judd said of Trump. 
Trump, forced to tailor his campaign strategy to a new opponent, rarely mentioned Biden. He argued that Democrats had staged an affront to democracy by dumping Biden after the primaries were over because they were worried about his poll numbers. Trump, who faces criminal charges in two jurisdictions over allegations he illegally tried to overturn the 2020 election results, also accused Harris of knowing more about Biden’s health than she let on publicly.
“Now, if we start beating her in the polls by 10 or 15 points, are they going to bring in a third candidate?” Trump wondered. “It’s like, you know, ‘Trump is killing this guy, all right, out! Let’s bring in a new one.’” 
Trump also wrestled with what has become Harris’ central pitch: that the campaign is now between a prosecutor and someone who was found guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.
“Their campaign says, ‘I’m the prosecutor and he is the convicted felon.’ That’s their campaign,” Trump said. “I don’t think people are going to buy it.”Henry J. Gomez is a senior national political reporter for NBC News"
16,FOX_30,Harris edging Trump in new poll conducted after Biden's withdrawal,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-edging-trump-new-poll-conducted-after-bidens-withdrawal,"Ahead of the 2020 general election, then-vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris was grilled by CBS News for being the ""most liberal senator"" in the U.S. at the time.
Vice President Kamala Harris is edging former President Donald Trump in a hypothetical general election match-up, according to a new poll conducted after President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race.
The New York Times/Siena College released a new survey that found that Trump leads Harris by only one percentage point among likely voters, 48% to 47%. Among registered voters, Trump led Harris by two percentage points. 
The new results reveal a tightening of the race since Democrats changed their nominee when compared to a New York Times poll in July that found Trump was leading Biden by 6 points.

16,CNN_12,Trump slams Harris as an ‘ultra-liberal’ as he returns to the campaign trail under a reshaped political landscape,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/donald-trump-rally-north-carolina/index.html,"
Donald Trump stepped onto the campaign trail Wednesday to an entirely new race and a political landscape once again irrevocably altered by an unprecedented election year.
    

            The former president’s rally here was﻿ his first since President Joe Biden abruptly ended his reelection bid Sunday, setting off a chain of events that appears destined to end with Trump facing Vice President Kamala Harris in November.
    

            Trump lost no time Wednesday turning his focus to his likely new opponent, dubbing her “Lyin’ Kamala Harris” and painting her as a “radical liberal” whom voters will reject in November.
    

            “Kamala Harris has been the ultra-liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe,” the former president told his supporters.
    

            Biden’s decision to end his campaign and Harris’ subsequent elevation has sent a surge of adrenaline through the Democratic Party and unleashed a wave of new donations to compete with Trump’s own strengthened financial position. Meanwhile, Trump and his campaign are working to reimagine a playbook and operation launched to take on an unpopular 81-year-old incumbent.
    

            Trump told the audience in Charlotte that he “was supposed to be nice,” alluding to his message of unity after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania the weekend before the Republican National Convention.
    

            “They say something happened to me when I got shot: I became nice,” Trump said. “If you don’t mind, I’m not going to be nice,” he added to roars from the crowd.
    

            “This November, the American people are going to tell her, ‘No thanks, Kamala. You’ve done a terrible job. You’ve been terrible at everything,’” said the former president, who slammed Harris over the border and inflation.
    

            Trump also mocked Harris’ attempts to portray the race against the former president as one between a former prosecutor – Harris is a former San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general – and a convicted felon.
    

            “Their campaign says, ‘I’m the prosecutor, and he is the convicted felon.’ That’s that campaign. I don’t think people are going to buy it. And we won our big case. You know, we won the case in Florida,” Trump said, referring to the recently dismissed classified documents case.
    

            “A vote for Kamala is a vote for four more years of dishonesty and incompetence, weakness and failure,” he added.
    

            In a campaign already marked by extraordinary events – a significant civil judgment against Trump, a felony conviction, an indictment dismissed and another delayed by a scandal in the Georgia prosecutor’s office, Biden’s confidence-shattering debate performance and the assassination attempt – the latest twist has plunged the presidential race deeper into uncharted territory.
    

            Trump spent Tuesday reacting to his changed political fortunes. In a barrage of social media posts, the former president ripped into his likely new opponent, lamented that Republicans were forced “to waste a great deal of time and money” prior to the Democratic shake-up, suggested that the “Biden/Harris administration” was to blame for the assassination attempt on his life, criticized Democratic tributes to Biden (“He was pushed out of power like a dog,” the former president wrote) and ripped Fox News for giving airtime to the Democratic governor of Minnesota, a state Trump is targeting.

            “They make me fight battles that I shouldn’t have to fight!” Trump said of the network.
    

            Later, Trump held a call with reporters – the first of its kind this cycle – during which he tested new attack lines against Harris.
    

            “As a result of her dangerously extreme immigration policies, the largest invasion in history is now taking place at our southern border, and it’s getting worse, not better,” said Trump, who has spent the past 19 months attacking Biden over the border while rarely mentioning Harris.
    

            The Democratic National Committee responded to the stepped-up attacks on Harris over immigration by highlighting Trump’s successful effort to kill a bipartisan immigration deal earlier this year.
    

            Trump’s team insists it was prepared for a change at the top of the Democratic ticket long before Biden officially dropped out, pointing to an internal memo from May laying out scenarios that would result in an open convention and another Democrat as the nominee.
    

            Senior Trump advisers continue to suggest that a campaign against Harris would largely center on the same issues once used to criticize Biden: crime, immigration and inflation. As Biden’s second in command, Harris played a key role in shaping the administration’s approaches to those topics, they will argue.
    

            However, some individuals close to Trump acknowledge the uncertainty brought on by Harris’ candidacy, specifically what new Democratic enthusiasm could mean for turnout in November. A new CNN/SSRS poll released Wednesday found no clear leader in a Trump-Harris matchup: The former president held 49% support among registered voters nationwide to Harris’ 46%, a finding within the poll’s margin of sampling error. Still, that was a closer contest than earlier CNN polling had found about a Biden-Trump matchup.
    

            Trump’s campaign had been bracing for the fresh excitement over Harris to generate a bump for her in the polls, as it laid out in an expectation-setting memo Tuesday from Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio. He predicted that Harris would start “gaining on or even leading President Trump” in the polls, though he also insisted that the “honeymoon” period would end.
    

            Trump’s team faces a race against the clock to define Harris before she can fully turn the Biden election machine into her own campaign. Though polls suggest Harris is a recognizable figure, the Trump campaign remains convinced that the public doesn’t know much about her – referring to the gap as “name education.” The campaign intends to spend the coming weeks trying to fill that knowledge void with as much negative information about Harris as it can.
    

            Fabrizio in his memo previewed what the Trump campaign is expected to attack: Harris’ record in California as a prosecutor and state attorney general; her tie-breaking vote as vice president on the Inflation Reduction Act, a law Biden championed to boost investments to reverse climate change; and her response to the rise in migrant border crossings.

            A source close to Trump also indicated that the campaign and its allies are planning to specifically highlight certain choices she made as San Francisco district attorney in an attempt to portray her as lenient on violent criminals.
    

            “So, while the public polls may change in the short run and she may consolidate a bit more of the Democrat base, Harris can’t change who she is or what she’ done,” Fabrizio wrote.
    

            The leading pro-Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., launched a new 30-second spot Sunday, first shared on social media, showcasing another plan of attack. The ad says Harris “covered up Joe Biden’s obvious mental decline” and features a clip of her praising Biden’s performance as president. “Our president is in good shape, in good health, tireless, vibrant, and I have no doubt about the strength of the work that we have done,” Harris says in the clip.
    

            The group, which has already spent $77 million on ads boosting Trump so far, announced plans to air the ad in the key battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania.
    

            Trump’s appearance in Charlotte provided his first opportunity to contrast himself with Harris before voters in a battleground state. Four years ago, North Carolina produced Trump’s narrowest margin of statewide victory, and it is expected to be a top battleground again in 2024.
    

            In a memo released Wednesday, the Harris campaign outlined its view of the candidate’s electoral path to victory, painting a much more optimistic picture beyond the so-called Blue Wall states to include the battleground states of the Sun Belt such as Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina. It’s a notable change from where things stood just weeks ago when a Biden campaign memo acknowledged that those Sun Belt states were no longer as competitive.

“Melania” will be released by Skyhorse Publishing, which has published such Donald Trump supporters as former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and attorney Alan Dershowitz. Skyhorse also has worked with third-party candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and former Trump insider Michael Cohen, who later became one of his harshest critics. Some Skyhorse books include forewords by Trump ally Steve Bannon.
Melania Trump’s memoir was announced Thursday by her office, which neither provided a specific release date nor mentioned whether it would come out before Election Day in November. Trump has been the subject of other books, including one by former adviser Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, but she has never told her own story at length before.
The former first lady “invites readers into her world, offering an intimate portrait of a woman who has lived an extraordinary life,” the announcement reads in part. “‘Melania’ includes personal stories and family photos she has never before shared with the public.”
A spokesperson said no information was available beyond what was included in the release, which made no reference to financial terms, promotional plans or if she worked with a co-author.
Melania Trump, Donald Trump’s third wife, has been an enigmatic figure since her husband announced he was running in the 2016 election. She has sought to maintain her privacy even as she served as first lady, focusing on raising their son, Barron, and promoting her “Be Best” initiative to support the “social, emotional, and physical health of children.” While she appeared at her husband’s campaign launch event for 2024 and attended the closing night of last week’s Republican National Convention, she has otherwise stayed off the campaign trail. Her decision not to deliver a speech at this year’s convention marked a departure from tradition for candidates’ wives, and from the 2016 and 2020 Republican gatherings.
According to her office, the memoir will come in two versions: a $150 “Collector’s Edition,” 256 pages, “in full color throughout, with each copy signed by the author,” and a “Memoir Edition,” 304 pages, including 48 pages of never-before-seen photographs. The book is listed at $40, with signed editions going for $75.
Both editions are available for pre-order exclusively through the first lady’s web site, MelaniaTrump.com. A spokesperson did not have any immediate comment on when or whether it could be ordered elsewhere.
Unlike other former presidents and first ladies, Donald and Melania Trump have not released any post-White House books through mainstream New York publishers. Donald Trump published numerous books before his presidency, working with Random House and Simon & Schuster among others, but many shunned him after the siege of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
He has released two books since leaving Washington, a picture book commemorating his time at the White House and a compilation of letters from world leaders and celebrities. Both came out through Winning Team Publishing, co-founded in 2021 by Donald Trump Jr. and former Trump campaign staffer Sergio Gor.The Associated Press"

""Let us not forget that differing opinions, policy, and political games are inferior to love. Our personal, structural, and life commitment - until death - is at serious risk.

Dawn is here again. Let us reunite. Now. This morning, ascend above the hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence. We all want a world where respect is paramount, family is first, and love transcends. We can realize this world again. Each of us must demand to get it back. We must insist that respect fills the cornerstone of our relationships again. I am thinking of you, my fellow Americans.""

23,NBC_24,Biden and Harris to meet separately with Netanyahu at the White House,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-harris-meet-separately-netanyahu-white-house-rcna163590,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are scheduled to meet separately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Thursday amid the 2024 election race shakeup and as the administration still pushes for a cease-fire agreement. 
Biden will host Netanyahu in the Oval Office at around 1 p.m. ET, and the two leaders are scheduled to meet with families of American hostages held hostage in Gaza around 2:30 p.m. in the White House Cabinet Room. 
This will be the first time the two will meet in person since Biden visited Israel shortly after Hamas' terrorist attack on Oct. 7. 
Harris will speak with Netanyahu around 4:30 p.m. in the vice president's ceremonial office, a meeting that is considered even more high-stakes now that she's running for president following Biden's decision to withdraw from the race. Harris missed Netanyahu's speech before a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday because of a previously scheduled event in Indianapolis. Typically, the vice president presides over joint addresses. 
A senior administration official told reporters Wednesday that Biden will discuss his ""ironclad commitment to Israel's security, the very serious threats from Iran and from Iranian proxy and terrorist groups, including Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis.""
The official said the two leaders are expected to speak ""in depth"" about developments in Gaza, including efforts to reach a cease-fire agreement and the humanitarian crisis. The administration believes that a deal ""is in the closing stages and it’s reaching a point that we believe a deal is closable, and it’s time to move to close that agreement,"" the official said. 
For her part, Harris has been engaged on the Israel-Gaza conflict for the last 10 months, the official said, including participating in every call with Netanyahu as well as critical meetings like those with hostage families. 
An aide to Harris said the vice president will continue her intensive engagement on Gaza during the meeting, underscore Israel’s need to defend itself, and condemn the Oct. 7 attack. 
Harris will convey her view that it’s time for the war to end in a way that will keep Israel secure, release all hostages, end the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, and allow the Palestinian people to enjoy their right to dignity, freedom, and self-determination, the aide said. They will also discuss efforts to reach agreement on the cease-fire deal. 
In his speech before Congress, Israel's prime minister thanked Biden ""for his tireless efforts on behalf of the hostages and for his efforts to the hostage families as well.""
""There will obviously be no daylight between the president and the vice president,"" the official said, adding they expect for a productive day because the Israelis will be at the White House for a while on Thursday. 
Netanyahu also thanked Biden for his leadership in his speech. 
""I thank President Biden for his heartfelt support for Israel after the savage attack on Oct. 7th,"" Netanyahu said. ""He rightly called Hamas 'sheer evil.' He dispatched two aircraft carriers to the Middle East to deter a wider war. And he came to Israel to stand with us during our darkest hour — a visit that will never be forgotten.""
""President Biden and I have known each other for over 40 years,"" he continued. ""I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel and for being, as he says, a proud Zionist. Actually, he says, a proud Irish American Zionist.""
Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with former President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Friday.Rebecca Shabad is a politics reporter for NBC News based in Washington.

23,WaPo_133,"Harris calls for cease-fire and hostage release, after Netanyahu meeting",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/25/netanyahu-biden-harris-hostages/,"Vice President Harris implored Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday to accept a cease-fire deal that would pause the fighting in Gaza and release hostages, as U.S. leaders say they are closer than ever to an agreement.“Let’s get the deal done so we can get a cease-fire to end the war,” she told reporters in brief remarks after her bilateral meeting with Netanyahu at the White House. “Let’s bring the hostages home, and let’s provide much-needed relief to the Palestinian people.”Harris’s decision to give her full backing for the deal and explain its general outline appeared designed to add pressure on Israel and Hamas to close the remaining gaps in reaching an agreement to at least temporarily end more than nine months of conflict.That it was the vice president, not President Biden, giving public remarks after they each held separate bilateral meetings with the Israeli leader reflected how much has changed in Washington in recent days. Biden announced Sunday he was exiting the presidential race; by Tuesday, Harris had become the likely Democratic nominee.In her remarks, Harris reiterated she remains a firm backer of Israel, reflecting on collecting funds to plant trees in Israel as a young girl, while also expressing serious concern about some of Israel’s conduct in its unrelenting military campaign in Gaza. As Harris moves forward in the presidential race, she will find herself needing to further define her positions on key issues, especially the controversial Israel-Gaza war, and where, if any, there is daylight between her and the president.Harris has not publicly diverged from Biden’s approach to the war, but she has pushed the administration to more heavily consider Palestinian suffering in its response and often been the highest-profile official to speak emphatically about civilian casualties.“Israel has a right to defend itself, and how it does so matters,” Harris said, adding she has “serious concern about the scale of human suffering in Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians,” and “images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety.”“We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering, and I will not be silent,” she said.John Kirby, a White House spokesman, said Harris has “been a full partner in our policies in the Middle East, particularly with our policies toward Israel and the war in Gaza.” He added that she has been involved in nearly every conversation between Biden and Netanyahu since the conflict began.On Thursday morning, as part of that continuing balancing act, Harris — not Biden — released a strongly worded statement about the protests near the U.S. Capitol, while Netanyahu was delivering an address to Congress, calling out “despicable acts by unpatriotic protesters and dangerous hate-fueled rhetoric.”“I condemn any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organization Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate the State of Israel and kill Jews,” she said. “Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent, and we must not tolerate it in our nation.”Before he met with Harris, the Israeli leader met with Biden, whom he has known for decades, in the Oval Office. The two leaders appeared genial at the start of their meeting, despite deep underlying tensions over the ongoing conflict and a path forward.“Well, welcome back, Mr. Prime Minister,” Biden said before the meeting. “We’ve got a lot to talk about. I think we should get to it.”Biden has repeatedly said a cease-fire deal was imminent in recent weeks, even though the United States and other negotiating partners have been frustrated for months by the lack of an agreement.The meetings, part of Netanyahu’s hours-long visit to the White House, came a day after the Israeli leader delivered a defiant speech to a joint meeting of Congress. Netanyahu rejected criticisms from international organizations about Israel’s conduct, posited without evidence that Iran was funding pro-Palestinian protesters surrounding the Capitol and vowed Israel would settle for nothing less than “total victory.”Since announcing his decision not to seek reelection, Biden has said ending the war in Gaza remains a top priority in his final months in office. “I’m going to keep working to end the war in Gaza, bring home all the hostages, and bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war,” Biden said Wednesday during his Oval Office address.Kirby told reporters Thursday that the negotiating parties are closer “than we’ve been before” to a deal, though he emphasized there are still important gaps to bridge.The first phase of an agreement would include a six-week pause in fighting and the release of some hostages. The second phase would continue a cessation of hostilities while Hamas and Israel negotiate a permanent cease-fire, determining the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.Biden’s meeting on Thursday was his first face-to-face encounter with Netanyahu since the president traveled to Israel in the days after the Oct. 7 attacks. Thursday marked only the second time Harris met with Netanyahu, a White House official said. They met once in 2017 when she was in the Senate; since the Oct. 7 attacks, she has been on more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu.The president tightly embraced Israel in the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attacks, but as Netanyahu has continued an all-out assault on Gaza, he has become more critical, calling on Israeli leaders to allow more aid into the territory, where nearly 2 million civilians are suffering from widespread starvation and a collapsed health-care system.In his brief public remarks, Netanyahu spoke warmly about Biden, though after leaving the White House, the Israeli leader will head to Mar-a-Lago to meet with former president Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president.“From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,” Netanyahu said to Biden.Despite the ongoing tensions, Kirby said Biden and Netanyahu have a “healthy relationship,” though he did not know if the president had watched Netanyahu’s speech on Wednesday.“And by healthy, I mean they’re not going to agree on everything.” Kirby said. “They haven’t, through the long political lives that both of them have enjoyed, always agreed on everything. They come from two different political traditions, but they know one another.”After their bilateral meeting in the Oval Office, the two leaders met with families of Americans held hostage by Hamas. By including the families, the White House hoped to elevate their message that Netanyahu needs to stop making new demands and agree to the hostage cease-fire deal on the table, officials familiar with the matter said.Netanyahu’s government is negotiating for the release of more than 100 Israeli hostages, though of that number, many are believed to be dead.Following their meeting with Biden and Netanyahu, the hostage families said they were now “more optimistic” than at any other time since November, when Hamas released more than 100 people in the war’s first — and only — negotiated hostage release, said Jonathan Dekel-Chen, father of American hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen.Speaking in front of cameras outside the West Wing, Jonathan Dekel-Chen said the families were given “absolute commitment from the Biden administration and from Netanyahu that they understand the urgency of this moment now to waste no time and to complete this deal as it currently stands, with as little change as humanly possible within it.”The families also emphasized the convergence between Biden, Harris and Trump in supporting an immediate deal.“We’ve got a rare moment now where the current president of the United States, and anybody who might become president of the United States — both Vice President Harris and Donald Trump — are all aligned in saying this deal must get done now,” said Jon Polin, father of American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin.Since the start of the Gaza War, Netanyahu has come under criticism for putting his military objectives related to the total destruction of Hamas ahead of the urgency of securing the release of hostages.Earlier this summer, the United States blamed Hamas for adding new demands to the deal, but that outlook shifted earlier this month when Netanyahu directed Mossad Chief David Barnea to negotiate further stipulations that moved the goal posts, said diplomats who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations.Under the new conditions, Israel would not agree to withdraw its forces from the Philadelphi Corridor along the Egyptian border, the diplomats said. Israel would also not allow unrestricted access for Gazans seeking to return to their homes in the north — insisting that its forces be permitted to establish checkpoints to monitor the movement of the displaced."
24,NBC_25,Jennifer Aniston slams JD Vance over 'childless cat ladies' comment from resurfaced interview,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jennifer-aniston-slams-jd-vance-childless-cat-ladies-comment-resurface-rcna163633,"Actor Jennifer Aniston, who has been open about her fertility struggles, slammed Sen. JD Vance over a resurfaced 2021 interview in which he said the United States was being run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies.”
“I truly can’t believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States,” Aniston wrote Wednesday in an Instagram story, including a clip of Vance’s comments.
The interview gained fresh traction this week after it was posted on X, days after former President Donald Trump announced that the Republican senator from Ohio would be his vice presidential running mate.
During a 2021 appearance on Tucker Carlson’s former Fox News show, Vance said that the country was being led “by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made.”
“So they want to make the rest of the country miserable too,” Vance continued. “And it’s just a basic fact. If you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?”
Harris, who has two stepchildren, is now running for president after President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race. Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, has adopted twins.
Vance went on to say in the clip that he believes people “who go home at night and see the face of a smiling kid, whatever their profession, I think they’re happier, I think they’re healthier, and they’re going to be better prepared to actually lead this country.” 
Aniston also called out Vance over his far-right stance on reproductive rights.
“All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,” Aniston wrote. “I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.”
The actor told Allure in 2022 that she tried to get pregnant for many years but “it was a challenging road” for her.
“I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it,” she said. “I was throwing everything at it. I would’ve given anything if someone had said to me, ‘Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.’ You just don’t think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.”
Aniston, 55, said the constant media scrutiny and false claims that she didn’t want children because she was “selfish” were hurtful.
Harris’ stepdaughter, Ella Emhoff, on Thursday also pushed back at Vance's comments from the 2021 interview.
“How can you be ‘childless’ when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I,” Emhoff wrote in a post on Instagram this morning, referring to her brother and Harris’ other stepchild, Cole Emhoff.
Emhoff also praised a statement by her biological mother, second gentleman Doug Emhoff’s ex-wife, Kerstin Emhoff, who defended Harris against “baseless attacks” and praised her for being a “loving, nurturing, fiercely protective” stepmother to her children for more than 10 years.
While Aniston did not officially back Harris, the Instagram post comes as many in Hollywood have begun publicly broadcasting their enthusiasm for the vice president’s campaign.
Josh Gad, Sheryl Lee Ralph, Barbra Streisand and Kerry Washington were among the flood of actors to voice their support. A handful of artists, including Lil Nas X and John Legend, also shared posts on social media backing Harris.
And Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, who was among the first Democratic donors to publicly urge Biden to step aside, donated $7 million to a super PAC supporting Harris’ run, The Information reported.Minyvonne Burke is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News."
24,WaPo_79,"‘Childless cat ladies,’ Jennifer Aniston, and Swifties take on JD Vance",https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2024/07/25/childless-cat-lady-jd-vance-jennifer-aniston-response/,"Three years ago, well before JD Vance was selected as Donald Trump’s running mate, he suggested in a TV interview that some Democrats including Vice President Harris are “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable.”Those 2021 comments are resurfacing on social media now that Harris is the likely Democratic nominee, sparking a fresh wave of anger from women who say it’s offensive to those struggling with fertility issues — and inaccurate that people without children “don’t really have a direct stake” in the country’s future.At the same time, many on social media are embracing and owning the “childless cat lady” label as a point of pride, with many even pointing to reported billionaire Taylor Swift as a prime example of a highly successful one — seen even on her 2023 Time “Person of the Year” cover with her fluffy ragdoll wrapped around her neck.“There’s a movement,” declared Nikki Barnes, a previous member of the Democratic National Committee from Florida, accompanied by a “Childless cat ladies for Harris 2024” image quickly amassing nearly 2 million views. On TikTok, people are snapping up “Cat ladies for Harris 2024” stickers.There’s a movement pic.twitter.com/TBSUHmsBqnThe vociferous response to the resurfaced Vance comments — which have been shared widely and amassed nearly 28 million views on an X post shared Monday — only underscores how female reproductive rights including access to abortion, birth control and in vitro fertilization will be a major drivers in the 2024 race. Gender and racial attacks like the ones she experienced as a primary candidate in the 2020 race are poised to accelerate now that she’s the likely nominee.For the record, Harris, 59, became a stepmom of two when she married Douglas Emhoff in 2014 and has been deeply involved in the lives of stepchildren Ella and Cole. And Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, whom Vance also singled out in his comments describing how “the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,” became a parent of adopted twins.Harris spokesman Ammar Moussa said that “unlike Donald Trump and JD Vance, Vice President Harris understands that every single American has a stake in this country’s future.”Vance’s campaign is pointing to a different speech from the July 2021 in which he targeted the “childless left” but added a caveat: that “there are people, of course, for biological reasons, medical reasons that can’t have children. The target of these remarks is not them.”Yet many women are reminding Vance that there are plenty of reasons they may not have children.“I truly can’t believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States,” actress Jennifer Aniston wrote Wednesday, slamming Vance in an Instagram story. “Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,” wrote the “Friends” star.“I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.” (While Trump has declared support for in vitro fertilization, Senate Republicans last month blocked consideration of a bill to protect IVF access — and the issue erupted in February when the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos are people and that a person could be liable for destroying them.)Reproductive health issues, especially conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and endometriosis can impact women’s ability to conceive and carry a pregnancy. Female fertility declines with age and lack of adequate health-care services or child support services can also be factors influencing the decision to have a child.Aniston has previously been candid about the challenges of trying to get pregnant — and has previously written about how “we don’t need to be married or mothers to be complete.”‘The View"" host Whoopi Goldberg also weighed in on the show Wednesday: “Sir, there are people who have chosen not to have children for whatever reason,” she said. “There are people who want to have children who cannot. How dare you. You never had a baby; your wife had a baby ...  you know nothing about this.”Meghan McCain, talk show host and daughter of the late GOP senator John McCain of Arizona, posted on X that “I have been trying to warn every conservative man I know — these JD comments are activating women across all sides, including my most conservative Trump supporting friends.” The remarks “have caused real pain and are just innately unchristian. This is not who we are,” she said.Buttigieg in a CNN interview, said Vance’s remarks came on the heels of their difficult journey to adoption. “He couldn’t have known that, but maybe that’s why you shouldn’t be talking about other people’s children,” Buttigieg said.Vance, in his 2021 comments, called out “childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.” Women online blasted the assumption that those who are without children are unhappy.“I had absolutely no idea I was miserable,” actor Liz Vassey, known for her role on “CSI,” wrote on X. “Thank God there was a man around to tell me.”Hey! I'm a childless cat lady and I'm only miserable when I think of what miserable men like this might do to our country and our lives.  Therefore, I will fight with all my might to keep these #MiserableMen from winning.  Thank you @JoeBiden with all my heart & let's elect… https://t.co/RDsakyC3awVance’s comments came as more Americans are choosing not to have children. A Pew Research Survey in 2021 found that the childless U.S. adults aged 18 to 49 who said they were unlikely to ever have children rose by 7 percentage points in the previous three years to 44 percent. About 56 percent said they did not want children, 19 percent stated a medical reason for not having kids, and financial reasons stopped another 17 percent from becoming a parent.As some on social media put it: Childless cat ladies vote, too — and some, even, are cultural icons. “It’s bold, for someone seeking votes, to hone in on ‘childless cat ladies’ when the leader of Childless Cat Ladies is TAYLOR SWIFT,” author Caitlin Moran posted. Swift, 34, has three cats and has described them as some of her biggest influences.Sure enough, Swifties were entering the chat in droves. One TikToker added Swift’s Time cover to the soundtrack of “Who’s Afraid of Little Old Me?”Another posted a video of Swift riding a giant rendering of her cat Olivia dressed as a unicorn, with the text: “Childless cat ladies riding to polls in November to vote for Harris.”Replying to @Life Happens Therapy & Travel #harris2024 #childlesscatladies #jdvance #democrat #catladiesoftiktok #vote #kamalaharris #kamalanomenon #taylorswift Legal fellow and Lawfare correspondent Anna Bower pointed out on X: “hell hath no fury like a certain childless cat lady who has yet to endorse a presidential candidate.”"
26,NBC_27,"Netanyahu's speech was cheered in Congress, decried by hostage families back home",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/netanyahu-speech-congress-israel-hostage-families-gaza-hamas-rcna163581,"Cheers and standing ovations greeted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress in Washington, the heart of American political power. But the barnstorming address left the father of 19-year-old soldier and Hamas hostage Liri Albag feeling heartsick.  
“When he talked for 55 minutes and didn’t talk about the deal for one second, I was very upset, embarrassed and angry,” Eli Albag told NBC News in a phone interview Thursday about what he viewed as Netanyahu's unwillingness to strike a deal with Hamas for the release of relatives being held in the Gaza Strip. 
He added that he wanted to believe that the return of Israeli hostages like Liri was a priority for the Israeli leader, but he said he hasn’t seen “the results.”
Albag, 55, is one of several family members of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza who demanded to meet with cease-fire negotiators after Israeli media and Reuters reported that an Israeli delegation had not set off for talks in Qatar on Thursday as planned. Instead it was reported that they were held back until next week.  
Netanyahu railed against Hamas and Iran in his Wednesday address, and he said Israel would not settle for anything less than “total victory” in its offensive in Gaza, which he said “could end tomorrow if Hamas surrenders, disarms and returns all the hostages.” If they didn’t, he said, “Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas’ military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home.”
Large protests greeted the speech, which came three months after Congress passed a military aid package that included $14 billion for Israel, with many demonstrators decrying the nearly 40,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza since the start of the war, according to health authorities in the enclave.
While some lawmakers, mostly Democrats, refused to attend the address amid mounting global outrage over the tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians killed and wounded, Noa Argamani, who traveled with Netanyahu to Washington, watched the address in the chamber.
Argamani became a symbol of Hamas’ Oct. 7 terror attack, which killed 1,200 and saw around 250 taken hostage, after her kidnapping was captured in a viral video. She has faced criticism from some Israeli commentators and hostage families for joining Netanyahu, some of whom have accused her of being a pawn in a political game.  Netanyahu has also been criticized for allegedly using hostages as “props” during public appearances but not advocating hard enough for their release.
“While (Netanyahu) boasts about caring about the hostages, he’s not sending the negotiation team to Qatar to seal the deal,” Udi Goren, whose cousin Tal Haimi’s body remains in Hamas’ captivity, said in a statement.  
“Why doesn’t he want more Argamanis to be back home?” he added. 
Netanyahu’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the hostage families' criticism of the prime minister's address and the government policy toward negotiations with Hamas.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the relatives of those held captive in Gaza, said the delay in sending negotiators to Qatar unfolded after hostage families had received repeated assurances from them that the delegation would be sent this week. 
“This foot-dragging is a deliberate sabotage of the chance to bring our loved ones back. It effectively undermines the negotiations and indicates a serious moral failure,” the group said in a statement Thursday morning. 
There are now 115 hostages who remain held in Gaza, including at least 41 who are believed to be dead, according to Israeli officials. Those numbers include four hostages who have been held in Gaza since 2014, with two of them among those believed to be dead. 
According to several of the American hostage families in Washington for the Netanyahu speech and meetings, they are upset that he is in the United States instead of in Israel trying to get their loved ones home. They also told NBC News on Wednesday that they are looking toward Thursday's joint meeting at the White House with President Joe Biden and Netanyahu as a chance for Biden to pressure the Israeli leader to agree to a cease-fire deal as soon as next week with no new obstacles.
Calling Netanyahu’s speech a “disgrace,” Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid also wrote on X that there had been “an hour of talking without saying a single sentence: ‘There will be a hostage deal.’”
The families spoke out after the Israeli military said Thursday that troops had retrieved the bodies of five hostages in Gaza's southern city of Khan Younis. 
Among them was kindergarten teacher Maya Goren, who died in Hamas’ captivity at age 56, according to Israeli officials. The bodies of four soldiers — Sgt. Maj. Ravid Aryeh Katz, Master Sgt. Oren Goldin, Staff Sgt. Tomer Ahimas and Sgt. Kiril Brodski — were also retrieved, the officials said.
The rescue operation took place as Israeli forces carried out an offensive in Khan Younis that saw tens of thousands of Palestinians forced to evacuate the area.Chantal Da Silva reports on world news for NBC News Digital and is based in London."

            Families of hostages held captive in Gaza condemned Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech to the United States Congress, as pressure grows on the Israeli prime minister to agree to a deal to secure their release.
    

            “The speech and applause won’t erase the one sad fact: The words ‘Deal Now!’ were absent from the prime minister’s address,” The Hostage and Missing Families Forum in Israel said in a statement.
    

            Although Netanyahu’s speech drew raucous applause inside Congress, dozens of Democrats refused to attend. Among those who snubbed the speech was former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who called it “by far the worst presentation of any foreign dignitary invited and honored with the privilege of addressing the Congress of the United States.”
    

            People gathered at the so-called Hostages Square in Tel Aviv to watch Netanyahu’s speech on Wednesday. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has become a potent political force in Israel since some 250 people were abducted by Hamas on October 7, and the square a regular site of protests demanding that the hostages be brought home.
    

            “They came to watch the broadcast of the speech and hear addresses from family members of the hostages, hoping to hear the Prime Minister utter the two crucial words: ‘There’s a deal,’” the statement from the Forum said.

            During his nearly 52-minute address, Netanyahu lashed out against critics of Israel’s war in Gaza but did not mention the status of the ceasefire negotiations, despite intense international pressure to find a deal and growing optimism that one could soon be struck.
    

            Rather than mentioning a deal, a bellicose Netanyahu told Congress: “The war in Gaza could end tomorrow if Hamas surrenders, disarms and returns all the hostages. But if they don’t, Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas’ military capabilities, end its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home.”
    

            But Netanyahu is facing growing calls to negotiate a deal to secure the hostages’ release. Noam Peri, daughter of Chaim Peri, who the Israeli government last month said died in Hamas captivity, said: “You can no longer save my father, but you must return to our shared values and restore the basic contract between us – before it’s too late.”
    

            “Sign the deal, save the hostages who are alive and fighting for their lives every moment,” she urged.
    

            Criticism from families of hostages was echoed by Yair Lapid of the opposition Labor party, who wrote on X: “Disgrace! An hour of talking without saying the one sentence: ‘There will be a kidnapping deal.’”
    

            But Netanyahu’s speech was lauded by members of his government. Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the “moving and important” speech demonstrates “the strength of alliance between the US and Israel.”
    

            Bezalel Smotrich, the hard-right finance minister and chairman of the Religious Zionist Party, said: “Our Jewish and Israeli hearts are moved and filled with pride on this important occasion.”
    

            After Netanyahu’s speech, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced it had retrieved the bodies of five hostages and brought them back to Israel. The bodies of Ravid Katz, Kiril Brodski, Tomer Ahimas, Oren Goldin and Maya Goren were found during an operation in the Khan Younis area on Wednesday, the IDF said, where it launched a fresh ground offensive this week.
    

            This means that 111 hostages remain in Gaza, including 39 believed to be dead, according to data from Netanyahu’s office. There are eight dual-American citizens believed still to be captive in Gaza, three of whom have been confirmed dead. The Biden administration has not shared information about the five who may still be alive.
    

            The recovery of the five bodies came after Israel renewed its offensive in Khan Younis. The United Nations estimates that about 150,000 people fled the area on Monday alone, after the IDF issued evacuation orders that have intensified pressure on the meager supplies of food and water, and the lack of places to seek shelter.
    

            Video published Thursday showed smoke billowing into the sky over Khan Younis, after a very large explosion which local journalists said was an Israeli airstrike. The journalists said the strike occurred in the town of Kizan Al Najar east of Khan Younis and had killed several people and injured at least 15 others. CNN has asked the IDF for comment.
    

            Despite the warm reception by lawmakers in Congress, about 80 House Democrats skipped Netanyahu’s speech, including US Vice President Kamala Harris, who instead attended a pre-scheduled trip to a sorority event in Indiana. President Joe Biden and Harris are scheduled to meet with Netanyahu at the White House Thursday.
    

            Also among the absentees was Nancy Pelosi, who later blasted Netanyahu’s speech.
    

            “Many of us who love Israel spent time today listening to Israeli citizens whose families have suffered in the wake of the October 7th Hamas terror attack and kidnappings. These families are asking for a ceasefire deal that will bring the hostages home – and we hope the Prime Minister would spend his time achieving that goal,” she said in a statement.
    

            Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the lone Palestinian-American congresswoman, held up a black-and-white sign during Netanyahu’s speech. One side said, “War criminal;” the other, “Guilty of genocide.”
    

            A number of House Democrats and Republicans criticized Tlaib’s demonstration. Democratic Rep. Steny Hoyer said the sign was “unfortunate” and not appropriate.
    

            While most of the chamber rose to applaud Netanyahu as he entered, Tlaib was among three Democrats who remained seated. Sen. Chuck Schumer stood to welcome Netanyahu, did not not applaud. Sen. Mark Kelly, a potential pick for Vice President in November, did applaud the Israeli leader.
    

            With so many Democrats skipping the speech, a number of Republicans sat on the Democratic side of the aisle.

31,NBC_32,Uvalde school police officer pleads not guilty to charges from response to 2022 shooting,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/uvalde-school-police-officer-pleads-not-guilty-charges-stemming-action-rcna163642,"UVALDE, Texas — A former Uvalde, Texas, school police officer who was part of the slow law enforcement response to the 2022 mass shooting at Robb Elementary School pleaded not guilty during a court appearance Thursday.
Adrian Gonzales was one of the nearly 400 law enforcement personnel who responded to the scene but then waited more than 70 minutes to confront the shooter inside the school. Teary-eyed family members were in the courtroom in the small Texas town to watch as Gonzales was arraigned on charges of abandoning and failing to protect children who were killed and wounded.
Some of the victims’ families have spent more than two years pressing for officers to face charges after 19 children and two teachers were killed inside the fourth grade classroom. Some have called for more officers to be charged.
“For only two to be indicted, there should have been more because there was a lot of ranking officers during that day that knew what to do but decided not to. But they only got these two,” Jerry Mata, whose 10-year-old daughter Tess was killed, said after the hearing.
“We’ll take what we get and we’re just gonna continue fighting for the kids and the two teachers and see it all the way through,” Mata said.
Gonzales and former Uvalde schools police Chief Pete Arredondo were indicted by a grand jury in June. Arredondo waived his arraignment and entered a not guilty plea on July 10. Both were released on bond following their indictments.
Prior to the hearing, Gonzales’ attorney had called the charges “unprecedented in the state of Texas.”
“Mr. Gonzales’ position is he did not violate school district policy or state law,” said Nico LaHood, the former district attorney for Bexar County.
Javier Montemayor, who is listed by the Uvalde District Clerk as Arredondo’s attorney, did not reply to Wednesday phone messages seeking comment.
The May 22, 2024, attack was one of the worst school shootings in U.S. history. The police response has been heavily criticized in state and federal investigations that described “cascading failures” in training, communication and leadership among officers who waited outside the building while some victims lay dying or begging for help.
Gonzales, 51, was among the first officers to arrive. He was indicted on 29 charges that accuse him of abandoning his training and not confronting the shooter, even after hearing gunshots as he stood in a hallway.
Arredondo, 53, was the on-site commander that day. He is charged with 10 state jail felony counts of abandoning or endangering a child. Arredondo failed to identify an active shooting, did not follow his training and made decisions that slowed the police response to stop a gunman who was “hunting” victims, according to the indictment.
Terrified students inside the classroom called 911 as parents begged officers to go in. A tactical team of officers eventually went into the classroom and killed the shooter.
Each charge against Gonzales and Arredondo carries up to two years in jail if convicted.
The case is the latest, yet still rare circumstance of a U.S. law enforcement officer being charged for allegedly failing to act during an on-campus shooting. The first such case to go to trial was a sheriff’s deputy in Florida who did not confront the perpetrator of the 2018 Parkland massacre. The deputy was acquitted of felony neglect last year. A lawsuit by the victims’ families and survivors is pending.
Several families of victims have filed federal and state lawsuits against law enforcement, social media and online gaming companies and the gun manufacturer that made the rifle the gunman used.The Associated Press"
31,CNN_50,Ex-Uvalde schools police officer pleads not guilty to charges of child endangerment and abandonment in 2022 massacre,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/us/uvalde-shooting-police-officer-arraignment/index.html,"
            One of the first officers who responded to the Uvalde school massacre in Texas pleaded not guilty Thursday to more than two dozen criminal counts.
    

            Former Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District police officer Adrian Gonzales faces 29 counts of abandoning and endangering a child in connection with the May 2022 slaughter that left 19 children and two teachers dead.
    

            Gonzales was arraigned Thursday, more than two years after the deadliest school shooting in more than a decade. It took law enforcement 77 minutes after the gunman walked into Robb Elementary School to take him down. As victims lay dead or dying inside classrooms, officers were seen on video waiting outside in hallways.

            The botched response to the mass shooting has been described as an “abject failure,” with officials and experts blaming multiple entities.
    

            Gonzales and former Uvalde schools police chief Pete Arredondo are the only law enforcement officers to be indicted on criminal charges so far.
    

            According to Gonzales’ indictment, the former officer failed to “follow his active shooter training.”
    

            “After hearing gun shots and after being advised of the general location of the shooter and having time to respond to the shooter, the said Adrian Gonzales failed to engage, distract or delay the shooter, to attempt to engage, distract and delay the shooter, and failed to otherwise act in a way to impede the shooter until after the shooter entered rooms 111 and 112 of Robb Elementary School and shot at a child or children in Rooms 111 and 112,” the indictment states.
    

            Gonzales’ attorney, Nico LaHood, said his client “feels he’s innocent.”
    

            “There were over 370 officers there. We have not seen or even heard of a theory of why Mr. Gonzales is being singled out,” LaHood said Thursday after the arraignment. “We’ll get into that more when we see the discovery. But that’s going to be a long process.”

            Gonzales told investigators he was at the high school when he heard a report of a vehicle accident near Robb Elementary and went to check. He said he heard shots and entered the south hallway along with Arredondo. Gonzales said he tried to call for a SWAT team on his radio but could not transmit inside the school building – so he left.
    

            “Once I got out to get radio reception, I never went back in,” Gonzales told investigators.
    

            While the gunman roamed freely inside the school, Gonzales said he spent much of the time waiting with emergency medics outside the west door. He said he found a set of keys and a floor plan of the school that had been requested by a Texas Ranger on scene.
    

            Gonzales, who was hired by the Uvalde school district in July 2021, left the department in February 2023. No specific reason was given for his departure, according to the Uvalde News Leader.
    

            Arredondo, who was considered the de facto incident commander at the scene, faces 10 counts of child endangerment and known criminal negligence, according to his indictment.
    

            Arredondo was fired by the Uvalde school board three months after the shooting. He waived his right to an arraignment and entered a plea of not guilty last week, CNN affiliate KSAT reported.
    

            Uvalde County Jail records show both Arredondo and Gonzales were released on $10,000 bond.

31,WaPo_91,"Former Uvalde school officer pleads not guilty, faces families in court",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/25/uvalde-adrian-gonzales-charged/,"Former Uvalde school district police officer Adrian Gonzales pleaded not guilty Thursday to multiple child-endangerment charges stemming from the botched response to the Robb Elementary School shooting that killed 19 schoolchildren, two teachers and injured many others.It was the first time any law enforcement officer has faced the families of the victims in court since the 2022 massacre. Co-defendant Pedro “Pete” Arredondo, the former school district police chief, waived his appearance and was absent from court. He has also pleaded not guilty.A Uvalde County grand jury indicted Gonzales and Arredondo late last month. Prosecutors allege that both men, by their inaction and actions, were among the first to arrive at the scene but left children vulnerable to the attack by a lone shooter. The charges are unprecedented in Texas.“We are in uncharted territory,” said Gonzales’s attorney Nico LaHood, who added that he has yet to see the state’s evidence against his client. “All he did was show up to help those children.”Inside the courthouse, security was tight and those attending the hearing had their bags checked twice. A framed painting of the 21 people who were killed in the shooting hung from the wall at the north entrance, where deputies rifled through purses and passed a wand over attendees. Inside the courtroom, the families and their attorneys filled six rows.The much-criticized Uvalde County District Attorney Christina Mitchell was not present.It took more than 70 minutes after the shooter first opened fired on the school for law enforcement to confront the gunman. About 40 minutes of that was spent looking for keys and equipment, evacuating adjacent classrooms and trying to negotiate with the shooter.The U.S. Justice Department issued a scathing 575-page report that singled out local police commanders and state law enforcement for not immediately entering the classroom and killing the gunman. Attorney General Merrick Garland said that “lives would have been saved” if officers had responded quickly.Gonzales never approached the classroom where the shooting was occurring, prosecutors allege.The state will have to prove that the former officer knowingly acted or failed to act in a way that led to the deaths of 19 children and injuries of 10 others. Arredondo is charged with 10 counts — or one for each wounded child.No other officers, including city police who arrived seconds after the two defendants, have faced any charges. Arredondo’s attorney did not respond to a request for comment.State Judge Sid Harle, based in San Antonio, presided over the hearing as Gonzales said little more than a soft “not guilty” during the proceeding. He was flanked on either side of the gallery by a battery of attorneys and security personnel including Texas Rangers and Uvalde County Sheriff’s deputies.Gonzales’s legal team said after the hearing that they don’t know how the special prosecutor singled out their client and tied the evidence to the charges. They are hiring additional investigators to review an extraordinary amount of evidence, they said.The defense team also did not discount the possibility of requesting a venue change if they believe their client cannot get a fair trial in Uvalde. But they said they do not have enough information yet.“There is a horrible monster responsible for the deaths of these children,” LaHood, Gonzales’s attorney, said in front of a gaggle of reporters and cameras. “And it’s not Adrian Gonzales.”Most of the families quickly left the courthouse after the hearing, but a few stayed to listen to Gonzales’s attorneys.Brett Cross, whose son, Uziyah Garcia, was slain in the shooting, said he looked Gonzales in the face as he walked by him outside the court. All he saw, he said, was cowardice.“If you put your life higher than that of children, then you’re a monster as well,” Cross said."

President Biden publicly addressed the nation on Wednesday night for the first time after announcing Sunday that he had withdrawn from his pending re-election.
He cited things he has done since being inaugurated — like battling COVID-19 and trying to help the country recover from what he called the ""worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.""
Biden also said the election is up to the ""American people,"" just a moment after he gave a slight endorsement to Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor.

""In just a few months, the American people will choose the course of America’s future. I made my choice. I’ve made my views known,"" Biden said from the White House. ""I would like to thank our great vice president, Kamala Harris. She is experienced, she is tough, she is capable. She’s been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country.
""Now the choice is up to you, the American people. When you make that choice, remember the words of Benjamin Franklin hanging on my wall here in the Oval Office, alongside the busts of Dr. King and Rosa Parks and Cesar Chavez.""

Biden, who is 81 and has faced criticism from both Republicans and Democrats over his physical appearances and mental acuity after the first presidential debate, did not mention any personal reasons for why he is stepping away.
""In recent weeks, it has become clear to me that I need to unite my party in this critical endeavor. I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America’s future, all merited a second term. But nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition,"" the president said.

""So I’ve decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It’s the best way to unite our nation. I know there was a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. There’s also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now.
""Over the next six months, I will be focused on doing my job as president. That means I will continue to lower costs for hard-working families, grow our economy. I will keep defending our personal freedoms and civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose. I will keep calling out hate and extremism, making it clear there is no place, no place in America for political violence or any violence ever, period. I’m going to keep speaking out to protect our kids from gun violence, our planet from climate crisis as an existential threat.""
Biden won the needed votes to clinch delegates for re-election. Now, it seems like Harris will be the presumed Democratic candidate to run against former President Trump in the general election this fall."
54,FOX_8,"Biden likely to keep same routine, accomplish 'nothing' in waning months of presidency: insiders",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-likely-keep-same-routine-accomplish-nothing-waning-months-presidency-insiders,"Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy questions the press secretary about President Biden's decision to drop out of the race.
President Biden's tenure in the White House expires in January, and political insiders from both sides of the aisle believe the remaining six months of his lame-duck presidency will consist largely of the same routine and ""absolutely nothing.""
Biden suspended his 2024 re-election campaign on Sunday, noting in a statement that he believed it ""is in the best interests of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term.""
Biden's announcement, which included his ""full support and endorsement"" for Vice President Harris to take over as the party's presidential nominee, led many Americans and political pundits to question what that fulfillment of duties will look like and whether the president will see through any meaningful policies or changes during his remaining months in office.
Former Democrat presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard, who represented Hawaii's 2nd Congressional District in the House from 2013 to 2021, said she sees little change coming Americans' way in the next six months, insisting Biden ""hasn't been the one making decisions"" on key issues all along.

""Clearly, President Biden hasn’t been the one making decisions on our country’s domestic and foreign policy for the last three and a half years,"" she said. ""The same unelected people running the country with Biden as their figurehead will continue to do so for as long as he is in office and with Kamala Harris, if she’s elected.""
""The people who’ve been actually running the country are the unelected power elite from the administrative state, national security state and military industrial complex working hand-in-glove with the propaganda media acting as their agents,"" she added. ""Their goal is to remain in power at any and all costs, and [they] have already shown they are willing to do whatever it takes to defeat and destroy [former President] Donald Trump, as he is the greatest threat to their power.""
Biden's unprecedented announcement came as an increasing number of Democrat lawmakers publicly called for him to step aside, with the party's leadership reportedly engaged in efforts to convince the 81-year-old president he could not win the November general election against Trump, the 2024 GOP nominee who he defeated four years ago to win the White House.

Julian Epstein, an attorney and former chief counsel to Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, told Fox News Digital he believes there is ""almost nothing"" Biden will be able to accomplish in the months and days before the inauguration.
FOX NEWS MEDIA PROPOSES TRUMP-HARRIS DEBATE MODERATED BY MARTHA MACCALLUM, BRET BAIER
""There is almost nothing that Biden can achieve in the next six months, other than treading water and maintaining the status quo,"" he said. ""If the White House were smart, it would double down on its support for Israel and make clear that the Democrats understand moral clarity on fighting what is in effect the Ku Klux Klan on the banks of the Mediterranean.""
American Majority CEO and founder Ned Ryun echoed Epstein's assessment, saying he believes there's ""absolutely nothing"" Biden will be able to accomplish in the shadows of Harris' presidential campaign.
""First, there’s no way anyone on either side of the aisle would want to push the envelope as they have their own re-elections to worry about,"" Ryan said. ""[Senate Majority Leader] Chuck Schumer would never let anything overtly problematic come to the floor in the Senate because it’s a terrible map already; he doesn’t need to make it even harder for them to try and hold majority.""
""So Biden will achieve precisely nothing, except via executive orders, as he’s beyond a lame-duck president and shouldn’t even still be in office,"" he added.

During his tenure in the White House, Biden has signed 140 executive orders, 196 presidential memoranda, 634 proclamations and 133 notices.
After his announcement, Biden's schedule was largely cleared of campaign events and speeches.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that Biden intends to complete his term in office and ""run through the finish line"" in January.

54,FOX_32,Politico column takes aim at Biden's 'weakened capacity' to use bully pulpit: 'Half a president',https://www.foxnews.com/media/politico-column-takes-aim-bidens-weakened-capacity-use-bully-pulpit-half-president,"President Biden remained defiant that he would stay in the 2024 race before abruptly revealing he would step aside for 'democracy.'
Politico's John Harris wrote in a column on Thursday that President Biden has ""essentially been only half a president,"" and argued his address to the nation on Wednesday showed why he had to drop out of the race.
""It is [Donald] Trump who used the presidential pulpit — and the mania and obsessive interest that followed him even after he lost it — in ways consistent with the grain of American history. He preoccupies the psyche of the nation, no less among those who loathe him as among the half or nearly half who are open to returning him to power,"" Harris wrote. ""It was Biden who is the tragic exception.""
Biden addressed the nation from the Oval Office on Wednesday and told Americans he was dropping out to unify the Democratic Party, adding that the election was about ""defending democracy."" Harris wrote that Biden's speech showed ""a paradox,"" in which ""Trump represents continuity and Biden is the anomaly.""
""On the performative dimension of the presidency — using words to inspire his supporters, box in his enemies, to reframe debates — he [Biden] has been arguably the weakest Oval Office occupant in more than a century, back to the days before television or even radio, when most Americans might read about a presidential speech but had never heard the president’s voice,"" he continued.

BIDEN ADDRESSES DECISION TO DROP OUT OF 2024 RACE, INTENDS TO COMPLETE TERM IN WHITE HOUSE
Harris argued that Biden did perform admirably when it came to passing legislation. He wrote Biden's voice has gotten fainter throughout his presidency and said the president's ""thoughts straddle a line between discursive and incoherent.""
""A president who was effective at waging a national argument and reframing debates to his advantage would not be facing a potent threat from the same politician he beat in the last election,"" Harris wrote in the column. 
He further criticized Biden's Oval Office address in the column, which was widely praised by members of the media, as another example of the president's ""weakened capacity to wage argument.""
On the other hand, CNN's Van Jones said Biden was a ""hero"" who ""fell on his sword.""

""To reach this standard requires employing all tools of the modern presidency, not just half,"" the column concluded. 
In his address, without going into specifics, Biden discussed his decision to bow out of the race, which came after weeks of fierce pressure from his own party and his own insistence that he wasn't going anywhere.
""In recent weeks, it's become clear to me that I need to unite my party in this critical endeavor.

Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, and Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina are among the most-discussed prospects for the Democratic vice-presidential nomination.
Her selection will set the tone for her last-minute presidential campaign launched with an endorsement of Biden following his sudden and unexpected withdrawal from the race.

The campaign of former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee in the 2024 election, has dismissed Harris's eventual vice-presidential pick as inconsequential. 
""There is a short list of governors and senators. They are all interchangeable,"" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told reporters on Wednesday. ""It doesn’t matter.""
Many top Democrats have fallen in line behind Harris, receiving endorsements from the Clintons, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.

Harris and Trump are locked in an extremely close contest, according to a new national poll conducted entirely after Biden announced he was suspending his campaign and endorsing his vice president.
Trump, who last week was formally nominated as the Republican Party’s 2024 presidential candidate, stands at 46% support among registered voters in an NPR/PBS News/Marist Poll.
Harris, who on Monday night said she had locked up the Democratic nomination thanks to verbal commitments from delegates at next month’s Democratic National Convention, stood at 45% support. Trump’s one point edge is well within the survey’s sampling error. Nine percent of those questioned were undecided.

76,FOX_37,Biden jokes he was '12' when he first met Israeli PM Golda Meir during Netanyahu visit to White House,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-jokes-12-first-met-israeli-pm-golda-meir-netanyahu-visit-white-house,"The president discussed his long history with Israeli prime ministers in a meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday.
While meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office Thursday, President Biden joked that he has known leaders from the Jewish state as far back as his childhood. 
""Mr. President,"" Netanyahu said at the start of the meeting, ""we've known each other for 40 years. And you've known every Israeli prime minister for 50 years from Golda Meir. So, from a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish-American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the State of Israel. And I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead on the great issues before us.""
Biden answered, ""I look forward to as well. By the way, that first meeting with Prime Minister Golda Meir, she had an assistant sitting next to me, a guy named Rabin. That's how far back it goes. I was only 12 then. Anyway, thank you all for being here."" 
Biden was referring to Yitzhak Rabin, who served as prime minister of Israel from 1974-1977 and again from 1992 until he was assassinated in 1995.

Biden actually met with Meir and Rabin in 1973, when he was a 30-year-old senator, a story he's told frequently. Three years ago, he incorrectly claimed he was a ""liaison"" between Israel and Egypt during the Six-Day War, which occurred in 1967, when he was still in law school. 
""I have known every, every prime minister well since Golda Meir, including Golda Meir,"" Biden said during a menorah lighting in 2021. ""And during the Six-Day War, I had an opportunity to, she invited me to come over because I was going to be the liaison between she and the Egyptians about the Suez.""
He actually met with Meir just prior to the October 1973 Yom Kippur War.
""And I sat in front of her desk,"" he added at the time. ""And she had a guy, her staff member, to my right. His name was Rabin. And she kept flipping those maps up and down. She had that bevy of maps, sort of kept it, and it was, it was so depressing what she was, about what happened. She gave me every detail.""
Biden's team confirmed to Fox News Digital Thursday he was joking about his age. 
Both leaders ignored reporters’ shouted questions about a potential cease-fire and the anti-Israel protests after the brief meeting. 
Netanyahu’s address to Congress Wednesday led to anti-Israel protests in the capital, with some marching through the streets shouting ""Free Palestine"" and others waving Hamas flags, burning the American flag and painting graffiti.

""I have a message for these protesters. When the tyrants of Tehran, who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering their hair, are praising, promoting and funding you, you have officially become Iran's useful idiots,"" Netanyahu said.
""Some of these protesters hold up signs proclaiming ‘Gays for Gaza.’ They might as well hold up signs saying ‘Chickens for KFC.’ These protesters chant ‘From the river to the sea.’ But many don't have a clue what river and what sea they're talking about.""

He addressed a nearly full House chamber, which included members of Congress and special guests like freed Israeli hostages who were taken by Hamas Oct. 7 and billionaire Elon Musk, among others.
Among those in the chamber was Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., Israel's harshest critic in the House of Representatives. Tlaib has called for Netanyahu to be arrested by the International Criminal Court. She staged a silent protest for much of his speech, holding a double-sided sign that said ""guilty of genocide"" on one side and ""war criminal"" on the other.

79,CNN_1,Harris navigates Biden and Netanyahu as she considers her stance on Israel,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/kamala-harris-israel-policy/index.html,"
            Four days into the most consequential week of Kamala Harris’ political life, she has to confront the most fraught foreign policy issue facing the country by looking directly into the eyes of an Israeli prime minister who decided not to even give her a passing name check in his address to Congress Wednesday afternoon.
    

            Up until now, Harris has been defined by working for President Joe Biden, arguably the most explicitly pro-Israel American president, even though his relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu has frayed.
    

            But now that she’s the presumptive Democratic nominee, Harris has to define what kind of president she wants to be — on this and every other issue, while Biden remains at the White House trying to nail down a Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal and with some around him thinking that restarting the normalization of relations with Saudi Arabia could be a top legacy project for the remainder of his term.
    

            Harris didn’t preside over Netanyahu’s speech to Congress on Wednesday, instead choosing to stick with a pre-scheduled trip to a sorority event in Indiana, as antisemitic protests erupted near the US Capitol where fences were put up like in the days following the January 6, 2021, riot. On Thursday, she’s set to welcome Netanyahu to her ceremonial office in the Old Executive Office Building. But articulating a clear position on Israel will take more than that, according to CNN’s conversations with two dozen former and current aides, members of Congress and other political players.
    

            “We don’t have enough evidence,” said Richard Haass, the former president of the Council on Foreign Relations and official in George W. Bush’s State Department, when asked to evaluate Harris’ position on Israel vis-à-vis Biden. “Anyone who says they can answer is not very helpful. You can’t judge a person when they’re vice president.”
    

            Even several people who have talked with Harris in depth about Israeli policy responded to CNN’s questions — on whether, for example, she would have done the same as Biden in sending some and halting other weapons to Israel — with a series of extended pauses and insistences that it’s impossible to judge hypotheticals.
    

            Aides say she will make her feelings clearer on Thursday after her meeting with Netanyahu.
    

            Harris is going to try to emphasize her independence from Biden without breaking with him, people who know her say, and is going to try to show the same clarity she’s displayed when going after Donald Trump instead of getting caught up in a garbled attempt to please everyone by not saying anything.
    

            The uncertainty about where she stands is high enough that second gentleman Doug Emhoff made a surprise appearance on a quickly organized Zoom call Wednesday afternoon hosted by the Jewish Democratic Council of America and Jewish Women for Kamala.
    

            “Let me just make this clear: The vice president has been and will be a strong supporter of Israel as a secure democratic and Jewish state, and she will always ensure that Israel can defend itself, period. Because that’s who Kamala Harris is,” Emhoff said.
    

            But change is coming, predicted Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee who has been critical of Israel in this period and observed Harris’ foreign policy thinking when they served on the Senate Intelligence Committee together.
    

            “President Biden brought to the White House a lifelong relationship with Bibi Netanyahu and a very mature history on the US-Israel relationship,” Murphy said. “This certainly seems to be a moment for a reconsideration of the relationship and for some fresh thinking on how to approach an Israeli political landscape that is lurching further to the right than we could have ever imagined.”
    

            Murphy added, “I think we would all benefit from getting a fresh set of eyes on this conflict and the way that the United States could try to create a viable Palestinian state.”
    

            But Harris has so many different pulls on her that an aide did not give a direct answer when asked if the vice president considers herself a Zionist — a term Biden again proudly embraced just weeks ago.
    

            That’s a reflection of how much Zionism, which for a century meant believing in the right of a Jewish homeland to exist, has been co-opted by anti-Israel forces, who argue it has come to symbolize colonialism and the killing of Palestinians.
    

            It’s also a reflection of the difference in thinking and rhetoric between the Democratic Party’s new standard bearer and a president who has made allegiance with Israel one of his defining positions for 50 years in national politics.
    

            “The vice president has been a strong and longstanding supporter of Israel as a secure, democratic homeland for the Jewish people. She will always ensure Israel can defend itself from threats, including from Iran and Iran-backed militias such as Hamas and Hezbollah,” said Harris’ deputy national security adviser Dean Lieberman when asked if she considers herself a Zionist. “One can criticize specific policies of the government of Israel while still strongly supporting the state of Israel and the people of Israel. And that support for Israel in no way conflicts with the vice president’s strong view that the Palestinian people deserve freedom, dignity, and self-determination.”
    

            Many close observers see a sign of where Harris’ inclinations are in her choice of Phil Gordon to be her national security adviser. A former Obama administration official, Gordon in 2016 co-authored a report for the Council on Foreign Relations, which, seven years before the October 7 attacks, begins: “The U.S. relationship with Israel is in trouble.” The root of the problem, the authors wrote, is that while America and Israel used to agree on the threats to Israeli security and what to do about them, now those threats have become broader and more complicated, and the opinions about how to tackle them have too.
    

            Gordon has traveled to the region since October 7, holding meetings separate from the ones that Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan and others have been having.
    

            One official who has been deeply involved with Biden administration policy on Israel said that Harris’ differences will actually be key to keeping the overall relationship from getting worse.
    

            “She’ll be able to communicate with another generation. She has the ability, because of who she is, to be enormously helpful to us who care deeply about Israel and how we’re going to get through this disaster,” said the official. “She is the future of the relationship between us and Israel.”
    

            Aides and allies who have talked with Harris – from her Senate days up through her being on the line for nearly every conversation Biden has had with Netanyahu – insist that substantively there is little daylight between her and the president.
    

            The difference is rhetorical, but that difference, they say, is very important. She has been concerned since right after October 7 both about expressing empathy for the Palestinians and about thinking of what the political reverberations could be back home from the way Biden hugged Netanyahu close, figuratively and then literally on his trip to Israel two weeks after the attacks.
    

            It’s the explanation, aides involved tell CNN, for the fury that erupted from the West Wing in March about the way Harris punctuated prepared text that both decried the “humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza and thoroughly condemned Hamas. She built up to her reading of “there must be an immediate ceasefire,” taking a long pause, then adding the rest of the approved sentence: “for at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table.”
    

            Many Democrats outside the White House are making optimistic guesses that she aligns with them.
    

            “Like most Americans, the vice president falls within the pro-Israel mainstream—somewhere between the ‘Greater Israel’ far right and the ‘Free Palestine’ far left,” said Rep. Ritchie Torres, a New York Democrat who has positioned himself as one of the most stalwart defenders of Israel. He added that he expects that position to translate into being for a two-state solution, keeping up security aid and Iron Dome funding for Israel and supporting the Trump administration-negotiated Abraham Accords.
    

            For all the Biden speeches that had to be paused as protesters were removed from the rooms, Harris’ first week effectively on the top of the ticket hasn’t seen such an interruption so far. That doesn’t mean the politics of this are settled.
    

            Abbas Alawieh – a delegate who won a spot at the Democratic convention because he represents some of the 730,000 people who voted “uncommitted” in Michigan’s Democratic primary – told CNN on Wednesday that he remains “very curious how she will differentiate a Gaza policy.”
    

            Alawieh said he’s hopeful. At the very least, he thinks that the party under Harris’ leadership will no longer make him and others aligned with him feel “neglected, ignored—and in some cases maligned,” as happened on a Tuesday night call of state delegates when another person told him to shut up when he tried to speak.
    

            The Michigan Democratic Party chair condemned that behavior in an email to delegates.
    

            Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition released an online ad on Wednesday repeatedly referring to Harris by a mispronounced version of her first name and falsely claimed that she “sided with the pro-Hamas demonstrators” and snubbed Israel by not attending Netanyahu’s speech to Congress.
    

            Trump also accused her of this, saying at a rally in North Carolina that “she’s running away from Israel” and “totally against the Jewish people” for not going. Neither the ad nor the candidate mentioned that Ohio Sen. JD Vance also skipped the speech, though he had no other public schedule, with campaign spokesman Jason Miller telling CNN he “has duties to fulfill as the Republican nominee for vice president.”
    

            Harris’ connection to these issues is more than policy. It touches Emhoff’s daughter, who has been noticeably active on pro-Palestinian causes since October 7. It has come up at Seder dinners at the Naval Observatory. And more than anything, it is rooted in the second gentleman.
    

            Emhoff has talked at length about feeling a sense of duty, not just when he became the first Jewish spouse of a vice president or president, and channeling that into helping develop the administration’s strategy to combat antisemitism. He’s also talked about how much pain he felt personally after October 7.
    

            Halie Soifer, the CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, recalled a trip to Jerusalem she took with Harris and Emhoff in 2017, when she was working in the California Democrat’s new Senate office. She still has photos of Harris taking out a traditional kippah head covering for Emhoff when they visited the Western Wall.
    

            Soifer said she is satisfied that Harris remains committed to Israel — even after being read the indirect answer about whether the vice president considers herself a Zionist.
    

            And Emhoff has stressed that even as this campaign picks up, he is going to keep talking about Judaism and Israel, as he has throughout this administration with his wife’s encouragement.
    

            On the Zoom call on Wednesday, he told the story of not being with his wife on Sunday when the news broke about Biden exiting the race, dropping a little Yiddish by blaming “this flight mishigas” that had him stuck in Los Angeles.
    

            Then he made a promise to the 1,700 people listening: “I’m going to keep living openly like a Jew and maybe there will be a mezuzah on the White House, like there is on the vice president’s residence.”

85,CNN_7,NORAD intercepts Russian and Chinese bombers operating together near Alaska in first such flight,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/norad-russian-chinese-bombers-alaska/index.html,"
            The North American Aerospace Defense Command intercepted two Russian and two Chinese bombers flying near Alaska Wednesday in what a US defense official said was the first time the two countries have been intercepted while operating together.
    

            The bombers remained in international airspace in Alaska’s Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) and were “not seen as a threat,” according to a statement from NORAD.
    

            The US and Canada, which together comprise NORAD, intercepted the Russian TU-95 Bear and Chinese H-6 bombers. The aircraft did not enter US or Canadian sovereign airspace, NORAD said.
    

            It also marks the first time H-6 bombers, which are a derivative of older Soviet bombers, have entered the Alaska ADIZ, the defense official said.
    

            The intercept was carried out by US F-16 and F-35 fighter jets, as well as Canadian CF-18 fighter jets, according to the defense official. Support aircraft were also part of the intercept, the official said.
    

            On Thursday, China’s Defense Ministry said the Chinese and Russian air forces had organized a “joint strategic aerial patrol in the relevant airspace of the Bering Sea” as part of an existing annual cooperation plan between the two militaries.
    

            Zhang Xiaogang, a spokesperson for the ministry, told a news conference it was the eighth such patrol organized by the two militaries since 2019, which were aimed at “further testing and enhancing the level of cooperation between the two air forces, as well as deepening strategic mutual trust and practical cooperation between the two countries.”
    

            “This action is not aimed at third parties, it is in line with relevant international laws and international practices and has nothing to do with the current international and regional situation,” Zhang said.
    

            Russian flights into Alaska’s ADIZ are not uncommon. In May, Russia flew four aircraft into Alaska’s ADIZ, which NORAD said at the time “occurs regularly.”
    

            But the presence of Chinese aircraft appears to be a new development. In March, the head of US Northern Command, Gen. Gregory Guillot, said China was pushing farther north into the Arctic and he expected to see aircraft there “as soon as this year potentially.”
    

            “What I have seen is a willingness and a desire by the Chinese to act up there,” Guillot told a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
    

            “We have seen them in the maritime. We have seen them under the cloud of a technical or scientific research, but we think it is certainly multi-mission, to include military. And then I expect to see air activity in the Alaska part of the Arctic as soon as this year, potentially.
    

            “It is a very big concern of mine.”
    

            China considers itself a “near-Arctic” state and has worked to expand its presence in the far north, including through its cooperation with Russia.

He added that the operation “is not directed at any third party, complies with international law and practices, and is unrelated to the current international and regional situation.”Joint China-Russia military exercises are nothing new. However, U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks on Monday said China was seeking “greater influence” in the Arctic region, and that there was “growing cooperation between the PRC [People’s Republic of China] and Russia in the Arctic,” something she described as “troubling.”Hicks, who was unveiling a new Arctic strategy, described this as “a critical time in the region,” particularly as “climate change and the resulting shifts in the operating environment” had implications for U.S. defense missions.The strategy noted that China’s presence in the Arctic, “while limited, is increasing,” and said “while significant areas of disagreement between the PRC and Russia remain, their growing alignment in the region is of concern.” It added that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “has made it increasingly reliant on the PRC for financing energy export infrastructure in the Arctic,” where more than 80 percent of its natural gas production is located.Defense officials have stressed that, even as Russia-China military cooperation has increased in recent years, the operations still remain limited.“While we see this increasing collaboration, I think it’s also important to note that it’s somewhat superficial in nature still, especially from a military perspective,” Iris Ferguson, the Defense Department’s deputy assistant secretary for Arctic policy, said Monday.“We know what it takes to operate with our Arctic allies and partners,” she continued. “And so, you know, flying in circles with one another briefly or deploying alongside one another is maybe good for optics, but we know that that’s not the same kind of level of in-depth cooperation that we have with our partners.”Earlier this month, the U.S. Coast Guard said a patrol discovered several Chinese military ships in the Bering Sea, in international waters but within the U.S. exclusive economic zone. The Chinese vessels said they were conducting “freedom of navigation operations,” the coast guard statement added.Maham Javaid and Vic Chiang contributed to this report."
99,CNN_24,The US economy is pulling off something historic,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/economy/us-economy-gdp-second-quarter/index.html,"
            The US economy is on the verge of an extremely rare achievement.
    

            Economic growth in the first half of the year was solid, with the economy expanding a robust 2.8% annualized rate in the second quarter, according to fresh Commerce Department figures released Thursday, which are adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings.
    

            Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic output, was much stronger in the second quarter than economists had predicted. The GDP report showed that businesses are continuing to invest and that consumers are still fueling growth with their spending, despite high prices.

A big change could come to the US economy in September


            As the economy continued to expand from April through June, inflation resumed a downward trend and seems to be on track to slowing further toward the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.
    

            America’s economy is about to stick what’s called a “soft landing,” which is when inflation returns to the Fed’s target without a recession — a feat that’s only happened once, during the 1990s, according to some economists.
    

            The latest GDP report showed that a key gauge of consumer demand picked up in the second quarter to an annual rate of 2.9%, matching the rate in the fourth quarter of 2023 for the strongest pace in two years. A measure of business investment also strengthened in the April-through-June period.
    

            The current health of the American economy suggests that the Fed has successfully handled inflation so far, with the finish line coming into clear view.

99,CNN_76,Takeaways from latest GDP report showing US economy is making history,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/economy/takeaways-gdp-economy/index.html,"
            The US economy just got its latest health check, and it looks promising.


            Gross domestic product, which measures all the goods and services produced in the economy, registered at a robust 2.8% annualized rate in the second quarter, after adjusting for inflation and seasonality, the Commerce Department said Thursday. That’s double the 1.4% rate seen earlier this year, and well above the 1.9% rate economists projected in a FactSet poll.
    

            A closer look shows that key parts of the economy improved from April through June compared to the prior three months, despite the highest interest rates in nearly a quarter century and persistent price pressures.
    

            The government’s GDP report isn’t always easy to decipher. Sometimes the headline number masks trends under the surface.
    

            But this time, there’s no mistaking that the American economy is truly on solid footing, from consumers to businesses. It also shows that the economy could pull off an extremely rare “soft landing.” That’s when inflation comes under control without the economy slipping into a recession, something that experts say has only happened once before, during the 1990s.
    

            Here are some key takeaways from Thursday’s GDP release.
    

            Consumer spending accounts for the vast majority of the US economy, about 70% of it. Spending accelerated sharply in the second quarter to an annual rate of 2.3%, up from 1.5% in the first quarter, as consumers spent a bit less on services but much more on goods. Separate data on spending shows that American shoppers are still shopping. Retail sales, excluding purchases at car dealerships, surged last month, including spending at restaurants and bars.
    

            Within the GDP report, there is a specific measure that is a good gauge of consumer demand in the economy, affectionately known as “final sales to private domestic purchasers” (don’t try to say that three times in front of a mirror.) That measure strengthened in the second quarter, rising to a 2.9% rate compared to 2.6% seen earlier this year.
    

            Generally, one risk that comes with an economy that’s expanding robustly is that price pressures can either get stuck or heat up. That’s not what happened in the second quarter. The report showed that inflation slowed from April through June, compared to the prior three-month period, even as economic growth accelerated.
    

            That’s a crucial development for the Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to pare back interest rates from a 23-year high in the coming months.
    

            “Buried deep in this report is good news on the inflation front, the PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) price index dipped below 3%—that’s substantial further progress on the road to a September rate cut,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, in a note Thursday.
    

            The Commerce Department on Friday releases June figures on household income, spending and the PCE price index (the Fed’s favorite inflation measure), though Thursday’s GDP release already offered a sneak peek.
    

            Businesses invested much more in the second quarter than in the first three months of the year.
    

            In fact, the contribution from business investment toward GDP actually doubled in the April-through-June period. The measure for that — known as “nonresidential fixed investment” — rose to a 5.2% rate in the second quarter, up from 4.4% in the first quarter. That was largely driven by a sharp acceleration in spending on “equipment,” which encompasses everything from laptops to milling machines.
    

            This development is important because businesses put their money where their mouths are, so the pickup in this category shows that businesses believe the outlook is good enough to invest in.
    

            “The story all along has been corporate investment. The consumer is healthy, but investment grew almost double digits over the last quarter,” Scott Helfstein, senior vice president and head of investment strategy at Global X, said in a note Thursday. “Companies are investing in automation and digitalization, which will drive margins higher, and valuations will continue to follow.”
    

            The one weak spot in the business investment category was a steep decline in spending on “structures,” or physical buildings, which declined 3.3% in the second quarter, down from the 3.4% gain seen previously. That pullback likely reflects the effects of still-high interest rates.
    

            “Elevated borrowing costs and tight bank lending standards will (continue to) pose headwinds for equipment spending and some facets of structures,” Oren Klachkin, financial markets economists at Nationwide, said in a note. “But we think that tech-related investment will continue to rise.”

            “We’re closer than we’ve ever been,” one senior administration official said. “It’s up to the Israelis to accept it.”
    

            Biden’s in-person meeting with Netanyahu followed the Israeli prime minister’s speech to Congress on Wednesday, which sparked protests including instances of antisemitism or pro-Hamas rhetoric in Washington, DC. The White House has condemned such demonstrations.
    

            In brief remarks before the meeting, Netanyahu mentioned how the two men have known each other for four decades. He added: “From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish-American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the State of Israel.”
    

            Biden reminisced about meeting with previous Israeli leaders before making a joke about his age: “That’s how far back it goes. I was only 12 then.” Neither leader responded to shouted questions from reporters.
    

            The meeting, which was Biden’s first with a world leader since announcing he would drop out of the 2024 race, came at a fragile point in their decadeslong relationship. A resolution to end the Israel-Hamas war that began in October now looms large over Biden’s legacy as a one-term president. Progress in the negotiations for a ceasefire have come in fits and starts in recent months, and Biden and his senior national security officials have been closely involved in trying to land the deal.
    

            Biden also participated in a meeting with Netanyahu that includes families of American hostages in Gaza - a separate setting where he could apply firm pressure on Netanyahu to finalize the ceasefire agreement.
    

            “In this setting he will really be held accountable to his commitment of pursuing a ceasefire and hostage deal,” said one US official.
    

            Families of the American hostages have expressed frustration in recent months about the relative lack of outreach from Netanyahu and his office – particularly in comparison to the regular cadence of communication that has come from senior Biden administration officials since the war began.
    

            One family member who attended the Thursday afternoon meeting with Biden and Netanyahu told CNN before the meeting that they hoped the president would use the setting to exert serious pressure on his Israeli counterpart – particularly now that Biden is free from the political burdens of a reelection campaign.
    

            After their meeting with the president and Netanyahu, some family members struck an optimistic tone on the prospects of a deal being reached soon.
    

            “We feel more optimistic than we have since the first round of releases in late November, early December,” said Jonathan Dekel-Chen. “We got absolute commitment from President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu that they understand the urgency of this moment now. And to waste no time. And to complete this deal as it currently stands with as little change as humanly possible.”
    

            When the Biden administration proposed a joint meeting with the families, some US officials did not expect Netanyahu to accept the proposal, two US officials said.
    

            Other US officials believed that Netanyahu would have no choice but to accept the offer, and viewed it as an opportunity to put the Israeli leader in the hot seat in front of both Biden and hostage families amid ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage deal, officials said.
    

            Multiple sources stressed that no major announcement about an agreement is expected on Thursday. However, as CNN reported this week, US and Israeli officials have voiced increased optimism about the prospects of an agreement.
    

            While Biden has remained firmly behind Israel, even as its campaign in Gaza has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, both leaders have traded not-so-subtle barbs in recent months over the future of the war and how Netanyahu has waged it.
    

            Biden has described Israel’s actions in Gaza as “over the top,” threatened to withhold some new arms transfers and repeatedly pressured Netanyahu to scale back and be more precise in his military operation in Gaza – criticism that reached a peak when an Israeli strike killed seven World Central Kitchen workers in early April. The Israeli leader has been steadfast in his position that the war will not end until Hamas is eliminated while accusing the US of withholding weapons from its closest ally – claims that American officials flatly rejected.
    

            Speaking in front of Congress this week, Netanyahu did not substantially address the status of ceasefire negotiations. He instead praised Biden for his “heartfelt support” for Israel after the October 7 Hamas attack while urging the US to fast-track military aid to “dramatically expedite an end to the war.”
    

            “As we defend ourselves on all fronts, I know that America has our back and I thank you for it – all sides of the aisle,” Netanyahu said.
    

            US officials remain sensitive to Israeli politics that may be shaping Netanyahu’s calculations – including, as CNN has reported, the timing of Israel’s parliament going into recess at the end of the month, which would make it harder for right-wing opponents of the deal to move to collapse the government.
    

            The US does not believe, for now, that Netanyahu is standing in the way of or delaying a ceasefire and hostage deal, and believes that progress is being made amid ongoing negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Both the Israelis and Hamas, the official said, have elements they need to agree on before a deal is reached, and not one side is holding up negotiations at this point.
    

            The in-person meeting at the White House will be the first time the two men have met in person since Biden’s trip to Israel last year following the October 7 attack, although the two men have spoken frequently on the phone. It was followed by the meeting with American hostage families, and then Netanyahu met with Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Biden has endorsed to replace him on the top of the Democratic ticket.
    

            Harris welcomed Netanyahu and said they had “a lot to talk about” ahead of their conversation.
    

            The prime minister in his remarks to Congress criticized anti-Israel protesters as “Iran’s useful idiots” and falsely downplayed the role of Israel in causing the ongoing civilian suffering in Gaza.
    

            Biden’s support for Israel’s war had been one his most politically toxic issues within his own party for much of the year, with many of his public campaign appearances being repeatedly interrupted by protesters demanding a ceasefire in Gaza. Biden’s stance toward those protests has been conciliatory – he has repeatedly responded to them by saying that the protesters have a point, and that too many innocent people are dying in Gaza.
    

            But the national conversation surrounding Biden’s handling of Israel’s war took a back seat to the waves of Democratic concern about his ability to beat former President Donald Trump after his faltering debate performance last month. Trump and Netanyahu will meet Friday at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump announced Tuesday.
    

            Last week, Biden spoke extensively about the war in the Middle East for the first time in months – telling a Complex Networks interviewer that he considers himself a Zionist but adding that he’s “done more for the Palestinian community than anybody” while still calling for more aid to reach the Gaza Strip.
    

            “I’m the guy that opened up all the assets. I’m the guy that made sure that – I got the Egyptians to open the border to let goods through, medicine and food,” Biden said. “I have been very supportive of the Palestinians, but Hamas, they’re a bunch of thugs.”
    

            Biden and Netanyahu last spoke during a 30-minute call on July 4, during which both leaders “focused” on details about a possible hostage exchange and ceasefire deal.
    

            A deal was never finalized or assured during that call.

132,CNN_61,Gov. Gavin Newsom issues executive order for removal of homeless encampments in California,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/us/gavin-newsom-executive-order-homeless-encampments/index.html,"
            California Gov. Gavin Newsom, buoyed by a recent US Supreme Court decision, issued an executive order Thursday calling on state officials to begin taking down homeless encampments.
    

            The move to begin dismantling thousands of encampments throughout California comes after the high court ruled last month in favor of an Oregon city that ticketed homeless people for sleeping outside. The ruling rejected arguments that such “anti-camping” ordinances violated the Constitution’s ban on “cruel and unusual” punishment.
    

            “This executive order directs state agencies to move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them — and provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same,” Newson said in a statement. “There are simply no more excuses. It’s time for everyone to do their part.”
    

            The order calls on state officials “to adopt humane and dignified policies to urgently address encampments on state property.”
    

            The move has drawn the ire of homeless advocates.
    

            “Newsom could have issued this order before the (Supreme Court) decision. The only difference now is that states and localities are free to confine and arrest people even when there is no shelter available,” said Chris Herring, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California Los Angeles.

            “So before the Supreme Court ruling cities were in the position where they would have to provide shelter offers before removing encampments. Now … they will be able to carry out these encampment sweeps with the very real threat of issuing people incredibly expensive fines of which people cannot pay and often results in a warrant or an arrest or can result in incarceration.”
    

            Herring said the timing of the order wasn’t surprising as Newsom seeks to “politically clear his name of the homeless crisis, especially as he’s in the national spotlight right now amid the presidential election.”
    

            In San Francisco, a spokesperson for Mayor London Breed said the city had already started to take action.
    

            “Our city encampment teams and street outreach staff have been going out every day to bring people indoors, and to clean and clear encampments,” spokesperson Parisa Safarzadeh told CNN in a statement. “This is why we are seeing a five year low in the City’s tent count on our streets.”
    

            Last month, Newsom praised the Supreme Court decision, saying it “provides state and local officials the definitive authority to implement and enforce policies to clear unsafe encampments from our streets.”
    

            “This decision removes the legal ambiguities that have tied the hands of local officials for years and limited their ability to deliver on common-sense measures to protect the safety and well-being of our communities,” Newsom added.
    

            The case was the most significant appeal involving unhoused Americans to reach the Supreme Court in decades, and it was closely watched by cities and states across the nation wrestling with a sharp increase in homelessness.

132,NYT_1,Newsom Will Order California Officials to Remove Homeless Encampments,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/us/newsom-homeless-california.html,"Gov. Gavin Newsom will order California officials on Thursday to begin dismantling thousands of homeless encampments, according to officials in his administration, calling on government leaders to act on a recent Supreme Court decision “with urgency and dignity.”
The executive order, which is expected to affect tens of thousands of people, represents the nation’s most sweeping response to a June ruling that gave governments greater authority to remove homeless people from their streets.
Homeless encampments have vexed California, where housing costs are among the nation’s highest, more than any other state. An estimated 180,000 people were homeless last year in California, the most in the nation, and about 123,000 homeless people on any given night were unsheltered, according to the most recent count. Unlike New York City, most jurisdictions in California do not guarantee a right to housing.
Governor Newsom will instruct California cities and counties on how best to ramp up enforcement on a signature issue of his administration. He also will mandate that state agencies not simply move campers along, but also work with local governments to house people and provide services into which the state has pumped billions of dollars.“The state has been hard at work to address this crisis on our streets,” Mr. Newsom said in a statement.
“There are simply no more excuses,” he added. “It’s time for everyone to do their part.”
Mr. Newsom, who is widely viewed as having presidential aspirations, has channeled about $24 billion into homelessness since he took office in 2019. His administration says it helped move more than 165,000 homeless people into temporary or permanent housing two fiscal years ago, the most recent period for which data is available.

132,WaPo_113,California Gov. Gavin Newsom orders homeless camps cleared,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/25/gavin-newsom-homeless-supreme-court/,"SAN FRANCISCO — California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday ordered agencies to remove homeless encampments on state land and urged local officials to follow suit, citing a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last month allowing cities to enforce bans on sleeping in public spaces.“In the past, the courts have denied the ability for local government, including the state, to clean up many of these encampments,” Newsom said in a Facebook video discussing his executive order. “ … We have now no excuse with the Supreme Court decision.”California is home to more than 180,000 unhoused people — nearly a third of the country’s total — and almost 70 percent of them live without shelter outside, a larger share than any other state, according to federal statistics.Under Newsom’s order, state agencies — including parks and transportation workers — must prioritize clearing encampments that pose safety risks, such as those along waterways. Newsom urged cities and counties, where most homeless encampments are located, to adopt similar policies.“It’s time to move with urgency at the local level to clean up these sites,” Newsom said Thursday.Newsom, a Democrat with national aspirations, has like other politicians in the state been dogged by complaints over homelessness. He has in turn tangled with leaders of the state’s largest cities over efforts to clear encampments.“No more excuses,” Newsom posted on X. “ … It’s time for locals to do their job.”Newsom’s executive order cannot force localities to act, although he could withhold state money until they comply. It could spark a standoff between his administration and some of the state’s largest cities, also run by Democrats, where homeless encampments are largely concentrated.On Thursday, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass balked at Newsom’s order, noting that an annual count of the city’s unhoused showed their ranks had decreased 10 percent.“For the first time in years, unsheltered homelessness has decreased in Los Angeles because of a comprehensive approach that leads with housing and services, not criminalization,” Bass said in a statement condemning the clearing of encampments.Newsom has expended both political capital and billions in state funding trying to solve the crisis that has only seemed to deepen, and he was part of an unusual coalition of liberal and conservative state leaders who urged the Supreme Court to make it easier for localities to dismantle homeless encampments.Responding to those entreaties, the Supreme Court ruled last month that cities may ban homeless residents from sleeping outside, a sweeping decision that broke along ideological lines and rejected the argument that regulations against camping violate the “cruel and unusual punishment” clause of the Eighth Amendment.In the case, City of Grants Pass v. Johnson, the court’s conservative majority cleared the way for regulations that penalize people for sleeping in public spaces such as parks and streets, even when a community lacks indoor shelter and its unhoused residents have nowhere else to go.Advocates for the unhoused and some local officials warned the ruling would have a devastating impact on some of the nation’s most vulnerable residents. Instead of solving the problem, they argued, the decision criminalized homelessness and would only exacerbate the crisis.But some California mayors, like London Breed of San Francisco, have taken a more aggressive stance, promising to begin clearing encampments in coming weeks.“San Francisco is already doing what the Governor is calling for, with efforts well underway since long before the Grants Pass ruling,” Breed posted on X Thursday. “We’ve made significant investments in shelter and housing, and consistent daily outreach continues to offer services and support. This proactive approach has led to a five-year low in our street tent count.”Breed wrote that she expects the Ninth Circuit court to lift an injunction next week that has limited the city’s response.“More needs to be done to ensure our streets are safe and clean,” Breed wrote. “As we wait for this final step from the courts, our outreach work hasn’t slowed. Our teams are going out every day to bring people indoors and clean up encampments.”In Los Angeles, the epicenter of the epidemic, Bass warned cities against using the Supreme Court ruling as a pretext to “arrest their way out of this problem or hide the homelessness crisis in neighboring cities or in jail.”“Strategies that just move people along from one neighborhood to the next or give citations instead of housing do not work,” Bass said.Jim Sullivan, an economics professor at Notre Dame who studies poverty and homelessness, agreed.“Clearing encampments is not going to reduce homelessness. It’s shifting it around,” Sullivan said. “The presence of encampments speaks to the need for more efforts to both prevent and reduce homelessness.”Research shows that the two most effective ways to prevent and reduce homelessness are emergency financial assistance and permanent supportive housing, which includes services to help with substance abuse or other issues, Sullivan said. While such approaches are expensive, he said, they’re more effective than clearing encampments because “if you’re not providing a path to housing stability for those who are homeless, you’re just moving the issue around.”Hennessy-Fiske reported from Houston."
151,CNN_87,Judge who ordered Trump to pay $454 million says he was ‘accosted’ by lawyer and won’t recuse himself from case,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/engoron-recusal-response-trump-civil-case/index.html,"
            The judge who found Donald Trump liable for fraud and ordered the former president to pay $454 million said he will not recuse himself from the case.
    

            Trump asked Judge Arthur Engoron to step aside from the case, which is on appeal, alleging he engaged in “prohibited communications” with a real estate lawyer about the case before his decision was rendered earlier this year.
    

            “I am supremely confident in my ability to continue to serve, as I always have, impartially,” Engoron wrote in an order Thursday. The judge said that over three years into the litigation, his recusal would result in “immense prejudice.”
    

            Trump’s lawyers asked for the recusal after NBC published an interview with real estate attorney Adam Bailey the day the verdict was rendered. According to the article, Bailey said he “had the ability to speak to [this Court] three weeks ago…I saw him in the corner [at the courthouse] and I told my client, ‘I need to go.’ And I walked over and we started talking … I wanted him to know what I think [about the case] and why … I really want him to get it right.”
    

            Bailey told CNN that he only spoke with Engoron about his September summary judgment decision “because that’s the only thing I discussed with reporters.” NBC said it stood by its story.
    

            Engoron in Thursday’s ruling said he was “accosted” by Bailey while leaving the courthouse one day in February.
    

            The judge described the “90-second incident” was a “nothingburger” from a “landlord-tenant lawyer ranting” and said that he did not base any part of his rulings on what Bailey said.
    

            “I did not initiate, welcome, encourage, engage in, or learn from much less enjoy, Bailey’s tirade. I did not base any part of any of my rulings on it, as Bailey has outlandishly, mistakenly, and defamatorily claimed,” Engoron wrote.
    

            The judge also said he was unaware of any investigation by the Commission on Judicial Conduct saying he has not been contacted by the review group.

152,CNN_88,Man arrested for allegedly starting Park Fire in California as Oregon battles massive blaze,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/us/durkee-fire-oregon/index.html,"
The largest active wildfire in the United States has scorched almost 270,000 acres in eastern Oregon, as nearly 80 large active wildfires are burning in the US, including a California blaze that exploded in size overnight. Here’s the latest:


            • California battles northern blaze: The Park Fire in California has exploded to nearly 71,500 acres and is 3% contained, according to CalFire. A suspect has been arrested after being identified pushing a car engulfed in fire 60 feet into a gully, “spreading flames that caused the Park Fire,” the Butte County District Attorney’s Office announced Thursday afternoon. The blaze has forced mandatory evacuations in Butte County, where the state’s deadliest wildfire, the Camp Fire, killed more than 80 people in 2018.
    

• The Oregon fire is 0% contained: The Durkee Fire – which has already burned an area larger than the city of Indianapolis – started on July 17 near the Oregon-Idaho state line. Amid high temperatures, extremely dry vegetation and strong winds, the fire has grown tens of thousands of acres since Sunday and is 0% contained as of Thursday morning.
    

• Durkee Fire threatens nearby communities: Three people were injured and two homes and 12 other structures were destroyed as the fire spread, according to the Oregon Department of Emergency Management. Officials have asked some residents to evacuate. Some communities do not have power, according to Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, who has deployed resources from the National Guard to assist.
    

• Two fires threaten national park in Canada: The flames closing in on the nation’s largest national park from two directions sent visitors and residents fleeing the town of Jasper in Alberta, where buildings are burned. Officials say the losses are significant, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has deployed federal support to help battle the blaze.
    

            A 42-year-old suspect has been arrested after witnesses reported seeing someone “pushing a car that was on fire into a gully near the Alligator Hole in upper Bidwell Park shortly before 3:00 p.m. yesterday,” according to a news release from Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey. “The car went down an embankment approximately 60 feet and burned completely, spreading flames that caused the Park Fire.”
    

            The DA says the man was seen “calmly leaving the area by blending in with the other citizens who were in the area and fleeing the rapidly evolving fire.”
    

            The suspect is being held without bail pending his arraignment, which is set for Monday, according to the DA’s office.
    

            Triple-digit temperatures and high wind gusts have fueled the fire’s growth.
    

            Some residents in Butte County were asked to evacuate, as the fire grew to nearly 40,000 acres overnight to an area roughly the size of Washington, DC. By Thursday morning, the fire had burned an average of nearly 50 football fields per minute since it started Wednesday afternoon. Triple-digit temperatures and high wind gusts have fueled its growth.
    

            There are more than 200 firefighters deployed to fight the blaze, according to CalFire.
    

            The lightning-sparked Durkee Fire is the largest of 31 large wildfires currently burning across Oregon, which has been the hardest hit by fires in recent days.
    

            Officials in Malheur County and Baker County issued evacuations for areas around the Durkee Fire. Meanwhile, dense smoke from the flames impeded traffic on Interstate 84, leading to periodic closure of the freeway.
    

            Kotek called it a “dynamic situation.”
    

            “The wildfires in Eastern Oregon have scaled up quickly,” Kotek said in a news release. “We are facing strong erratic winds over the region that could impact all fires. Rain is not getting through. Some communities do not have power.”
    

            More than 500 firefighters and resources from 22 states are working to fight the fire,  according to InciWeb.

            “We have been at this for a number of days, and those days just seem to keep getting harder and harder with the weather that we’re seeing in our area and the intense fire behavior,” Sarah Sherman of the Bureau of Land Management said in a video update.
    

            Over the weekend and earlier this week, the Durkee Fire exhibited extreme fire behavior, even creating it’s own weather in the form of pyrocumulus clouds.
    

            The clouds form over heat sources due to the intense, upward vertical motion of air cooling and condensing as it moves higher into the sky. They can reach heights of 50,000 feet and generate their own systems of thunderstorms.
    

            If fires burn hot enough, they can create clouds that produce lighting and rain, called pyrocumulonimbus.
    

            “Over the last week, firefighters have been challenged by hot temperatures and gusty winds that continue to push several wildfires across the state,” the Oregon State Fire Marshal said.
    

            Wildfire smoke, including from the Durkee Fire in Oregon, was spreading into Boise and beyond. Air quality alerts have been issued for parts of Colorado, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.
    

            Patrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, told the Associated Press that driving into town Wednesday morning was “like driving into a fog bank, because it’s so thick and low to the road.”
    

            “Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,” Nauman said of the smoke.
    

            A cold front has moved through the area Thursday morning, bringing high temperatures to the 80s on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. A red flag warning, which indicates increased risk of fire danger, has expired.

156,CNN_97,Justice Elena Kagan says Supreme Court’s code of conduct needs an enforcement plan. Takeaways from her wide-ranging comments.,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/kagan-supreme-court-ethics-sacramento-conference/index.html,"
            Justice Elena Kagan on Thursday defended the code of conduct the Supreme Court created last year, but conceded there needs to be a way to enforce the rules for it to be more effective.
    

            “I think that the rules that we put out are good ones,” Kagan said at a judicial conference in Sacramento. “I think that the thing that can be criticized is, you know, rules usually have enforcement mechanisms attached to them. And this one, this set of rules does not.”

Supreme Court attempts to address ethics concerns with new code of conduct but leaves many questions unanswered


            After the Supreme Court came under intense scrutiny in 2023 following a series of blockbuster investigative pieces that turned a spotlight on the alleged ethical lapses of several of the justices, the nine justices released an ethics code in November in an attempt to assuage concerns raised by Democratic lawmakers and others that its members had no formal code of conduct they were required to adhere to.
    

            But notably absent from the code of conduct was an enforcement mechanism to hold justices accountable for any violations of the code, leading some court observers to regard it as a toothless Band-Aid for larger ethics issues that have dogged the court. The document leaves a wide range of decisions up to the discretion of individual justices, including decisions on recusal from sitting on cases.
    

            The comments were made during a wide-ranging conversation before an audience of judges and lawyers at the 9th US Circuit Judicial Conference, in response to a question from one of the event’s moderators.
    

            Kagan made the first public appearance of the nine justices since the court wrapped up a historic and contentious session earlier this month in which Kagan and her two liberal colleagues found themselves on the losing side of many of the biggest cases.
    

            Here’s a roundup of Kagan’s comments:
    

            Kagan on Thursday called criticism of the code of conduct “fair,” and went on to say that she thought the best enforcers of it for the Supreme Court would be lower-court judges, but not the justices themselves.
    

            “I can’t think of other people who should enforce a code of conduct … against judges. And I think it would be quite bad … for us to do it to each other,” she said. “In other words, for the same judges who are sitting around the table trying to decide cases, to be to be the people who are saying, ‘Oh, no, you broke that rule or you didn’t break that rule.’”

            In order to do this, Kagan suggests Chief Justice John Roberts look elsewhere in the federal judiciary.
    

            “I feel as though however hard it is that we could and should try to figure out some mechanism for doing this,” the liberal justice said. “I have a lot of trust and faith in the chief justice. You know, if the chief justice appointed some sort of committee of, you know, highly respected judges with a great deal of experience, with a reputation for fairness, you know, that seems like a good solution to me.”
    

            Kagan said that she was sharing only her own opinion.
    

            “I’m doing no intimating here,” she said, attempting to dismiss any speculation that she was revealing anything that the court was actively working on. “This is one person’s view and that’s all it is.”
    

            Kagan’s criticism of the court on Thursday was not limited to its new code of conduct. She also expressed frustration with the large number of concurrences her colleagues have been issuing in cases, which she described as “not a good thing for the court.”
    

            “It prevents us, I think, from giving the kind of guidance that lower courts have a right to expect, that the public has a right to expect. It muddies the waters of our decisions,” she said.

Takeaways from the Supreme Court’s decision upholding the domestic violence gun ban


            Kagan specifically pointed to the court’s decision in US v. Rahimi, a major Second Amendment case the court decided earlier this year in which the majority upheld a federal ban on domestic abusers having guns. Though the ruling was 8-1, with Roberts writing for the majority, a flurry of separate writings from many members of the court were also issued.
    

            “Everybody sort of tries to spin it one way or another way,” she said. “Often people use separate opinions to pre-decide issues that aren’t properly before the court and that, you know, may come before the court in a year or two and sort of to try to give signals as to how lower court should decide that, which I don’t think is right.”
    

            “There are definitely times where separate opinions make sense,” Kagan continued, noting that she wrote one this session. “I think all the time we’re in a position where we look at the majority opinion and we say, ‘Not the way I would have written it.’ But I think we should have a higher threshold for saying, ‘But it’s, you know, it will do. It’s OK enough, I agree with it enough. And the world doesn’t need to hear my separate thoughts on like a better opinion that could have been written.’”
    

            Kagan also made clear that she was growing impatient with the increased use of the court’s emergency docket, in which the court can issue unsigned and unexplained orders that allow the justices to act on a case while also shielding the legal analysis behind the decision and the vote count.


            Use of the emergency, or shadow, docket increased dramatically during the Trump administration, where the Justice Department used the docket to seek relief in cases that affect wide swaths of the country and that would have usually been decided by the justices following the normal process. Under President Joe Biden, GOP-led states and other private litigants have used the docket in challenges to various federal actions, often forcing the court to hear the merits of the disputes.
    

            “Because we granted a number of them and in the early years of the Trump administration, I think it encouraged people to keep bringing these kinds of petitions for emergency relief from us,” Kagan said.
    

            There are currently several matters pending on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket, including some challenging the Biden administration’s key student loan repayment program and the new rules issued by the Department of Education under Title IX, which prohibits sex discrimination in schools that receive federal funding.
    

            Those pending petitions, Kagan said, make the court work much more even as they have added fewer argued cases to their docket in recent years.
    

            “One of the great things about our calendar was that it was spaced out so that we would have a break before we sort of went back to the hothouse of decision making. And just the relentless, you know, bringing of these emergency petitions makes that not the case anymore,” she said.
    

            The justice went on to say that the court may have learned “a good lesson” this session when it agreed to hear oral argument in an abortion dispute that arose from its emergency docket only to later say it had improperly granted review in the matter.
    

            “And that may be as a good lesson for us to sort of say as to some of these emergency petitions, ‘No. Too soon, too early. Let the process play out,’” she said.
    

            Though Kagan and her two liberal colleagues eked out wins in disputes over abortion rights and a federal prohibition on domestic abusers having guns, they were left to pen dissents in cases concerning former President Donald Trump’s claims of presidential immunity, the power of federal agencies and whether cities can ticket homeless people for sleeping outside.

How the Supreme Court’s blockbuster ‘Chevron’ ruling puts countless regulations in jeopardy


            Kagan, who was appointed to the bench in 2010 by then-President Barack Obama, penned the dissent on behalf of her two liberal colleagues in the case this session that significantly curbed the power of federal agencies to approve regulations.
    

            Reading portions of her dissent from the bench last month, she denounced the “massive shock” that her conservative colleagues had delivered to a 40-year-old system in which courts gave deference to agencies when reviewing regulations for everything from the environment to public health and the workplace.
    

            On Thursday, she stressed that it’s unclear to her how the court’s overturning of the so-called Chevron precedent will play out in the coming years.
    

            ”So I think that there’s going to be a fair bit of instability, and there’s going to be some courts in some circumstances really putting a thumb on the scales for the agency, and others not,” she said.
    

            The Supreme Court has long been viewed as an institution above the usual deep division that exists in Washington, with justices on opposite ends of the ideological spectrum frequently touting their ability to maintain warm personal relationships.
    

            The late Justices Antonin Scalia, a conservative icon, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the court’s leading liberal for decades, famously enjoyed visiting the opera together and traveling together despite their deep disagreements about the law.
    

            But asked on Thursday whether she thought collegiality is important for the court, Kagan made clear that while she saw it as important, it shouldn’t ultimately matter to the public.
    

            Measuring how well the nine get along should not be in how often they go to the opera together, she reasoned.
    

            “I can’t imagine why the public should care if we go to the opera together, or we can talk about baseball together,” Kagan said.
    

            “What the public should care about is … if the collegiality brings about a certain kind of decision-making process. In other words, if it leads to people listening to each other in talking about the law and in talking about cases and making decisions,” Kagan said. “If it leads to people being able to step into each other’s shoes and see the world through another person’s eyes or see certain legal issues through a different perspective.”

159,CNN_91,San Diego Padres’ Dylan Cease throws second no-hitter in franchise history,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/sport/san-diego-padres-dylan-cease-no-hitter/index.html,"
            San Diego Padres pitcher Dylan Cease threw the second no-hitter in franchise history in the team’s 3-0 victory over the Nationals in Washington, DC, on Thursday.
    

            The 28-year-old struck out nine but walked three batters. He got Nationals All-Star shortstop CJ Abrams to fly out to right field to secure the no-hitter.
    

            After the final out, teammates mobbed Cease on the pitching mound to celebrate the momentous occasion.
    

            Cease threw 114 pitches, one over his season high.
    

            In a postgame interview, he said team manager Mike Shildt came over to him and said “nice job” while at 95 pitches. Cease then responded that he “felt great” and has thrown more pitches this season.
    

            “Thankfully they let me talk him (Shildt) into it, and here we are,” Cease continued with a smile on his face.
    

            Joe Musgrove threw the franchise’s first no-hitter in 2021.
    

            This is the second no-hitter this season, the first since Houston Astros’ Ronel Blanco threw one in April.
    

            Cease, who was traded to the Padres before the season from the Chicago White Sox, came into Thursday’s game with a 9-8 record and a 3.59 ERA.

159,WaPo_118,Dylan Cease no-hits the Nationals as Padres complete sweep,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/25/dylan-cease-padres-nationals-no-hitter/,"All no-hitters are improbable, but the one San Diego Padres’ right-hander Dylan Cease spun Thursday afternoon was especially unlikely at around 12:14 p.m. It was then that the skies opened over Nationals Park, a deluge that forced a 76-minute rain delay in the top of the first with the visitors in the midst of a three-run first inning.Cease had not yet thrown a pitch, but had already warmed up. Now, everything was on hold as the tarp was rolled onto the field. For Padres Manager Mike Shildt, a decision loomed: Did he transition to a bullpen game to be cautious with his starter’s health, or would he let Cease figure things out?Shildt stuck with his pitcher. Cease warmed up on a mound inside, under cover, managing his arm and biding time until the weather cleared. And three-and-a-half hours later, Cease completed just the second no-hitter in franchise history, methodically dismantling the Nationals in a 3-0 win to complete San Diego’s three-game sweep.Two years ago, Cease was one out from a no-hitter. This time, the ball with the best chance to drop was the last — a line drive from CJ Abrams off a fastball near triple digits, a rare pitch that the righty left over the plate, but one that found San Diego right fielder Bryce Johnson right in his tracks for the final out.“Think I had a little flashback right there,” Cease said. “Man, off the bat right there, it looked kind of like a bloop hit. I saw it stay up. Just screaming and yelling. That was awesome.”“Hit that — I guess hard, but not hard enough,” Abrams said.Cease was the first to celebrate, his index finger toward the sky as euphoria coalesced at the mound, catcher Luis Campusano the first to embrace the right-hander. Luis Arraez, who broke up the no-hit bid in 2022 and now plays for the Padres, was the one who handed Cease the ball from the final out.“Magnificent performance,” Shildt said. “Start of the game was interesting enough, gets hot, then has an hour 15 minute rain delay. … First inning, he comes in and says ‘I’m not quite there.' Second inning, ‘getting there.’ Third inning, he just hit his stride.”The no-hitter capped a dazzling run of starts for Cease, who has allowed just two hits over his past 22 innings. It also marked the second time the Nationals have been no-hit in franchise history. The first was Aug. 9, 2023, by the Phillies’ Michael Lorenzen.Cease, who was traded to San Diego (55-50) from the White Sox in a spring training blockbuster that sent three top Padres prospects to Chicago, avoided hard contact all afternoon, nibbling around the zone. He threw 114 pitches, 71 for strikes and struck out nine. He walked three.“He had to warm up as well and sit through a delay as well, so to sit through that plus the no hitter is pretty remarkable,” said Nationals lefty Patrick Corbin, who allowed three runs in seven innings.“I’ve been on both sides of no-hit, perfect games,” Nationals Manager Dave Martinez said. “This is the 10th one I’ve seen live. Every one, it’s something special.”The first rumblings of history coming cane in the fourth inning when one of the 20,755 in the crowd yelled from the upper deck behind home plate that Cease was throwing a no-hitter, a blatant attempt to jinx the 28-year-old. No such luck.After striking out Jacob Young with a 100 mph fastball to end the sixth, Cease spun toward the direction of his second baseman. After he was done watching Juan Yepez ground out to finish the seventh, he turned toward the dugout and spun his finger before shaking Shildt’s hand, making it all the more evident that he wanted to finish the game — but perhaps wouldn’t be given the shot, with lefty Adrian Morejon warming in the bullpen.Indeed, Sildt said after the game, the plan was to pull Cease after the frame. There was a debate. For only the second time in Shildt’s career, he was talked out of a decision to remove a starter.“Thankfully, they let me talk him into it,” Cease said. “And then, he we are.”Cease came back out for the eighth and needed just nine pitches to dispel James Wood (strikeout), Keibert Ruiz (groundout) and Luis García Jr. (groundout). As he returned to the dugout, he pumped his fist softly by his chest.Cease’s go-to pitch against the Nationals (47-56), just as it was when he one-hit them June 26, was his slider. In that previous start, the Nationals managed all of one hit. Thursday, they barely sniffed a knock. Abrams pulled a long fly out to right field in the fourth, but that needed another 10 feet to clear the wall. Ruiz nearly poked one through the infield in the eighth, but Xander Bogaearts corralled it, bobbled it, then narrowly got the Nationals’ slowest runner at first base.“His fastball’s got the ride and the slider bites, so he gets a lot of swing and miss or weak contact,” Abrams said. “You saw that today.”“In every no-hitter there are a couple of plays that save it,” Cease said. “I think there were a couple right there. Made it happen.”He struck out Wood three times, twice on a fastball and once on a slider. Only Lane Thomas and Abrams reached base, the former walking twice and the latter once. The Nationals scored in just one inning during the entire series — a three-run first Wednesday in what turned into a 12-3 loss. The team continues to struggle against strong sliders.“He kind of just picks around the plate,” Thomas said. “Props to him. Just a good day.”In the ninth, the Milton, Ga., native came out to applause from behind the visitors’ dugout, briefly allowing the umpires to check his glove. They didn’t find anything nefarious.And so Cease went to the rosin one final time for a bit more grip. Ildemaro Vargas made him work for an eight-pitch groundout, bringing his pitch count to 111, his dugout now at a standstill. Young grounded out on the next pitch and a roar went up inside the park. The Padres dugout clapped. Then Abrams slashed a liner to right that found Johnson’s glove. That fan who tried to jinx him back in the fourth? He was right — Cease had a no-hitter.“It’ll set in even more as time goes,” Cease said. “But I’ve been close, and to finally get it done, it’s one of those things that’s just — it feels so remarkable and hard to believe. To be able to do it and go out and experience it, I really don’t even know how to feel, I’m just happy.”Notes: Before Thursday’s game, the Nationals signed second-rounder Luke Dickerson, a high school shortstop from New Jersey, to a $3.8 million bonus, a pool-era record for a player drafted in the second round or later. The slot value for his pick, No. 44, is $2,122,200 — he signed for roughly the equivalent value of pick No. 22 ($3.802 million). Because Washington traded for pick No. 39 in the Hunter Harvey deal, the Nationals had more bonus pool money to work with, and therefore could negotiate to pay well over slot value for a player they regarded highly.The Nationals have signed 19 of their 21 picks, with only Florida State righty Yoel Tejeda Jr. (14th round) and Florida third baseman Colby Shelton (20th) left. The deadline to sign picks is 5 p.m. Aug. 1."

It was only 3 percent contained as of Thursday morning. Temperatures in the area were expected to top 100 degrees in the afternoon.Fire personnel are “focusing on evacuations and structure defense” while “building direct containment lines,” the Butte County Fire Department said. The cause of the fire is under investigation, and an evacuation center has been set up in Chico, according to Cal Fire.While there have been no official reports of structures burned, video shows at least one home in flames amid what appears to be a leaking gas line.Butte County has endured an active fire season this year. Earlier this month, more than two dozen structures in the county were destroyed as the Thompson Fire burned more than 3,700 acres. And several other wildfires have been reported in the county, including the Junes Fire, which burned more than 1,000 acres in June.Jamie Grettum, a Salesforce instructor, lives in Chico and said she could see plumes of smoke all afternoon from her neighborhood. Wednesday evening, she joined hundreds of locals at a nearby park to watch the fire on the horizon and get a sense for “how nervous we need to be right now,” she told The Washington Post.Chico is less than 15 miles west of Paradise, which was ravaged by the Camp Fire, the deadliest fire in California’s history, in 2018. Grettum said she could sense the anxiety in the air on Wednesday night. “We know for sure we’re standing out there with survivors of that,” she said, referring to the Camp Fire. “It was tense and silent and sad.”Grettum is also a wildfire survivor — the 2007 Witch Fire burned down her neighborhood in San Diego County. On Wednesday, she was “doing a little mental checklist” of what to take with her if she has to evacuate, she said. “When you’re packing and evacuating, you never think your house will burn. … I know better than that now.”"

Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) announced Tuesday that he plans to resign effective Aug. 20, creating a Senate vacancy in the wake of his federal bribery conviction.New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) subsequently said he plans to exercise his duty as the state’s governor to make a temporary appointment to fill the Senate vacancy “to ensure the people of New Jersey have the representation they deserve.”At a news conference on Wednesday, the governor called Menendez’s resignation “a sad end to what was a very productive career in public service.”Senate resignations stemming from ethical scandals are rare. Only a handful of other senators have left the chamber in the post-World War II era under clouds of misconduct, the most recent being Al Franken (D-Minn.) in 2017.Now, Murphy must pick an appointee to fill the position until Jan. 3 — the end of Menendez’s Senate term. Here are some of the prospective candidates who have been floated to temporarily replace Menendez in the Senate.In June, Kim won the Senate Democratic primary for Menendez’s seat. If Kim wins in November, he will replace Menendez in the Senate for a full term beginning in 2025.Kim, a former State Department official who joined the House in 2019, has indicated that he would accept the temporary appointment to the Senate if the governor asks. But the Republican candidate running against Kim in the Senate race, Curtis Bashaw, has urged Murphy to “appoint a caretaker to this seat, as is the long-standing New Jersey tradition, and not give either [Senate] candidate the advantage of incumbency in this election.”Kim’s potential appointment is also complicated by the fact that he ran in the competitive Senate Democratic primary against the governor’s wife, Tammy Murphy.Tammy Murphy, who dropped out of the Senate race before primary votes were cast, has also taken herself out of consideration for the temporary Senate appointment.Way was appointed by Murphy to be the state’s lieutenant governor in 2023, one month after the death of then-Lt. Gov. Sheila Oliver. She is also New Jersey’s secretary of state.She previously was an administrative law judge for the state of New Jersey. Among her other local New Jersey government roles, in 2006 Way was elected to the Passaic County Board of Chosen Freeholders — the state’s precursor to what are now referred to as county commissioners.Campos-Medina is a labor activist who serves as executive director of the Worker Institute at Cornell University. She told Politico that she would be willing to serve if the governor asked.As one of the Democratic candidates who ran in the Senate primary in New Jersey. she came in second in the race, after Kim, with 16 percent of the vote.Salas, who was appointed to her current role in 2011, was floated as a potential Senate contender last year. She’s a former Hispanic Bar Association of New Jersey president and federal magistrate judge.In 2020, Salas and her family were the target of an attack at their home by a self-declared men’s rights activist who had filed a case before Salas. Her son was killed and her husband was critically wounded in the attack. Following the incident, Salas called for tighter restrictions on the personal information of judges.Wells was New Jersey’s secretary of state from 2006 to 2010 under then-Gov. Jon Corzine (D). She is married to Ted Wells, a prominent defense attorney who has mentored House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.).Watson Coleman has been in Congress since 2015 and, before that, she served in the New Jersey General Assembly.When asked about the prospect of the Senate appointment, Watson Coleman’s spokesperson, Mike Shanahan, told the New York Times that she “would gladly continue to serve New Jersey in whatever capacity is asked of her.” But Shanahan added that the congresswoman “doesn’t expect that call.”"

0,NBC_1,2 dead in listeria outbreak likely linked to sliced deli meats,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/2-dead-listeria-outbreak-likely-linked-sliced-deli-meats-rcna162808,"Two people have died in a listeria outbreak across 12 states in the U.S. that is likely linked to sliced deli meats, according to the CDC. 
In total, 28 people have been infected and hospitalized with the disease as of Friday in an outbreak that began in May, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The listeria infections have been reported in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts. 
The two deaths were reported in Illinois and New Jersey, according to the CDC. The agency also noted that one pregnant woman got sick with listeria and remained pregnant after she recovered. 
People who got sick reported to state and local officials that they ate ""a variety of meats sliced at deli counters"" in the month before they got sick. Officials interviewed 18 people, 16 of whom said they ate meats sliced at a deli, and found they most commonly ate turkey, liverwurst and ham. The sliced meats from deli counters came from a variety of supermarket and grocery story delis, according to the CDC. 
The CDC said it is comparing foods people who were infected ate in this outbreak to foods people ate who got sick with listeria but were not part of an outbreak, and found that the people in this outbreak were ""more likely to eat deli-sliced turkey and liverwurst."" 
""This information suggests that meats sliced at the deli are a likely source of this outbreak,"" the CDC said. ""However, at this time CDC doesn’t have enough information to say which deli meats are the source of this outbreak.""
There is no information that shows people are getting listeria from prepackaged deli meats, the CDC said. 
The agency noted that the true number of those infected in this outbreak is likely higher than the reported number and that the outbreak could be occurring in additional states with no known illnesses. 
That's because some people recover from listeria without any medical care and are therefore never tested for the illness, the CDC said, adding that recent illnesses may not have been reported because it takes three-to-four weeks to determine if someone with listeria is part of an outbreak. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service is working to identify the supplier of the deli meats that were then sliced at grocery store deli counters and purchased by people who were sick in this outbreak, the CDC said. 
The CDC recommends avoiding eating deli meats sliced at a deli counter unless they are heated before eating and advises people who or pregnant, aged 65 or older or have a weakened immune system to contact their doctor if they have any listeria symptoms, which can include fever, flu-like symptoms, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and seizures.

0,WaPo_26,Two dead in listeria outbreak linked to deli meat. Here’s what to know.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/07/20/listeria-deli-meat-states-lunch-meat/,"At least two people in the United States have died in connection with a listeria outbreak linked to meat sliced at deli counters, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of Friday, 28 cases had been recorded in 12 states since the end of May.However, “the true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely higher than the number reported,” the CDC said in its investigation report. “... This is because some people recover without medical care and are not tested for Listeria.”Here’s what to know about the bacteria and the latest outbreak.The CDC is aware of 28 people infected with the strain of listeria in the outbreak, from a dozen states: New York (7 cases); Maryland (6); Virginia (2); New Jersey (2); Massachusetts (2); Georgia (2); Missouri (2); Illinois (1); Pennsylvania (1); North Carolina (1); Wisconsin (1); Minnesota (1). They had a median age of 75.It added that the outbreak “may not be limited to the states with known illnesses.” Samples from those infected were collected between May 29 and July 5, and “recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak,” the agency said.Of the two known deaths, one was in Illinois and the other in New Jersey.Many people affected by the outbreak reported to the CDC that they had eaten meat they had sliced at deli counters, at a range of supermarkets and delis.Investigators are still working to determine the specific products that may be contaminated, the agency said Friday. It noted that the most commonly consumed meats were turkey, liverwurst and ham but that there was not enough information to say which deli meats were behind the outbreak.It said there was no evidence to date that people were getting sick from prepackaged deli meats.Listeria is the infection usually caused by eating food contaminated with the Listeria monocytogenes bacterium. While the bacteria are common — living in moist environments, soil, water, decaying vegetation and animals — the infection is rare. It most often occurs in humans through food contamination. People who are pregnant, adults 65 and older, newborns and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk of falling seriously ill from a listeria infection.Foods that are more likely to be contaminated include soft cheeses; premade deli salads; unheated deli meat, cold cuts, hot dogs and fermented or dry sausages; refrigerated pate or meat spreads; cold-smoked fish; raw milk products; sprouts and melons.The first and most common symptoms of listeria infection are diarrhea and vomiting. Those typically begin within 24 hours of eating food contaminated with listeria and usually last one to three days. While unpleasant, these symptoms are not usually considered life-threatening.In serious cases, the bacteria spreads beyond the intestines and is classified as an invasive illness. These symptoms usually start within two weeks. They include fever, flu-like symptoms such as muscle aches and fatigue, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and seizures.About 1 in 6 people with invasive listeriosis who are not pregnant die, according to the CDC. It is the third-leading cause of death from foodborne illness in the United States.Although not typically fatal, invasive illness during pregnancy usually leads to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery or a life-threatening infection for the newborn.Anyone experiencing listeria symptoms should contact a health-care provider.For those at higher risk, the CDC recommends not eating meat that has been sliced at a deli counter unless it is reheated to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit or until steaming hot just before serving.Listeria can also grow on foods kept in the refrigerator and is killed by heating food to a high enough temperature. Recommended practices include cleaning refrigerators, containers and surfaces that may have touched sliced deli meat.Delicatessens should follow Agriculture Department guidelines on controlling listeria."
1,NBC_2,Missouri woman who served 43 years in prison freed after murder conviction overturned,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sandra-hemme-case-woman-served-43-years-prison-freed-conviction-overtu-rcna162813,"CHILLICOTHE, Mo. —  A woman whose murder conviction was overturned after she served 43 years in prison was released Friday, after Missouri’s attorney general fought for more than a month to keep her behind bars.
Sandra Hemme, 63, left prison Friday in Chillicothe, hours after a judge threatened to hold the attorney general’s office in contempt if they continued to fight against her release. She reunited with her family at a nearby park, where she hugged her daughter and granddaughter. Her sister, Joyce Ann Kays, was all grins.
The judge originally ruled on June 14 that Hemme’s attorneys had established “clear and convincing evidence” of “actual innocence” and overturned the conviction. But Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey fought her release in the courts.
During a court hearing Friday, Judge Ryan Horsman said that if Hemme wasn’t released by a designated time, he wanted Bailey himself to appear in court Tuesday morning, and he threatened to hold the attorney general’s office in contempt.
He also scolded Bailey’s office for calling the warden and telling prison officials not to release Hemme after an appeals court panel said she could be released. “I would suggest you never do that,” Horsman said, adding: “To call someone and tell them to disregard a court order is wrong.”
The Missouri Corrections Department then confirmed Hemme, whose been in prison for 43 years, would be released before 6 p.m. CDT Friday.
Two of Hemme’s relatives were in court Friday but declined to talk after the hearing. The rest of her family members were with Hemme’s father, who was hospitalized with kidney failure and moved to palliative care. “He wants only to see his daughter free in his lifetime, just as Ms. Hemme wants nothing more than to be at her father’s bedside at this time,” Hemme’s attorney, Sean O’Brien, said in a court filing Thursday.
He added that further delay was causing their family “irreparable harm and emotional distress.”
After she is released, “she is going right to her father,” O’Brien said after Friday’s court hearing. “This has been a long time coming.”
Over the last month, a circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court all agreed Hemme should be released, but she was still held behind bars, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.
“I’ve never seen it,” said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor and dean emeritus of Saint Louis University Law School. “Once the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.”
The lone holdup to freedom came from the attorney general, who has filed court actions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases. The warden at the Chillicothe Correctional Center has declined to let Hemme go, based on Bailey’s actions.
Horsman ruled on June 14 that “the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.” A state appeals court ruled on July 8 that Hemme should be set free while it continued to review the case. The Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday declined to undo the lower court rulings that allowed her to be released on her own recognizance and placed with her sister and brother-in-law.
Bailey, a Republican facing opposition in the Aug. 6 primary election, responded with another request late Thursday, asking the Circuit Court to reconsider.
Hemme was serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri.
She’s been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project.
Hemme’s immediate freedom was complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for “offering to commit violence.” Bailey had argued that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and that she should start serving those sentences now.
Her attorneys countered that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a “draconian outcome.”
Some legal experts agreed.
Peter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison was “a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,” since evidence strongly suggests she didn’t commit the crime.
Bailey’s office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday.
Bailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.
Horsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a “malleable mental state” when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as “often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.” Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.
The St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman — a fellow officer, who died in 2015 — and the prosecution wasn’t told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.
Evidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman’s pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke’s apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.
Horsman, in his report, called Hemme “the victim of a manifest injustice.”"

Chillicothe, Missouri (AP) – A woman whose murder conviction was overturned after she served 43 years of a life sentence was released Friday, despite attempts in the last month by Missouri’s attorney general to keep her behind bars.
    

            Sandra Hemme, 64, left a prison in Chillicothe, hours after a judge threatened to hold the attorney general’s office in contempt if they continued to fight against her release. She reunited with her family at a nearby park, where she hugged her sister, daughter and granddaughter.
    

            “You were just a baby when your mom sent me a picture of you,” she said. “You looked just like your mamma when you were little and you still look like her.”
    

            Her granddaughter laughed. “I get that a lot.”

            Hemme had been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project. The judge originally ruled on June 14 that Hemme’s attorneys had established “clear and convincing evidence” of “actual innocence” and he overturned her conviction. But Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey fought her release in the courts.
    

            “It was too easy to convict an innocent person and way harder than it should have been to get her out, even to the point of court orders being ignored,” her attorney Sean O’Brien said. “It shouldn’t be this hard to free an innocent person.”
    

            During a court hearing Friday, Judge Ryan Horsman said that if Hemme wasn’t released within hours, Bailey himself would have to appear in court Tuesday morning. He threatened to hold the attorney general’s office in contempt.

            Hemme declined to address reporters after she was released. O’Brien said she was going straight to the side of her father, who was hospitalized with kidney failure and recently moved to palliative care. ”This has been a long time coming,” he said of her release.
    

            O’Brien said previously that delays had caused their family “irreparable harm and emotional distress.”
    

            There are still struggles ahead.
    

            “She’s going to need help,” he said, noting she won’t be eligible for social security because she has been incarcerated for so long.
    

            Over the last month, a circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court all agreed Hemme should be released, but she was still held behind bars, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.

In the wake of attempts by some in the media to portray vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance as extreme, conservatives on social media insisted that the Washington Post's worry that the Republican is an ""anti-woke"" warrior could actually be a massive endorsement of the lawmaker. 
The Post's headline on Friday read, ""Leaked memo shows J.D. Vance’s anti-woke ideology on foreign affairs."" Vance himself joked about it on X, writing, ""They got me."" 
The paper's National Security reporter John Hudson authored a piece detailing how Sen. Vance would move to block U.S. State Department nominees from being confirmed if they were shown to be proponents of radical left ideology. The piece seemed to galvanize conservative support for Vance, at least on X.
""The Washington Post didn't have to sell J.D. Vance to me like this, because I already liked him before they got these leaked memos showing how truly based he is,"" conservative journalist Ian Miles Cheong remarked in an X post about the new article.

Hudson’s article described how, as a senator, Vance became ""known in the most powerful offices of the State Department as the single biggest obstacle to confirming career ambassadors in the Senate.""
The reporter explained how Vance would go about holding up these diplomats in their appointments, stating that he would ask them to fill out a ""a questionnaire on hot-button social issues about gay and lesbian rights, gender transition care and hiring practices related to diversity, equity and inclusion."" 
Many of those who revealed their left-wing bent in their answers to this questionnaire were held up for ""more than a year"" in attaining their positions at the State Department. 
Hudson stated that his outlet obtained a copy of this questionnaire, and shared some of the specific questions that were featured on it. 
He wrote that it ""asked would-be ambassadors if they would increase the number of ‘gender-neutral bathrooms’ in U.S. embassies, boost resources for ‘gender dysphoria and gender transition care’ and raise the ‘Progress flag’ during ‘regional Pride celebrations.’""
The reporter noted that Vance’s office did not respond to their request for comment, though the vice-presidential nominee did provide a sarcastic remark on social media. 
""They got me,"" Vance wrote on X Saturday afternoon.

The piece prompted a wave of mockery online and ginned up support for the lawmaker’s anti-woke conduct. 
New York Post reporter Lydia Moynihan joked, ""I don’t think this is the bombshell report that will alienate independents the Washington Post thinks it is.""
Conservative commentator Joey Mannarino addressed Vance, posting, ""Thank you for standing against WOKE.""

            Sheila Jackson Lee, a longtime Democratic congresswoman from Texas who was an outspoken advocate for Black Americans for decades, has died, according to a statement from her office. She was 74.
    

This is a developing story and will be updated.

43,WaPo_23,"Sheila Jackson Lee, outspoken Texas congresswoman, dies at 74",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/07/19/sheila-jackson-lee-congresswoman-dead/,"Sheila Jackson Lee, a Texas Democrat who during three decades in the U.S. House of Representatives became one of the most prominent Black members of Congress and a ubiquitous champion of African American and women’s rights, died July 19 at a hospital in Houston. She was 74.Her death was confirmed by her family. Rep. Jackson Lee announced in June that she had pancreatic cancer. She had been treated years earlier for breast cancer.Rep. Jackson Lee, the daughter of a hospital orderly and a night-shift vocational nurse, grew up far from Texas, in the New York City borough of Queens. She received a bachelor’s degree from Yale University and a law degree from the University of Virginia before moving with her husband to Texas, where he was from, and where she began her political career as a municipal judge and a member of the Houston City Council.She was first elected in 1994 to her Houston-based congressional seat, which was once held by the charismatic African American congresswoman Barbara Jordan. Rep. Jackson Lee quickly established herself as an outspoken advocate for racial and gender equality, voting rights and the revision of the criminal justice system.She was a lead sponsor of legislation that in 2021, after decades of lobbying by advocates, recognized as a federal holiday June 19, or Juneteenth, a date that has come to memorialize the end of slavery in the United States.She also spearheaded legislation that in 2022 reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act, which was enacted in 1994 but expired in 2019. The original law provided protections for women against domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking. Under Rep. Jackson Lee’s leadership, it was expanded, among other ways, to specifically address Native American, transgender and immigrant women.Critics accused Rep. Jackson Lee of drawing attention to herself, in addition to her causes. She offered dizzying arrays of amendments that had little to no chance of passing and, according to C-SPAN data, was among the members who spent the most time speaking on the House floor, including when the chamber was empty.At the annual State of the Union address, she made it her practice to arrive hours in advance to secure an aisle seat from which to be seen on TV interacting with the president as he made his way to and from the podium.Also complicating Rep. Jackson’s Lee reputation were accounts of her mistreatment of staff members, whom she reportedly required to chauffeur her around Washington, dispatched on personal errands, phoned after midnight and scolded harshly for what she regarded as their shortcomings.Her office was known for having one of the highest turnover rates on Capitol Hill. In 2023, during an unsuccessful run for mayor of Houston, she expressed regret when a recording emerged of her insulting her campaign staff in a profanity-laced tirade.Rep. Jackson Lee said she attempted to ignore the criticism aimed at her and attributed it, at least in part, to sexism and racism.“I have been in the skin of a woman and an African-American, and I understand the injustices we have to live through,” she told the Texas Tribune in 2017. She added, “I just take it with a smile because I love the institution” of Congress.Politicians are often labeled, fairly or unfairly, as “workhorses” or “showhorses.” In many estimations, Rep. Jackson Lee fell squarely in the latter category. Robert Stein, a professor of political science at Rice University in Houston who followed Rep. Jackson Lee’s career for decades, said she was a “showhorse” — but not in a negative way.“She was a showhorse for the causes she cared about,” Stein said, also remarking that “she staked out a career in the Congress that I think suited her and her abilities.”In response to criticism that Rep. Jackson Lee was a publicity-seeking politician who demanded too much of her staff, Stein cited what he described as a double standard for men and women in politics. “If this was a White male, we would have said he was a great politician,” he said. “When she’s a Black woman from [Queens] who moves to Houston — nobody ever gave her a break.”Admirers lauded Rep. Jackson Lee for pushing causes that she believed in even when she was unlikely to see them prevail. Foremost among those causes was the campaign to obtain reparations for African Americans as a means of redressing the enduring consequences of slavery.In 2021, Rep. Jackson Lee successfully pushed H.R. 40, a bill to create a commission on the matter of reparations, through the Judiciary Committee. That committee vote was as far as the proposal had advanced on Capitol Hill since then-congressman John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) began advocating reparations more than three decades earlier.“We’re asking for people to understand the pain, the violence, the brutality, the chattel-ness of what we went through,” Rep. Jackson Lee said. “And, of course, we’re asking for harmony, reconciliation, reason to come together as Americans.”Within the House, Rep. Jackson Lee served as chief deputy Democratic whip and was a member of the Homeland Security and Budget committees in addition to the Judiciary Committee.Back in her district, she was known as a consummate politician, always on hand for weddings and funerals.Rep. Jackson Lee took pride in her reputation for showing up, whether at local gatherings or the State of the Union address. It was her job, she said, to represent her constituents as forcefully as she could.In 2009, when President Barack Obama made his first address to a joint session of Congress, Rep. Jackson Lee was ready when the transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, appeared in the chamber.“As he walked down the aisle, I made the final push for Houston being in the president’s budget … and for Houston being the first city that Secretary LaHood visited, and what were the results? We got in the president’s ’09 budget … and he made our city the first city to visit,” Rep. Jackson Lee told the Texas Tribune. “I hosted him the entire day.”Sheila Jackson, one of two children, was born in Queens on Jan. 12, 1950.Her father had been an artist for Marvel Comics in the 1940s, but he lost his job when White colleagues returned to theirs after serving in World War II, according to the Houston Chronicle. He later worked as a day laborer and as a hospital orderly. Her mother cared for premature babies at a hospital affiliated with the Salvation Army.Rep. Jackson Lee attended New York City public schools as they started to desegregate in the 1950s and ’60s. She was bused to predominantly White schools, she recounted, where she overcame discrimination to become involved in student government.Her junior year, she ran for student council vice president but was elected secretary, a position that she assumed her classmates deemed more appropriate for a female student, she told the Chronicle.She did not know if she would have the opportunity to attend college until she received a scholarship established at New York University for Black students after the 1968 assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.Years later, reflecting on the tragedy that made it possible to pursue her education, she told the New York Times that she was a beneficiary of the “hills and valleys, the broken bodies and broken hearts, the loss of life of many who have gone on before me.”She later transferred to Yale, where she studied political science and graduated in 1972, and where she met her future husband, Elwyn Lee, whom she married the next year. She received her law degree from the University of Virginia in 1975.The couple resided for three years in Washington, where she worked for the House Select Committee on Assassinations, convened to investigate King’s death and the slaying of President John F. Kennedy in 1963.Rep. Jackson Lee and her husband then moved to Houston, where she practiced law and mounted three unsuccessful races for local judgeships. She received an appointment to the municipal bench before winning an at-large seat on the Houston City Council in 1989.In 1994, she challenged Rep. Craig Washington (D), elected in 1989 to fill the seat left vacant when Rep. Mickey Leland (D) was killed in a plane crash in Ethiopia. Rep. Jackson Lee defeated Washington, 63 percent to 37 percent in the primary, then easily won the general election in her highly Democratic district.Upon her election to the House, Rep. Jackson Lee was awarded a seat on the Judiciary Committee, which under Republican leadership voted, along party lines, to support the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998. Clinton was accused of lying under oath about his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.Rep. Jackson Lee was one of Clinton’s most ardent defenders, remarking that “I know oppression when I see it” and denouncing Clinton’s impeachment trial in the Senate as “a sledgehammer to catch a fly.” He was acquitted in 1999.In 2019, Rep. Jackson Lee stepped down as chairman of a Judiciary subcommittee and as chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation amid accusations that she fired an aide who had also worked for the foundation and who threatened to sue the foundation over an alleged sexual assault by a supervisor.Rep. Jackson Lee denied having retaliated against the woman and was reinstated in 2021 as chairman of the subcommittee on crime, terrorism and homeland security.In her 2023 run for Houston mayor, the nation’s fourth-largest city by population, Rep. Jackson Lee had the endorsements of former president Clinton and his wife, Hillary Clinton, but she was soundly defeated in a nonpartisan runoff by a longtime Democratic state senator, John Whitmire, who attracted support from centrist Democrats, Republicans and independents with an emphasis on public safety.In the 2024 congressional election, Rep. Jackson Lee defeated a Democratic challenger, former Houston City Council member Amanda Edwards, in the March primary.Survivors include her husband, of Houston; two children, Jason Lee of Chicago and Erica Carter of Houston; a brother; and two grandchildren.Reflecting on the forceful approach she took to work on behalf of her constituents and causes, Rep.

            What could be “the largest IT outage in history” has disrupted sectors across the globe – leaving thousands of passengers stranded at airports, emergency communication services down and blood donation centers without vital shipments.
    

            Airlines, businesses, government agencies, health and emergency services, banks and schools and universities around the world ground to a halt or saw services disrupted due to a flawed software update for Microsoft Windows operating systems issued by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, experts told CNN. CrowdStrike’s CEO said a fix has been deployed, but experts say getting systems back in order will be a lengthy process.
    

            As of early Saturday, hundreds of flights flights into, out of or within the United States were  canceled or delayed. The day before, more than 3,000 flights had been canceled and more than 11,000 delayed, according to FlightAware.com.
    

            All flights were grounded for United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Allegiant Airlines on Friday. Airlines later announced they were resolving issues and resuming flights.
    

            Frustrated passengers lined up at airports backed up with flight cancellations and delays, missing life events like funerals and birthdays.

Global tech outage: What to know if you’re traveling this weekend


            After spending more than 19 hours at Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, one passenger won’t be getting home to Los Angeles anytime soon.
    

            “I couldn’t get another flight rebooked because the system is down, so I couldn’t get any vouchers for food, hotel, nothing,” Kiah Hampton told CNN on Friday afternoon.
    

            Hampton described sleeping on the floor at the airport after a previous flight was canceled last night, adding, “It seems like I am going to have to sleep here tonight.”
    

            New Jersey resident Jennifer Small likewise slept at the airport overnight and had her flight canceled twice.
    

            “I want to get home to my son. I want to get home to Jersey,” Small said, adding she doesn’t believe she will be able to travel home until Saturday.
    

            Thousands of people crammed together in airports across the country, waiting for answers. Passengers Ty Kelley, who was traveling to Philadelphia to attend a funeral, described it as a chaotic scene.
    

            “It’s wild, it’s crazy, it’s crowded — I have anxiety right now,” she said. “I’m going to wait in this long line and try and get to Philadelphia today.”
    

            Another passenger told CNN she had been traveling with her toddler to Boston for a birthday party. “It has been frustrating to say the least,” Spirit Airlines customer Miya Haney said.
    

            The issues didn’t just plague airports. Americans felt the impacts of the outage in various facets of their everyday lives, including while trying to call 911 during emergencies in some areas, getting or renewing their driver’s licenses or shipping or receiving packages.
    

            There have been reports of 911 outages in various states, like Alaska, and cities, like Phoenix, where the system was down for hours but has since been restored. Meanwhile, in New York City, 911 services are working.
    

Driver’s license offices are closed or have limited services in Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina and Georgia because of the ongoing outages.
    

            Shipping companies, namely UPS and FedEx, are warning customers there may be some service delays Friday because of the tech outage.
    

            Meanwhile, thousands of companies around the world are struggling with payment processing after the outage brought down systems across a wide range of businesses. The ongoing is also impacting major hotels, including Marriott International and some Hilton hotels.
    

            Cybercriminals are already capitalizing on the chaos by promoting fake websites filled with malicious software designed to compromise unsuspecting victims, according to warnings from the US government and multiple cybersecurity professionals.
    

            Former McAfee CEO Dave DeWalt told CNN that a group of private sector and government agencies worked overnight to “ascertain the threat” and find a solution to the global outage. The call included the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and other private and government organizations.
    

            CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz apologized to customers Friday for the outage and said the company is working with those affected.
    

            “We understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption,” Kurtz posted on X. “We are working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on.”
    

            But that could be easier said than done: Manual restarts of individual systems take time and expertise that some customers don’t have, which is why companies are slow to recover from the outage.
    

            CrowdStrike promised customers “full transparency” on how the outage occurred and that it will “prevent anything like this from happening again.”
    

            While most hospitals remained open to treat medical emergencies, some said an inability to access electronic medical records and order lab tests and prescriptions had caused them to cancel patient appointments and surgeries.
    

            Hospital workers have scrambled to provide needed care to patients without the technology they rely on.
    

            Kim Brown was near the end of her shift Thursday night as a labor and delivery nurse at Kaiser Permanente in San Jose, California, when the hospital’s computer systems, which it relies on to care for women in labor and their babies, went down.
    

            “All of our babies get little plastic tags that will set off an alarm if they get too close to an exit or an elevator. That went down,” Brown said. “It was unnerving because we had zero information. It was just, ‘Oh, well, everything’s out now.’“
    

            With the outage posing a security risk to newborn babies, the hospital called security guards to sit by the elevators to keep them safe.
    

            At the postpartum care unit in Dignity Health California Hospital Medical Center in Los Angeles, nurse Laura Topete said she ran into a roadblock trying to get analgesic drugs for a woman who was in pain after delivery, but couldn’t access the doctor’s orders to see what kind of medications she could have.
    

            “The patient was in pain longer than she needed to be,” Topete said.
    

            Epic Systems, a company that makes widely used electronic health records systems for hospitals and doctors’ offices, said on Friday that its Nebula cloud-based platform had been impacted by the outage overnight and that some services, including telehealth visits, were not available during the outage. Another electronic medical records company, Veradigm, also said its systems were impacted by the CrowdStrike outage.
    

            A spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services said it is “working to assess the impact of the Crowdstrike outage on patient care and HHS systems, services, and operations,” along with federal, state, local and private sector partners.
    

            In addition to hospitals, blood donation centers have experienced challenges and are altering blood shipment methods due to flight delays. New York Blood Center, which supplies about 200 hospitals in the Northeast, initiated an emergency driving operation to distribute collected blood. And Blood Assurance was concerned for its planned shipment of at least 20 platelets — the disc-shaped fragments that help with clotting — due to flight issues.
    

            The impacts of the global tech outage were felt across the US as countless government agencies waited for services to get back to normal.
    

            The mayor of Portland, Oregon, issued an emergency declaration due to the ongoing outage. It affected the city’s servers in city data centers, employee computers and single sign-on to cloud services, Mayor Ted Wheeler said in a news release.
    

            In Southern California, the disruption is causing connectivity issues at the Los Angeles County Superior Court and it temporarily limited jail bookings in San Diego County, officials said.

            Elsewhere, some voting locations in Arizona experienced outages in Maricopa County as early voting continues in the state’s primary, according to the Maricopa County Elections Department. The county is the fourth-most populous in the US and is home to Phoenix, the county website said.
    

            The governor of New York described impacts of the outage on transportation links and health care facilities as an “unprecedented situation.” The state’s top priority, however, is emergency services.
    

            “We are working with localities to ensure that 911 systems are operational,” Gov. Kathy Hochul said. The 911 system is working in all 62 state counties, according to Hochul.
    

            On a federal level, the United States Customs and Border Protection experienced “processing delays” that may lead to longer wait times at US ports of entry. CBP said it is working to restore its systems to full capacity and mitigate impacts on its operations as well as on international trade and travel, a spokesperson said Friday.
    

            The Social Security Administration closed its local offices to the public on Friday after the outage shut down numerous services. The agency said in a statement that it expects longer wait times for the national 800 phone number, and some online services may be unavailable.
    

            The US Department of Justice said in a memo that it is searching for workarounds but warned staff that the CrowdStrike issue “is significant and there is currently no estimated restoration time.”

61,CNN_50,"At least 3 killed and 87 injured, Houthis say, as Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen day after Tel Aviv drone attack",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/middleeast/yemen-israel-strikes-hodeidah-intl/index.html,"
Israeli airstrikes targeted Houthi rebels in Yemen a day after the Iran-backed group claimed a deadly attack on the Israeli city of Tel Aviv.
    

            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its fighter jets struck “military targets of the Houthi terrorist regime” in the area of Yemen’s Hodeidah Port on Saturday in what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said was a direct response to the death of a 50-year-old Israeli in a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv Friday.
    

            This is the first time Israel has struck Yemen, according to Israeli officials.
    

            The Houthi-run Al Masirah TV said the Israeli strikes targeted oil facilities in the port on Yemen’s west coast, killing at least three people and injuring 87, most of them with “severe burns.”
    

Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam said the strikes had also hit civilian targets and a power station. He slammed what he said was “brutal Israeli aggression” aimed at increasing the “suffering of the people of Yemen” and pressuring it to stop its support of Gaza.
    

            Houthi army spokesperson Yehya Saree vowed to respond to the strike, saying the Houthis would not hesitate to strike Israel’s “vital targets” and warning that Tel Aviv was still not safe.
    

            “We have prepared for a long war with this enemy until the aggression stops and the blockade on the Palestinian people is lifted,” Saree said.
    

            Netanyahu said in a statement on Saturday that Hodeidah was “not an innocent port.”
    

            “It was used for military purposes, it was used as an entry point for deadly weapons supplied to the Houthis by Iran,” Netanyahu said, adding that Hodeidah had also been used to attack international shipping in the Red Sea.
    

            Netanyahu also said the operation, which hit targets 1,800 km (1,118 miles) from Israel’s borders, shows the enemy Israel is serious about responding to threats.
    

            “It makes it clear to our enemies that there is no place that the long arm of the state of Israel will not reach,” Netanyahu said.
    

            IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said the strikes were also in response to the roughly 200 projectiles the rebel group has fired towards Israel since October, when Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza began.

Israel investigates security failures around deadly Tel Aviv drone strike


            Since the start of the war, the Yemeni rebels have regularly targeted the country with drones and missiles, most of which have been intercepted by Israel’s defenses or those of its allies. However, the Houthis have claimed their drone attack in Tel Aviv Friday – which also injured 10 people – was performed by a new drone capable of “bypassing the enemy’s interception systems.”
    

            The Houthis have also regularly attacked US targets and commercial shipping in the Red Sea.
    

            Both the UK and the US have responded to the attacks on shipping by carrying out strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. However, Israel has not taken part in those responses.
    

            An Israeli defense official told CNN that this was a 100% Israeli strike. The official said Israel had previously let the US and UK take the lead on responding to Houthi attacks but decided to respond itself this time because of the death of the Israeli citizen in Tel Aviv.
    

            According to the official, Israeli Defense Minister Gallant informed US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin before the strike was carried out.
    

            The defense official added that Israel was able to strike so quickly because it had been preparing for this scenario for months.
    

            A White House official said US President Joe Biden had been briefed on “developments” in the Middle East. A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said the US had not coordinated with Israel on the airstrikes, but added that the US fully recognizes “Israel’s right to self-defense.”
    

            The Houthi movement, also known as Ansar Allah – Arabic for ‘Supporters of God’ – is a Shi’ite Islamist political and military organization backed by Iran, that emerged in the 1990s.
    

            Similar to chants used by Lebanon-based Iranian proxy Hezbollah, the Houthis’ official slogan reads, “God is the Greatest. Death to America. Death to Israel. Curse the Jews. Victory to Islam.”

Who are the Houthis? A former captive and conflict expert explains


            In 2014, Houthi forces allied with former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh took control of Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, from the UN-recognized Yemeni government, sparking a civil war that has afflicted the country ever since.
    

            Since March 2015, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have led a coalition in Yemen against Houthi forces.
    

            More recently, the group has come to be seen in parts of the largely-Sunni Muslim world and beyond as champions of the Palestinian cause, defending the people of Gaza against Israel.
    

            Since October 7, Houthi rebels have carried out numerous missile and drone attacks on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, asserting that these vessels are linked to Israel and its allies, which has escalated tensions throughout the Middle East.
    

            The strike on Hodeidah comes amid rising tensions in the region.
    

            In recent weeks the Lebanese Iran-backed Islamist group has been ramping up cross-border attacks with Israel after months of low-intensity fighting, prompting the Israeli military to warn that it is prepared to launch a large-scale attack on its northern border.
    

            Following the Hodeidah strike, Israel’s Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir congratulated Netanyahu on the operation and said Israel should “adopt the same policy against Hezbollah in Lebanon.”
    

            Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant echoed Gvir’s sentiment. Smotrich said Israel must continue to attack “with all its might even in distant places,” while Gallant said “the blood of Israeli citizens has a price,” and that anywhere Israelis are attacked the “result will be identical.”

            “The fire that is currently burning in Hodeidah, is seen across the Middle East and the significance is clear,” Gallant said.
    

            Hezbollah in Lebanon condemned the attack on Yemen and said “we stand firmly with the Yemeni people in defending themselves, their sovereignty, and their heroic and historic stance alongside Palestine.”
    

            Hamas also condemned the attack, calling it a “dangerous escalation.”
    

            Meanwhile, Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Israel Katz called on the international community to “maximize sanctions on Iran.”
    

            “Iran supports, trains, and finances the Houthi terror organization as part of its regional network of terror organizations aimed at attacking Israel,” he said.
    

            “Iran is the head of the snake – it must be stopped now,” Katz added.
    

            Iran condemned the Israeli strike on Hodeidah. Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Nasser Kanaani warned of the risk of war in the region, saying Israel’s actions in Gaza were the “root” of the escalating tensions.
    

            “The oppressed but powerful people of Yemen are paying the price for their honorable support of the innocent citizens, women and children of Gaza,” Kanaani said.

61,WaPo_57,Israel strikes Yemen port after Houthis claim drone attack in Tel Aviv,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/20/israel-yemen-hodeida-drone-tel-aviv/,"Israel carried out airstrikes Saturday on a port city in Yemen that is controlled by the Houthi militant group, sparking massive fires at a critical hub for imports to the impoverished country in an attack that Israeli leaders cast as a warning to emboldened adversaries around the Middle East.The attack came a day after the Houthis, an Iranian-allied group, claimed responsibility for a rare drone attack on Tel Aviv that killed one person and struck just yards from a U.S. Embassy branch office. After the strikes Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said they came in “direct response to the drone attack” Friday as well as other Houthi attacks against Israel during the war in Gaza.The strikes made “it clear to our enemies that there is no place that the long arm of the State of Israel will not reach,” he said.The Houthis, an Iranian-backed group, have been striking ships off Yemen’s coastlines for the better part of the year, in attacks they say are aimed at ending Israel’s Gaza offensive, while throttling vital trade routes. Over the last few months, the United States and Britain have carried out airstrikes against the Houthis, in an unsuccessful effort to end the maritime attacks.Israel’s attack Saturday was also unlikely to deter the Houthis, Yemen analysts said, and might have the opposite effect, allowing the group to consolidate its power at home as it rallied Yemenis to mobilize against yet another foreign threat. The strikes also heralded a further expansion of the war in Gaza, adding a volatile new dynamic to what has become a building regional conflict, joined by militant groups in Lebanon and Iraq as well.Stories to keep you informed

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.A military spokesman for the Houthis said “several” Israel raids had struck the port, a power station and fuel tanks in Hodeida, a struggling city that serves as the entry point for imports to large parts of Yemen. He vowed the group would retaliate.“We will respond to this blatant Israeli aggression and will not hesitate to strike the enemy’s vital targets,” Yahya Saree, the military spokesman, said in a televised statement. “We have prepared, with the help of God Almighty, for a long war with this enemy until the aggression stops and the siege on the Palestinian people is lifted,” he said.Footage of the aftermath of Saturday’s strikes showed black smoke billowing from massive fires in the port, and residents in Hodeida bathed in an orange glow as they watched. Al-Masirah, a Yemeni TV channel, quoted the ministry of health as saying that the strikes had injured more than 80 people, most with severe burns. The channel aired footage from what appeared to be a hospital, of injured people on gurneys lining a hallway.The Houthi drone that struck Tel Aviv on Friday evaded Israel’s sophisticated air defense network and struck the city without even setting off air-raid sirens — a failure that Israeli officials blamed in part on “human error.” Weapons experts said it was possible that the Houthis had enhanced one of their existing drones to use in the attack by increasing its range.An Israel Defense Forces official said Saturday that Israel carried out the strike on military and “dual use” targets following months of Houthi rocket and missile attacks on Red Sea shipping and Israeli territory. The official would not comment on reports of involvement by other national militaries in the region, including Saudi Arabia, the United States and Great Britain, although those allies were notified of the operation, the official said.“The fire that is currently burning in Hodeida is seen across the Middle East, and the significance is clear,” Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defense minister, said in a statement. “The Houthis attacked us over 200 times. The first time that they harmed an Israeli citizen, we struck them. And we will do this in any place where it may be required. The blood of Israeli citizens has a price.”Netanyahu, in his remarks, said that the Hodeida port was “used for military purposes, it was used as an entry point for deadly weapons supplied to the Houthis by Iran. They used this weapon to attack Israel, to attack the countries of the region, to attack an international shipping lane, one of the most important shipping lanes in the world.”It was also the entry point for fuel and food that entered Yemen, a country that has suffered gravely through a decade of civil war as people struggled to get basic necessities. The strikes Saturday could imperil those supplies, said Mohammed al-Basha, a senior Middle East analyst at Navanti, a risk-assessment group.The strikes had resulted in “the complete destruction of oil tanks at Hodeida port, with extensive damage also reported at Hodeida power station,” he said in a message. The destruction, he added, was expected to “trigger severe fuel shortages across northern Yemen, significantly impacting essential services such as hospital diesel generators. The situation is likely to be exacerbated by the intense summer heat, intensifying the suffering of the local population.”While ships docked in the port and grain silos in the area were not believed to be affected by the strikes, there had been damage to refined oil tanks belonging to the Yemen Petroleum Company, he said. There were also concerns that “poorly equipped firefighters” would not be able to quickly put out the roaring blaze in the port.The attack has “sparked panic in Houthi-controlled areas, with residents rushing to gas stations in fear of an impending fuel crisis,” he said. To calm the public, the Houthi-controlled Yemen Petroleum Company was forced to issue a statement saying there were adequate fuel supplies.A 34-year old Yemeni man whose family has a house in Hodeida, near the port, said the home was damaged by the fire caused by the strikes. The man, who lives outside of Yemen and asked to be identified by his first name, Hareth, said a relative had checked on the house Saturday. It was in one of the “poorest neighborhoods,” he said, where people’s houses were made of wood in the “traditional style.” The area had been targeted previously, during Yemen’s civil war, but had survived.“This time, everything was burned,” he said.Fahim reported from Istanbul, Rom from Tel Aviv, Hendrix from Jerusalem and El-Chamaa from Beirut."
80,WaPo_4,"At WNBA All-Star Game, Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese go from rivals to teammates",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/19/wnba-all-star-game-angel-reese-caitlin-clark/,"PHOENIX — Caitlin Clark launched her shot at Footprint Center as the WNBA all-star team wrapped up practice with a half-court contest. The ball careened off the backboard just to the left of the square. Before Clark walked away, Angel Reese stormed toward the all-star logo and fired. The orange and white ball bounced off the middle of the square and right through the twine, and Reese turned and lifted her right arm in victory, giving high-fives to a couple of teammates before doing a little dance.Hall of Famer and all-star coach Cheryl Miller soon stood in the middle of the floor doling out cash to Reese and Arike Ogunbowale, who also made her half-court heave.“I’m about my money,” Reese said with a laugh. “I’m going to shop when I get to Paris, so I need Paris money.”Reese is going to the Olympics but only to watch, so she and Clark will be teammates for the first time in Saturday’s All-Star Game, which pits the WNBA team against the U.S. Olympic squad. The much-discussed rivalry between the two goes back to the 2023 NCAA championship game, in which Reese and LSU were crowned champs and she made the you-can’t-see-me hand gesture that Clark has used herself.The two will be forever connected. Clark was the No. 1 overall pick after becoming the NCAA’s all-time leading scorer, and Reese was selected seventh. The two are the front-runners for WNBA rookie of the year, and fans have sold out arenas around the league to see them. Reese set the WNBA record with 15 consecutive double-doubles, and Clark broke the WNBA record with 19 assists in the final game before the all-star break.“That’s what everybody wants to see,” Reese said of the two playing together. “We got a little pick and roll, obviously, in practice today. It’s going to be really cool playing with each other.“I know y’all have been seeing the get-along shirts. … Everybody can really wear their get-along shirts together, for one day at least.”Clark added: “Obviously as two rookies, getting to share this experience for the first time, it’s super rare to be here as a rookie. And to have two of us here, it’s just really great overall.”The duo have drawn so much attention that the league adjusted its media rules. On the day of games, players were required to be available to the media after shoot-around, before the game and after it. The new rules allow teams to designate two players not to be required to speak after shoot-around.Even at Friday’s post-practice media sessions, Clark and Reese began later than the rest of the team to accommodate the throng of people — at least four deep — that surrounded them.“I can only assume what it’s like to be that young and have that much attention and that much criticism,” Nneka Ogwumike said. “To be honest, I don’t think I’d be able to handle it. Those are two very different people, and they’re handling it in the best way that they know how but still representing the league and also themselves in ways that continue to help grow the game.”Said ESPN analyst LaChina Robinson: “They have really entered into new territory where not just sports fans are interested in Angel and Caitlin but they’re household names. So I’ve enjoyed watching them really take the league to new heights, both with their play on the court and who they are as people.”Clark is averaging 17.1 points (13th in the WNBA), a league-best 8.2 assists and 5.8 rebounds (19th). She also posted the first triple-double by a rookie in league history. Reese has averaged a double-double with 13.5 points (24th) and 11.9 rebounds (second). Both the Indiana Fever and Chicago Sky are in playoff position despite low expectations for the season.“I love and appreciate the rivalry,” Miller said. “I love what they’ve done for the women’s game from the collegiate level to now. And it’s working. And it was only a matter of time. Great narratives, great storylines.“But now the bottom line comes down to one thing: It’s about basketball, and it’s about wins. And both these young ladies and their teams, people don’t want to face them down the stretch because now it’s starting to click.”Reese added: “It’s a blessing. I never thought I would be a rookie all-star. I never thought I would be in this moment.”Both will get a well-deserved break after the All-Star Game following a busy two years. They both played in the final college game of the year in 2023 and met again in the Elite Eight this past season, with Clark and Iowa going all the way to the championship game. A week later, they were drafted, and training camps began 13 days after that.Not making the Olympic team was a disappointment for Clark, but there’s a silver lining.“Getting this break is going to be very beneficial for myself and something that I deserve,” Clark said. “There has to be a point where that has to stop and you have to take care of yourself and do things for yourself, and maybe some of those decisions at times can be hard. And you want to give the world and everybody watching what they want, too, and help this game get better and better. But relaxing and reflecting on everything that’s happened to me over the course of the last year will be super important because my life has moved so fast.“Sure, I’m tired, but at the same time there’s so many people that would kill to be in my shoes and so many people that are going through so much worse in their lives.”"
80,WaPo_38,Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese aren’t the only WNBA rookies making an impact,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/20/wnba-all-star-game-caitlin-clark-angel-reese-rookies/,"A standout 2024 WNBA draft class has already made its mark three months into the season. At the midway point, ahead of Saturday’s All-Star Game, its two biggest stars have set records.The All-Star Game in Phoenix precedes the Paris Olympics this summer, and signals the start of a month-long league break. It pits the U.S. women’s national team against a WNBA all-star squad that excludes players heading to Paris.The 2024 draft class was headlined by Caitlin Clark, the top selection by the Indiana Fever, and Angel Reese, the No. 7 pick by the Chicago Sky. Both will play for the WNBA All-Stars.Saturday’s showcase comes on the heels of another gaudy performance by Clark, who set a WNBA record with 19 assists in a game Wednesday against the Dallas Wings. Clark, the NCAA’s all-time Division I scoring leader, has enjoyed scoring success early on as a pro.She averages 17.1 points, 8.2 assists and 5.8 rebounds per game. Her points total tops all rookies and her assist rate is the best in the league. She netted a career-high 30 points in games against the Los Angeles Sparks in May and the Washington Mystics in last month’s WNBA Commissioner’s Cup.She also became the first rookie in WNBA history to record a triple-double, accomplishing the feat earlier this month against the league-leading New York Liberty. She has double-doubles in eight of her last 11 games.After setting the single-game assist record Wednesday, Clark is 13 away from setting the rookie single-season assist record (225), set by Ticha Penicheiro in 1998. Clark and Penicheiro are the only players in WNBA history to exceed 200 assists in their rookie seasons, and Clark is just the ninth player with at least 400 points and 200 assists in a season — regardless of experience level.Still, ball security has been an issue, as it was at the end of the Fever’s Wednesday loss to Dallas, where Clark gave the ball away late in a close contest. Her 5.6 turnovers per game are well beyond the next closest player (Connecticut’s Alyssa Thomas, with 3.6), though that can partly be attributed to her aggressive playmaking style.“I think the beginning of the season was probably the most difficult for me. Just the adjustment of, first of all, playing in this league. And then second of all, the schedule that we had, playing a game, having a day off, playing a game,” Clark told reporters on Wednesday. “I think once we really kind of got into a flow and got a few wins under our belt and had a little more practice time, things have settled down and flowed a little better. I feel like my feet are definitely getting under me more and starting to build more and more confidence.”Caitlin Clark is in a category of her own 👏With 19 assists in tonight's game, Clark has set a new record for most AST in a single game in WNBA historyPreviously, Courtney Vandersloot held the record with 18 AST in a game for the Chicago Sky vs. the Indiana Fever in 2020 pic.twitter.com/dUVzusSBTpReese, the other rookie sensation, set the NCAA record for most double-doubles in a single season in 2023. She has extended her habit to the professional ranks, where she reset the WNBA-record for consecutive double-doubles with 15 straight. She came up two points short of extending the streak on July 13 against the New York Liberty.She averages 13.5 points and 11.9 rebounds per game. She sits just behind two-time league MVP A’ja Wilson for the league lead in the latter category — narrowly trailing Wilson’s 12 rebounds per contest.Where Clark was expected to make a significant impact, Reese has exceeded expectations. At the break, Clark is the front-runner for 2024 Rookie of the Year and Reese sees +650 odds. “[Winning] is what’s most important to me,” Reese told ESPN earlier this month. “I think I’ve done a great job, being able to be consistent and I’ve broken the record already. So [I want to] be able to just be me and do whatever my teammates need.”The countdown begins... ⏳Get ready to witness the ultimate clash of talent as #WNBAAllStar meets the USA Women's National Team on July 20th at 8:30pm/ET on ABC 📺 pic.twitter.com/oEyJciHmExIt’s not just Reese who has exceeded rookie expectations.Forward Rickea Jackson, the fourth overall selection by the Los Angeles Sparks, is the team’s third-leading scorer with 11.4 points per game. Aaliyah Edwards, a reserve forward and the sixth pick by the Washington Mystics, is one of the team’s top rebounders. Kamilla Cardoso, the 6-foot-7 center whom the Sky picked four places ahead of Reese, averages 8.1 points and 7.8 rebounds, and has been a reliable force in the paint. All three have made quality contributions.Beyond the top picks in April’s draft, others have made an impression.The Mystics’ Julie Vanloo, a Belgian point guard who entered the league this year at 31, averages 8.4 points and 5.1 assists through 25 games (starting all but four). Vanloo has been a perimeter threat for Washington this season, even before she broke the team’s rookie record for three-pointers made on Sunday (now 52).Rookie guards Jacy Sheldon (5.3 points and 1.8 assists in 21.5 minutes per game) and Sevgi Uzun (5.4 points and 3.5 assists in 24.3 minutes) have contributed to an — albeit struggling — Dallas team. Jackson, Edwards, Cardoso and Sheldon are currently considered longshots for rookie of the year with +20000 odds.Some rookies haven’t been as fortunate.Second overall pick Cameron Brink averaged 7.5 points, 5.3 rebounds and a team-leading 2.3 blocks in 15 starts for the Sparks. But her season ended last month after she suffered an ACL injury against Connecticut.Kate Martin, Clark’s college teammate at Iowa and a second-round pick by the Las Vegas Aces, has been a surprise contributor off the bench for the defending WNBA champions. She averages 3.6 points, 2.0 rebounds and 1.2 assists in just over 14 minutes of action per night. But her return is in question after she slipped late in the first quarter of Tuesday’s game against Chicago and suffered an apparent lower leg injury."

99,WaPo_46,Toll in Bangladesh protests tops 100 as Dhaka falls quiet under curfew,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/20/bangladesh-protests-violence-students/,"DHAKA, Bangladesh — Life in the Bangladeshi capital ground to a halt Saturday as the government enforced a curfew to quell violent clashes between student protesters and security forces.Shops and businesses were closed and roads were largely empty in the typically congested city of 10 million people, save for military and paramilitary personnel on patrol. Late on Saturday, scattered street battles were reported across Dhaka. Sweeping restrictions on the internet imposed on Thursday remained in place.According to a Washington Post tally of hospital and police reports, at least 110 people have been killed in the demonstrations over the past four days — the most of any protests in Bangladesh in over a decade. Police forces said several of their personnel are among the dead. Thousands of others have been wounded.Mohammed Abir, a medical examiner at the morgue at Dhaka Medical College hospital, said he received 33 bodies Friday evening.The U.N. humans rights chief, Volker Türk, on Friday called the violence “shocking and unacceptable” and urged restraint. There needs to be “impartial, prompt and exhaustive investigations” into the attacks against students, he said, adding that he was especially worried about the actions of the government’s paramilitary police units, “which have long track records of violations.”Stories to keep you informed

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.Dhaka and several other major Bangladeshi cities have been engulfed this past week by protests against a new governmental policy of reserving a portion of civil service jobs for specific groups, including descendants of the nation’s freedom fighters. The quota system, seen as unfair, has fueled explosive anger toward the government under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which has deployed increasingly draconian methods to quell the unrest.Leaders of the student protest movement told reporters they met with government officials Saturday to convey a list of demands, including an overhaul of the job quota system, the resignation of certain cabinet ministers and immediate trials for those responsible for the killing of students.The government must release student protesters who have been arrested, Abdullah Saleheen, a student activist, said in an interview. “Until that happens our protests will continue,” he added.Calls on Saturday from The Post to the Bangladeshi Foreign Ministry and Home Affairs Ministry, as well as the U.S. Embassy in Dhaka, went unanswered.On Friday, protesters stormed a jail in the district of Narsingdi, northeast of the capital, freeing hundreds of inmates. Police posts across Dhaka were set on fire as paramilitary and military forces deployed tear gas, rubber bullets and smoke bombs to disperse large crowds.At the end of the night, the government announced a nationwide curfew, ordering people to stay home until Sunday 10 a.m. local time. There was a two-hour window on Saturday from noon to 2 p.m. for public movement.Internet services have been shut down and mobile services disrupted in a near-total “blackout” that has left much of the country’s 170 million people unreachable. Banks have reported disruptions in operations.Bangladeshi officials say they have slowed internet connectivity to stop the spread of misinformation. But in a letter, a coalition of more than 300 digital rights groups said it is likely to have the opposite effect by reducing people’s ability to counteract misinformation and spurring panic. “Government agencies have a duty to ensure that people can access open, secure, and unrestricted internet when they need it the most,” the #KeepItOn coalition wrote.Another digital rights advocacy group, Asia Internet Coalition, urged Bangladesh “to consider the serious impact of its action on its people and the country’s reputation as an investment destination.”Several of the biggest companies in the textile industry, a major contributor to Bangladesh’s economy, said they would close their factories on Sunday. Hasina has canceled a preplanned trip to Europe to deal with the unrest, her office said.Tan reported from Singapore."

More than 35 congressional Democrats have called for Biden to step aside, according to a Washington Post tally. Former president Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), held a rally Saturday in the battleground state of Michigan. Vice President Harris spoke at a fundraiser in Cape Cod, Mass., as Biden remains sidelined after testing positive this week for the coronavirus."
120,WaPo_62,Trump and Vance appear at first rally since assassination attempt,https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/07/20/trump-vance-michigan-rally-grand-rapids/,"GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Former president Donald Trump held his first rally since his attempted assassination at another campaign event, joined by his newly announced running mate, J.D. Vance.Trump and Vance, the Republican senator from Ohio,  appeared in Grand Rapids exactly one week after a gunman opened fire at Trump’s rally in Butler, Pa. with an AR-style rifle. The attack killed one audience member, injured others and left Trump with a bloody ear, instantly creating a shocking and iconic election-year scene in which Trump pumped his fist and shouted “Fight!” as Secret Service officers rushed him offstage.Now, Trump is coming off his formal nomination at the Republican National Convention in perhaps his strongest political position this campaign cycle, with some Democrats pushing to remove President Biden last-minute from their ticket and Republicans full of optimism.The Grand Rapids event is  Trump and Vance’s first rally as running mates and underscores the Trump team’s hopes that Vance’s Ohio upbringing and populist message will help them win the neighboring swing states of Michigan and Pennsylvania. Speaking for just over 10 minutes Saturday afternoon ahead of Trump’s remarks, Vance highlighted his roots in a “working class family” that struggled with addiction and said he viewed both political parties as “broken” for a long time.He laid out the “America First” and isolationist ideas he has championed in a changing GOP. He rebuked leaders across the political spectrum he said had allowed American jobs to be outsourced and suggested the U.S. should pick its foreign entanglements more carefully.“There’s nothing radical about having a strong national security that when we go to the war, we punch and we punch hard, but being cautious, and not trying to get America involved in every far-flung corner and conflict of the world,” Vance said. “Sometimes, my friends, it just is none of our business and we oughta stay out of it.” The crowd cheered.Despite the violence last week, Trump supporters queued up in long lines early Saturday to hear from their official ticket. Many rally attendees wore shirts with Trump’s words after the assassination attempt — “fight, fight, fight” — or with photos of Trump raising his fist, and a few sported ear bandages meant to mimic the one Trump had at the GOP convention.Saturday’s rally took taking place with extra safety precautions. The event was moved indoors after the shooting at an open-air event because an arena is easier to secure, The Washington Post previously reported, and Trump’s campaign does not expect to hold any more outdoor rallies soon. Secret Service sought additional help from local law enforcement as well.“They will be on heightened security obviously,” Kent County commissioner Walter Bujak told The Post before the rally. “They’re going to dot the i’s and cross the t’s for this one.”Supporters at the rally said they believed that God saved Trump’s life last week and expressed little fear for their own security.“I feel safe and I don’t feel worried. Security is beefed up as much as it could be,” said Angelic Johnson, 54. “We just have to look to God to protect us like he did that night that Trump got shot.” She said she came to learn more about Vance after only knowing his basic biography.Rallygoers booed and jeered when screens showed a mashup of Biden stumbling over his words and tripping onstage.Biden’s campaign held a news conference Saturday ahead of the Grand Rapids rally to assail Trump’s agenda, saying it would hurt workers while giving breaks to the wealthy. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) shared a video with her “welcome” message for Trump and Vance, saying that “here, we protect reproductive freedom” and making other digs at Trump’s policies.But Democrats’ own turmoil has been a growing distraction. A dozen more Democratic lawmakers called on Biden to pull out of the presidential race on Friday alone, indicating a party still deeply unsettled by Biden’s struggle to hold his train of thought at a June 27 and other stumbles.A bout of covid-19 has also taken Biden off the campaign trail while Trump and Vance plan a bundle of events coming out of the Republican convention.On Monday afternoon, Vance will hold a rally in his hometown of Middletown, Ohio. Then he will head to a Monday evening rally in Radford, Va. — a signal of the Trump campaign’s continued efforts to expand the map of competitive states to places where Democrats usually prevail in the presidential race. Biden won Virginia by 10 points in 2020.Trump plans to speak at a rally in Charlotte on Wednesday evening.Trump, appearing at the convention with a bandage on his ear, used his speech to call for unity after last week’s rally shooting. “The discord and division in our society must be healed,” he said.But after recounting the assassination attempt and attributing his survival to divine intervention, Trump mostly returned to his usual material. He jabbed at “crazy Nancy Pelosi” and alluded to his false claims the 2020 election was stolen from him — “that horrible, horrible result that we’ll never let happen again.”Knowles reported from Washington."

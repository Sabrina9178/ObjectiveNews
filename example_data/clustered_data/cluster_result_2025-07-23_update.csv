1,NBC_2,Election 2024 live updates: Trump turns attacks toward Kamala Harris after Biden exits race,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/live-blog/election-2024-live-updates-rcna162976,"Summer Concepcion
House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., and Minority Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., announced their endorsements of Harris for president.
After commending Biden for making the “patriotic decision” to withdraw from the race, Aguilar said the election “will be the fight of our lives,” citing abortion bans in the wake of the Supreme Court’s overturn of Roe v. Wade in 2022 and the need to lower costs for average Americans, adding that Trump poses a threat to reproductive rights and clean energy jobs.
“Moving forward, I will do everything I can to elect Kamala Harris the 47th President of the United States, defeat Donald Trump and take back the House from Extreme MAGA Republicans,” he said in a statement. “I know Kamala to be a fierce advocate for working families and a tough-minded prosecutor who knows right from wrong. I ask every American who believes in the rule of law, supports our Democracy and wants to keep America a beacon of hope for future generations to join me in this fight.”
Clark said she “proudly and enthusiastically” endorses Harris for president. She pointed to Harris’ support for reproductive rights, role in lowering prescription drug costs for seniors, effort to expand the Child Tax Credit, advocacy for affordable child care and housing, and help in pass gun safety reforms.
“While Donald Trump campaigns on dividing the American people and rigging the system for the rich, Kamala Harris will grow the economy by growing the middle class and defend our core principles of democracy and justice for all. I’m proud to stand with Kamala and excited to get to work to elect her!” Clark said in a statement.

Trump’s political team has been preparing to run against Harris for weeks, something it got one step closer to yesterday after Biden said he is dropping out of the race.
“We are pretty excited about the fact that he endorsed Kamala,” said Richard Grenell, a former U.S. ambassador to Germany and Trump’s acting director of national intelligence. “As we know in California, she has never been vetted. … Kamala Harris is a product of this whole system. She’s very far left, unvetted and untested.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., anticipates that Harris is coming into the race “bringing the receipts” against Trump, noting her experience as a former prosecutor during an interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”
“She’s been on the world stage, and she will have a unique ability, as a former prosecutor and a fierce competitor, to prosecute his past, his selfishness about his role in all of this,” she said. “And it’s going to be, I think, something like you’ve never seen before.”
Klobuchar, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, recalled Harris’ cross examination of conservative Supreme Court nominees who ultimately overturned the landmark ruling of Roe v. Wade.
“We believe women should be able to make their own decisions about their health care, not politicians,” she said. “Kamala Harris is going to be looking at Donald Trump, the guy that did the video this year that said he was proudly the person who overturned Roe v. Wade. She is the prosecutor, is going to be able to talk about what he’s done all of his felony indictments in a way that you’ve never seen before, and then she’s going to be able to talk about the economic record.”

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., denied in a ""TODAY"" interview this morning that there was a coordinated behind-the-scenes campaign by Democrats to pressure Biden to exit the race .
Schiff, who called on Biden to step aside, said he himself “certainly wasn’t part of any coordinated campaign.”
“And I don’t think there was,"" he said. ""I think you had individual leaders in the party looking at the polls, listening to people from battleground states and from battleground House districts, and increasingly concerned about the trajectory that we’re on.”
“It was hard for all of us, frankly, because we admire Joe Biden, we respect Joe Biden, and more than that, we just have tremendous affection for Joe Biden,” he added. “He’s a wonderful and decent human being. So this, I think, was hard for all of us in the party. But I can’t say that I was part of any coordinated effort.”
Schiff said he made his “own judgment about what I thought was best” in urging Biden to consider “what he thought was the right direction for the country.”
“And I think that Joe Biden wasn’t going to be intimidated or pushed or anything else,” he said. “He was going to make his decision when he was ready to make it. And you know, once again, he did what he has always done through his lengthy, multi-decade career. And that is put country first.”
Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi worked behind the scenes in efforts to nudge Biden out of the race after his dismal debate performance last month, NBC News reported.

Harris campaign spokesperson Brian Fallon said this morning that she raised $49.6 million from grassroots donors in the hours following Biden's exit from the 2024 campaign and his endorsement of her.
It's among the biggest fundraising sprees ever for a presidential campaign. Earlier this year, Trump's political operation raised more than $63 million online across two days following his criminal conviction in New York.

With Biden exiting the presidential race, Harris becomes the overwhelming front-runner to be the Democratic presidential nominee.
Harris’ biggest challenge lies further ahead, though: She has been polling the same as Biden — or just slightly better — against Trump, according to multiple surveys taken before Biden withdrew from the contest.

One thing hasn’t changed now that Biden is no longer seeking the Democratic Party’s nomination: Democratic convention delegates remain free to vote for whomever they want to be their party’s nominee, regardless of the results of the primary.
The only command to delegates under current convention rules is to “in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.” After a primary process in which Biden won virtually every contest and faced no true opposition, those “sentiments” were easy to predict.

Harris vowed in a statement to defeat Donald Trump. Biden said in a letter to fellow Americans on Sunday that “it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President.” Harris was calling fellow Democrats on Sunday to shore up support.

Harris has received a rapid flow of endorsements from top Democrats, including from several who had been mentioned as other possible replacements for Biden. Harris called Biden’s record “unmatched in modern history” at the outset of an event Monday honoring championship college athletic teams — Harris’s first public appearance since Biden left the ticket. Later Monday, Harris is traveling to campaign headquarters in Delaware."

Before President Biden announced he would discontinue his re-election campaign and endorsed Vice President Harris, recent polls that had been conducted after his disastrous debate performance showed little difference between how he matched up against former President Trump compared to how Harris would. 
The New York Times assessed that Harris falls about two percentage points behind Trump in recent polls. The 46% to 48% difference is slightly better for Harris compared to how Biden polled on average – three percentage points behind the Republican presidential nominee, 47% to 44%. 
A New York Times/Siena College poll conducted in the battleground state of Pennsylvania from July 9-11, before Biden dropped out and before the assassination attempt on Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, showed Harris was only behind by one percentage point in a hypothetical matchup against Trump. 
In Virginia, Harris had a five percentage point lead, compared to Biden only polling ahead of Trump in the same state by a razor-thin margin, according to the Times. Harris polled slightly better than Biden in both states among Black voters, younger voters and women.

According to a Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll conducted July 5-9, 70% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents indicated that they would be ""satisfied"" if Biden withdrew from the race and Harris was nominated to run as the 2024 Democratic presidential candidate.
In an open-ended question, that poll showed 29% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents named Harris as their pick for the Democratic nomination if Biden bowed out.

NEW POLL REVEALS WHAT DEMOCRATS THINK OF HARRIS AS PRESIDENT
Seven percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents referenced California Gov. Gavin Newsom, while 4% said they wanted former first lady Michelle Obama as Biden's replacement. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer each had 3% of support, though half of Democrats did not specify an alternative candidate.

As pressure mounted from Democrat lawmakers and donors for Biden to step aside, a poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research released last week found that about six in 10 Democrats believe that Harris would do a good job as president herself. About two in 10 Democrats do not believe she would, and another two in 10 say they do not know enough to say.

Results of a CNN poll conducted by SSRS and released on July 2 indicated that three-quarters of voters say the Democratic Party would have a better chance of keeping the White House with someone else other than Biden at the top of the party's ticket. In a hypothetical match-up, 47% of registered voters supported Trump compared to 45% for Harris, a difference that fell within the survey's margin of error.

42,CNN_8,"More than 1,500 US flights canceled for the third day straight as airlines slowly recover from global tech outage",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/us/tech-outage-flight-cancellations-united-delta-airlines/index.html,"
            More than 1,500 US flights have been canceled for the third day straight, as airlines struggle to recover from a global tech outage that left thousands of passengers stranded at airports.
    

            Around 1,600 flights into, within or out of the United States were canceled by Sunday evening, while more than 8,500 US flights were delayed, according to the tracking website FlightAware.com.
    

            More than 1,000 of those cancelations were from Delta Air Lines, the website shows.
    

            The airline is continuing its recovery efforts following “an outside vendor technology issue” resulting in delays and cancelations, Delta said Sunday. The airline is communicating directly with some impacted customers, offering travel vouchers, waivers and SkyMiles Program miles, it said.
    

            In an update to Delta customers Sunday afternoon, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said the airline’s teams are still working to recover their system and restore operations.
    

            “Canceling a flight is always a last resort, and something we don’t take lightly,” Bastian said.
    

            On Saturday, 2,136 flights among multiple carriers were canceled, and more than 21,300 flights were delayed, according to FlightAware.

A global tech outage brought many computer systems and businesses to a screeching halt. Here’s what happened


            The issue extended beyond airports, with businesses, government agencies, health and emergency services, banks, schools and universities around the world grinding to a halt or seeing services disrupted due to a flawed software update for Microsoft Windows operating systems issued by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, experts told CNN.
    

            The outage affected an estimated 8.5 million Windows devices, according to Microsoft.
    

            CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz apologized to customers and said a fix has been deployed, but experts say getting systems back in order will be a lengthy process.
    

            Major airlines have said services are being restored, but there could be more delays and disruptions.
    

            A majority of United Airlines systems have recovered from Friday’s outage, though some delays and cancellations are still possible, the airline said in a statement. More than 400 United flights were canceled Saturday, and over 200 flights were canceled Sunday, according to FlightAware.com.
    

            Delta has paused unaccompanied minor travel until Wednesday due to the outage, the airline announced over the weekend. Unaccompanied children who are already booked on a Delta flight will not be able to travel, and the airline has asked that no new flights be booked for them.
    

            Also impacted was American Airlines, which said in a statement  Friday “we were able to safely reestablish our operation” and it had “issued a travel waiver for our customers impacted by the vendor technology issue earlier this morning.” Allegiant Air said in a statement Saturday while “normal operations have resumed” after the outage, they’re processing a backlog of customer messages and troubleshooting their programs and platforms.
    

            Even with the flawed computer update rolled back, it’s not a quick fix for airlines, which have computers at thousands of gates that will need to be individually manually rebooted, David Kennedy, cofounder of cybersecurity company Binary Defense, told CNN on Saturday.
    

            “It’s not just as simple as rebooting. There’s a lot more steps and complexities in this that are involved,” Kennedy said. “There’s just not enough people at those airports, at those locations to go and do it.”
    

            The US Department of Transportation on Friday said it determined the flight delays and cancelations resulting from the system outage were “controllable,” meaning they’re “attributable to the airline.” In such cases, the airlines “must adhere to their customer service commitments.”
    

            Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in a social media post Saturday said he received reports of some airlines only offering flight credits to passengers for canceled flights.
    

            “Let me be clear — you are entitled to get your money back promptly if your flight is canceled and you don’t take a rebooking,” Buttigieg said.
    

            Flight cancelations persist at the world’s busiest airport, Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, where officials have implemented a “concessions crisis plan, ensuring concessions availability while all flights are operating.”
    

            “We’ve provided assistance and guidance to passengers spending the night in the airport, and we’re collaborating with our airlines to create space for luggage reunification areas,” an airport spokesperson told CNN on Sunday.
    

            “It just seems like nobody cares about us. We’re sleeping on the floor. There’s kids sleeping on the floor and no one’s done anything about it,” traveler Anthony Augugliaro told CNN affiliate WSB on Sunday.
    

            Long lines of passengers also waited for assistance at the airport Saturday. Delta passenger Catalina Villareal described the scene: “Mayhem. Chaos. Frustration. Hunger.”
    

            Villareal said she had experienced three flights cancellations.

The global software outage affected this forecaster’s broadcast. He took the weather report into his own hands – literally


            Charlotte Yeh, a traveler at Boston Logan International Airport, told CNN affiliate WFXT Saturday she received no notification her flight to Fort Lauderdale for her father’s 96th birthday was canceled.
    

            Thousands of people face the same uncertainty as they cram together in airports across the country, waiting for answers.
    

            “I was supposed to be in California for my mom’s wedding,” Richard Whitfield of Pasco County, Florida, told CNN on Saturday. Whitfield and his partner, Jonathan Shade, left Tampa on Thursday and missed their connecting flight in Atlanta due to poor weather conditions, delaying their landing and forcing the plane to refuel in Tallahassee.
    

            After their rescheduled flight on Friday was delayed many times, the couple decided to cancel the trip and just head home. But with no available flights back to Tampa on Friday night, they spent their second night in an airport hotel. They were unable to get a voucher from Delta for either of their stays.
    

            “(Richard has) been on hold for 24 hours,” Shade told CNN. “When he eventually got his number in line, it was 2,001.”
    

            Two hours later, Richard’s place in Delta Air Lines’ virtual customer service queue was 2,300 in line, Shade said.
    

            Whitfield told CNN the whole ordeal has had an impact on him.
    

            “For me, it’s been the domino effect that it has on humanity and everything that we need to survive: food, sleep, or water, housing,” he said.
    

            After spending 48 hours in Atlanta, they found a Saturday evening flight back to Tampa they say they can only hope is not delayed or canceled. For now, there is nothing the couple can do but wait and “get a good stiff drink,” Shade and Whitfield said.

42,CNN_42,Hundreds of US flights are canceled for the 4th straight day. Here’s the latest on the global tech outage,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/22/us/microsoft-power-outage-crowdstrike-it/index.html,"
            Hundreds of US flights were canceled early Monday, as airlines work to recover four days after a global tech outage caused massive delays and left travelers stranded at airports around the nation.
    

            More than 700 flights into, within or out of the United States were canceled by 7:30 a.m. ET Monday, and more than 800 flights were delayed, according to flight tracking site FlightAware.
    

            While most airlines have brought their cancellation numbers down, more than 600 of Monday’s canceled flights were from Delta Air Lines, according to FlightAware.
    

            Delta declined to comment on the numbers, but in an update to customers Sunday afternoon, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said the company is working to restore operations after the outage.
    

            The “largest IT outage in history” – prompted by a software update for Microsoft devices late Thursday into the early hours of Friday – brought down computers and technical systems across the world, causing disorder at airports, outages for 911 services and challenges at health care facilities.
    

            “In particular one of our crew tracking-related tools was affected and unable to effectively process the unprecedented number of changes triggered by the system shutdown,” Bastian said in the statement.
    

            The outage affected an estimated 8.5 million Windows devices – less than one percent of all Windows machines, according to a Saturday blog post from Microsoft. But the effects were ubiquitous, with airlines, banks, businesses, schools and governments, along with some health and emergency services, across the world affected.
    

            Costs from the outage could top $1 billion, Patrick Anderson, CEO of Anderson Economic Group, told CNN. But it’s unclear if – and how – any customers affected will be compensated.
    

            Here’s what we know about the outage and its continued effects.
    

            The outage was related to a software update rolled out by CrowdStrike, a major US cybersecurity firm. The software – used by numerous Fortune 500 companies, including major global banks, health care and energy companies, as well as by the US government –detects and blocks hacking threats.

What is CrowdStrike, the company linked to the global outage?


            CrowdStrike told customers early Friday the outages were caused by “a defect found in a single content update of its software on Microsoft Windows operating systems,” according to a post on X from CEO George Kurtz. The issue was identified and isolated, and engineers deployed an update to fix the problem, Kurtz said.
    

            The company’s engineers took action to address the problem, according to an advisory viewed by CNN, which told customers to reboot their computers and perform other actions if they were still having technical issues. The issue is specific to Falcon, one of CrowdStrike’s main software products, and is not impacting Mac or Linux operating systems, according to the advisory. Crowdstrike says Falcon is designed to protect files saved in the cloud.
    

            The company said the outage was not caused by a security incident or a cyberattack.
    

            Kurtz later apologized to customers and said the company is “deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption.”
    

            In an update posted to LinkedIn late Sunday, CrowdStrike said “a significant number” of the 8.5 million devices were back online and operational.
    

            On Sunday, more than 1,800 US flights were canceled and more than 9,900 delayed, according to FlightAware. Major hotels, including Marriott International and some Hiltons, were impacted both in regard to payment processing and delays to check in-processes.
    

            US-based carriers American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Allegiant Airlines, SunCountry and Frontier Airlines all reported issues on Friday.
    

            American Airlines said Friday morning it was able to “safely re-establish” operations. By Friday night, United said “most of our systems have recovered,” but cautioned there may still be some flight delays or cancellations as a result of the issues.
    

            Delta Airlines paused all its flights Friday morning while its systems were offline, and more than 3,500 Delta and Delta Connection flights were cancelled through Saturday, according to the airline. More than 1,200 Delta flights were canceled on Sunday, after the carrier canceled 1,208 flights on Saturday, according to FlightAware.


            Delta also announced that it would not be allowing unaccompanied minors to travel until July 24 due to the outage.
    

            Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg spoke with Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian Sunday afternoon as the air carrier continues to struggle with a high number of flight cancellations, according to the department.

            “We continue to receive reports of unacceptable disruptions and customer service conditions at Delta Air Lines, including hundreds of complaints filed with our Department. I have made clear to Delta that we expect the airline to provide prompt refunds to consumers who choose not to be rebooked, and free rebooking and timely reimbursements for food and overnight hotel stays to consumers affected by the delays and cancellations, as well as adequate customer service assistance to all of their passengers,” Buttigieg said in a statement.
    

            Other airlines were getting back on track over the weekend, including one of the world’s largest operators, Turkish Airlines, which said Saturday, “The global technical issue has been resolved. All our operations have returned to normal.”
    

            The same day, Jetstar Japan, Hong Kong Express and Cebu Pacific airlines said their operations are gradually being restored after disruptions due to the global tech outage.
    

            Even with the flawed computer update rolled back, it’s not a quick fix for airlines, which have computers at thousands of gates that will need to be individually rebooted, David Kennedy, cofounder of cybersecurity company Binary Defense, told CNN on Saturday.
    

            “It’s not just as simple as rebooting. There’s a lot more steps and complexities in this that are involved,” Kennedy said. “There’s just not enough people at those airports, at those locations to go and do it.”
    

            Amid the travel chaos, Buttigieg said earlier in a social media post Saturday he received reports of some airlines only offering flight credits to passengers for canceled flights.
    

            “Let me be clear — you are entitled to get your money back promptly if your flight is canceled and you don’t take a rebooking,” Buttigieg said.
    

            The widespread usage of CrowdStrike’s software meant the outage penetrated numerous industries, including emergency communications, government services and health care.

            Large hospital systems, including Mass General Brigham in Massachusetts, Penn Medicine in Pennsylvania, Mount Sinai Health System in New York all reported Friday they were affected by the outage.
    

            Emory Healthcare in Atlanta said it had delayed “procedures at ambulatory surgical centers and hospitals are delayed until our systems are stabilized.”
    

            Some cancer centers, including Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and New York’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, also paused certain procedures and scheduled appointments.
    

            Several blood banks likewise experienced disruptions.
    

            And in a few areas, including Arizona and Alaska, 911 services were briefly disrupted before being restored.
    

            Government agencies, including Social Security offices and local Department of Motor Vehicles offices, also temporarily paused their operations due to the outage.
    

            Public transportation in Washington, DC, and Pennsylvania were also affected by the outage but restored operations Friday.
    

            And mail carriers UPS and FedEx said while they remained operational, they expected service delays Friday.

46,CNN_12,Hunter Biden drops lawsuit against Fox News over ‘mock trial’ miniseries,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/media/hunter-biden-drops-fox-news-lawsuit-trial/index.html,"
            Hunter Biden on Sunday abruptly dropped a lawsuit he filed last month against Fox News over the network’s fictionalized miniseries that he alleged included sexually explicit images of him without consent.
    

            Biden dropped the lawsuit just hours after his father, President Joe Biden, announced his decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, though it’s not clear if the timing is related.
    

            The decision came less than a month after the president’s son sued Fox News, claiming the right-wing network unlawfully published “intimate images” of him in a 2022 miniseries about his legal troubles on the Fox Nation streaming service.

Biden will not seek reelection; endorses Harris


            Representatives for Hunter Biden didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday. A Fox News spokesperson declined to comment.
    

            The miniseries, “The Trial of Hunter Biden,” was a six-part offering that featured a dramatized “mock trial” about Hunter Biden’s overseas financial dealings that led, in part, to his federal tax indictment and claims that fueled House Republicans’ stalled impeachment inquiry into his father.
    

            Fox News removed the miniseries from its platforms in late April after Biden threatened to file a lawsuit. Nonetheless, he sued the network on June 30.
    

            At the time, a Fox News spokesperson claimed the lawsuit was meritless and “entirely politically motivated,” and said the network looked forward to “vindicating our rights in court.”

Hunter Biden drops request for new gun trial


            “Consistent with the First Amendment, Fox News has accurately covered the newsworthy events of Mr. Biden’s own making,” the spokesperson said.
    

            While Hunter Biden ended his lawsuit against Fox, his legal challenges continue. Biden, 54, faces a federal tax evasion trial scheduled for September. He was convicted earlier this year of three federal gun felonies in a separate trial. He has not, however, been charged in connection with the bribery and foreign lobbying allegations that were at the center of Fox’s miniseries.
    

            Earlier on Sunday, Biden released a statement praising his father’s historic decision to bow out of the 2024 race.
    

            “I’m so lucky every night I get to tell him I love him, and to thank him,” Biden wrote. “I ask all Americans to join me tonight in doing the same.  Thank you, Mr. President.  I love you, Dad.”

46,WaPo_27,Hunter Biden drops lawsuit over Fox News ‘mock trial’ miniseries,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/07/22/hunter-biden-drops-fox-lawsuit/,"Hunter Biden has withdrawn a lawsuit against Fox News over a miniseries that used his sexually explicit photos in a “mock trial” dramatization of a fictitious criminal prosecution of the president’s son.Biden’s legal team filed a “notice of voluntary dismissal” Sunday, less than three weeks after his case was initiated in federal court in New York — and on the same day President Biden announced he was dropping his bid for reelection.Lawyers did not say why they had withdrawn the case.Hunter Biden, 54, a former lobbyist who has struggled with substance abuse, has faced a welter of legal problems. Last month, he was found guilty in Delaware of lying about his drug use to buy a gun; in September he will face trial on tax evasion charges in California.But “The Trial of Hunter Biden,” a six-part miniseries released on the Fox Nation streaming platform in 2022, portrayed an imagined courtroom prosecution of Biden on charges of violating bribery and foreign-agent laws that he has never faced in real life.The show relies partially on documents found on a laptop that Biden is said to have abandoned at a Wilmington, Del., repair shop in 2019 — he has maintained that some may have been hacked or stolen from him instead — including some intimate images.In his suit filed July 1, Biden accused Fox of unlawfully enriching itself by using his image, inflicting emotional distress and illegally publishing his intimate photos in violation of New York’s “revenge porn” law.Fox said at the time that it had removed the miniseries from its streaming platform after receiving a legal warning from Biden’s lawyers in April. But it otherwise defended the production and said the lawsuit was without merit.“Hunter Biden is a public figure who has been the subject of multiple investigations and is now a convicted felon,” the company statement said. “Consistent with the First Amendment, Fox News has accurately covered the newsworthy events of Mr. Biden’s own making.”Fox representatives did not comment further on the suit’s withdrawal."
51,CNN_17,What we know 4 days after a software update brought down computer systems around the world,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/22/us/microsoft-power-outage-crowdstrike-it/index.html,"
            Four days after a faulty software update from a cybersecurity company unexpectedly brought down computers and technical systems across the world, airlines and some other companies are still experiencing delays and other technical problems.
    

            The “largest IT outage in history” – prompted by a software update for Microsoft devices late Thursday into the early hours of Friday – caused disorder at airports, outages for 911 services and challenges at healthcare facilities.
    

            The outage affected an estimated 8.5 million Windows devices – less than one percent of all Windows machines, according to a Saturday blog post from Microsoft. But the effects were ubiquitous, with airlines, banks, businesses, schools and governments, along with some health and emergency services, across the world affected.
    

            Costs from the outage could top $1 billion, Patrick Anderson, CEO of Anderson Economic Group, told CNN. But it’s unclear if – and how – any customers affected will be compensated.
    

            Here’s what we know about the outage and its continued effects.
    

            The outage was related to a software update rolled out by CrowdStrike, a major US cybersecurity firm. The software – used by numerous Fortune 500 companies, including major global banks, healthcare and energy companies, as well as by the US government — detects and blocks hacking threats.

What is CrowdStrike, the company linked to the global outage?


            CrowdStrike told customers early Friday the outages were caused by “a defect found in a single content update of its software on Microsoft Windows operating systems,” according to a post on X from CEO George Kurtz. The issue was identified and isolated, and engineers deployed an update to fix the problem, Kurtz said.
    

            The company’s engineers took action to address the problem, according to an advisory viewed by CNN, which told customers to reboot their computers and perform other actions if they were still having technical issues. The issue is specific to Falcon, one of CrowdStrike’s main software products, and is not impacting Mac or Linux operating systems, according to the advisory. Crowdstrike says Falcon is designed to protect files saved in the cloud.
    

            The company said the outage was not caused by a security incident or a cyberattack.
    

            Kurtz later apologized to customers and said the company is “deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption.”
    

            Travelers continued to feel the impact of the failure for a third straight day on Sunday, with more than 1,800 US flights canceled and more than 9,900 delayed, according to the tracking website FlightAware. Major hotels, including Marriott International and some Hiltons, were impacted both in regard to payment processing and delays to check in-processes.
    

            US-based carriers American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Allegiant Airlines, SunCountry and Frontier Airlines all reported issues on Friday.
    

            American Airlines said Friday morning it was able to “safely re-establish” operations. By Friday night, United said “most of our systems have recovered,” but cautioned there may still be some flight delays or cancellations as a result of the issues.
    

            Delta Airlines paused all its flights Friday morning while its systems were offline, and more than 3,500 Delta and Delta Connection flights were cancelled through Saturday, according to the airline. More than 1,200 Delta flights were canceled on Sunday, after the carrier canceled 1,208 flights on Saturday, according to FlightAware.


            Delta also announced that it would not be allowing unaccompanied minors to travel until July 24 due to the outage.
    

            Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg spoke with Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian Sunday afternoon as the air carrier continues to struggle with a high number of flight cancellations, according to the department.
    

            “We continue to receive reports of unacceptable disruptions and customer service conditions at Delta Air Lines, including hundreds of complaints filed with our Department. I have made clear to Delta that we expect the airline to provide prompt refunds to consumers who choose not to be rebooked, and free rebooking and timely reimbursements for food and overnight hotel stays to consumers affected by the delays and cancellations, as well as adequate customer service assistance to all of their passengers,” Buttigieg said in a statement.
    

            In a letter Sunday afternoon, Bastian apologized to customers, saying the extremely busy travel weekend contributed to the problem. Delta declined CNN’s request to comment further.
    

            Other airlines were getting back on track over the weekend, including one of the world’s largest operators, Turkish Airlines, which said Saturday, “The global technical issue has been resolved. All our operations have returned to normal.”
    

            The same day, Jetstar Japan, Hong Kong Express and Cebu Pacific airlines said their operations are gradually being restored after disruptions due to the global tech outage.

51,CNN_18,A global tech outage brought many computer systems and businesses to a screeching halt. Here’s what happened,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/tech/timeline-crowdstrike-system-outage/index.html,"
            A global software outage Friday brought many computer systems across business, healthcare, technology and government sectors to a screeching halt in under 12 hours.
    

            How did the crash unfold? Which systems have recovered, and which ones are still affected? We break it down. (All times Eastern Time.)
    

            Overnight on Thursday and into Friday, several states, including Alaska and Arizona, experience 911 service outages. Some hospitals also begin experiencing technology issues overnight, according to nurses on shift.
    

            Between 2 and 3 a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration announces that all Delta and American Airlines flights are grounded. Several minutes later, the FAA says flights from United and Allegiant Airlines have been grounded regardless of their destination.
    

            Spirit Airlines says its flight reservation system has also been affected by the outage.
    

            A few hours later, between 5 and 6 a.m., public transit systems in the Northeast begin announcing that they have been impacted. Washington, DC, public transportation services — including trains and buses — begin experiencing delays, according to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.
    

            In New York City, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, North America’s largest transportation network, says customer information systems have gone temporarily offline, but train and bus services remain unaffected.
    

            At 5:30 a.m., US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike tells customers that it was “aware of reports of crashes” of its software on Microsoft Windows operating systems, according to a company advisory viewed by CNN. CrowdStrike’s cybersecurity software — used by numerous Fortune 500 companies — detects and blocks hacking threats.
    

Between 6 and 7 a.m.: A White House National Security Council spokesperson tells CNN they are “aware of the incident and are looking into the issue and impacts.” A White House source familiar with the matter tells CNN there are no indications at this time of malicious activity, though the administration is still investigating.
    

            Global banks start reporting some service disruptions, including Australia’s Commonwealth Bank, South Africa’s Capitec, and the Bank of Israel. Australian lenders ANZ and Westpac were also impacted, according to Downdetector, a website that tracks cyber outages. Downdetector has also reported issues for New Zealand’s ASB Bank.
    

            Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler issues an emergency declaration in response to the outage that affected Bureau of Emergency Communication’s Computer Aided Dispatch system that is used for fielding emergency calls. The bureau begins taking calls manually, according to the mayor’s office.
    

            Meanwhile, United Airlines announces that it is resuming “some flights.”
    

            Delta Air Lines resumes some flight departures and issues travel waivers to affected customers.
    

            A spokesperson for Atlanta’s Hartsfield Jackson International Airport said that systems were operational and the airport put in place additional customer service personnel to address the challenges they’re facing.
    

            The spokesperson urged customers to “have patience. We’re trying to have grace and patience with all of the passengers. We’re asking the same.”
    

            Later Friday morning, Charlotte Douglas International Airport, an American Airlines hub, advises passengers to not go to the airport “unless they have confirmed their flight information with the airline.” Officials at Miami International Airport, another American Airlines hub, likewise warn travelers that US Customs and Border Protection operations have been affected nationwide, “so international passenger arrivals are currently being processed manually at a slower pace.”
    

            A little before 9 a.m., Alaska State Troopers and Phoenix Police Department in Arizona say that service at its 911 centers are once again operational after emergency and non-emergency call centers were impacted.
    

            Portland’s Computer Aided Dispatch system also comes back online at 9 a.m.
    

            “At no time was the community’s ability to make 911 calls impacted,” the mayor’s office says in a news release. “The critical, life-saving services of public safety bureaus, including Police and Fire & Rescue, continue.”
    

            The Federal Communications Commission announces it is working with federal agencies to provide assistance and determine the extent of the outage after it was made aware of “reports of a systems outage causing disruptions in service, including 911.”
    

            President Joe Biden is briefed on the CrowdStrike outage and his team is in touch with CrowdStrike and impacted entities, says a White House official. The president’s team is also engaged with agencies “to get sector by sector updates throughout the day and is standing by to provide assistance as needed,” according to the official.
    

            Around this time, an increasing number of federal agencies begin getting involved and reporting service disruptions. The US Department of Homeland Security says in a statement on X they are “working with CrowdStrike, Microsoft and our federal, state, local and critical infrastructure partners to fully assess and address system outages.”
    

            Social Security offices close to the public, as the agency warns the public that “longer wait times on our national 800 number are expected.”
    

            In an internal memo viewed by CNN, the US Department of Justice says it is feeling some impact from the technology outage and, while it’s working on workarounds, notes it does not have an “estimated restoration time.”
    

            Mail carriers UPS and FedEx tell CNN they were also impacted by the outage. UPS says its airline is operational and its drivers are on the roads, but there may be some service delays.
    

            A little after 11 a.m., CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz says in a post on X, the firm “(understands) the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption,” adding that the incident was not a cyber attack, and that customers’ data remains protected.
    

            “The issue has been identified and a fix has been deployed,” he said. “There was an issue with a Falcon content update for Windows Hosts.”
    

            The Massachusetts Department of Transportation announces that some Registry of Motor Vehicle operations are impacted. Other states also report impacts to their driving services, including Georgia, North Carolina, Texas and Tennessee.
    

            Around the same time, several of the nation’s healthcare and hospital systems announce they have been impacted by the global outage, including Mass General Brigham hospital system in Massachusetts, Penn Medicine in Pennsylvania, Northwell Health in New York, and Emory Healthcare in Atlanta.
    

            While some hospitals report delays in services, others cancel some non-urgent surgeries and medical office visits. Several cancer centers, including Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and New York’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center say they have paused certain procedures and scheduled appointments.
    

            In British Columbia, the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) announces its health system has been impacted, and is working on implementing contingency plans in order to ensure care for patients.
    

            Around 4 p.m., New York Blood Center, a supplier of blood to approximately 200 hospitals in the Northeast United States, says it has put in place an emergency driving operation to distribute blood.
    

            “The test tubes are not making it onto planes from yesterday and today, requiring for us to drive them,” New York Blood Center’s senior vice president Andrea Cefarelli told CNN in a phone call. “There is going to be a 12-24 hour delay in getting the test results.”
    

            Blood Centers of America, which rely on shipping companies like FedEx, says it is experiencing delays in reporting test results. Executive Vice President Jenny Ficenec says blood usage may be down due to hospitals canceling elective surgeries, so the delay should not cause any shortages unless the problem persists.
    

            Blood Assurance, which provides blood to hospitals in a number of Southeast states, including Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia, says its planned shipment of at least 20 platelets has been postponed due to flight delays and cancellations caused by the outage.
    

            “We are asking community members to help through donation,” Blood Assurance says in an email to CNN. “We have a fantastic community of donors that always shows up when we need them.”
    

            Meanwhile, CrowdStrike CEO Kurtz takes to social media again and promises customers “full transparency” on how the global IT outage involving the company’s software occurred.
    

            CrowdStrike would take steps “to prevent anything like this from happening again,” according to a statement on the company’s website.
    

            In a statement Saturday morning, Microsoft estimates the outage affected 8.5 million Windows devices.
    

            That’s less 1% of all Windows machines, according to Microsoft, but the company adds that “the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services.”
    

            Various sectors are still feeling the aftershocks of the outage. Although airlines have largely resumed services, many tell customers that they expect disruptions in schedules to continue.
    

            As of noon on Saturday, at least 3,375 flights across the United States have been delayed and more than 1,200 canceled, according to data from flight tracker FlightAware. Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the nation’s busiest airport, remains the most affected. Delta Air Lines has canceled more than 500 flights, while United Airlines has canceled almost 300, according to FlightAware.

            At least six people died after a gunman entered a home for the elderly in Croatia on Monday and started shooting, according to the country’s public broadcaster.
    

            A man with a firearm entered a private home for the elderly in the town of Daruvar, about 75 miles east of the capital Zagreb, and opened fire at those who were present, Croatian Radiotelevision (HRT) reported.
    

            Several people were also injured during the shooting, HRT said, without providing the exact number.
    

            Five of the victims died immediately, according to HRT. State news agency HINA has reported that some of those injured were receiving medical assistance in the hours after the shooting.
    

            The gunman ran away but was later arrested near a cafe, according to HINA.
    

            The investigation is ongoing and police have not provided additional details, HRT said.
    

            “We are appalled by the murder of five people” in the home for the elderly, Croatia’s Prime Minister Andrej Plenković said in a post on social media, before the death of the sixth victim.
    

            “We express our condolences to the families of the victims and hope for the recovery of the wounded. I expect the competent authorities to determine all the circumstances of the terrible crime,” Plenković said.
    

            Croatia’s Deputy Prime Minister Davor Božinović, Minister of Health Vili Beroš, and social policy minister Marin Piletić are travelling to Daruvar, the prime minister added.

            Alongside a female flag bearer who will be announced on Tuesday, James will be front and center in a unique event.
    

            The Opening Ceremony will be held along the River Seine, marking the first time that the ceremony has not taken place inside a stadium. The Parade of Nations – which typically features national delegations of athletes entering the Olympic Stadium on foot – will take place on the water itself, with boats carrying the 10,500 athletes through the center of the city.
    

            The ceremony begins at 1:30 p.m. ET on July 26 and will be broadcast on NBC.
    

            “It’s an incredible honor to represent the United States on this global stage, especially in a moment that can bring the whole world together,” James said in a Team USA statement. “For a kid from Akron, this responsibility means everything to not only myself, but to my family, all the kids in my hometown, my teammates, fellow Olympians and so many people across the country with big aspirations.
    

            “Sports have the power to bring us all together, and I’m proud to be a part of this important moment.”
    

            The 39-year-old was chosen for the role by his fellow US Olympians. Per Team USA, more than 350 athletes (out of the 592 headed to the Games) will participate in the ceremony.
    

            The Los Angeles Lakers superstar is the first male basketball player to carry the American flag and third basketball player to be selected for the honor after Dawn Staley (2004) and Sue Bird (2020).
    

            James will be making his fourth Olympic appearance when he takes to the court in Paris, as he looks to help the USA retain its gold medal in the men’s competition as part of a star-studded squad that features former MVPs Kevin Durant, Steph Curry and Joel Embiid.
    

            The men’s team begins Olympic competition against Serbia on Sunday.
    

            Despite winning all of its warmup games, preparations for Team USA have not always been smooth, with the squad notably being pushed to the final buzzer by South Sudan in a breathless 101-100 victory.
    

            The American delegation will be on the second-to-last boat in the Parade of Nations, as the US will host next Olympics in LA in 2028. They will be followed by 2024 host nation France.

On July 13th, we failed,” Cheatle told members of the committee. “As the director of the United States Secret Service, I take full responsibility for any security lapse.”The hearing marks Cheatle’s first time testifying before Congress in nearly three decades with the agency. She has been director since September 2022.A gunman gained access to an unsecured roof less than 150 yards from the stage of Trump’s campaign rally in Pennsylvania, where he opened fire with an AR-style rifle, injuring Trump, killing one man in the crowd and seriously wounding two others.Cheatle said the agency is fully cooperating with the FBI’s criminal investigation into the shooting, as well as additional reviews by Congress, the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General and an independent bipartisan panel announced Sunday.“We must learn what happened, and I will move heaven and earth to ensure an incident like July 13th does not happen again,” she testified."

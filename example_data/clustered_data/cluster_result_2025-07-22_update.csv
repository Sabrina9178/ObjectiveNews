One week after a bullet nearly took his life, former President Donald Trump delivered a speech filled with divisive rhetoric that was largely in line with his usual tone.
Despite Trump having told reporters that he would pivot to a message of unity, the former president used his Saturday speech in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to call President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris names, refer to Biden’s allies as “thugs,” argue without evidence that Democrats cheated in the 2020 election, and characterize migrants as coming from prisons, jails and mental institutions.

As President Joe Biden faces a wave of new calls from elected officials to end his re-election bid, his political allies are actively exploring ways to publicly demonstrate he still has widespread support among key elements of the Democratic Party’s base, according to three Democrats familiar with the discussions.
The new effort is aimed at turning the pressure campaign against Biden back on party insiders by seizing on anger and frustration among some voters who feel disenfranchised by attempts to push the candidate they cast their ballots for aside, the Democrats said.

1,NBC_12,"Democrats praise Biden's achievements as president, with some endorsing Harris as his successor",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/democrats-praise-bidens-achievements-president-endorsing-harris-succes-rcna162932,"WASHINGTON — Top Democrats on Sunday praised President Joe Biden for his accomplishments in the White House after he ended his re-election campaign, with some following his lead by expressing support for Vice President Kamala Harris to take his place as the party’s 2024 presidential nominee.
Many Republicans, meanwhile, said that Biden’s decision means he shouldn’t continue serving the rest of his term in the White House, which ends in January.
After Biden announced he was exiting the presidential race in a letter Sunday afternoon, he endorsed Harris in a post on X. Harris said in a statement later on that she’s honored to have earned Biden’s endorsement and said her “intention is to earn and win this nomination.”
Harris celebrated Biden and his legacy, saying it’s “unmatched in modern American history, surpassing the legacy of many Presidents who have served two terms in office.”
“With this selfless and patriotic act, President Biden is doing what he has done throughout his life of service: putting the American people and our country above everything else,” she said.

The top Democratic leaders in Congress, however, didn’t offer an endorsement of Harris — or any other candidate.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement, that Biden “has not only been a great president and a great legislative leader but he is a truly amazing human being.”
“Joe, today shows you are a true patriot and great American,” said Schumer, who served with Biden in the Senate and spoke to him Sunday afternoon, according to a source familiar with their conversation.
House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who until Sunday had been supportive of Biden remaining in the race, said the president is “one of the most accomplished and consequential leaders in American history,” pointing to his handling of Covid and the economy and defeating Trump in 2020.
Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who has significant influence in the party, said in a post on X that “God blessed America with Joe Biden’s greatness and goodness.”
“President Joe Biden is a patriotic American who has always put our country first. His legacy of vision, values and leadership make him one of the most consequential Presidents in American history,” she wrote. “With love and gratitude to President Biden for always believing in the promise of America and giving people the opportunity to reach their fulfillment.”
Pelosi had been hinting since Biden’s devastating debate performance that she was concerned about his prospects in November.
Former President Barack Obama touted Biden’s accomplishments in a lengthy statement, ranging from helping end the pandemic to creating millions of jobs to enacting the first major piece of gun safety legislation in 30 years.
“More than that, President Biden pointed us away from the four years of chaos, falsehood, and division that had characterized Donald Trump’s administration,” Obama wrote. “For him to look at the political landscape and decide that he should pass the torch to a new nominee is surely one of the toughest in his life. But I know he wouldn’t make this decision unless he believed it was right for America. It’s a testament to Joe Biden’s love of country  —  and a historic example of a genuine public servant once again putting the interests of the American people ahead of his own that future generations of leaders will do well to follow.”
Obama didn’t endorse anyone for the Democratic nomination in his statement.
In a joint statement, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that they are “honored to join the President in endorsing Vice President Harris and will do whatever we can to support her.”
“We’ve lived through many ups and downs, but nothing has made us more worried for our country than the threat posted by a second Trump term,” they warned.
Biden decided not to run for president in the 2016 cycle against Hillary Clinton, who went on to become the Democratic presidential nominee, but lost to Donald Trump.
Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a former member of Democratic leadership who was credited with helping to turn Biden’s 2020 primary campaign around and propel him to the nomination, endorsed Harris for president on Sunday. 
“I echo the good judgment [Biden] demonstrated in selecting Vice President Harris to lead this nation alongside him, and I am proud to follow his lead in support of her candidacy to succeed him as the Democratic Party’s 2024 nominee for President,” Clyburn wrote.
The South Carolina Democrat, a key member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said he’s had the honor and privilege of calling Biden a friend for many years. 
“President Biden has improved the lives of countless Americans through his selfless service, and I thank him for his unparagoned leadership,” he said, listing many of Biden’s accomplishments as president. 
Presidential historian and former journalist Jon Meacham, who has helped write key speeches for Biden in the White House, said in an interview on MSNBC on Sunday that Biden’s withdrawal is a “singular moment in the history of the American presidency” for a man who “has given the lion’s share of his life to the service of the republic.”
“It tells us a lot about what he truly values — President Biden has decided that this campaign is not about him but about us,” he said. “It’s not about personal ambition, it’s about the durability and viability of the constitutional order that so many of us believe could be in danger as events unfold.”
Trump, for his part, wrote in a post on Truth Social that “Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve — And never was!”
Trump claimed that Biden “attained” the job as president “by lies, Fake News, and not leaving his Basement.” He went to say, “We will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”
House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., called on Biden to resign as president, a message shared by other Republican lawmakers on Sunday.
“If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President,” Johnson said. “He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough.”
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who served in the Senate with Biden and worked with him to reach compromises in negotiations on a variety of pieces of legislation, said in a statement that the country is “less prosperous and less secure than it was in January, 2021.”
“We cannot afford four more years of failure,” said McConnell, who criticized Democrats for pushing Biden out of the race by saying they have been “trying to upend the expressed will of the American people in primary elections across the country.”Rebecca Shabad is a politics reporter for NBC News based in Washington."

President Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris after announcing he is dropping out of the 2024 run for re-election. 
""My fellow Democrats, I have decided not to accept the nomination and to focus all my energies on my duties as President for the remainder of my term,"" Biden posted on X Sunday afternoon 
""My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it’s been the best decision I’ve made.

He thanked Harris for her work in the administration, but stopped short of offering her his endorsement in his initial letter. Harris has been considered the top choice to replace Biden ahead of the president officially dropping out. 
Democrats' calls had mounted for weeks that Biden should drop out of the race, following his disastrous debate performance on June 27, which put his mental fitness under further scrutiny as he stumbled over his words and appeared more subdued than in previous years. 
As early as Sunday morning, however, Biden allies and the campaign doubled down that the president would not bow out of the race. 
TRUMP GETS BOOST IN POLLS AFTER BIDEN'S BOTCHED DEBATE 
""It is false. And I think that it is false to continue to try to gin up this narrative. Joe Biden has said he is in this race,"" deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said on MSNBC on Sunday. ""He is in this race to win it. He is instructing us to continue to carry out a plan to make sure that we are communicating [to as] many voters as possible. Actions speak louder than words, although sometimes, in this case, I wish that our words would speak louder so that people would stop asking this question. But we are doing both. The president has doubled down and said that he is running in this race to win it, and that he is not going anywhere.""

Biden dropping out comes as former President Trump was officially nominated as the Republican Party's choice for president. Trump joined the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, last week, where he announced Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate and accepted the nomination. 
The RNC was held just two days after an assassination attempt nearly ended Trump's life, leaving him with an injury to his right ear. A shooter opened fire on Trump's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last Saturday, injuring Trump and two others, and killing a 50-year-old married dad who was protecting his wife and family from the gunfire.

1,CNN_27,Biden endorses Harris to be the next Democratic presidential nominee,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/kamala-harris-biden-endorsement-democratic-nominee/index.html,"
            President Joe Biden has thrown his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris to become the next Democratic nominee for president after announcing Sunday he is dropping out of the race.
    

            Should Harris officially become the party’s standard-bearer, she would be the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead the ticket of a major political party.
    

            The historic endorsement comes after weeks of disarray within the Democratic Party, following a disastrous debate performance by Biden that called into question his ability to win a second term and govern for another four years. Biden ended his campaign Sunday amid growing calls from members of his party to step aside.
    

            Logistically, Harris is the natural heir to the ticket as Biden’s running mate. She would inherit the Biden campaign’s massive political operation and war chest. Recent polling has also shown her performing better against former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, than Biden and other potential Democratic contenders.
    

            Should there be efforts to pass over Harris in favor of Democrats seen as likely to run in 2028, there may be backlash from the vice president’s supporters and prominent Black Democrats. But Harris has also experienced something of a renaissance within her party, as Democrats showered her with praise in the days following the debate.
    

            Throughout her vice presidency, Harris has struggled to define herself while juggling an issue portfolio that has included difficult topics such as voting rights and stemming the tide of migrants coming from Central America. On the former, an effort to bolster the Voting Rights Act failed in Congress. On migration, Harris was criticized on the right for not spending enough time on the border and on the left for telling migrants in a speech, “Do not come.”
    

            As recently as last year, some Democrats were worried that negative views of Harris could hurt the ticket, prompting prominent Democrats to urge the party to stop undermining her.
    

            But in the weeks since Biden’s June debate performance, Harris has settled into a groove, becoming a key surrogate for Biden’s reelection campaign on reproductive health as the campaign put it, the threat Trump poses to democracy.
    

            Harris allies have argued that much of the criticism is a result of racism and sexism against the country’s first woman of color in such a position. Now, they say, the country is seeing in Harris what her allies have seen for years.
    

            “Oftentimes Black women are not seen until they’re needed,” said LaTosha Brown, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter, a progressive group that works to boost Black voter turnout. “We’ve seen her constantly berated, marginalized, questioned. I think that the shift is because there’s a need.”

More than 35 congressional Democrats have called for Biden to step aside, according to a Washington Post tally. Former president Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), held a rally Saturday in the battleground state of Michigan. Vice President Harris spoke at a fundraiser in Cape Cod, Mass., as Biden remains sidelined after testing positive this week for the coronavirus."

3,NBC_4,Secret Service denied requests for more security at Trump events before attempted assassination,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/secret-service-denied-requests-security-resources-trump-events-rcna162888,"The Secret Service repeatedly denied requests for more personnel and other security resources from agents guarding former President Donald Trump prior to the assassination attempt on the candidate at a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, a Secret Service official told NBC News.
The earlier requests for additional resources, which stretched over two years, could not be fully accommodated because the Secret Service lacked the resources to fulfill them, the official said.
“The Secret Service has a vast, dynamic, and intricate mission. Every day we work in a dynamic threat environment to ensure our protectees are safe and secure across multiple events, travel, and other challenging environments,” said Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesperson for the Secret Service. “We execute a comprehensive and layered strategy to balance personnel, technology, and specialized operational needs.”
“In some instances where specific Secret Service specialized units or resources were not provided, the agency made modifications to ensure the security of the protectee,” he added. “This may include utilizing state or local partners to provide specialized functions or otherwise identifying alternatives to reduce public exposure of a protectee.”
The day after Trump was wounded by a 20-year-old gunman, Guglielmi said claims that resource requests from Trump’s Secret Service detail had been denied were “absolutely false.”
The Washington Post was first to report that the Secret Service had repeatedly denied requests for additional security at Trump events for two years prior to his attempted assassination.
The Post reported that Secret Service agents assigned to Trump had requested magnetometers and additional agents to assist with security screenings of attendees at large public gatherings Trump attended, as well as more snipers and specialty teams at other outdoor events.
The revelation that the Secret Service repeatedly turned down additional resources requested from agents guarding Trump comes as the agency experiences a decadelong staffing shortfall, as previously reported by NBC News.
Despite a near doubling of the Secret Service’s budget in recent years, the personnel shortage has continued. The number of senior officials requiring security has also increased as the potential threats against them have diversified.
The Secret Service and federal and local law enforcement agencies have struggled with recruitment in the wake of the police murder of George Floyd. Lengthy Secret Service background checks, which can take up to a year, have also delayed hiring.
The agency has also struggled to retain experienced agents due to the high pressure and grueling nature of the work, as well as the lure of higher salaries in the private sector.Julia Ainsley is the homeland security correspondent for NBC News and covers the Department of Homeland Security for the NBC News Investigative Unit.

JD Vance.
The U.S. Secret Service recently responded to a Washington Post report that claimed the agency's top officials ""repeatedly"" denied requests to former President Trump's security detail.
The report comes exactly a week after former President Donald Trump was shot in Butler, Pennsylvania, while speaking at a rally, prior to his 2024 presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. 
The gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, had been observed by attendees before the shooting began.
The Post reported that, before the July 13 assassination attempt on Trump, top Secret Service officials ""repeatedly"" denied requests for tighter security measures from Trump's detail. An official granted the interview to the media outlet on the condition of anonymity.
According to the report, agents tasked with protecting Trump requested additional security resources in the past. These requests involved things such as magnetometers or a larger number of personnel to screen guests. Additional snipers had also reportedly been requested in the past.

Senior officials reportedly told the agents that the Secret Service lacked the resources to fulfill the requests. The Post reviewed multiple requests, but none of them pertained to the Butler rally. 
On Saturday night, the Secret Service released a statement obtained by Fox News Digital explaining that the agency ""has a vast, dynamic, and intricate mission.""
""Every day we work in a dynamic threat environment to ensure our protectees are safe and secure across multiple events, travel, and other challenging environments,"" the statement read. ""We execute a comprehensive and layered strategy to balance personnel, technology, and specialized operational needs.""

4,NBC_5,Sen. Joe Manchin joins calls for Biden to drop out of the 2024 race,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/sen-joe-manchin-biden-drop-out-presidential-race-rcna162892,"Sen. Joe Manchin, I-W.Va., on Sunday joined growing calls for President Joe Biden to drop out of the presidential race.
Manchin, who left the Democratic Party in May but continues to caucus with Democrats, said that during the first week after the president’s poor June debate performance, he initially thought Biden “needed time to evaluate and make a decision if he was going to at that time.”
“And then I thought, well, we’d hear from my colleagues who are in very difficult, challenging areas of the country, whether it be in Congress, as far as their districts, or in the states, as far as my senators, and they’re speaking out now,” he said in an interview on ABC News’ “This Week.” “And then when you see the donor class, basically, speaking up and saying that they went a different direction, if you will.”
Manchin said he believes that if Biden exits the race now, it would allow him to address a series of key issues, and his departure would give him the chance to “show the rest of the world the orderly transfer of power from the superpower of the world.”
“He will go down with a legacy unlike many people, as one of the finest and truly a [patriotic] American,” Manchin said. “So, with that, I come with a heavy heart to think the time has come for him to pass the torch to a new generation.”
Manchin called for an open process to replace Biden on the Democratic presidential ticket and suggested Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear as potential nominees.
“It’s time, it’s just time,” Manchin said.
Manchin, who had decided against launching a presidential bid against Biden, blamed “both sides” for escalating rhetoric that led to the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump at a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.
“This should be a wake-up call for all of us,” Manchin said. “I am angry, as I know others are, that we are in this position. We must acknowledge that both sides share responsibility for where we are and where we go from here.”
Manchin, however, acknowledged Biden’s “irreparable” debate performance and criticized Democrats voicing their support for the president after the debate.
“At a time when the Democratic Party must realize they risk losing the Senate and even the House, in addition to losing the presidency, they are doing nothing to broaden the tent and appeal to more Americans,” Manchin said. “Instead, they continue to pull the party to the left. Sadly, their vocal support for President Biden in the face of his irreparable debate performance are just evidence of how much control the far left has over the current administration.”
Manchin joins four Democratic senators who have called for Biden to exit the race.
Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., was the first Democratic senator to call for Biden to end his re-election bid. Welch, a fixture in Vermont politics, argued that Biden should exit the race “for the good of the country” in an opinion piece published in The Washington Post this month.
Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., who is running for re-election in one of the most vulnerable Senate seats for Democrats, also called on Biden to depart the race. Tester said in a statement that while he appreciates Biden’s “commitment to public service and our country,” Biden shouldn’t seek re-election. He said that he has worked with Biden “when it has made Montana stronger, and I’ve never been afraid to stand up to him when he is wrong.”
Sens. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Sherrod Brown of Ohio have also pushed for Biden to exit the race. More than 30 congressional Democrats thus far have said they want a nominee to replace Biden on the Democratic presidential ticket.
However, members of the Congressional Black Caucus and BOLD PAC, the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, have continued to voice their support for Biden’s re-election campaign.
The president and his campaign have maintained that he has no intention to drop out of the race. In a statement Sunday, Mia Ehrenberg, a spokesperson for the Biden campaign, said the campaign believes that Democrats will “absolutely come together” to fight against Trump in November.
“While the majority of the Democratic caucus and the diverse base of the party continues to stand with the President and his historic record of delivering for their communities, we’re clear-eyed that the urgency and stakes of beating Donald Trump means others feel differently,” Ehrenberg said in a statement. “We all share the same goal: an America where everyone gets a fair shot and freedom and democracy are protected. Unlike Republicans, we’re a party that accepts — and even celebrates — differing opinions, but in the end, we will absolutely come together to beat Donald Trump this November.”
Jen O’Malley Dillon, Biden’s campaign chair, on Friday also maintained that the president isn’t going anywhere.
“You have heard from the president directly time and again: He is in this race to win, and he is our nominee, and he’s going to be our President for a second term,” O’Malley Dillon said during an interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”Summer Concepcion is a politics reporter for NBC News."

Joe Manchin calls on Biden to step aside, pass torch to 'a new generation'",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sen-joe-manchin-calls-biden-step-aside-pass-torch-a-new-generation,"Fox News correspondent Christina Coleman reports as more than 35 Democrats are calling on President Biden to end his re-election bid on 'Fox News Live.'
Independent Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia on Sunday called on President Biden to step aside. 
""He will go down with a legacy unlike many people as one of the finest and surely a patriot, an American,"" Manchin said of Biden during an appearance on ABC's ""This Week."" ""And so with that, I come with a heavy heart to think the time has come for him to pass the torch to a new generation."" 
Manchin changed his party registration from Democrat to independent this year, though he still caucuses with the Democrats in the Senate.
ABC host Martha Raddatz asked Manchin directly if he believes Biden should step aside as the Democratic nominee. Manchin said Biden ""has the ability for the last five months of his presidency to be the president he always wanted to be, be able to unite the country, bring it back together, to be able to maybe spend all of his time on solving the problems in Gaza, bringing peace to Gaza and to the Middle East."" 
CAMPAIGN CRISIS: DEMS WHO HAVE CALLED FOR BIDEN TO DROP OUT OR RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT HIS HEALTH
From now until the end of his term, Manchin said, Biden could also ""dedicate his time to enforcing, reinforcing Ukraine's ability to defend and win their freedom, and then be able to show the rest of the world the orderly transfer of power from the superpower of the world.""
In the three weeks since Biden's disastrous debate performance against former President Donald Trump, Manchin said he ""thought the president needed time to evaluate and make a decision if he was going to at that time."" The senator also acknowledged Democratic colleagues facing competitive races in Congress or at the state-level in November who fear Biden's re-election campaign could ruin their chances.

With the donor class also speaking up saying ""they want a different direction,"" Manchin said he believes Biden must withdraw, noting too it's ""concerning"" to watch the 81-year-old on the campaign trail.
""It's concerning. It's concerning when you watch him. I'm concerned about the President's health and well-being, I really am,"" Manchin said. ""But when I've been talking to him, you know, I can tell when he's in a good mood. He'll say, Hey, Joe, Joe, how's it going? And when he's upset with me, he'll say, Joe, what's up? So we're still communicating the way we always have.""

Though he believes Biden should stop his re-election campaign, Manchin said he believes Biden still has the mental acuity required to remain president for the remainder of his term. 
""I think basically he can finish this job that he started and finish the way he wanted to lead,"" Manchin said.

6,NBC_7,President Joe Biden drops out of 2024 presidential race,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/president-joe-biden-drops-2024-presidential-race-rcna159867,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden announced Sunday that he will end his presidential re-election campaign, bringing an abrupt and humbling conclusion to his half-century-long political career and scrambling the race for the White House just four months before Election Day.
Biden, 81, could not reverse growing sentiment within his party that he was too frail to serve and destined to lose to Donald Trump in November. He backed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him as the Democratic nominee.

“While it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,” Biden wrote in a letter posted on X. “I will speak to the Nation later this week in more detail about my decision.”
Biden thanked Harris for “being an extraordinary partner” in his letter and then endorsed her in a subsequent post.
""My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President,"" Biden posted. ""And it’s been the best decision I’ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year.""
Biden and Harris spoke today ahead of the president’s announcement, according to a source familiar with the campaign.
His withdrawal caps a singular national political career, bookended by Richard Nixon’s fall and Trump’s rise. He mounted four presidential bids. He spent 36 years in the U.S. Senate representing tiny Delaware. He rose to the chairmanships of the powerful Judiciary and Foreign Relations committees. And he served eight years as Barack Obama’s vice president.
Reactions from politicians quickly began pouring in.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in a post on X that Biden “has been an extraordinary, history-making president — a leader who has fought hard for working people and delivered astonishing results for all Americans.”
“He will go down in history as one of the most impactful and selfless presidents,” said Newsom, who was one of the most prominent Biden surrogates. Newsom has also been floated as a possible Democratic presidential contender.
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, another prominent Democrat talked about as a future national candidate, called Biden a “great public servant” in a post to X.
“My job in this election will remain the same: doing everything I can to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump, a convicted felon whose agenda of raising families’ costs, banning abortion nationwide, and abusing the power of the White House to settle his own scores is completely wrong for Michigan,” Whitmer wrote.
The president's granddaughter Naomi Biden said in a post that she was “nothing but proud today of my Pop,” adding that he has “served our country with every bit of his soul and with unmatched distinction.” First lady Jill Biden posted her husband’s statement to X with a heart emoji. 
Across the aisle, Republicans slammed the move and many called on him to resign his office, days after the completion of a Republican National Convention where speaker after speaker slammed the Biden-Harris ticket.
""If Joe Biden is not fit to run for president, he is not fit to serve as President. He must resign the office immediately,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson. 
In a brief phone interview with NBC News, Trump reacted to Biden's decision, calling the president ""the worst president in the history of the United States by far.""
When asked whether he was surprised by Biden's decision, Trump said that Biden ""should never have been there in the first place.""
“He should have stayed in his basement,"" Trump said.
In a fundraising email, Trump’s campaign said that Biden “quit the race in complete disgrace.”
Biden’s decision to exit the race less than a month before his party’s convention and a few months before voters head to the polls is unprecedented in the modern political era. The last sitting president to abandon a re-election bid was Lyndon Johnson, whose expansion of the Vietnam War in the 1960s split the Democratic Party. But Johnson’s announcement came in March 1968 — eight months before that election.
“We’re in uncharted waters,” said Barbara Perry, a presidential studies professor at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center. “No president has dropped out or died this close to the convention.”
Replacing Biden atop the Democratic ticket is likely to set off internal Democratic tremors as ambitious officials maneuver to become his successor. Factions have already formed around Harris, Whitmer and Newsom.
Harris would seem to be the heir apparent. She broke a barrier as the first female vice president. A woman of color, she enjoys strong support among African Americans, a loyal piece of the Democratic coalition. Overall, though, Harris’ approval rating stood at only 32% in an NBC News poll released earlier this month. 
“There’s no one you can name right now who is an obvious substitute,” Perry said. “That’s what makes this so uncertain and chaotic.”
The mechanics of putting a new name on ballots also gives rise to myriad legal questions. Republicans could work to throw obstacles in the nominee’s path by mounting legal challenges aimed at keeping that person off the ballot.
Questions about Biden’s capacities dogged him throughout his presidency, but peaked following his debate with Trump on June 27. Combined with his flagging poll numbers, his listless performance sparked a panic among his own party that he couldn’t win in November. 
With 51 million people watching, Biden spoke in a raspy voice and often failed to complete thoughts or deliver a cogent explanation of why voters should choose him over Trump. He later attributed his poor performance to exhaustion and a cold. He implored the country not to let one bad night overshadow his accomplishments in office.
Unpersuaded, Democratic lawmakers began calling on him to step aside, a rebellion that started slowly but grew steadily in size and intensity. Thirty-seven congressional Democrats, including independent Sen. Joe Manchin, who previously was in the Democratic Party, had called on Biden to drop out of the 2024 election before he delivered his decision Sunday afternoon.
They appealed to Biden’s patriotism, arguing that if he sincerely believed Trump is a threat to democracy, he needed to put his country first and stand down.
Biden fought back. He held numerous calls and meetings with Democratic officials at all levels to shore up support inside the party — to no avail.
Looking to blunt concerns about his acuity, he gave interviews and held press conferences to prove to voters that he could still think on his feet. But the gaffes kept coming and his poll numbers remained stagnant.
In another bit of bad fortune and timing, Biden tested positive for Covid-19 on July 17, forcing him off the campaign trail.
For Democrats, Biden’s illness created an unwanted contrast. While Trump delivered a triumphal speech accepting the Republican nomination in Milwaukee on July 18, five days after surviving an assassination attempt, Biden was in self-isolation back home.
Biden’s departure is the latest in a series of jarring developments that has made the 2024 presidential race the most chaotic in living memory. Trump easily won the Republican presidential nomination despite splitting his time between the campaign trail and various courtrooms where he was a defendant in criminal and civil cases. In May, a jury in Manhattan convicted him on 34 felony counts related to hush money payments to a porn star.
Then, in short order, Trump rebounded. The Supreme Court issued a much-anticipated ruling on July 1 that immunized Trump from official conduct when he was president, impeding special counsel Jack Smith’s efforts to prosecute Trump for interfering in the 2020 election.
Trump nearly died on July 13 as he appeared at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. A gunman lying on a roof 130 yards away fired a bullet that grazed his ear. Trump dropped to the ground in self-defense. Then, his face smeared with blood, he rose and defiantly pumped his fist, yelling “Fight!”
Another fortuitous development came two days later, coinciding with the opening of the Republican convention in Milwaukee that certified Trump’s nomination. Federal Judge Aileen Cannon in Florida dismissed a separate case brought by Smith alleging that Trump improperly retained classified documents that he took home with him when he left the White House in 2021. Cannon, who had been appointed by Trump, ruled that Smith’s appointment was illegal. Smith quickly appealed her ruling.
The rolling streak of news gave Trump a jolt of momentum, allowing Republicans to present an energized and unified front at this month’s convention. 
Biden seldom sparked any such enthusiasm. HIs primary campaign was mostly a coronation. He faced token opposition as party leaders cleared the field, betting that having beaten Trump once before, Biden was best positioned to do it again. But poll after poll confirmed that voters harbored doubts about him, believing he was too old and infirm to serve another term.
An AP-NORC survey released July 17 found that a whopping 65% of Democrats believed Biden should exit the race.
Pressed by his voters, abandoned by party leaders, Biden gave in.Peter Nicholas is a senior White House reporter for NBC News."
6,FOX_31,Joe Biden bows out of the 2024 race – we lost a good president and a good man,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/joe-biden-bows-out-2024-race-lost-out-good-president-good-man,"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reacts to President Biden announcing he is dropping out of the 2024 presidential race and has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris.
I’ve been acutely aware of the possibility of President Joe Biden dropping out of the 2024 race since the debate at the end of June. I was still on maternity leave, but it was about all my friends could talk about. 
""What do you think he’s going to do?"" they asked. ""Do we like Kamala, now?"" they wondered. ""Is there time to swap him out and get on all the ballots?"" they panicked. 
Now we know the answer. Biden just announced that he won’t be seeking reelection this November. And even though I knew it was coming, it feels profoundly sad to me.  
'PROUD OF OUR PRESIDENT': DEMS HEAP PRAISE ON BIDEN FOR DECISION TO END 2024 CAMPAIGN
Sad on a human level. Joe Biden is a fundamentally good man who did not want this outcome. He believes he can win, even if the data doesn’t say so. And sad on a political level. Biden was an incredible president with a record to be enormously proud of. Whoever is at the top of our ticket will no doubt celebrate his accomplishments – and him! – but there’s a joy to how he talks about what the Biden-Harris administration has gotten done that I’ll really miss.

Like he always says, it’s personal for him. 
Getting the American Rescue Plan in response to COVID-19 passed was personal. Because of Biden, low-to-medium income earners got $1,400 to put towards groceries and rent. The child-tax credit was extended. And over $7 billion was allotted for small business loans. 
Getting the bipartisan infrastructure bill passed was personal. Because of Biden, our roads, bridges, public transport and airports are getting much-needed investment. Over $60 billion is going toward expanding broadband. And $55 billion for clean drinking water. It should be noted that not one single Republican voted for the bill.

Getting the bipartisan gun safety bill passed was personal. Because of Biden, the largest gun safety legislation in over three decades was signed into law. It includes incentives to states to pass red-flag laws and prohibit people convicted of domestic abuse from owning a gun. It also expands background checks on people ages 18-21. Did it do everything Biden wanted? Absolutely not. But he got it done. 
Getting the Inflation Reduction Act passed was personal. Because of Biden, the U.S. made the largest investment in combating climate change on record. Corporations now have to pay their fair share. Medicare can now negotiate the price of certain expensive drugs. Insulin is capped at $35 a month! Come on, man, as Biden would say.  
Getting the CHIPS and Sciences Act passed was personal. Because of Biden, over $50 billion in federal incentives was granted to semiconductor manufacturing, leading to thousands of new, good-paying jobs across America. There has been over $200 billion in private sector investment as a result. By the end of the decade, we’ll produce close to 20% of the world’s most advanced chips. That’s how you stick it to China. 
What’s more, under Biden we have record low unemployment and a record high stock market. We are producing more crude oil than any other country in history – 13 million barrels a day. Our economy is the envy of the world. NATO is stronger, and we are a force for good in the world.

Now we know the answer. Biden just announced that he won’t be seeking reelection this November. And even though I knew it was coming, it feels profoundly sad to me.  
I could go on, but you’ll no doubt hear about all these accomplishments and more as the campaign unfolds.  
I know that I speak for regular Democrats in thanking Joe Biden for an incredible four years and saying that we’re really, really sad. Father Time came for a really good one.

7,NBC_8,Xander Schauffele wins the British Open for his 2nd major this year,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/xander-schauffele-wins-british-open-rcna162916,"TROON, Scotland — Xander Schauffele won the British Open on Sunday for his second major of the year, delivering a masterpiece at Royal Troon with a 6-under 65 to overcome a two-shot deficit and give the Americans a sweep of the majors for the first time since 1982.
Schauffele won the PGA Championship at Valhalla two months ago by making a 6-foot birdie putt on the final hole. In a final round set up for big drama — nine players separated by three shots at the start — Schauffele made it look like a nice walk along the Irish Sea.
He played bogey-free in a strong, chilly wind and pulled away with three birdies in a four-hole stretch early on the back nine to go from two shots behind to leading by as many as three.
He won by two shots over American Billy Horschel and Justin Rose, the 43-year-old from England who had to go through 36-hole qualifying just to get into the field. They were among four players who had at least a share of the lead at one point Sunday.
They just couldn’t keep up with Schauffele. No one could.
Given the wind, heavy air off the Firth of Clyde and punishing nature of Royal Troon, Schauffele’s 65 ranks among the great closing rounds in British Open history. Playing in the third-to-last group, he matched the round of the championship with a score that was just over eight shots better than the field average.
The 30-year-old from San Diego became the first player since Jordan Spieth in 2015 to win his first two majors in the same season. And he extended American dominance on this Scottish links as the seventh Open champion in the last eight visits to Royal Troon.Rose closed with a 67 and it was only good for second place. Horschel, who started the final round with a one-shot lead in his bid to win his first major, dropped back around the turn and birdied his last three holes for a 68 for his best finish in a major.
The player Schauffele had to track down was Thriston Lawrence of South Africa, who birdied three of four holes to end the front nine with a 32.
Schauffele was two shots behind when it all changed so suddenly. Schauffele hit a wedge out of the left rough on the difficult 11th and judged it perfectly to 3 feet for birdie. He hit another wedge to 15 feet for birdie on the 13th, and capped his pivotal run with a 12-foot birdie putt on the par-3 14th.
Lawrence finally dropped a shot on the 12th and didn’t pick up any shots the rest of the day. He closed with a 68 and earned a small consolation — a trip to the Masters next April, his first time to Augusta National.
Scottie Scheffler, who got within one shot of the lead briefly on the front nine, lost his way with a three-putt from 6 feet for a double bogey on the ninth hole. Scheffler finished his round by topping a tee shot on the 18th and making another double bogey. The world’s No. 1 player closed with a 72 and tied for seventh.
Schauffele went from the heaviest major trophy at the PGA Championship to the smallest and oldest, the famed claret jug that he will keep for a year.
He finished at 9-under 275 and earned $3.1 million, pushing him over $15 million for the season.The Associated Press"

8,NBC_9,Some Republicans call on Biden to resign the presidency too after ending his 2024 campaign,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/republicans-call-biden-resign-ending-2024-campaign-rcna162923,"WASHINGTON — Some Republicans reacted immediately to President Joe Biden’s announcement that he won’t seek re-election in November by demanding that he resign the presidency as well.
“If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President. He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement shortly after Biden revealed his decision.
New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, the conference chair and fourth-ranking House Republican, added: “If Joe Biden can’t run for re-election, he is unable and unfit to serve as President of the United States. He must immediately resign.”
Follow for live updates
It was a widespread response within the Republican Party, with multiple others reacting similarly, including Rep. Pat Fallon, R-Texas:
Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., the chair of the Senate GOP campaign arm, said he is “formally calling on President Biden to resign from office ... out of concern for our country’s national security.”
“If Joe Biden is no longer capable of running for re-election, he is no longer capable of serving as President. Being President is the hardest job in the world, and I no longer have confidence that Joe Biden can effectively execute his duties as Commander-in-Chief,” Daines said in a statement.
Biden said in his Sunday statement that he will “stand down” from the presidential race and “focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.” While many Democrats called on Biden to withdraw from the 2024 race, none have pushed for him to quit the presidency early. The skeptical Democrats have not taken issue with Biden’s ability to do the job, but rather with his declining communication skills and ability to wage a vigorous campaign leading into November after his poor debate performance.
Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., proposed that Biden be forcibly removed from office through the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, which governs succession if a president cannot fulfill his duties.
“If Joe Biden is unfit to run for re-election, he is unfit to carry out his term,” Mullin said on X. “25th Amendment.”
Far-right Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., said: “How is he strong enough to continue serving as Commander in Chief of the strongest nation in the world? Joe Biden ought to step down.”
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., accused Democrats of contradicting the will of voters who chose Biden as their nominee in a statement, adding, ""We cannot afford four more years of failure.""
But McConnell, 82, a longtime friend of Biden's who is himself stepping down at the end of this term, did not join GOP calls for the president to resign before his term ends.
Some Republicans, including Johnson, slammed the Democratic Party for Biden’s decision to withdraw and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris to be the standard-bearer this fall.
“Having invalidated the votes of more than 14 million Americans who selected Joe Biden to be the Democrat nominee for president, the self-proclaimed ‘party of democracy’ has proven exactly the opposite,” Johnson said in his statement, seeking to undercut a major Democratic attack line against Donald Trump this campaign season — that the former president has worked to undermine U.S. democracy.
“The party’s prospects are no better now with Vice President Kamala Harris,” Johnson added.
Other Trump allies responded by saying Trump has been running against not just Biden, but an entire party and system.
“Presidents Trump has never just been running against Joe Biden. He’s been running against the destruction of America brought by Democrats and their policies,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said on X, adding that Democrats waged “a coup” against Biden.
Vivek Ramaswamy, a former presidential contender and Trump supporter, said: “We’re not running against a candidate. We’re running against a system.”Sahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News."
8,WaPo_21,"How Democrats would pick a new candidate if Biden drops out, step-by-step",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/21/open-convention-democrats-biden-drop-out/,"If President Biden decides to end his campaign for reelection, as dozens of members of his party have demanded, there are two paths for replacing him at the top of the Democratic ticket.One is a virtual vote that would lock in a new nominee in early August, and the other is an “open” convention, a scenario the party hasn’t experienced since 1968.A convention is open when no candidate arrives with a clear majority of delegates, so the event turns into a mini-primary in which contenders scramble to persuade delegates to vote for them.The potential for chaos is high, and the time is short. Some states have August deadlines to get on the ballot for the general election, and early voting begins in some places in September. So party leaders probably would try to settle the nomination before the Democratic National Convention begins Aug. 19.Here’s how the process could play out.Biden decides to drop out of the race.

Source: APThere are two types of Democratic delegates.Pledged delegates commit to supporting the candidate state voters chose, although a “good conscience” clause in the party’s rules gives them a bit of wiggle room.The party allocates pledged delegates to each state or territory, and state party officials divvy them out to candidates.Jurisdictions have different criteria, but in general, almost any registered voter deemed to be loyal to the party and the candidate can be a pledged delegate: poll workers, local elected officials, fundraisers, even candidates’ kids.Automatic delegates, often called superdelegates, are the party’s highest-profile leaders. They have the role because of the offices they hold (or held), and the group includes former presidents and vice presidents, Democratic governors, members of Congress and party officials.They are not pledged to any candidate and are not allowed to vote on the first ballot at the convention.Maybe.If the party goes ahead with a long-planned virtual vote, it could officially lock in the nominee before the convention starts on Aug. 19, and the contest would be over.The virtual vote is not a typical part of the process. It was largely set up to confirm Biden as the nominee before Ohio’s ballot deadline, which falls before the Democratic convention this year. Ohio legislators resolved the problem, but Democrats planned to go through with the early vote anyway to avoid any legal challenges that would try to keep Biden off Ohio’s ballot.However, it would allow very little time for the party to coalesce around a new nominee.Even if the virtual vote is canceled, the party could generally agree on a candidate before the convention. In that case, the convention might technically be considered open, but the proceedings could be as drama-free as usual.Democratic leaders would be motivated to settle the question quickly so a new nominee can begin a campaign as soon as possible, said Amy K. Dacey, the executive director of the Sine Institute of Policy and Politics at American University and a former CEO of the Democratic National Committee.“You’re ending a Republican convention where it’s very clear who their nominees are, whose names will appear on the ballot,” Dacey said. “... They now have this moment in time of like 31 days before the Democratic convention, where they have their nominees in place and they’re all campaigning.”Biden could try to tip the scales toward unity by asking his nearly 3,900 delegates to back his preferred candidate. They wouldn’t have to comply, but they were chosen for their loyalty to him and may be inclined to do what he asks.But if there is no consensus before the delegates arrive in Chicago, the Democrats would have their first open and contested convention since 1968. That one, also in Chicago, went so catastrophically awry that the party overhauled the way it chooses candidates.AT THE CONVENTION

A nominee is chosenJust to get their name in the roll call vote, each candidate would need the signatures of at least 300 delegates, and no more than 50 can come from a one state.We would probably know early who the contenders are, Dacey said, citing the short window of time available to drum up wider support. “If I’m somebody who wants to get my name in in a contested convention, the minute I have those 300 names, I’m going to say it,” she said.Behind-the-scenes maneuvering and dealmaking would rev up to warp speed as state party bosses try to corral their delegates into a voting bloc.Once everyone is in Chicago, candidates and their surrogates probably would blanket not just the convention floor but also hotels, bars and other assorted hidey holes looking for delegates to woo.Things have gone off the rails in past open conventions, when candidates clawed for every vote.In a Politico oral history of the 1976 Republican open convention, attendee Tom Korologos, former ambassador to Belgium, recalled a Gerald Ford delegate falling and badly injuring her leg. He said that rather than rushing her to a hospital, other delegates splinted her leg with convention programs and kept her within voting distance because they feared her replacement would cast a ballot for Ronald Reagan. (Ford won the nomination battle but lost the presidency to Democrat Jimmy Carter, who in 1980 lost to Reagan.)Soon enough, the first roll call vote would occur.If a candidate were to get a majority of delegates’ votes on the first ballot, that person would become the nominee, and everyone could finally relax a little.But if no one has a majority, a second vote would take place.At that point, the convention would be considered “brokered,” a term coined in long-ago conventions when party power brokers threw all their dealmaking, arm-twisting might into finagling votes. There hasn’t been one of those since 1952.The toned-down 2024 version of that scenario would be that, starting with the second ballot, the superdelegates enter the voting pool.Voting would continue, round after round, until a candidate got the votes of a majority of all delegates and would be named the party’s nominee.While it probably would make good television, party division playing out on the convention floor is hardly the ideal scenario.In 1924, the Democrats needed 103 rounds of voting to finally settle on compromise candidate John Davis after the two highest vote-getters withdrew. It didn’t work out well. Incumbent president Calvin Coolidge beat Davis in a landslide.Additional sources: Brookings Institution; “2024 Presidential Nominating Process: Frequently Asked Questions” by the Congressional Research Service; Ballotpedia, The Green Papers.Artur Galocha contributed to this report.

10,NBC_11,Tadej Pogacar wins Tour de France for the 3rd time and in style with a victory at time trial,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/tadej-pogacar-wins-tour-de-france-3rd-time-rcna162918,"NICE, France — Tadej Pogacar won the Tour de France for the third time and celebrated in style with a victory in Sunday’s final stage — a time trial ending in Nice.
The 25-year-old Slovenian rider became the first cyclist to secure the Giro d’Italia and Tour de France in the same year since the late Marco Pantani in 1998.
Two-time defending champion Jonas Vingegaard of Denmark was second overall. He also finished the 21st and final stage in second place.
Pogacar won the 34-kilometer (21-mile) time trial on the French Riviera’s roads from Monaco to Nice in 45 minutes, 24 seconds. Vingegaard was 1 minute, 3 seconds behind him and Belgian rider Remco Evenepoel 1:14 back in third spot.
In the overall standings, Vingegaard finished 6:17 behind Pogacar and Evenepoel was third overall, 9:18 behind Pogacar — whose other Tour wins came in 2020 and 2021.
The race did not finish in Paris as it usually does because of the Olympic Games. Nice mayor Christian Estrosi called the region between the Mediterranean Sea and the southern French Alps “perfect cycling territory.”
From early Sunday morning, fans camped along the popular Promenade des Anglais in Nice to guard a spot that would offer the best glimpse of cyclists.
Some fans chanted “Remco, Remco” as the race-against-the-clock specialist zoomed past them.
They may have been surprised to see Pogacar going flat out.
After his explosive attack on Friday, Pogacar said he would not try to win Saturday’s stage. But he could not resist and won that to become the second man to win five mountain stages in one Tour after Italian rider Gino Bartali in 1948.
Pogacar had no need to attack on Sunday, either, considering he led Vingegaard overnight by more than five minutes.
But the lure of another stage win proved too strong and he flew down the winding roads past picturesque Èze and Villefranche-sur-Mer on the approach to Nice, where the route flattened out again.
Pogacar held out three fingers as the finish line and a sixth stage win approached on this year’s Tour — the same number of stages he won when dominating the Giro d’Italia.
It was Pogacar’s biggest winning margin of his three Tour wins — beating the 5:20 gap on Vingegaard three years ago, but below the 7:29 victory margin Vingegaard enjoyed over Pogacar last year.
The battle with Vingegaard was not as close as it might have been in different circumstances.
The 27-year-old Vingegaard was hospitalized for nearly two weeks in April following a high-speed crash in the Tour of the Basque Country. He resumed competitive racing only on this Tour.The Associated Press"
10,CNN_30,Tadej Pogačar completes dominant Tour de France victory,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/sport/tadej-pogacar-tour-de-france-spt-intl/index.html,"
            A certain nonchalance has marked Tadej Pogačar’s ruthless overall victory at this year’s Tour de France, a race he has dominated from start to finish, accomplishing feats not achieved for more than a quarter of century.
    

            The 26-year-old became the first rider since Marco Pantani in 1998 to achieve the “double,” winning both the Tour de France and Giro d’Italia in the same year, an almost impossible feat in modern cycling  that seemed easy for Pogačar who still had the energy to muster a bow over the finish line when he took his fourth stage victory of the race on Friday or joke in post-race interviews.
    

            His fifth and sixth stage victories of the race followed on Saturday and Sunday, the biggest haul for any rider since 2009 and an enormous amount for a general classification rider like Pogačar. Not since 1948 has a rider won five mountain stages in a single edition of the race like Pogacar did this year.

            Eventually, he finished six minutes and 17 seconds ahead of his great rival Jonas Vingegaard in second place overall, having extended the margin by winning the time trial in the race’s final stage on Sunday in Nice.
    

            Their rivalry has shaped every edition of the Tour de France since 2021 when Denmark’s Vingegaard emerged as an unlikely challenger to a rampant Pogačar. The Slovenian won that year before Vingegaard took the next two editions, cracking his rival in the high mountains, and he lined up on the start line in Florence three weeks ago as the defending champion.
    

            But, this year, Pogačar, reemerged as the dominant rider on almost every terrain, dismantling Vingegaard who arrived at this race diminished, still recovering from a serious crash just three months ago in which he broke his collarbone as well as several ribs and suffered a collapsed lung.
    

            Like almost every other great sporting rivalry, theirs is one that pits two contrasting personalities against one another – the outgoing, flamboyant Pogačar itching to attack at any opportunity versus the more introverted, collected Vingegaard who marshals his efforts more strategically.
    

            Only young Remco Evenepoel, making his Tour de France debut, could remain within touching distance of these two, eventually finishing in third place, 9:18 behind Pogačar.
    

            He stood on the podium wearing the white jersey of the best young rider in the race, alongside Pogačar in the yellow jersey, Richard Carapaz in the polka-dot jersey worn by the race’s best climber and Biniam Girmay, who made history as the first Black African rider to win the green jersey as the leader of the points classification.

21,FOX_12,Campaign crisis: Dems who have called for Biden to drop out or raised concerns about his health,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/campaign-crisis-dems-who-have-called-biden-drop-out-raised-concerns-about-his-health,"Fox News correspondent Christina Coleman reports as more than 35 Democrats are calling on President Biden to end his re-election bid on 'Fox News Live.'
In the weeks since President Biden's catastrophic debate performance, panicked Democrats have increased pressure on the president to abandon his re-election bid. 
Top Democratic Party officials, megadonors, editorial writers and as many as 36 congressional lawmakers have urged the president to ""pass the torch"" to a new generation of leadership for fear that Biden cannot defeat Republican nominee former President Trump. 
Biden's top campaign aides have been working damage control with major donors, while the White House — and Biden himself — remain adamant he is the right man to lead the party.

Twenty-three Democratic governors from across the nation descended on the White House earlier this month to meet with the embattled president, but after the gathering, only Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who leads the Democratic Governors Association, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore spoke to reporters to express their support. 
Moore described the meeting with Biden as ""honest"" and ""candid"" and said the governors were ""going to have his back.""
Hochul said Biden was ""in it to win it"" and that the trio had pledged their support to him ""because the stakes could not be higher.""
California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who many commentators have proposed as a possible Biden replacement, also took part in the White House meeting and backed the 81-year-old. 
""I heard three words from the President tonight – he’s all in. And so am I,"" Newsom posted on X on July 3. Newsom also publicly backed Biden immediately after the debate. 
""You don’t turn your back because of one performance,"" Newsom said after the debate. ""What kind of party does that? This president has delivered. We need to deliver for him at this moment.""

24,FOX_16,Biden defiantly charges ahead with election run despite speculation he would drop out this weekend,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-defiantly-charges-ahead-election-run-despite-speculation-he-would-drop-weekend,"Fox News correspondent Christina Coleman reports as more than 35 Democrats are calling on President Biden to end his re-election bid on 'Fox News Live.'
President Biden has defiantly remained in the presidential race despite mounting calls from allies to drop out, and speculation that he would bow out as early as this weekend. 
The Biden campaign has hit back against anonymous sources and speculation that Biden would end his campaign in the coming days, suggesting a pressure campaign was building to force Biden's hand. 
""There are a lot of anonymous sources out there this week telling y’all what is and isn’t happening on Team Biden-Harris. I’m here – on the record (!) – to give you an overview of what actually happened, what’s to come, and a few thoughts on the very bad things coming out of the Republican National Convention,"" Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Muonoz said in a press release late last week. 
The comment was released shortly following Newsmax's Mark Halperin reporting that unnamed Democratic sources informed him that Biden will drop out of the race as soon as this weekend, that he would not endorse Vice President Kamala Harris to take the mantle, and would call for an open convention during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month.

""It will happen as early as this weekend. A speech has been drafted for him. He will continue on as president, is his intention. He also will not, I'm told, endorse Vice President Harris as his successor. They're hoping that he will endorse an open process in which the convention will be open to Vice President Harris and a few other candidates in Chicago to pick the Democratic nominee for president,"" Halperin said on Thursday. 
CAMPAIGN CRISIS: DEMS WHO HAVE CALLED FOR BIDEN TO DROP OUT OR RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT HIS HEALTH
Axios also speculated the president would drop out this weekend, with unnamed Biden aides allegedly saying the president was warming up to the idea of giving into the calls to bow out. 
The Biden campaign, however, has so far not given an inch on the speculation and calls for the president to drop out, with campaign and White House officials shooting down speculation on social media, releasing press releases and continuing to announce fundraising efforts. 
Biden’s deputy campaign manager doubled down on Sunday that reports of the president dropping out are ""false"" and that Biden has been clear he is remaining in the race. 
""It is false. And I think that it is false to continue to try to gin up this narrative. Joe Biden has said he is in this race,"" deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said on MSNBC on Sunday. ""He is in this race to win it. He is instructing us to continue to carry out a plan to make sure that we are communicating [to as] many voters as possible. Actions speak louder than words, although sometimes, in this case, I wish that our words would speak louder so that people would stop asking this question. But we are doing both. The president has doubled down and said that he is running in this race to win it, and that he is not going anywhere.""

Biden is currently self-isolating in his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, after he was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Wednesday. He was diagnosed while in Las Vegas, forcing the campaign to cancel events in the city as the president recovers. 
Thirty-six Democrats have called on Biden to drop out of the race in the days and weeks following his disastrous debate performance, which put his mental fitness under further scrutiny as he stumbled over his words and appeared more subdued than in previous years. 
Ahead of his COVID diagnosis, Biden hit the campaign trail at a faster clip than before the debate, holding rallies and meetings across the nation, coupled with his official duties as president, including hosting world leaders for a NATO summit earlier this month. Biden delivered a stronger than typical speech during the NATO summit, and received mixed reviews for his first solo press conference of the year. The events, however, have evidently not swayed Democrats that he's up for the job, as traditional allies continue releasing statements calling on him to drop out. 
""While the choice to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden’s alone, I believe it is time for him to pass the torch. And in doing so, secure his legacy of leadership by allowing us to defeat Donald Trump in the upcoming election,"" California Rep. Adam Schiff said in a statement last week.

""There have been lots of Democrats who have been giving little anonymous quotes to the press, to some journalist to print, and I'm not here to knock the press on it,"" she said. ""I'm here to knock my colleagues on it, because to me, I think that's, and I'm sorry, I'm going to say because it's after midnight. That's bulls---. Like, if you have an opinion, say it with your chest and say it in public,"" Squad member, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, said last week in defense of Biden. 
AMBER ROSE CLAPS BACK AT JOY REID AFTER CRITICIZING CONVENTION SPEECH: ‘STOP BEING A RACE BAITER’
The chair of the Democratic National Committee, Jamie Harrison, has also notably not called for Biden to pull out of the race, instead saying earlier this month that Biden is the party's nominee.
""This ain’t the West Wing… we have had a process, millions voted for Joe Biden and we have our nominee!"" Harrison tweeted on July 2.

Biden is not yet the official nominee for the ticket, but is expected to be formally nominated in a virtual roll call on Aug. 7, DNC Rules Committee members voted Friday. The move leaves Democrats with roughly two weeks to rally renewed support for Biden as their nominee, or for Biden to drop out and let another candidate step up to the job. 
AOC CALLS ‘BULL----’ ON DEMOCRATS PRIVATELY TURNING ON BIDEN
The speculation mounting around Biden dropping out comes as former President Trump was officially nominated as the Republican Party's choice for president.

53,CNN_20,"At least 6 killed, Houthis say, as Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen day after Tel Aviv drone attack",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/middleeast/yemen-israel-strikes-hodeidah-intl/index.html,"
            At least six people were killed and scores more injured in Israeli airstrikes on a Yemeni port, Houthi rebels have said, a day after the Iran-backed group claimed a deadly attack on the Israeli city of Tel Aviv.
    

            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its fighter jets struck “military targets of the Houthi terrorist regime” in the area of Yemen’s Hodeidah Port on Saturday, in what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said was a direct response to the death of a 50-year-old Israeli in a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv on Friday.
    

            This is the first time Israel has struck Yemen, according to Israeli officials.
    

            The Houthis said at least six people were killed, three are missing while a further 83 people were injured in the strikes, which hit oil facilities.
    

Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam said the strikes had also hit civilian targets and a power station. He slammed what he said was “brutal Israeli aggression” aimed at increasing the “suffering of the people of Yemen” and pressuring the group to stop its support of Gaza.
    

            Houthi army spokesperson Yehya Saree vowed to respond to the strike, saying the Houthis would not hesitate to strike Israel’s “vital targets” and warning that Tel Aviv – a major city home to scores of diplomatic missions – was still not safe.
    

            “We have prepared for a long war with this enemy until the aggression stops and the blockade on the Palestinian people is lifted,” Saree said.
    

            On Sunday Israel said it intercepted a missile launched from Yemen. “The projectile did not cross into Israeli territory. Rocket and missile sirens were sounded following the possibility of falling shrapnel. The incident has concluded,” the IDF said.
    

            Netanyahu said in a statement on Saturday that Hodeidah was “not an innocent port.”
    

            “It was used for military purposes, it was used as an entry point for deadly weapons supplied to the Houthis by Iran,” Netanyahu said, adding that Hodeidah had also been used to attack international shipping in the Red Sea.
    

            Netanyahu also said the operation, which hit targets 1,800 km (1,118 miles) from Israel’s borders, shows the enemy Israel is serious about responding to threats.
    

            “It makes it clear to our enemies that there is no place that the long arm of the state of Israel will not reach,” Netanyahu said.
    

            United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a UN statement he was “deeply concerned” by reports of the strikes.
    

            “The response to the Israeli aggression against our country is inevitably coming and will be huge and great,” Houthi rebels warned in a statement following the attack, adding that they will continue their operations against Israeli, American, and British ships until Israel stops its “siege” on Gaza.
    

            IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said the strikes were also in response to the roughly 200 missiles and drones the rebel group has launched towards Israel since October, when Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza began.

            Since the start of the war, the Yemeni rebels have regularly targeted the country with drones and missiles, most of which have been intercepted by Israel’s defenses or those of its allies. However, the Houthis have claimed their drone attack in Tel Aviv Friday – which also injured 10 people – was performed by a new drone capable of “bypassing the enemy’s interception systems.”
    

            The Houthis have also regularly attacked US targets and commercial shipping in the Red Sea.
    

            Both the UK and the US have responded to the attacks on shipping by carrying out strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. However, Israel has not taken part in those responses.
    

            An Israeli defense official told CNN that this was a 100% Israeli strike. The official said Israel had previously let the US and UK take the lead on responding to Houthi attacks but decided to respond itself this time because of the death of the Israeli citizen in Tel Aviv.
    

            According to the official, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant informed US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin before the strike was carried out.
    

            The defense official added that Israel was able to strike so quickly because it had been preparing for this scenario for months.
    

            A White House official said US President Joe Biden had been briefed on “developments” in the Middle East. A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said the US had not coordinated with Israel on the airstrikes, but added that the US fully recognizes “Israel’s right to self-defense.”
    

            The Houthi movement, also known as Ansar Allah – Arabic for ‘Supporters of God’ – is a Shi’ite Islamist political and military organization backed by Iran, that emerged in the 1990s.
    

            Similar to chants used by Lebanon-based Iranian proxy Hezbollah, the Houthis’ official slogan reads, “God is the Greatest. Death to America. Death to Israel. Curse the Jews. Victory to Islam.”

            In 2014, Houthi forces allied with former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh took control of Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, from the UN-recognized Yemeni government, sparking a civil war that has afflicted the country ever since.
    

            Since March 2015, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have led a coalition in Yemen against Houthi forces.
    

            More recently, the group has come to be seen in parts of the largely Sunni Muslim world and beyond as champions of the Palestinian cause, defending the people of Gaza against Israel.
    

            Since October 7, Houthi rebels have carried out numerous missile and drone attacks on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, asserting that these vessels are linked to Israel and its allies, which has escalated tensions throughout the Middle East.
    

            In recent weeks Hezbollah has been ramping up cross-border attacks with Israel after months of low-intensity fighting, prompting the Israeli military to warn that it is prepared to launch a large-scale attack on its northern border.
    

            Following the Hodeidah strike, Israel’s Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir congratulated Netanyahu on the operation and said Israel should “adopt the same policy against Hezbollah in Lebanon.”
    

            Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Defense Minister Gallant echoed Ben Gvir’s sentiment. Smotrich said Israel must continue to attack “with all its might even in distant places,” while Gallant said “the blood of Israeli citizens has a price,” and that anywhere Israelis are attacked the “result will be identical.”

            “The fire that is currently burning in Hodeidah, is seen across the Middle East and the significance is clear,” Gallant said.
    

            Hezbollah in Lebanon condemned the attack on Yemen and said “we stand firmly with the Yemeni people in defending themselves, their sovereignty, and their heroic and historic stance alongside Palestine.”
    

            Hamas also condemned the attack, calling it a “dangerous escalation.”
    

            Meanwhile, Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Israel Katz called on the international community to “maximize sanctions on Iran.”
    

            “Iran supports, trains, and finances the Houthi terror organization as part of its regional network of terror organizations aimed at attacking Israel,” he said.
    

            “Iran is the head of the snake – it must be stopped now,” Katz added.
    

            Iran condemned the Israeli strike on Hodeidah. Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Nasser Kanaani warned of the risk of war in the region, saying Israel’s actions in Gaza were the “root” of the escalating tensions.
    

            “The oppressed but powerful people of Yemen are paying the price for their honorable support of the innocent citizens, women and children of Gaza,” Kanaani said.

53,CNN_21,Israel strikes Yemen for the first time following deadly Houthi drone attack. Here’s what we know,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/middleeast/israel-strikes-houthi-rebels-explainer-intl/index.html,"
            For the first time, Israel has struck inside Yemen, following a deadly drone attack launched by Houthi rebels on Tel Aviv.
    

            Since the October 7 attacks by Hamas on Israel, the Houthis have been targeting shipping in the Red Sea in solidarity - they say - with Gaza. But these direct attacks on each other’s soil between the Israeli military and an Iranian-backed rebel group risk creating a new front in a conflict that already threatened to spill over into the region.
    

            Soon after the Israeli attack, the Houthis said they launched a fresh barrage of missiles towards Israel, promising a response that will be “huge and great.”
    

            Here’s what we know.
    

            The Houthis are an Iran-backed Islamist group based in Yemen.
    

            The Houthi movement, also known as Ansar Allah (Supporters of God), is one side in a civil war that has raged in Yemen for nearly a decade. It emerged in the 1990s, when its leader, Hussein al-Houthi, launched “Believing Youth,” a religious revival movement for a centuries-old subsect of Shia Islam called Zaidism.
    

            Since a ceasefire, the Houthis have consolidated their control over most of northern Yemen. They have also sought an agreement with Saudi Arabia, a major rival of Iran, that would bring the war to a permanent end and cement their role as the country’s rulers.
    

            The Houthis are believed to have been armed and trained by Iran. Since Hamas’s attacks on October 7 attacks and Israel’s subsequent ground and air offenses in Gaza, the Houthis say they have been seeking revenge against Israel for its military campaign by targeting Red Sea shipping.
    

            The US and UK have responded to those attacks by carrying out strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. However, Israel has not taken part in those responses.
    

            In addition, Israel’s army spokesman says the militant group has targeted “Israeli civilians and civilian infrastructure” about 200 times in the same period. Most of those launches were intercepted by US Central Command, the spokesman said, but Israel’s air defenses have also intercepted Houthi drones and missiles inside and outside Israel’s airspace.
    

            A tipping point for Israel appears to have come on Friday, when a drone attack was launched on Tel Aviv, killing one Israeli citizen and injuring several others.
    

            The attack was claimed by the Houthis, with spokesperson Yahya Sare’e saying the operation was performed by a new drone capable of “bypassing the enemy’s interception systems.”
    

            “We will continue to strike these targets in response to the enemy’s massacres and daily crimes against our brothers in the Gaza Strip,” Sare’e said. “Our operations will only cease when the aggression stops and the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted.”
    

            The attack marked the first time Tel Aviv, Israel’s commercial center, has been struck by a drone in an attack claimed by the Houthis. Israel authorities are investigating the circumstances and potential security failures around the deadly drone blast.
    

            Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari said that the military suspects the drone was an Iranian-made Samad-3 model, launched from Yemen, which had been upgraded to extend its range.
    

            A second drone was intercepted outside of Israeli airspace to the east at the same time as the attack, he said, adding that Israel is now upgrading its air defenses and increasing aerial patrols of its borders.
    

            Israel’s response came a day later, when Israeli aircraft hit the Yemeni port of Hodeidah.
    

            The attack, which marked the first time Israel has struck Yemen, killed at least six people and injured scores more, Yemeni officials said. The Houthi-run Al Masirah TV said the strikes targeted oil facilities in the port on Yemen’s west coast.
    

Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam said the strikes had also hit civilian targets and a power station. He slammed what he said was “brutal Israeli aggression” aimed at increasing the “suffering of the people of Yemen” and pressuring the group to stop its support of Gaza.
    

            Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the port was used by Iran to bring arms into Yemen.
    

            “The port we attacked is not an innocent port. It was used for military purposes, it was used as an entry point for deadly weapons supplied to the Houthis by Iran,” he said in a statement on Saturday.
    

            Netanyahu also said the operation, which hit targets 1,800 km (1,118 miles) from Israel’s borders, showed Israel was serious about responding to threats.
    

            “It makes it clear to our enemies that there is no place that the long arm of the State of Israel will not reach,” Netanyahu said.
    

            Neither side have suggested they are ready to back down. “It’s not in the Houthi ‘DNA’ to de-escalate with Israel,” Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute wrote on X.
    

            Houthi army spokesperson Yehya Saree said the Houthis have “prepared for a long war” with Israel and that Tel Aviv is still not safe. Israel’s Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, warned that the “blood of Israeli citizens has a price,” and that if Israelis are attacked, the “result will be identical” to that which has been seen in Lebanon and Gaza.
    

            On Sunday, Israeli military said it had intercepted a missile approaching Israeli territory from Yemen while the Houthis said they launched a “number of ballistic missiles.”
    

            The war in Gaza has already been accompanied by significantly heightened tensions between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. The two sides have been trading cross-border fire since October 8, when Hezbollah fired at three Israeli border posts “in solidarity” with Palestinians.
    

            But while raised tensions with the Houthis undoubtedly creates fresh challenges for Israel, Hezbollah remains the bigger threat given its extensive arsenal and proximity to Israel.
    

            Yoel Guzansky, a senior fellow at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) who has served on Israel’s National Security Council, told CNN he believes Israel has until now been restrained in its response.
    

            He believes Israel was trying to send a signal to the US and the international community that “enough is enough,” and deliberately chose a target with high visibility.
    

            “You have to signal to a rogue actor that is attacking you that there is a price to pay, and I think this is what Israel tried to do.”
    

            Like the Houthis, Hezbollah is also heavily backed by Iran, which makes no secret of its animosity towards Israel.
    

            Any increase in hostilities between Israel and Iran’s proxies is seen as deeply destabilizing in the region because it could push the two countries closer towards open warfare.
    

            Israel and Iran have already traded one direct exchange since October 7. Few in the international community want to see it happen again.

54,CNN_13,Secret Service says it denied Trump additional resources in recent years even as his team complained,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/secret-service-trump-security-requests/index.html,"
            Former President Donald Trump’s security detail had complained they were not being given enough resources and personnel by the Secret Service over the past two years, and the agency acknowledged Saturday it denied some requests.
    

            A spokesperson for the Secret Service said in a statement Saturday that the agency has not provided certain resources in the past but has instead provided other security measures including from local partners.
    

            The news comes amid widespread concerns about how a sniper was able to obtain rooftop access roughly 150 meters from Trump’s position at an outdoor rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last week.
    

The Washington Post and The New York Times reported earlier Saturday that the Secret Service denied previous request from Trump’s security team over the past two years.

            Some close to the former president felt the decisions, which they believed were personal to Trump, came from the top ranks of the agency.
    

            While Trump holds close relationships with members of his Secret Service detail, the relationship between those agents and the upper ranks of the agency has been tense for some time, according to multiple sources familiar with the dynamic.
    

            In response to questions from CNN over whether the Secret Service had denied additional security requests, a spokesperson told CNN the agency makes “modifications” when certain resources are not provided to protectees.
    

            “In some instances where specific Secret Service specialized units or resources were not provided, the agency made modifications to ensure the security of the protectee,” Anthony Guglielmi, chief of communications for the Secret Service, wrote in a statement. “This may include utilizing state or local partners to provide specialized functions or otherwise identifying alternatives to reduce public exposure of a protectee.”
    

            Guglielmi said in a statement the day after the shooting that claims that Trump was denied additional security requests specifically for the rally in Pennsylvania were untrue.
    

            “This is absolutely false. In fact, we added protective resources & technology & capabilities as part of the increased campaign travel tempo,” Guglielmi wrote on X.
    

            Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle is facing a flurry of questions about how a gunman was able to get a clear line of sight to Trump at the rally site, and there have been calls for her resignation from members of Congress, including House Speaker Mike Johnson.
    

            Cheatle will likely face questions over these issues during her testimony this week before several committees in Congress over the security failures that led to the assassination attempt.

            More than 1,500 US flights have been canceled for the third day straight, as airlines struggle to recover from a global tech outage that left thousands of passengers stranded at airports.
    

            Around 1,500 flights into, within or out of the United States were canceled by Sunday evening, while more than 7,400 US flights were delayed, according to the tracking website FlightAware.com.
    

            More than 600 of those cancelations were from Delta Air Lines, the website shows.
    

            The airline is continuing its recovery efforts following “an outside vendor technology issue” resulting in delays and cancelations, Delta said Sunday. The airline is communicating directly with some impacted customers, offering travel vouchers, waivers and SkyMiles Program miles, it said.
    

            On Saturday, 2,136 US flights were canceled, and more than 21,300 flights were delayed, according to FlightAware.

A global tech outage brought many computer systems and businesses to a screeching halt. Here’s what happened


            The issue extended beyond airports, with businesses, government agencies, health and emergency services, banks, schools and universities around the world grinding to a halt or seeing services disrupted due to a flawed software update for Microsoft Windows operating systems issued by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, experts told CNN.
    

            The outage affected an estimated 8.5 million Windows devices, according to Microsoft.
    

            CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz apologized to customers and said a fix has been deployed, but experts say getting systems back in order will be a lengthy process.
    

            Major airlines have said services are being restored, but there could be more delays and disruptions.
    

            A majority of United Airlines systems have recovered from Friday’s outage, though some delays and cancellations are still possible, the airline said in a statement. More than 400 United flights were canceled Saturday, and over 200 flights were canceled Sunday, according to FlightAware.com.
    

            Delta has paused unaccompanied minor travel until Wednesday due to the outage, the airline announced over the weekend. Unaccompanied children who are already booked on a Delta flight will not be able to travel, and the airline has asked that no new flights be booked for them.
    

            Also impacted was American Airlines, which said in a statement  Friday “we were able to safely reestablish our operation” and it had “issued a travel waiver for our customers impacted by the vendor technology issue earlier this morning.” Allegiant Air said in a statement Saturday while “normal operations have resumed” after the outage, they’re processing a backlog of customer messages and troubleshooting their programs and platforms.
    

            Even with the flawed computer update rolled back, it’s not a quick fix for airlines, which have computers at thousands of gates that will need to be individually manually rebooted, David Kennedy, cofounder of cybersecurity company Binary Defense, told CNN on Saturday.
    

            “It’s not just as simple as rebooting. There’s a lot more steps and complexities in this that are involved,” Kennedy said. “There’s just not enough people at those airports, at those locations to go and do it.”
    

            The US Department of Transportation on Friday said it determined the flight delays and cancelations resulting from the system outage were “controllable,” meaning they’re “attributable to the airline.” In such cases, the airlines “must adhere to their customer service commitments.”
    

            Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in a social media post Saturday said he received reports of some airlines only offering flight credits to passengers for canceled flights.
    

            “Let me be clear — you are entitled to get your money back promptly if your flight is canceled and you don’t take a rebooking,” Buttigieg said.
    

            Flight cancelations persist at the world’s busiest airport, Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, where officials have implemented a “concessions crisis plan, ensuring concessions availability while all flights are operating.”
    

            “We’ve provided assistance and guidance to passengers spending the night in the airport, and we’re collaborating with our airlines to create space for luggage reunification areas,” an airport spokesperson told CNN on Sunday.
    

            “It just seems like nobody cares about us. We’re sleeping on the floor. There’s kids sleeping on the floor and no one’s done anything about it,” traveler Anthony Augugliaro told CNN affiliate WSB on Sunday.
    

            Long lines of passengers also waited for assistance at the airport Saturday. Delta passenger Catalina Villareal described the scene: “Mayhem. Chaos. Frustration. Hunger.”
    

            Villareal said she had experienced three flights cancellations.

            Charlotte Yeh, a traveler at Boston Logan International Airport, told CNN affiliate WFXT Saturday she received no notification her flight to Fort Lauderdale for her father’s 96th birthday was canceled.
    

            Thousands of people face the same uncertainty as they cram together in airports across the country, waiting for answers.
    

            “I was supposed to be in California for my mom’s wedding,” Richard Whitfield of Pasco County, Florida, told CNN on Saturday. Whitfield and his partner, Jonathan Shade, left Tampa on Thursday and missed their connecting flight in Atlanta due to poor weather conditions, delaying their landing and forcing the plane to refuel in Tallahassee.
    

            After their rescheduled flight on Friday was delayed many times, the couple decided to cancel the trip and just head home. But with no available flights back to Tampa on Friday night, they spent their second night in an airport hotel. They were unable to get a voucher from Delta for either of their stays.
    

            “(Richard has) been on hold for 24 hours,” Shade told CNN. “When he eventually got his number in line, it was 2,001.”
    

            Two hours later, Richard’s place in Delta Air Lines’ virtual customer service queue was 2,300 in line, Shade said.
    

            Whitfield told CNN the whole ordeal has had an impact on him.
    

            “For me, it’s been the domino effect that it has on humanity and everything that we need to survive: food, sleep, or water, housing,” he said.
    

            After spending 48 hours in Atlanta, they found a Saturday evening flight back to Tampa they say they can only hope is not delayed or canceled. For now, there is nothing the couple can do but wait and “get a good stiff drink,” Shade and Whitfield said.

57,CNN_15,Bangladesh’s top court rolls back most government job quotas after violent protests,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/asia/bangladesh-supreme-court-rolls-back-job-quotas-intl/index.html,"
            Bangladesh’s Supreme Court on Sunday rolled back most of the controversial quotas on government jobs which sparked violent protests.
    

            Under the quota system, some 30% of sought-after civil service jobs are reserved for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh’s war of independence from Pakistan in 1971 - with many of the country’s contemporary political elite related to that generation.
    

            Since the roles are linked to job security and higher pay, the quota system has angered many in the country, particularly students and young people, as Bangladesh faces high unemployment levels.
    

            Dozens of people have reportedly been killed and hundreds injured in the violence, which saw demonstrators gather on streets and university campuses in the capital Dhaka and other cities.
    

            In 2018, the civil service quota system was scrapped following similar protests but in June the High Court reinstated it, ruling its removal unconstitutional. On July 10, the Supreme Court suspended the quotas for one month while it took up the case.
    

            On Sunday, the country’s top court dismissed the earlier ruling that brought back the quotas, directing that 93% of government jobs will be open to candidates on merit, without quotas.
    

            Speaking to local media in Dhaka following the announcement, Shah Monjurul Hoque, a lawyer representing students said that the Supreme Court “gave a final solution to this quota system.”
    

            “That is 93% quota for general people, 5% quota for freedom fighters and their kin, 1% for ethnic minority community, and 1% for third gender and physically disabled,” he said.
    

            Ahead of the ruling, Bangladesh on Sunday extended a curfew imposed on Friday to try to quell the violence and deployed soldiers to patrol the streets of the capital Dhaka, according to Reuters.
    

            According to local media, the curfew was extended until after the Supreme Court hearing and will continue for an “uncertain time” following a two-hour break for people to gather supplies, Reuters reported.
    

            CNN has tried to reach the prime minister’s office, home affairs ministry, and police, but mobile and internet services appear to remain mostly down across the country after a government-imposed blackout.
    

            As of Saturday, internet monitoring site NetBlocks said activity had remained at around 10% for more than 48 hours since services were cut Thursday.
    

            The US state department raised the travel advisory level for Bangladesh on Saturday, urging people to “not travel” due to “civil unrest, crime and terrorism.”

            Dallas Wings guard Arike Ogunbowale set a new WNBA All-Star game record of 34 points while Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese set rookie records as they helped lead Team WNBA to a 117-109 win over Team USA on Saturday in Phoenix.
    

            All Ogunbowale’s 34 points came in the second half, with 21 in the third quarter, as Team WNBA overturned a four-point deficit at half time to defeat Team USA as it prepares for the upcoming Paris Olympics.
    

            Ogunbowale’s scoring exploits earned her a second All-Star MVP award in front of 16,407 fans at Footprint Center.
    

            “Coach (Cheryl Miller) actually called me out at halftime in front of everybody was like, just take a deep breath and play your game,” the 27-year-old said after the game. “I guess you guys saw what happened.”
    

            Ogunbowale is the fourth player in league history with multiple All-Star game trophies.
    

            Meanwhile, rookies Chicago Sky forward Reese and Indiana Fever guard Clark played on the same team for the first time and both enjoyed historic games in their All-Star debuts.
    

            Reese, who has already set a WNBA record for the most consecutive double-doubles this season, became the first rookie to record a double-double in an All-Star game after finishing with 12 points and 11 rebounds.
    

            Clark had four points and also set a rookie All-Star game record with 10 assists, one of which went to Reese, to finish just one assist shy of Sue Bird’s overall record in an All-Star game.
    

            “It was a lot of fun, we came in here and we competed hard,” Clark told reporters afterward. “We knew they were going to want to win so we came out with the same mindset … We started the third quarter really strong and that’s what set the tone.”

            Clark was left off the Olympic roster, a decision that was initially met with some shock, but she told reporters that there was “plenty of talent on that team.”
    

            “I think it was the same four years prior, Team WNBA beat Team USA and they were perfectly fine at the Olympics,” she added. “If anything, it shows how good this league is, how much talent there is … I’m going to be supporting them and cheering them on, I love the Olympics … they’re going to win gold and dominate.”
    

            Six-time All-Star and New York Liberty forward Breanna Stewart led Team USA with 31 points and 10 rebounds while six-time All-Star and Las Vegas Aces center A’ja Wilson added 22 points, six rebounds and three assists.

72,CNN_34,Harris will seek Democratic nomination and could be the first Black woman and Asian American to lead a major party ticket,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/kamala-harris-biden-endorsement-democratic-nominee/index.html,"
            Vice President Kamala Harris said she plans to seek the Democratic nomination after President Joe Biden stepped aside and endorsed her, setting up a push that could make her the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead the ticket of a major political party.
    

            “I am honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,” she said in a statement.
    

            Biden’s historic endorsement — and Harris’s pledge to unite the party behind her —came Sunday after he announced that he is dropping his reelection bid following weeks of disarray within the Democratic Party. The president’s disastrous debate called into question his ability to win a second term and govern for another four years.
    

            “My fellow Democrats, I have decided not to accept the nomination and to focus all my energies on my duties as President for the remainder of my term. My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it’s been the best decision I’ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee,” Biden said.
    

            Still, despite the president’s backing, it remains unclear if Harris will become the nominee, or what process the Democratic Party would take to select an alternative. It will now be up to the delegates to the party’s national convention to choose their candidate. While Harris allies have sought to secure her path to the nomination, some Democrats have stopped short of backing her or explicitly called for an open nomination process.
    

            Democratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison said in a statement that in the coming days the party will “undertake a transparent and orderly process to move forward as a united Democratic Party with a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in November.”
    

            Logistically, Harris is the natural heir to the ticket as Biden’s running mate.
    

            The Biden-Harris campaign on Sunday formally amended filings with the Federal Election Commission to rename its principal committee “Harris for President,” saying that the committee name is “different than previously reported.”
    

            The committee also filed a letter with the commission stating that “Vice President Harris is now a candidate for United States President in the 2024 election and will henceforth be conducting campaign activities only in pursuit of that office.”
    

            Control of the campaign war chest, however – totaling $95.9 million at the end of June – depends on whether Harris remains on Democrats’ 2024 ticket.
    

            Recent polling has also shown her performing better against former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, than Biden and other potential Democratic contenders.
    

            Should there be efforts to pass over Harris in favor of Democrats seen as likely to run in 2028, there may be backlash from the vice president’s supporters and prominent Black Democrats. But Harris has also experienced something of a renaissance within her party, as Democrats showered her with praise in the days following the debate.
    

            Throughout her vice presidency, Harris has struggled to define herself while juggling an issue portfolio that has included difficult topics such as voting rights and stemming the tide of migrants coming from Central America. On the former, an effort to bolster the Voting Rights Act failed in Congress. On migration, Harris was criticized on the right for not spending enough time on the border and on the left for telling migrants in a speech, “Do not come.”
    

            As recently as last year, some Democrats were worried that negative views of Harris could hurt the ticket, prompting prominent Democrats to urge the party to stop undermining her.
    

            But in the weeks since Biden’s June debate performance, Harris has settled into a groove, becoming a key surrogate for Biden’s reelection campaign on reproductive health as the campaign put it, the threat Trump poses to democracy.
    

            Harris allies have argued that much of the criticism is a result of racism and sexism against the country’s first woman of color in such a position. Now, they say, the country is seeing in Harris what her allies have seen for years.
    

            “Oftentimes Black women are not seen until they’re needed,” said LaTosha Brown, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter, a progressive group that works to boost Black voter turnout. “We’ve seen her constantly berated, marginalized, questioned. I think that the shift is because there’s a need.”
    

            A growing number of Democratic officials and donors already have rallied behind Harris, including the Congressional Black Caucus PAC, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Democratic Senate candidates including Andy Kim of New Jersey, Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland and incumbent Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin.
    

            Even as Democrats waited for Biden to make his decision, Harris supporters were working behind the scenes for the last week to secure support from delegates -– not to push Biden out, but to be prepared in case he left the race.
    

            “We have been whipping delegates for the last week,” a senior Democratic strategist who worked on Harris’ 2020 campaign told CNN.
    

            Her network of backers includes a number of key Black female Democratic allies who have been quietly organizing for weeks to ensure that she would be well positioned to lead the ticket if Biden stepped aside. Those women will meet in a Zoom call Sunday evening.
    

            “The bottom line is, we are ready to go,” said Brown of Black Voters Matter. “We are grateful for President Biden’s service and that’s why we fought for him until the end. We are ecstatic that he has put his endorsement behind Vice President Kamala Harris. We expect the full Democratic apparatus to do the same and if they don’t, they will lose this election.”
    

            Harris allies are describing this moment as “uncharted territory” but are confident the party will be able to navigate the days ahead because Biden has endorsed her.
    

            For donors, Biden’s decision to exit the race and endorse Harris represents a seismic change for the Democratic party that many are embracing publicly.
    

            Dmitri Mehlhorn, a Democratic political strategist advising several big-money backers, released a statement Sunday following Biden’s withdrawal supporting Harris.
    

            “Kamala Harris is the American dream personified, daughter of immigrants who met at Cal,” Mehlhorn said. “She is also toughness personified, rising from my home town of Oakland California to become the top prosecutor of the state. With Scranton Joe stepping back, I cannot wait to help elect President Harris.”
    

            Other donors were less enthusiastic about the Harris pick. Top Biden donor John Morgan called the president’s endorsement of Harris a “f— you” to people who “pushed him out.”
    

            “Be careful what you wish for,” he wrote on X.
    

            Harris, the daughter of Berkeley political activists and immigrants from India and Jamaica, grew up in Oakland and spent much of her political career in California’s Bay Area. After earning her law degree from the University of California, Hastings College of Law, she became a deputy district attorney for Alameda County. She later served in the San Francisco district attorney and city attorney offices.
    

            In 2003, she was elected district attorney for San Francisco. Seven years later, she was elected California’s attorney general – the first woman, first Black person and first Asian American to hold the position.
    

            Harris’s record in law enforcement would later become both a boon and a burden to her political campaigns for Senate and the White House. Among her more controversial policies was a truancy program she advocated, which allowed parents to be charged with misdemeanors if their children missed too many school days. Harris later said she regretted the “unintended consequences” of the program.
    

            In 2016, Harris won her bid to succeed outgoing California Sen. Barbara Boxer, becoming the second Black woman to ever serve in the US Senate.
    

            As a senator, Harris was known for her prosecutorial questioning style during hearings with Trump administration officials and nominees, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
    

            Three years later, in January 2019, she entered the Democratic presidential primary. From the start, Harris acknowledged the historic nature of her campaign – she launched her bid on the federal holiday marking Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday and held a news conference at Howard University, the historically Black college she graduated from in 1986.
    

            Harris was one of more than a dozen Democrats, including Biden, who sought the 2020 party nomination. One of Biden’s worst debate moments of that cycle came when Harris blasted him over his opposition in the 1970s to court-ordered busing of students to desegregate schools. The dig from Harris, who was close friends with Biden’s son Beau before his death in 2015, came as a surprise to Biden and angered some his allies.
    

            After she dropped out, Harris became a prominent surrogate for Biden before being named his vice presidential pick in August 2020.
    

            “I’ve decided that Kamala Harris is the best person to help me take this fight to Trump and Mike Pence and then to lead this nation starting in January 2021,” Biden told supporters in an email.

18,NBC_19,'Inside Out 2' is the highest-grossing animated movie ever,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/movies/-2-highest-grossing-animated-movie-ever-rcna163474,"Disney is back on top at the box office.
On Tuesday, “Inside Out 2” surpassed $1.46 billion in global ticket sales, making it the highest-grossing animated feature of all time, usurping another Disney title, “Frozen II.” 
Its box office will continue to grow. The film has yet to open in Japan, a region that contributed nearly $33 million to the $850.5 million global total of “Inside Out” in 2015.
The record-breaking box office for “Inside Out 2” comes after a series of theatrical hits and misses from the company, especially from its animated releases.
In particular, Pixar has suffered at the box office in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Much of its difficulties have come, in part, because Disney opted to debut a handful of animated features directly on streaming service Disney+ during theatrical closures and even once cinemas had reopened.
As a result, before “Inside Out 2,” no Disney animated feature from Pixar or its Walt Disney Animation studio had generated more than $480 million at the global box office since 2019.
Of note, Disney does not consider its 2019 “The Lion King” to be an animated feature despite nearly the entire film being computer animated. It is considered a live-action remake, according to the company. Otherwise, it would be the highest-grossing animated feature, as it collected more than $1.6 billion during its theatrical run.

18,CNN_29,‘Inside Out 2’ becomes highest-grossing animated movie of all time,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/business/inside-out-2-highest-grossing-animated-movie/index.html,"
            If there’s one emotion that Disney and Pixar are probably feeling right now, it’s joy.
    

            That’s after movie sequel “Inside Out 2” became the highest-grossing animated film of all time, raking in $1.46 billion at the global box office and dethroning former record holder “Frozen 2” from 2019, according to Disney on Wednesday.
    

            That’s giving a much-needed boost to Hollywood, which saw a slow start to the summer season and is still grappling with the effects of the writers’ and actors’ strikes of last year.
    

            “Inside Out 2” hit theaters last month and passed the $1 billion mark just 19 days after its release — the fastest ever for an animated film. It’s currently on week six of its theatrical run and has already bagged a spot as the 13th highest-grossing film of all time.
    

            “From Europe to Asia, the Middle East the US, you just see incredible, record-breaking numbers for a movie,” said Daniel Loria, editorial director at Box Office Pro, which collects sales and showtime data from thousands of movie theaters across the United States. “It’s definitely a great success story, not only for movie theaters here in the United States, but all over the world.”
    

            The film has already made history in the Americas, quickly becoming the highest-grossing film in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Uruguay’s cinema scene.
    

            And Loria predicts the film could end its theatrical run with even higher numbers as it prepares to open in Japan next week, having already enjoyed successes across Asia and the Pacific, making $84 million just after 12 days of release.
    

            “It really breathed new life into the global box office and reestablished a momentum that we haven’t seen since the ‘Barbenheimer’ craze of last summer,” Loria said.
    

            The excitement surrounding the “Inside Out 2“ release comes after the film industry was met with a slow start to the summer movie season.
    

            “The record-breaking performance of ‘Inside Out 2’ has been incredibly important for movie theatres as the film swooped in and changed the mood of this industry that, at the time of the film’s release, saw a summer movie season that was being written off as a box office bust,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.
    

            Last summer, blockbusters “Barbie” (which is distributed by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery) and “Oppenheimer” combined added nearly a billion dollars to the domestic box office, according to Comscore data. So far, 2024 has yet to produce a combo with that same box-office draw.

20,NBC_21,Deputy who killed Sonya Massey worked for 6 agencies in 4 years,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/deputy-killed-sonya-massey-worked-6-agencies-4-years-rcna163409,"The former sheriff’s deputy charged with murder in the fatal shooting of Sonya Massey had been employed by six agencies since 2020, Illinois law enforcement records show. And he twice pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol before he began working in law enforcement, according to court records.
Sean Grayson was fired from the Sangamon County Sheriff’s Office last Wednesday, nearly two weeks after he shot and killed Massey in her home in Springfield, about 200 miles southwest of Chicago. 
Massey, 36, had called 911 to report a suspected prowler. Grayson and another deputy, who has not been identified, responded just before 1 a.m. on July 6. Grayson shot her in the head within seconds of demanding she drop a pot of water after she told him, “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,” body camera video released Monday shows. 
Massey was Black. Grayson is white. His employment history includes short stints as a part-time officer at three small police departments in Illinois.
NBC News has requested his personnel files from each agency, and has received responses from four so far. Records provided by those four departments do not include any complaints or disciplinary action against Grayson. All of the agencies he worked for are in central Illinois. 
Grayson worked part time at the Pawnee, Kincaid and Virden police departments, state records show, with his employment at Pawnee overlapping at times with both Kincaid and Virden. He worked full time at the Auburn Police Department and the sheriff’s departments in Logan and Sangamon counties.
DJ Mathon, the chief of the Kincaid Police Department, said Grayson worked there part time from Feb. 4 to May 18, 2021, and was let go by the Village of Kincaid Board when he refused to live within a 10-mile radius of the village. He maintained his employment at Pawnee, where he was hired in August 2020, during the entirety of his time at Kincaid and had asked for permission to take on the second job, records show. Mathon said the department did not have any written complaints against Grayson and no disciplinary actions were taken against him. 
Grayson was hired by the Virden Police Department shortly after leaving Kincaid, and while he was still working at Pawnee, at a rate of  $17.50 per hour, records obtained by NBC News show. He worked there part time for several months. The police department employs nine officers.  
The department said Grayson’s reason for leaving is unknown because it did not receive a resignation from him. An official from the department said that “he just stopped covering shifts.” His separation date was Dec. 31, 2021, though records show that he began working in Auburn months before. He wrote in the application for Auburn that he was leaving Virden because he wanted to be a full-time officer.
Grayson worked full time at the Auburn Police Department from July 2021 to May 2022, and then at the Logan County Sheriff’s Office for a little less than a year, before joining the Sangamon County Sheriff’s Office. 
In his letter of resignation from the Auburn Police Department, Grayson wrote that he “had nothing but a positive experience working as an officer.”
“I appreciate the opportunity you presented to me and I am sincerely grateful for everything you and this department has done for me,” he wrote. “I will take everything I have learned from you and this department and continue to learn and grow.”
Grayson received his part-time Law Enforcement Certification on June 5, 2021, according to the Illinois Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board. His certification status reads as suspended on the board’s website.
Before he worked in law enforcement, Grayson had been a wheeled vehicle mechanic in the U.S. Army from May 2014 to February 2016, Army spokesman Bryce Dubee said.
“He had no deployments and left the Army in the rank of private first class,” Dubee said in a statement. 
Court records show Grayson twice pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of driving under the influence of alcohol, in 2015 and in 2016. The 2015 arrest occurred during his enlistment. His past DUI arrests were disclosed in his application to the Auburn Police Department, records show. He also noted in that application that he at some point had had his license revoked or suspended.
Body camera footage shows that Grayson declined to render aid as Massey lay dying and had discouraged his partner from trying to save her. 
“The other deputy still rendered aid and stayed with Ms. Massey until medical help arrived,” a prosecutor wrote in court documents, adding that Grayson “at no time attempted to render aid to Ms. Massey.”
Grayson, 30, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct charges. He is being detained without bond. 
Last week, after the Illinois State Police concluded its investigation into the shooting, as required by state law, the sheriff’s office said Grayson was fired because the investigation had made it clear that he “did not act as trained or in accordance with our standards.”
Sangamon County State’s Attorney John Milhiser said a review of the  state police’s investigation, including the body-worn camera footage, “does not support a finding that Deputy Sean Grayson was justified in his use of deadly force.”
The fatal shooting has drawn comments from President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, and the Justice Department said it “is aware of and assessing the circumstances” surrounding it. The Justice Department said it “will continue to track the criminal case opened by the Sangamon County State’s Attorney.”Janelle Griffith is a national reporter for NBC News focusing on issues of race and policing."
20,CNN_20,What we know about the deputy charged with killing Sonya Massey in her home after she called 911 for help,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/us/sean-grayson-illinois-police-officer-shooting-sonya-massey/index.html,"
            The family of Sonya Massey is calling for a probe into the hiring of a sheriff’s deputy charged with fatally shooting the 36-year-old Black woman in her Illinois home this month, citing their concerns over records showing he’d worked at six law enforcement agencies in four years and was charged with driving under the influence twice.
    

            Sean Grayson, the 30-year-old Sangamon County sheriff’s deputy who has since been fired from the agency, was indicted by a grand jury last week on three counts of first-degree murder and one count each of aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct in connection with the July 6 shooting at Massey’s home near Springfield.
    

            He has entered a not guilty plea and was denied pretrial release, according to court records. The state’s training and standards board records show Grayson’s law enforcement certification has been suspended.
    

            CNN has sought comment from Grayson’s attorney.
    

            Massey is one of a number of Black women who have been killed by police in their own homes in recent years, including Breonna Taylor and Atatiana Jefferson.
    

            In a news conference Monday afternoon, civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents Massey’s family, connected her death to other cases of police violence against Black people across the US.
    

            Here’s what we know about the former sheriff’s deputy charged with murder in Massey’s death:
    

            Grayson had worked at six law enforcement agencies in Illinois since 2020, according to the Illinois Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board.
    

            He began working part-time with Pawnee police in August 2020, then moved to the Kincaid and Virden police departments, before taking up full-time work with Auburn police, the Logan County Sheriff’s Office and – in May 2023 – Sangamon County.
    

            Grayson’s resignation letter from the Auburn Police Department, reviewed by CNN, did not suggest he left due to problems or disciplinary issues. In it, he wrote: “I have had nothing but a positive experience working as an officer. Unfortunately, I have chosen to move on to Logan County Sheriff’s Office.”
    

            Grayson listed his reason for leaving both the Virden and Pawnee police departments as “wanting to be a full time” officer, and for the Kincaid Police Department as “my hours were cut,” according to his Auburn Police Department employment application, also reviewed by CNN.
    

            CNN has reached out to the other law enforcement agencies for more information.

            Court records indicate Grayson was charged with two DUI misdemeanor offenses in Illinois’ Macoupin County – one in 2015 and the other in 2016.
    

            The first incident occurred in August 2015, when Grayson’s vehicle was impounded after he was charged with driving under the influence. He pleaded guilty to the charge and paid more than $1,320 in fines, according to court records. Another charge, accusing him of driving under the influence with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08%, was dismissed.
    

            The following year in July, Grayson was charged again with DUI, pleaded guilty and paid more than $2,400 in fines, court records show.
    

            Grayson’s job application to the Auburn Police Department acknowledges he had previously been arrested and charged with a DUI.
    

            A petition calling for an investigation into why Sangamon County hired Grayson was circulated at a march and barbecue in Springfield on Monday night, CNN affiliate WICS reported.
    

            Massey’s family and their lawyers called for the county to investigate the decision to hire him, voicing concerns about his arrest record and his working for six departments in four years, according to WICS.

Illinois police release bodycam video of fatal shooting of Black woman in her home


            The Illinois State Police on Monday released 36-minutes of video that includes body-camera footage from each of the two Sangamon County sheriff’s deputies who responded to Massey’s house early on July 6. Massey had called 911 to report a possible “prowler” at her home in Springfield, according to a court document filed by prosecutors.
    

            The body-camera footage shows Grayson and another deputy speaking calmly with Massey in her home – at which point she goes to the stove to turn off a pot of boiling water. She then picks up the pot and the other deputy steps back, “away from your hot steaming water,” he says.
    

            “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,” she says in response.
    

            “Huh?” the deputy says.
    

            “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,” she repeats.
    

            “You better f**king not or I swear to God I’ll f**king shoot you in the f**king face,” Grayson says.
    

            He then draws his firearm and points it at her, and she ducks and says, “I’m sorry” while lifting the pot, the video shows.
    

            “Drop the f**king pot!” both deputies yell.
    

            Three shots are heard. After a few seconds of silence, one deputy says, “shots fired” and calls for emergency medical services.
    

            “Dude, I’m not taking f**king boiling water to the f**king head. And look, it came right to our feet, too,” Grayson says.
    

            Minutes after the shooting, Grayson speaks to another law enforcement figure. “She had boiling water and came at me with boiling water,” he says in the video. “She said she was going to rebuke me in the name of Jesus and came at (me) with boiling water.”
    

            Grayson did not activate his body camera until after he fatally shot Massey, according to charging documents. The other deputy had activated his body camera when he first arrived at the scene, the documents state.
    

            In the body-camera footage, Grayson tells his partner that Massey would not need medical help immediately after the shooting.
    

            The other deputy says he’s going to get a medical kit to help, but Grayson responds, “Nah, she’s done. You can go get it but that’s a headshot.”
    

            Grayson later goes to his vehicle to get his own medical supplies. When he gets back to the house, he asks if there’s anything he can do, but is told no.
    

            “All right, I’m not even gonna waste my med stuff then,” Grayson says.
    

            Next, Grayson leaves the house and speaks to a group of law enforcement officers outside. “Yeah, I’m good, this f**king b*tch is crazy,” he says, according to the footage.
    

            Since the shooting, local and state officials have criticized the deputy’s actions as an unjustified use of deadly force.
    

            A review of the Illinois State Police investigation into the shooting “does not support a finding that … Grayson was justified in his use of deadly force,” the state’s attorney for Sangamon County, John Milhiser, said in a July 17 news release.
    

            In a court document filed by the state last week, prosecutors said a “use-of-force” expert had reviewed the body-camera footage and concluded the use of deadly force was not justified.
    

            “(The expert) likened the scenario to an officer intentionally and unnecessarily putting himself in front of a moving vehicle and then justifying use of force because of fear of being struck,” the prosecutors wrote.
    

            The sheriff’s office said it has fired Grayson. “It is clear that the deputy did not act as trained or in accordance with our standards,” the office said.
    

            In a court document filed by the state last week, prosecutors noted Grayson could have drawn a Taser located on his duty vest.
    

            “He … has shown a willingness to use lethal force, despite the availability of non-deadly alternatives, when there is little to no threat to his bodily safety,” prosecutors wrote.
    

            In April 2021, Grayson was awarded a certificate for successfully completing a training course on how to use a Taser, according to documents obtained by CNN from the Auburn Police Department, his previous employer. He was also successfully trained on how to use pepper spray, the documents show.
    

            Massey’s father, James Wilburn, said during a news conference Monday he initially received conflicting information from law enforcement.
    

            “I was under the impression that a prowler had broken in and killed my baby. Never did they say that it was a deputy-involved shooting until my brother read it on the internet,” Wilburn said.
    

            At the news conference, Crump called her killing “senseless on every level.”
    

            Crump referenced what Grayson said – “I’ll f**king shoot you in the f**king face” – before Massey was shot.
    

            “Black women don’t get the consideration and the respect in America,” Crump said.

23,NBC_24,Man who attacked author Salman Rushdie charged with supporting terrorist group,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/man-attacked-author-salman-rushdie-charged-supporting-terrorist-group-rcna163451,"BUFFALO, N.Y. — A man who severely injured author Salman Rushdie in a frenzied knife attack in western New York faces a new charge that he supported a terrorist group.
An indictment unsealed in U.S. District Court in Buffalo on Wednesday charges Hadi Matar with providing material support to Hezbollah, a militant group based in Lebanon and backed by Iran. The indictment didn’t detail what evidence linked Matar to the group.
The federal charge comes after Matar earlier this month rejected an offer by state prosecutors to recommend a shorter prison sentence if he agreed to plead guilty in Chautauqua County Court, where he is charged with attempted murder and assault. The agreement also would have required him to plead guilty to a federal terrorism-related charge, which hadn’t been filed yet at the time.
Instead, both cases will now proceed to trial separately. Jury selection in the state case is set for Oct. 15.
Matar’s lawyer, Nathaniel Barone, didn’t immediately return a phone message seeking comment.
Matar, 26, has been held without bail since the 2022 attack, during which he stabbed Rushdie more than a dozen times as the acclaimed writer was onstage about to give a lecture at the Chautauqua Institution. Knife wounds blinded Rushdie in one eye. The event moderator, Henry Reese, was also wounded.
Rushdie detailed the attack and his long and painful recovery in a memoir published in April.
The author spent years in hiding after the Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran issued a fatwa, or edict, in 1989 calling for Rushdie’s death over his novel “The Satanic Verses.” Khomeini considered the book blasphemous. Rushdie reemerged into the public the late 1990s.
Matar was born in the U.S. but holds dual citizenship in Lebanon, where his parents were born. He lived in New Jersey prior to the attack. His mother has said that her son became withdrawn and moody after he visited his father in Lebanon in 2018.
The attack raised questions about whether Rushdie had gotten proper security protection, given that he is still the subject of death threats. A state police trooper and county sheriff’s deputy had been assigned to the lecture. In 1991, a Japanese translator of “The Satanic Verses” was stabbed to death. An Italian translator survived a knife attack the same year. In 1993, the book’s Norwegian publisher was shot three times but survived.
The investigation into Rushdie’s stabbing focused partly on whether Matar had been acting alone or in concert with militant or religious groups.The Associated Press"
23,CNN_21,"Man accused of stabbing author Salman Rushdie pleads not guilty to federal terrorism-related counts, lawyer says",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/us/salman-rushdie-stabbing-suspect-terrorism-charges/index.html,"
            The man accused of stabbing author Salman Rushdie was charged with three federal terrorism-related counts, according to a grand jury indictment unsealed Wednesday.
    

            Hadi Matar is charged with committing an act of terrorism transcending national boundaries, attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization and providing material support to terrorists.
    

            He pleaded not guilty, attorney Nathaniel Barone said.
    

            In August 2022, Rushdie was stabbed several times onstage shortly before he was due to deliver a lecture at the Chautauqua Institution in New York. Matar has already pleaded not guilty to state charges of second-degree attempted murder and second-degree assault in connection with the stabbing.

            Federal authorities allege in the unsealed grand jury indictment that Matar attempted to provide material support and resources – including “himself, and services” to “a designated foreign terrorist organization, namely, Hizballah,” according to the four-page indictment.
    

            The indictment alleges Matar “did knowingly attempt to kill, and did knowingly maim, commit an assault resulting in serious bodily injury, and assault with a dangerous weapon, a person within the United States.” It does not mention Rushdie by name.
    

            Matar recently rejected a state plea deal that would have tied in a federal terrorism-related charge and reduced his state prison sentence.
    

            Barone previously told CNN his client “has maintained his innocence, not only on the state charges, but will continue to maintain his innocence on the federal charges as well.”
    

            “In addition, Mr. Matar will exercise any and all of his fundamental and constitutional rights in defending this matter to the fullest,” Barone said.
    

            Matar’s next appearance in federal court is scheduled for August 7. If convicted of the federal charges, he could face life in prison, his attorney said.
    

            Matar is due to appear in state court in October, according to Barone.
    

            Rushdie, 77, has garnered widespread acclaim and scrutiny for his literary work. His fourth novel, “The Satanic Verses,” drew condemnation from some Muslims who found it to be sacrilegious.
    

            The late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who described the book as an insult to Islam and Prophet Mohammed, issued a religious decree, or fatwa, calling for Rushdie’s death in 1989.

32,NBC_33,Blast at Jose Cuervo plant in Mexico’s Tequila kills at least five people,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/blast-jose-cuervo-plant-mexicos-tequila-kills-least-five-people-rcna163396,"An explosion at a Jose Cuervo tequila plant in central Mexico killed at least five company workers and forced the evacuation of tourists from the area in the spirit’s hometown of Tequila, the head of the state’s emergency services said on Tuesday.
Victor Hugo Roldan, the chief of emergency services and firefighters in Jalisco state, told Reuters the blast occurred in a 500,000-litre tank at the plant, and the resulting fire was put out by company personnel.
At least two other tanks at the facility, operated by the world’s largest tequila maker Becle, also collapsed, he said.
In a statement, the company confirmed the death toll from the accident at its Rojeña plant, adding that several other workers were injured.
The explosion in one tank triggered a fire in three others, according to a statement from emergency services released later on Tuesday. The cause of the blast remains unknown.
A photo of the aftermath of the explosion released by emergency services showed a large metal tank emblazoned with the Cuervo logo collapsed on its side.
The town of Tequila, home to several distilleries of the agave spirit, is a popular tourist destination about an hour’s drive northwest of Guadalajara, Mexico’s second largest city."

            At least six workers have died in an explosion and fire at a tequila factory in Mexico, local authorities said.
    

            Two others were injured in the disaster, at a Casa Cuervo distillery in the town of Tequila, Jalisco state. Casa Cuervo is the world’s largest producer of the Mexican spirit, according to its website, encompassing the Jose Cuervo and Tequila 1800 brands, among others.
    

            “The incident involved the explosion of a tank car,” Jalisco’s civil protection agency said, adding that the fire ignited three additional tank cars, each with a capacity of 219,000 liters.
    

            The cause of the fire is not yet known, authorities said. At least 40 firefighting and civil protection teams responded to the incident.
    

            In a statement, Casa Cuervo said it was assisting authorities with their investigation and would reinforce security controls at its facilities.
    

            The state’s Civil Protection agency said that another fire broke out at the factory Wednesday morning in a storage area for cardboard and other materials, but that fire was quickly controlled and no additional risks were reported.
    

            The mayor of Tequila, Alfonso Magallanes, shared a post on his Facebook page urging residents not to approach the factory due to the ongoing situation.
    

            Jalisco state is the largest producer of agave, the key ingredient in tequila, generating nearly 75% of the nation’s annual crop. The town of Tequila, which gives the liquor its name, is a center for tourism, receiving an average of more than one million visitors annually from Mexico and abroad, according to data from the mayor’s office.
    

            In February, Mexico’s Chamber of Deputies approved a law to change National Tequila Day from the third Saturday of March to July 24, to coincide with the same date celebrated in the United States, its northern neighbor and largest trading partner.
    

            The US is the largest market for Mexican tequila exports. Adjusted for inflation, between 2014 and 2019, tequila imports increased from $1.1 billion to $4.9 billion, according to 2023 figures from the US Department of Agriculture.

Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, a potential running mate for Harris, is now in support of a bill that's been lauded by labor unions.
A spokesperson for the Arizona senator told NBC News today that Kelly would vote for the PRO Act, a measure he has not yet co-sponsored. The bill has 49 sponsors, including independent Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Kelly is the rare Democrat not to sign on.
Kelly has come under criticism from some unions in recent days for declining to back the key piece of legislation, prompting some to argue it should disqualify him from being the Democratic Party's vice presidential nominee.

Trump called for FBI Director Christopher Wray's resignation, pointing to Wray's testimony before Congress today in which he denied seeing Biden experiencing cognitive issues.
The former president said that Wray should resign for ""lying to Congress,"" arguing that ""anybody can see that Joe Biden is cognitively and physically challenged, and if you can’t see that, you sure as hell can’t be running the FBI.""

Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley today dodged questions about whether it's smart for the GOP to characterize Harris as a ""DEI candidate"" or a ""diversity hire.""
""I think our conversation regarding Kamala Harris needs to focus on two things. One, that she is a California liberal ... I think the other thing that we need to focus on is the fact that it is the Biden-Harris administration. It is the Biden-Harris campaign,"" Whatley said when asked directly about Republicans calling Harris a DEI candidate.
Pressed a second time on the language being used against Harris, Whatley said, ""Kamala Harris is the most radical left candidate that the Democrats have ever put on a ticket.""

The DNC Rules Committee met this afternoon to establish the framework for the presidential nomination process. Rules Committee Co-Chairs Bishop Leah Daughtry and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who is reportedly a contender for Harris’ running mate, led the meeting.
The committee voted to begin the virtual roll call on Aug. 1, assuming Harris is the only candidate for the nomination. The DNC must formally nominate both the presidential candidate and the vice presidential candidate ahead of Aug. 7. The DNC confirmed today that, if they fail to meet this deadline, their nominees may not appear on the Ohio ballot. When the convention begins on Aug. 19, it will hold a ceremonial roll call for the nominees.
Voting closed and the rules were formally adopted around 3:41 p.m. ET.

In a letter to the Trump and Harris campaigns and obtained by CNBC, Fox News president Jay Wallace and vice president for politics Jessica Loker invited Harris and Trump to debate in Pennsylvania on Sept. 17.
The letter added that the moderators would be Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier.
Biden and Trump had committed to a debate earlier in September on ABC News, but it's unclear whether an ABC News debate will still take place now that Biden has stepped aside and endorsed Harris.
The proposed Fox debate could come the day before Trump is scheduled to be sentenced for his hush money conviction. The sentencing hearing had been scheduled for July 11, but the judge overseeing the trial postponed it until at least Sept. 18 after Trump's lawyers asked for more time to review the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling.

Netanyahu said he wants to thank former President Trump ""for his leadership"" and his efforts to secure the Abraham Accords, the September 2020 deal to normalize relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, and Israel and Bahrain. That line drew cheers from lawmakers in the chamber. 
""Like Americans, Israelis were relieved that President Trump emerged safe and sound from that dastardly attack on him,"" he said. ""There is no room for political violence in democracies.""
""I also want to thank President Trump for all the things he did for Israel — from recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights ... to recognizing Jerusalem as our capital and moving the American Embassy"" there from Tel Aviv, Netanyahu said, which drew some boos from the chamber. 
Netanyahu is expected to meet with Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Friday.

Netanyahu blasted the International Criminal Court in his speech and said, ""America will be next."" 
""The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has shamefully accused Israel of deliberately starving the people of Gaza. This is utter, complete nonsense. It's a complete fabrication,"" Netanyahu said. 
The ICC's chief prosecutor said in May that he was seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders so they can be charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity. 
The prosecutor said he was also seeking an arrest warrant for Hamas' leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar.

Through the several standing ovations for Netanyahu, two Democratic senators — Raphael Warnock of Georgia and Chris Murphy of Connecticut —have stayed in their seats and not clapped. When Netanyahu spoke about bringing hostages home, Murphy, Warnock, Reps. Pete Aguilar of California and Katherine Clark of Connecticut seemed to be the only Democrats who did not stand. 
Schumer smiled for the first time in his remarks when Netanyahu spoke about IDF soldiers returning to battle. 
Senate Democrats were seated in the front two rows. Besides Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema and West Virginia Joe Manchin (both have left the Democratic Party and become independents) all stayed seated and did not clap when Netanyahu said protestors should be ashamed of themselves. Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, with Manchin and Sinema, also stood up when Netanyahu discussed University of  North Carolina fraternity brothers who clashed with anti-Israel protesters while the other Democrats remained stoic and seated. 
The crowd later chanted USA!

Netanyahu thanked Biden for his efforts to secure the release of hostages held in Gaza since Oct. 7.
""I want to thank President Biden for his tireless efforts on behalf of the hostages and for his efforts to the hostage families,"" Netanyahu said, and ""for his heartfelt support for Israel."" 
""After the savage attack on Oct. 7, he rightly called Hamas sheer evil,"" he said. 
Netanyahu's comments about Biden were met with resounding bipartisan applause. There has been tension between the two leaders over Netanyahu's  handling of the war in Gaza and they are expected to meet tomorrow in the White House.
Biden ""came to Israel to stand with us during our darkest hour — a visit that will never be forgotten,"" said Netanyahu. ""Biden and I have known each other for over 40 years. I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel, and for being, as he says, a proud Zionist.""

Netanyahu spoke about Noa Argamani, the Israeli woman sitting in the House gallery as the prime minister's guest, and her experience as a hostage taken to Gaza on Oct. 7 and rescued by Israeli security forces in early June. 
Netanyahu said on ""the morning of Oct. 7, the entire world saw Noa's look of desperation as she was violently abducted to Gaza on the back of a motorcycle.""
He referenced the operation that rescued Argamani and three other hostages who were held captive in Gaza. 
The prime minister also spoke about other hostages or families of hostages attending his speech. 
""I met with them again yesterday and I promised them this — I will not rest until all their loved ones are home,"" he said.

Police near the Capitol have used pepper spray to attempt to disperse protestors with the ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism) Coalition. 
About 500 protestors gathered in the street earlier this morning ahead of  Netanyahu's address to Congress.
The protesters were standing behind a large canvas banner that reads “Arrest Netanyahu for Genocide"" and planned to create a “people’s red line against genocide” and conduct a “citizen’s arrest” of Netanyahu. 
The group has provided attendees with signs on wood posts with phrases like “free all Palestinian political prisoners” and “lift the siege on Gaza now” as well as a “wanted” posted for Netanyahu.

In remarks at the Zeta Phi Beta Sorority Inc. Grand Boule in Indianapolis, Harris sought to draw a stark contrast between the policies she champions and those proposed by Trump and his conservative allies.
“As we work to build a brighter future and to move our nation forward, we must also recognize there are those who are trying to take us backward. You may have seen their agenda, part of it is called Project 2025,” she said, referring to an expansive conservative blueprint for a second Trump term proposed by the Heritage Foundation, which Trump has sought to distance himself from. 
Harris argued that Project 2025 is an effort to “return America to a dark past.”
“This represents an outright attack on our children, our families and our future,” she said. “These extremists want to take us back, but we are not going back.”
Harris told the gathering of one of the nation's largest historically Black sororities that Americans’ “hard won freedoms and rights,” such as voting rights and reproductive health rights, are under threat. She specifically took aim at Trump’s appointment of three conservative justices to the Supreme Court, which ultimately led to the overturning in 2022 of the landmark ruling Roe v. Wade that guaranteed a constitutional right to an abortion.
“Well, let me tell you something: When I am president of the United States, and when Congress passes a law to restore those freedoms, I will sign it into law,” she said.
Harris concluded that “there’s so much at stake in this moment.”
“Our nation, as it always has, is counting on you to energize, to organize and to mobilize, to register folks to vote, to get them to the polls and to continue to fight for the future our nation and her people deserve,” she said.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro dodged questions today about whether he's being vetted as a potential running mate for Harris, and told reporters when asked about calls for the Democratic National Convention to hold an open nomination vote that ""anyone could have jumped into this process.""
""It was an open process,"" Shapiro said at a press conference in New Castle, Pennsylvania. ""The vice president jumped in. I endorsed her immediately, as of course did President Biden. She has earned this nomination. She has earned the support of the needed number of delegates to make her the nominee. She has done an extraordinary job over the last, what has it been, 72-96 hours, something like that, of consolidating the party behind her.""
""For anyone calling for any open process, I will tell you we had one,"" he continued. ""And you know what? She kicked butt, and she earned the support, and she earned the nomination, and I’m proud to support her.""
Shapiro also called Harris' decision about a running mate a ""deeply personal"" one ""that she is obviously quite familiar with because she went through it with then-candidate Biden when she was selected to serve as the vice president of the United States.""
The decision should be made ""free from any political pressure,"" Shapiro added.

The father of one of the American hostages held in Gaza questioned Netanyahu's speech to Congress during an interview on MSNBC's ""Andrea Mitchell Reports.""
Jonathan Dekel-Chen, whose son Sagui Dekel-Chen has been held hostage in Gaza since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, called Netanyahu’s visit to the U.S. this week a “staged piece of political theater."" He said that “the vast majority of Israelis already understand” that Netanyahu is in “survival” mode,” and if the war in Gaza were to end, “it is doubtful” his coalition government “would survive.” 
He also criticized the meeting Netanyahu held last night with hostage families as ""neither intimate, nor just hostage families."" He said Netanyahu brought his own guests to the meeting and the ""most vocal were people not exposed to anything other than Bibi’s political line.""

Even if not directly stated, Andy Beshear knew why he was on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe”: an audition. 
About halfway through an 11-minute interview Monday morning, the 48-year-old Kentucky governor, who comes from the state’s political royalty, seamlessly turned his attention to Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who last week was picked as Donald Trump’s running mate. 
“I want the American people to know what a Kentuckian is and what they look like, because let me tell you, JD Vance ain’t from here,” Beshear said.
Beshear’s jab was no accident. 
Vance’s selection last week was viewed, in part, through the lens of geography. He is from a small, poverty-stricken town in Ohio and seen as someone who could solidify the Trump campaign in key swaths of the Midwest and Pennsylvania. 
After President Joe Biden made the historic decision to get out of the 2024 presidential race on Sunday, Vice President Kamala Harris became the party’s likely nominee and started the process of picking a running mate. Her shortlist includes several white governors from politically important states, including Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro, Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer, Minnesota’s Tim Walz and Beshear.
Unlike the others, Beshear’s red-hued state is most likely not in play in 2024. The two-term red-state governor, though, won re-election last year in a state Trump won by more than 20 percentage points in 2020. He also won by 22 percentage points in the eastern Kentucky county that Vance referred to in his Republican National Convention speech, a county Trump claimed by 52 points in 2020. In a region where Democrats are still fighting for votes, Beshear is seen as someone with a bipartisan reputation who can serve as a counterbalance to Vance.

""We need to do this on a bipartisan basis,"" he continued. ""Keep politics out of it. … We need to ask probing and important questions. We need to do it in a responsible way that avoids the kind of incendiary language that has become all too common in our country.”

FBI Director Christopher Wray testified at a House Judiciary Committee hearing today that a laptop tied to Trump's would-be assassin, Thomas Crooks, showed a Google search on July 6 that asked, “How far away was Oswald from Kennedy?”
The search refers to Lee Harvey Oswald, who assassinated President John F. Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963.
Wray also said the shooter’s rifle “had a collapsible stock, which could explain why it might have been less easy for people to observe.""
The hearing on FBI oversight has focused on the details surrounding the attempted assassination of Trump.

FBI Director Christopher Wray pushed back today on recent GOP slights against working women and people of color, telling a House Judiciary Committee hearing that it was an “insult” for critics to suggest they are less qualified for the job. 
“Any notion that we have lowered our standards is just not accurate,” Wray said.
Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have come under criticism from some Republicans after the attempted assassination of Trump on July 13 and Biden's decision on Sunday to end his re-election campaign, making way for Harris as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
On Monday, Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., told then-Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle that she was a “DEI horror story” during a hearing on the security lapses at Trump's rally. That day, Burchett also called Harris a “DEI vice president.” 
During a House Judiciary Committee hearing today, when asked to address DEI attacks, Wray said the FBI's hiring process was as “competitive and selective as ever.” 
The notion that women and people of color are “less qualified, frankly, is not at all consistent with what I’ve seen,” Wray said.
Wray is expected to continue testifying about the FBI’s investigation into the gunman’s motive and his preparations.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in remarks on the Senate floor this morning that he plans to attend Netanyahu's speech this afternoon despite his differences with the Israeli prime minister.
“Even though I disagree with many of Bibi Netanyahu policies, I will attend the speech because the United States relationship with Israel remains ironclad and transcends any prime minister or president, and we must do all we can to get our hostages home,"" said Schumer, the highest-ranking Jewish official in the U.S. ever.
In March, Schumer called for new elections in Israel to replace Netanyahu as the country's prime minister, saying that he had ""lost his way ... by allowing his political survival to take precedence over the best interests of Israel.""

When Biden announced he was dropping his re-election bid and throwing his support to Harris, the dynamics of the entire presidential race radically shifted. 
No longer was it two white men born in the 1940s facing off — again — for who should return to the White House. Instead, it’s between Trump, a man who is 78, against Harris, who is 59 and would make history as the first woman of color to be president if elected. 
And within a day, Harris was already facing attacks that centered on her race and gender, making it clear that while Republicans may try to tie her to some of Biden’s policies, she will face criticisms he never did.
Trump and his allies are taking pages from the same playbook they used the last time a woman was on top of the Democratic ticket. In 2016, Hillary Clinton’s qualifications, look and voice were also scrutinized. But this time, Republicans are also going after the background of Harris, the daughter of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father.

Several of the six American hostage families who are in Washington for the Netanyahu speech said they are upset that he is here instead of in Israel trying to get their loved ones home. 
They are also upset that he brought Israeli families to a meeting they had with him at his hotel Monday night — conducted in Hebrew — and every time they pressed him on the hostage deal, his aides would call on one of the prime minister’s supporters to validate his insistence that he still has to go after Hamas. 
Some of the families will be watching his speech from the gallery at the invitation of Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del. Afterward, they are supposed to meet with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Netanyahu.  
After meeting with national security adviser Jake Sullivan this week, they say they are looking toward tomorrow’s joint meeting at the White House with Biden and Netanyahu as a chance for Sullivan and the president to pressure Netanyahu to agree to a deal as soon as next week with no new obstacles. 
Biden clearly wants to get this done on his watch. Netanyahu is under huge pressure back home from the military, the intelligence and a majority of the Israeli public to wind the war down and agree to a cease-fire. Importantly, Hezbollah has said it will observe a Gaza cease-fire — which would de-escalate the threat from the north and permit 60,000 Israelis who’ve been evacuated from their homes near the Lebanon border since Oct. 7 to return home before school is set to reopen in the fall.      
They also don’t know whether Netanyahu’s Friday meeting with Trump will help or hurt their cause: They worry Trump might encourage the Israeli leader to hold out until after the November election. They hope instead that Trump  might want to take credit for closing the deal if it’s announced next week, saying he was Netanyahu's last meeting before flying home.

Building an airplane as it takes off is no way to build an airplane. And yet, sometimes, circumstances dictate that you have no choice but to try.
Of all the potential metaphors to use and abuse in this unprecedented moment, that’s probably the best one. Building a national campaign isn’t easy. It’s also exactly what Harris and the Democrats are doing with just over 100 days until Election Day.
Harris tried it once herself and experienced some ups but a lot more downs. She’s getting a massive head start this time compared to her 2020 primary campaign, thanks to what has turned into an almost seamless handoff from President Joe Biden to the new de facto Democratic nominee.
The Democratic National Committee seems set on trying to nominate Harris and her eventual running mate in a virtual delegate roll call before the actual convention begins. While I understand some of party leaders’ technical concerns around state laws and waiting until the start of the convention to officially nominate Harris and her running mate, it seems like an unnecessary step given the circumstances. The Democrats should welcome any GOP attempts to block Harris from a state ballot, because voters wouldn’t love the look, because there’s nothing about what the Democrats are doing that’s illegal or even unprecedented.

Vote.org says that a surge in voter registrations over the past two days has set a record for the 2024 election cycle. 
A spokesperson for the platform said the website saw more than 38,500 registrations since Biden's withdrawal. That outpaced when Taylor Swift posted on Instagram last September urging people to vote, driving about 34,000 registrations in 48 hours, the spokesperson said in an email.
The spokesperson also noted that 83% of those registrations came from young voters ages 18-34.

Senior Harris campaign aides working on helping her pick a running mate are focused on choosing someone who can speak directly to older white voters and suburban women about crime, abortion and the economy and can defend Harris against voters who may be uncomfortable supporting a Black and South Asian woman, two sources familiar with the campaign’s thinking told NBC News.
The campaign’s thinking is informed by internal polling and what they see as the state of the nation and Trump’s messaging, the sources said. They view Harris’ VP search much like former President Barack Obama’s decision to tap Biden as his running mate in 2008.
A source familiar with the campaign’s thinking said Harris aides are “batting around internally” which potential running mates will “appeal in short order to that 1 or 2 percent of voters” in battleground states who will likely decide the election.
“They are feeling like you need somebody who can go in and talk to these suburban women,” the source said. “The internal polling is showing that’s who you’re targeting. You’re targeting them on reproductive rights. You’re targeting them on democracy. You’re targeting them on law and order. You’re not really trying to sell them on governing or on record or any of that, but these are sort of softer issues.”
A second source familiar with how the Harris campaign is approaching selecting her running mate said Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper are viewed as top contenders by many aides, though others, including Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are also being vetted and considered also potential good choices.
The campaign is particularly interested in someone who will appeal to demographics and the voters that Biden would have brought to the table, including older white voters and suburban women, the source said. 
Aides to Harris also would like the running mate to appeal specifically to white men who don’t like Trump but who may have doubts about voting for a Black and South Asian woman, the source said.
“Let’s just face it. There’s a lot of sexist, racist white dudes out there in America who don’t like Trump, but just need a little extra validation. And, bringing one of the people mentioned onto the ticket helps validate her among those constituents,” the source said, adding that the campaign would like the running mate to appeal both to battleground states and to be ready to fight back hard at Republican attacks.
The source noted that the campaign is “in the honeymoon stage right now” in its VP search, “but things are about to get real.” 
“She needs someone who is going to be able to defend her and stand by her in the numerous hard times that are ahead. MAGA is just going to unleash,” the source said. “These are going to be terrifyingly crazy days. She needs someone who will be able to prop her up during hard times, and someone who, when these memes take hold, when the deepfakes take hold, when all those things start happening, will be able to stand by her and validate her to a small core constituency that will ultimately decide this election.”

In Harris’ quick, if unorthodox, rise to the top of the Democratic ticket, elected officials, activists and operatives see in her a new chance to beat Trump and make history in one swoop.
Eight years after Trump beat Hillary Clinton, Harris could be the first female president and the first Black woman and the first South Asian American to hold the nation’s top job, as well.
Democrats are somewhat optimistic, now armed with weapons they didn’t have in 2016: a messenger in Harris who is uniquely positioned to energize voters following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn national abortion rights, more proof from the ballot box that women can win in battleground areas and the knowledge that Trump himself is beatable — if still politically dangerous.
“The lessons that still apply [from 2016] are that people need to take Trump and his supporters seriously,” Shaunna Thomas, who co-founded and runs the pro-women group Ultraviolet, told NBC News. “That’s even more of a top-line message than whether or not a woman can win the presidency.”

Trump plans to stop holding outdoor rallies like the one where he was shot during an assassination attempt this month in Butler, Pennsylvania, according to two sources familiar with his campaign’s operations.
The sources said current plans are to hold indoor rallies, but they also said it’s possible Trump will participate in smaller outdoor events or larger rallies in facilities where entrances are more fully controlled and there are not issues with high ground nearby, like stadiums.
Spokespeople for the Trump campaign and the Secret Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment last night.
News of the shift in venues comes the day the director of the Secret Service, Kimberly Cheatle, announced her resignation. In her resignation letter, Cheatle said she took “full responsibility for the security lapse” in Pennsylvania.

In a new memo, the Harris campaign outlined what it views as the vice president’s pathway to victory and contextualized its belief that she is in a “position of strength” heading into the November election.
Campaign Chair Jen O’Malley Dillon cited Harris’ advantages with Black, Latino, Asian American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, female and young voters. Dillon also pointed to the support Harris has gained through grassroots fundraising and her ability to communicate effectively on the issue of abortion rights.
“With a popular message, a strong record on the issues that matter most to swing voters, multiple pathways to 270 electoral voters, and unprecedented enthusiasm on her side, the Vice President is in a strong position to take on Donald Trump and win in 104 days,” Dillon wrote.
Dillon argued that Harris is “well positioned” to expand support from the 2020 election, citing voters who didn’t support for the Biden-Harris ticket that year but came out to vote for Democrats in the 2022 midterm elections as “Donald Trump’s Republican Party grew more and more extreme.”
Dillon, however, noted that the campaign must bring more awareness to Harris and her policies in order to win voters who aren't familiar with her.
“In a highly polarized electoral environment, this shift in the race opens up additional persuadable voters who our campaign can work to win the support of,” Dillon wrote. “This race is more fluid now — the Vice President is well-known but less well-known than both Trump and President Biden, particularly among Dem-leaning constituencies.”
“This expanded universe of winnable voters is highly accessible to Vice President Harris: We have a clear advantage on issues, they have been supportive of Democrats in the past, and many are supportive of Democrats down-ballot,” she added. “It is the job of the Harris campaign to win these voters, but the pathway to do so is clear.”
Dillon concluded that the campaign will be “close, it will be hard fought, but Vice President Harris is in a position of strength — and she’s going to win.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to address a joint meeting of Congress this afternoon, his first since Hamas’ terrorist attack on Israel killed 1,200 people and resulted in the taking of hostages to Gaza, where about 100 are still believed to be held captive.
Netanyahu’s speech at 2 p.m. ET comes at a critical period: The U.S. is in the middle of a chaotic election year, and the Biden administration continues to push negotiators toward a cease-fire agreement that could end the war in Gaza, where the death toll has surpassed an estimated 30,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry.
“In my speech, I will emphasize the importance of bipartisan support for Israel, I will address our friends on both sides of the map and tell them that regardless of who will be chosen to lead the American people after the presidential elections, Israel is the most important ally of the United States in the Middle East, an irreplaceable ally,” Netanyahu said before he left for the U.S., according to his office.
He added, “I think that in this time of war and uncertainty, it is of utmost importance that our enemies know that the U.S. and Israel stand together — today, tomorrow and forever.”

For more than three at-times excruciating weeks, Biden and his team were locked in a campaign to save his candidacy. With his prime-time address to the nation tonight, a new effort is underway: to shape his legacy.
A team of Biden’s closest advisers is already at work to plot out what that will look like. The discussion includes domestic priorities he could advance in coming budget negotiations with Congress or through executive action, diplomatic initiatives he could see through with a freer hand and accomplishing what he has described as the most elusive of the three goals he outlined in his 2020 campaign — unifying the country.
NBC News spoke to a half-dozen White House and campaign officials about what Biden is planning, and advisers said they recognize that the biggest factor shaping how he is viewed in history will be whether Vice President Kamala Harris is successful in her bid to succeed him.
“Everything is being viewed through that lens,” a White House official said.

Harris’ allies in the tech community have launched a behind-the-scenes lobbying campaign to convince wealthy donors to back her campaign for president, according to people familiar with the matter.
Longtime investors Reid Hoffman and Ron Conway have been among Harris’ allies in Silicon Valley privately calling on those in their networks to support the vice president over Trump, these people explained.
The conversations have been ongoing since Sunday, when Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris, according to people who described the discussions to CNBC.

Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, a potential running mate for Harris, is now in support of a bill that's been lauded by labor unions.
A spokesperson for the Arizona senator told NBC News today that Kelly would vote for the PRO Act, a measure he has not yet co-sponsored. The bill has 49 sponsors, including independent Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Kelly is the rare Democrat not to sign on.
Kelly has come under criticism from some unions in recent days for declining to back the key piece of legislation, prompting some to argue it should disqualify him from being the Democratic Party's vice presidential nominee.Megan Lebowitz
Trump called for FBI Director Christopher Wray's resignation, pointing to Wray's testimony before Congress today in which he denied seeing Biden experiencing cognitive issues.
The former president said that Wray should resign for ""lying to Congress,"" arguing that ""anybody can see that Joe Biden is cognitively and physically challenged, and if you can’t see that, you sure as hell can’t be running the FBI.""Olympia Sonnier

Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley today dodged questions about whether it's smart for the GOP to characterize Harris as a ""DEI candidate"" or a ""diversity hire.""
""I think our conversation regarding Kamala Harris needs to focus on two things. One, that she is a California liberal ... I think the other thing that we need to focus on is the fact that it is the Biden-Harris administration. It is the Biden-Harris campaign,"" Whatley said when asked directly about Republicans calling Harris a DEI candidate.
Pressed a second time on the language being used against Harris, Whatley said, ""Kamala Harris is the most radical left candidate that the Democrats have ever put on a ticket.""Laura Jarrett

The DNC Rules Committee met this afternoon to establish the framework for the presidential nomination process. Rules Committee Co-Chairs Bishop Leah Daughtry and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who is reportedly a contender for Harris’ running mate, led the meeting.
The committee voted to begin the virtual roll call on Aug. 1, assuming Harris is the only candidate for the nomination. The DNC must formally nominate both the presidential candidate and the vice presidential candidate ahead of Aug. 7. The DNC confirmed today that, if they fail to meet this deadline, their nominees may not appear on the Ohio ballot. When the convention begins on Aug. 19, it will hold a ceremonial roll call for the nominees.
Voting closed and the rules were formally adopted around 3:41 p.m. ET.Alexandra Marquez
In a letter to the Trump and Harris campaigns and obtained by CNBC, Fox News president Jay Wallace and vice president for politics Jessica Loker invited Harris and Trump to debate in Pennsylvania on Sept. 17.
The letter added that the moderators would be Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier.
Biden and Trump had committed to a debate earlier in September on ABC News, but it's unclear whether an ABC News debate will still take place now that Biden has stepped aside and endorsed Harris.
The proposed Fox debate could come the day before Trump is scheduled to be sentenced for his hush money conviction. The sentencing hearing had been scheduled for July 11, but the judge overseeing the trial postponed it until at least Sept. 18 after Trump's lawyers asked for more time to review the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling.Rebecca Shabad
Netanyahu said he wants to thank former President Trump ""for his leadership"" and his efforts to secure the Abraham Accords, the September 2020 deal to normalize relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, and Israel and Bahrain. That line drew cheers from lawmakers in the chamber. 
""Like Americans, Israelis were relieved that President Trump emerged safe and sound from that dastardly attack on him,"" he said. ""There is no room for political violence in democracies.""
""I also want to thank President Trump for all the things he did for Israel — from recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights ... to recognizing Jerusalem as our capital and moving the American Embassy"" there from Tel Aviv, Netanyahu said, which drew some boos from the chamber.

Netanyahu blasted the International Criminal Court in his speech and said, ""America will be next."" 
""The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has shamefully accused Israel of deliberately starving the people of Gaza. This is utter, complete nonsense. It's a complete fabrication,"" Netanyahu said. 
The ICC's chief prosecutor said in May that he was seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders so they can be charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity. 
The prosecutor said he was also seeking an arrest warrant for Hamas' leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar. Frank Thorp Vproducer and off-air reporter

Through the several standing ovations for Netanyahu, two Democratic senators — Raphael Warnock of Georgia and Chris Murphy of Connecticut —have stayed in their seats and not clapped. When Netanyahu spoke about bringing hostages home, Murphy, Warnock, Reps. Pete Aguilar of California and Katherine Clark of Connecticut seemed to be the only Democrats who did not stand. 
Schumer smiled for the first time in his remarks when Netanyahu spoke about IDF soldiers returning to battle. 
Senate Democrats were seated in the front two rows. Besides Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema and West Virginia Joe Manchin (both have left the Democratic Party and become independents) all stayed seated and did not clap when Netanyahu said protestors should be ashamed of themselves. Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, with Manchin and Sinema, also stood up when Netanyahu discussed University of  North Carolina fraternity brothers who clashed with anti-Israel protesters while the other Democrats remained stoic and seated.

Netanyahu thanked Biden for his efforts to secure the release of hostages held in Gaza since Oct. 7.
""I want to thank President Biden for his tireless efforts on behalf of the hostages and for his efforts to the hostage families,"" Netanyahu said, and ""for his heartfelt support for Israel."" 
""After the savage attack on Oct. 7, he rightly called Hamas sheer evil,"" he said. 
Netanyahu's comments about Biden were met with resounding bipartisan applause. There has been tension between the two leaders over Netanyahu's  handling of the war in Gaza and they are expected to meet tomorrow in the White House.
Biden ""came to Israel to stand with us during our darkest hour — a visit that will never be forgotten,"" said Netanyahu. ""Biden and I have known each other for over 40 years. I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel, and for being, as he says, a proud Zionist.""Rebecca Shabad
Netanyahu spoke about Noa Argamani, the Israeli woman sitting in the House gallery as the prime minister's guest, and her experience as a hostage taken to Gaza on Oct. 7 and rescued by Israeli security forces in early June. 
Netanyahu said on ""the morning of Oct. 7, the entire world saw Noa's look of desperation as she was violently abducted to Gaza on the back of a motorcycle.""
He referenced the operation that rescued Argamani and three other hostages who were held captive in Gaza. 
The prime minister also spoke about other hostages or families of hostages attending his speech. 
""I met with them again yesterday and I promised them this — I will not rest until all their loved ones are home,"" he said. Rebecca Shabad

Police near the Capitol have used pepper spray to attempt to disperse protestors with the ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism) Coalition. 
About 500 protestors gathered in the street earlier this morning ahead of  Netanyahu's address to Congress.
The protesters were standing behind a large canvas banner that reads “Arrest Netanyahu for Genocide"" and planned to create a “people’s red line against genocide” and conduct a “citizen’s arrest” of Netanyahu. 
The group has provided attendees with signs on wood posts with phrases like “free all Palestinian political prisoners” and “lift the siege on Gaza now” as well as a “wanted” posted for Netanyahu.Summer Concepcion
In remarks at the Zeta Phi Beta Sorority Inc. Grand Boule in Indianapolis, Harris sought to draw a stark contrast between the policies she champions and those proposed by Trump and his conservative allies.
“As we work to build a brighter future and to move our nation forward, we must also recognize there are those who are trying to take us backward. You may have seen their agenda, part of it is called Project 2025,” she said, referring to an expansive conservative blueprint for a second Trump term proposed by the Heritage Foundation, which Trump has sought to distance himself from. 
Harris argued that Project 2025 is an effort to “return America to a dark past.”
“This represents an outright attack on our children, our families and our future,” she said. “These extremists want to take us back, but we are not going back.”
Harris told the gathering of one of the nation's largest historically Black sororities that Americans’ “hard won freedoms and rights,” such as voting rights and reproductive health rights, are under threat. She specifically took aim at Trump’s appointment of three conservative justices to the Supreme Court, which ultimately led to the overturning in 2022 of the landmark ruling Roe v. Wade that guaranteed a constitutional right to an abortion.
“Well, let me tell you something: When I am president of the United States, and when Congress passes a law to restore those freedoms, I will sign it into law,” she said.
Harris concluded that “there’s so much at stake in this moment.”
“Our nation, as it always has, is counting on you to energize, to organize and to mobilize, to register folks to vote, to get them to the polls and to continue to fight for the future our nation and her people deserve,” she said.Emma Barnett

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro dodged questions today about whether he's being vetted as a potential running mate for Harris, and told reporters when asked about calls for the Democratic National Convention to hold an open nomination vote that ""anyone could have jumped into this process.""
""It was an open process,"" Shapiro said at a press conference in New Castle, Pennsylvania. ""The vice president jumped in. I endorsed her immediately, as of course did President Biden. She has earned this nomination. She has earned the support of the needed number of delegates to make her the nominee. She has done an extraordinary job over the last, what has it been, 72-96 hours, something like that, of consolidating the party behind her.""
""For anyone calling for any open process, I will tell you we had one,"" he continued. ""And you know what? She kicked butt, and she earned the support, and she earned the nomination, and I’m proud to support her.""
Shapiro also called Harris' decision about a running mate a ""deeply personal"" one ""that she is obviously quite familiar with because she went through it with then-candidate Biden when she was selected to serve as the vice president of the United States.""
The decision should be made ""free from any political pressure,"" Shapiro added.Nicole Moeder
The father of one of the American hostages held in Gaza questioned Netanyahu's speech to Congress during an interview on MSNBC's ""Andrea Mitchell Reports.""
Jonathan Dekel-Chen, whose son Sagui Dekel-Chen has been held hostage in Gaza since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, called Netanyahu’s visit to the U.S. this week a “staged piece of political theater."" He said that “the vast majority of Israelis already understand” that Netanyahu is in “survival” mode,” and if the war in Gaza were to end, “it is doubtful” his coalition government “would survive.” 
He also criticized the meeting Netanyahu held last night with hostage families as ""neither intimate, nor just hostage families."" He said Netanyahu brought his own guests to the meeting and the ""most vocal were people not exposed to anything other than Bibi’s political line.""Matt Dixon

Even if not directly stated, Andy Beshear knew why he was on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe”: an audition. 
About halfway through an 11-minute interview Monday morning, the 48-year-old Kentucky governor, who comes from the state’s political royalty, seamlessly turned his attention to Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who last week was picked as Donald Trump’s running mate. 
“I want the American people to know what a Kentuckian is and what they look like, because let me tell you, JD Vance ain’t from here,” Beshear said.
Beshear’s jab was no accident. 
Vance’s selection last week was viewed, in part, through the lens of geography. He is from a small, poverty-stricken town in Ohio and seen as someone who could solidify the Trump campaign in key swaths of the Midwest and Pennsylvania. 
After President Joe Biden made the historic decision to get out of the 2024 presidential race on Sunday, Vice President Kamala Harris became the party’s likely nominee and started the process of picking a running mate. Her shortlist includes several white governors from politically important states, including Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro, Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer, Minnesota’s Tim Walz and Beshear.
Unlike the others, Beshear’s red-hued state is most likely not in play in 2024. The two-term red-state governor, though, won re-election last year in a state Trump won by more than 20 percentage points in 2020. He also won by 22 percentage points in the eastern Kentucky county that Vance referred to in his Republican National Convention speech, a county Trump claimed by 52 points in 2020. In a region where Democrats are still fighting for votes, Beshear is seen as someone with a bipartisan reputation who can serve as a counterbalance to Vance.

FBI Director Christopher Wray testified at a House Judiciary Committee hearing today that a laptop tied to Trump's would-be assassin, Thomas Crooks, showed a Google search on July 6 that asked, “How far away was Oswald from Kennedy?”
The search refers to Lee Harvey Oswald, who assassinated President John F. Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963.
Wray also said the shooter’s rifle “had a collapsible stock, which could explain why it might have been less easy for people to observe.""
The hearing on FBI oversight has focused on the details surrounding the attempted assassination of Trump.

FBI Director Christopher Wray pushed back today on recent GOP slights against working women and people of color, telling a House Judiciary Committee hearing that it was an “insult” for critics to suggest they are less qualified for the job. 
“Any notion that we have lowered our standards is just not accurate,” Wray said.
Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have come under criticism from some Republicans after the attempted assassination of Trump on July 13 and Biden's decision on Sunday to end his re-election campaign, making way for Harris as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
On Monday, Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., told then-Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle that she was a “DEI horror story” during a hearing on the security lapses at Trump's rally. That day, Burchett also called Harris a “DEI vice president.” 
During a House Judiciary Committee hearing today, when asked to address DEI attacks, Wray said the FBI's hiring process was as “competitive and selective as ever.” 
The notion that women and people of color are “less qualified, frankly, is not at all consistent with what I’ve seen,” Wray said.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in remarks on the Senate floor this morning that he plans to attend Netanyahu's speech this afternoon despite his differences with the Israeli prime minister.
“Even though I disagree with many of Bibi Netanyahu policies, I will attend the speech because the United States relationship with Israel remains ironclad and transcends any prime minister or president, and we must do all we can to get our hostages home,"" said Schumer, the highest-ranking Jewish official in the U.S. ever.
In March, Schumer called for new elections in Israel to replace Netanyahu as the country's prime minister, saying that he had ""lost his way ... by allowing his political survival to take precedence over the best interests of Israel.""Amanda TerkelPolitics Managing Editor
When Biden announced he was dropping his re-election bid and throwing his support to Harris, the dynamics of the entire presidential race radically shifted. 
No longer was it two white men born in the 1940s facing off — again — for who should return to the White House. Instead, it’s between Trump, a man who is 78, against Harris, who is 59 and would make history as the first woman of color to be president if elected. 
And within a day, Harris was already facing attacks that centered on her race and gender, making it clear that while Republicans may try to tie her to some of Biden’s policies, she will face criticisms he never did.
Trump and his allies are taking pages from the same playbook they used the last time a woman was on top of the Democratic ticket. In 2016, Hillary Clinton’s qualifications, look and voice were also scrutinized. But this time, Republicans are also going after the background of Harris, the daughter of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father.

Several of the six American hostage families who are in Washington for the Netanyahu speech said they are upset that he is here instead of in Israel trying to get their loved ones home. 
They are also upset that he brought Israeli families to a meeting they had with him at his hotel Monday night — conducted in Hebrew — and every time they pressed him on the hostage deal, his aides would call on one of the prime minister’s supporters to validate his insistence that he still has to go after Hamas. 
Some of the families will be watching his speech from the gallery at the invitation of Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del. Afterward, they are supposed to meet with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Netanyahu.  
After meeting with national security adviser Jake Sullivan this week, they say they are looking toward tomorrow’s joint meeting at the White House with Biden and Netanyahu as a chance for Sullivan and the president to pressure Netanyahu to agree to a deal as soon as next week with no new obstacles. 
Biden clearly wants to get this done on his watch. Netanyahu is under huge pressure back home from the military, the intelligence and a majority of the Israeli public to wind the war down and agree to a cease-fire. Importantly, Hezbollah has said it will observe a Gaza cease-fire — which would de-escalate the threat from the north and permit 60,000 Israelis who’ve been evacuated from their homes near the Lebanon border since Oct. 7 to return home before school is set to reopen in the fall.      
They also don’t know whether Netanyahu’s Friday meeting with Trump will help or hurt their cause: They worry Trump might encourage the Israeli leader to hold out until after the November election. They hope instead that Trump  might want to take credit for closing the deal if it’s announced next week, saying he was Netanyahu's last meeting before flying home. Chuck Todd
Building an airplane as it takes off is no way to build an airplane. And yet, sometimes, circumstances dictate that you have no choice but to try.
Of all the potential metaphors to use and abuse in this unprecedented moment, that’s probably the best one. Building a national campaign isn’t easy. It’s also exactly what Harris and the Democrats are doing with just over 100 days until Election Day.
Harris tried it once herself and experienced some ups but a lot more downs. She’s getting a massive head start this time compared to her 2020 primary campaign, thanks to what has turned into an almost seamless handoff from President Joe Biden to the new de facto Democratic nominee.
The Democratic National Committee seems set on trying to nominate Harris and her eventual running mate in a virtual delegate roll call before the actual convention begins. While I understand some of party leaders’ technical concerns around state laws and waiting until the start of the convention to officially nominate Harris and her running mate, it seems like an unnecessary step given the circumstances. The Democrats should welcome any GOP attempts to block Harris from a state ballot, because voters wouldn’t love the look, because there’s nothing about what the Democrats are doing that’s illegal or even unprecedented.

Vote.org says that a surge in voter registrations over the past two days has set a record for the 2024 election cycle. 
A spokesperson for the platform said the website saw more than 38,500 registrations since Biden's withdrawal. That outpaced when Taylor Swift posted on Instagram last September urging people to vote, driving about 34,000 registrations in 48 hours, the spokesperson said in an email.

Senior Harris campaign aides working on helping her pick a running mate are focused on choosing someone who can speak directly to older white voters and suburban women about crime, abortion and the economy and can defend Harris against voters who may be uncomfortable supporting a Black and South Asian woman, two sources familiar with the campaign’s thinking told NBC News.
The campaign’s thinking is informed by internal polling and what they see as the state of the nation and Trump’s messaging, the sources said. They view Harris’ VP search much like former President Barack Obama’s decision to tap Biden as his running mate in 2008.
A source familiar with the campaign’s thinking said Harris aides are “batting around internally” which potential running mates will “appeal in short order to that 1 or 2 percent of voters” in battleground states who will likely decide the election.
“They are feeling like you need somebody who can go in and talk to these suburban women,” the source said. “The internal polling is showing that’s who you’re targeting. You’re targeting them on reproductive rights. You’re targeting them on democracy. You’re targeting them on law and order. You’re not really trying to sell them on governing or on record or any of that, but these are sort of softer issues.”
A second source familiar with how the Harris campaign is approaching selecting her running mate said Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper are viewed as top contenders by many aides, though others, including Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are also being vetted and considered also potential good choices.
The campaign is particularly interested in someone who will appeal to demographics and the voters that Biden would have brought to the table, including older white voters and suburban women, the source said. 
Aides to Harris also would like the running mate to appeal specifically to white men who don’t like Trump but who may have doubts about voting for a Black and South Asian woman, the source said.
“Let’s just face it. There’s a lot of sexist, racist white dudes out there in America who don’t like Trump, but just need a little extra validation. And, bringing one of the people mentioned onto the ticket helps validate her among those constituents,” the source said, adding that the campaign would like the running mate to appeal both to battleground states and to be ready to fight back hard at Republican attacks.
The source noted that the campaign is “in the honeymoon stage right now” in its VP search, “but things are about to get real.” 
“She needs someone who is going to be able to defend her and stand by her in the numerous hard times that are ahead. MAGA is just going to unleash,” the source said. “These are going to be terrifyingly crazy days. She needs someone who will be able to prop her up during hard times, and someone who, when these memes take hold, when the deepfakes take hold, when all those things start happening, will be able to stand by her and validate her to a small core constituency that will ultimately decide this election.”Ali Vitali
In Harris’ quick, if unorthodox, rise to the top of the Democratic ticket, elected officials, activists and operatives see in her a new chance to beat Trump and make history in one swoop.
Eight years after Trump beat Hillary Clinton, Harris could be the first female president and the first Black woman and the first South Asian American to hold the nation’s top job, as well.
Democrats are somewhat optimistic, now armed with weapons they didn’t have in 2016: a messenger in Harris who is uniquely positioned to energize voters following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn national abortion rights, more proof from the ballot box that women can win in battleground areas and the knowledge that Trump himself is beatable — if still politically dangerous.
“The lessons that still apply [from 2016] are that people need to take Trump and his supporters seriously,” Shaunna Thomas, who co-founded and runs the pro-women group Ultraviolet, told NBC News. “That’s even more of a top-line message than whether or not a woman can win the presidency.”

Trump plans to stop holding outdoor rallies like the one where he was shot during an assassination attempt this month in Butler, Pennsylvania, according to two sources familiar with his campaign’s operations.
The sources said current plans are to hold indoor rallies, but they also said it’s possible Trump will participate in smaller outdoor events or larger rallies in facilities where entrances are more fully controlled and there are not issues with high ground nearby, like stadiums.
Spokespeople for the Trump campaign and the Secret Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment last night.
News of the shift in venues comes the day the director of the Secret Service, Kimberly Cheatle, announced her resignation. In her resignation letter, Cheatle said she took “full responsibility for the security lapse” in Pennsylvania.

In a new memo, the Harris campaign outlined what it views as the vice president’s pathway to victory and contextualized its belief that she is in a “position of strength” heading into the November election.
Campaign Chair Jen O’Malley Dillon cited Harris’ advantages with Black, Latino, Asian American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, female and young voters. Dillon also pointed to the support Harris has gained through grassroots fundraising and her ability to communicate effectively on the issue of abortion rights.
“With a popular message, a strong record on the issues that matter most to swing voters, multiple pathways to 270 electoral voters, and unprecedented enthusiasm on her side, the Vice President is in a strong position to take on Donald Trump and win in 104 days,” Dillon wrote.
Dillon argued that Harris is “well positioned” to expand support from the 2020 election, citing voters who didn’t support for the Biden-Harris ticket that year but came out to vote for Democrats in the 2022 midterm elections as “Donald Trump’s Republican Party grew more and more extreme.”
Dillon, however, noted that the campaign must bring more awareness to Harris and her policies in order to win voters who aren't familiar with her.
“In a highly polarized electoral environment, this shift in the race opens up additional persuadable voters who our campaign can work to win the support of,” Dillon wrote. “This race is more fluid now — the Vice President is well-known but less well-known than both Trump and President Biden, particularly among Dem-leaning constituencies.”
“This expanded universe of winnable voters is highly accessible to Vice President Harris: We have a clear advantage on issues, they have been supportive of Democrats in the past, and many are supportive of Democrats down-ballot,” she added. “It is the job of the Harris campaign to win these voters, but the pathway to do so is clear.”
Dillon concluded that the campaign will be “close, it will be hard fought, but Vice President Harris is in a position of strength — and she’s going to win.”Rebecca Kaplan

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to address a joint meeting of Congress this afternoon, his first since Hamas’ terrorist attack on Israel killed 1,200 people and resulted in the taking of hostages to Gaza, where about 100 are still believed to be held captive.
Netanyahu’s speech at 2 p.m. ET comes at a critical period: The U.S. is in the middle of a chaotic election year, and the Biden administration continues to push negotiators toward a cease-fire agreement that could end the war in Gaza, where the death toll has surpassed an estimated 30,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry.
“In my speech, I will emphasize the importance of bipartisan support for Israel, I will address our friends on both sides of the map and tell them that regardless of who will be chosen to lead the American people after the presidential elections, Israel is the most important ally of the United States in the Middle East, an irreplaceable ally,” Netanyahu said before he left for the U.S., according to his office.
He added, “I think that in this time of war and uncertainty, it is of utmost importance that our enemies know that the U.S. and Israel stand together — today, tomorrow and forever.”

For more than three at-times excruciating weeks, Biden and his team were locked in a campaign to save his candidacy. With his prime-time address to the nation tonight, a new effort is underway: to shape his legacy.
A team of Biden’s closest advisers is already at work to plot out what that will look like. The discussion includes domestic priorities he could advance in coming budget negotiations with Congress or through executive action, diplomatic initiatives he could see through with a freer hand and accomplishing what he has described as the most elusive of the three goals he outlined in his 2020 campaign — unifying the country.
NBC News spoke to a half-dozen White House and campaign officials about what Biden is planning, and advisers said they recognize that the biggest factor shaping how he is viewed in history will be whether Vice President Kamala Harris is successful in her bid to succeed him.
“Everything is being viewed through that lens,” a White House official said.

42,NBC_43,North Korean trash balloon lands on South Korea's presidential compound,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/north-korea-trash-balloon-lands-south-korea-president-compound-rcna163380,"SEOUL, South Korea — It’s not the cross-border barrage South Koreans have been fearing, but a balloon carrying a bag of trash floated over from North Korea and hit the presidential compound, security officials said Wednesday.  
Seoul’s Presidential Security Service told NBC News in a telephone call that it had tracked the balloon in real-time as it was carried by the winds across its nuclear-armed neighbor's border, until it eventually landed in the the presidential compound in the South Korean capital. 
It posed no danger, the agency added.
Balloons emerged as a new and messy weapon of war earlier this year. Since May, North Korea has been floating thousands of balloons with bags of trash attached to them, which have become a new source of tension between the two Koreas. Some have been filled with bottles, old batteries and even manure, but more recently they have just been carrying waste paper. 
Pyongyang has said the launches are a tit-for-tat response to activists and defectors who have for years sent propaganda leaflets via balloons. Others have contained dollar drugs and painkillers like Paracetamol. 
South Korea’s military is “closely monitoring North Korean movements,” the country’s Defense Minister Shin Won-sik told the Japanese newspaper Yomiuiri in an interview published Wednesday. 
He added that it was possible that North Korea’s ""military could fire at the balloons being sent by South Korean activists or the source where the balloons are launched.""
However, the likelihood of Pyongyang's military detecting the exact time and location of the South Korean balloons was low, the defense ministry told NBC News.
North Korea floated another round of balloons on Sunday, which South Korea called vulgar and shameful. It responded by blaring K-Pop through loudspeakers across the border. 
“We are broadcasting K-Pop, happy lifestyle [in South Korea], the development of South Korea and so on through the loudspeaker to North Korea,” Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a briefing Tuesday. Separately, their spokesperson Lee Sung-Joon, said they expected these broadcasts to stir up domestic agitation and encourage more defections from North Korea.  
The broadcasts were the first of its kind in more than a month and previously have included K-pop songs, weather forecasts, news on Samsung, the biggest South Korean company, as well criticism of  the North Korean missile program.
Although the balloon landed away from the main presidential office, it was the first one to have landed in the presidential compound, raising security concerns about key buildings. Officials did not say whether the balloon was manually guided, but the Joint Chiefs of Staff said it was carried by westerly winds.
South Korea has warned people to refrain from touching the objects contained in the trash bags.
Shin, South Korea’s defense minister, said Pyongyang ""may also respond by burying land mines, dissemination of propaganda leaflets using drones, disruption of the GPS, cyber-attack and so on.""
His comments came as Belarusian Foreign Minister Maxim Ryzhenkov arrived in the North Korean capital on Tuesday. 
Both countries are allies of Russia, which has become more diplomatically isolated since launching an invasion on Ukraine two years ago.
North Korea is keen to boost ties with Belarus to ""open a new era,"" state media KCNA quoted Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui as saying Wednesday a day after their meeting.
His visit comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin made a rare state visit to Kim last month, where the two signed a mutual defense treaty.
Tensions between the Koreas have been escalating for months, with Kim accelerating weapons testing and North Korean soldiers repeatedly crossing the border briefly that have prompted warning shots. 
Earlier this month, North Korean President Kim Jong Un’s sister, Kim Yo Jang blasted South Korea for ""dirty leaflets"" that were found in the border and other areas of North Korea, hinting on the eventual resumption of balloon launches.
Satellite imagery has also shown North Korea building a wall-like structure along portions of the North Korean side of the demarcation zone (DMZ), which is a 2.5 miles thick buffer zone, half on each side of the border line.
Earlier this year, Kim completely suspended military accords agreed between the two nations in 2018. As well as sending the balloons he also restored border posts. 
South Korea resumed aerial surveillance near the border which it said was in retaliation for North Korea’s satellite launch in November.

42,FOX_19,North Korean trash balloon drops garbage on South Korea’s presidential compound,https://www.foxnews.com/world/north-korean-trash-balloon-drops-garbage-south-koreas-presidential-compound,"Fox News contributor Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg discusses the global implications of Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un signing an 'aggression' pact on 'Your World.'
Trash carried by at least one North Korean balloon fell on the South Korean presidential compound on Wednesday, raising worries about the security of key South Korean facilities during North Korean provocations.
The rubbish that landed on the presidential compound in central Seoul contained no dangerous material and no one was hurt, South Korea’s presidential security service said. While North Korea likely lacks sophisticated technology to drop balloons on specific targets, some experts say South Korea should shoot down incoming North Korean balloons next time to protect major facilities because they might contain hazardous substances in the future.
North Korea's latest balloon launches came days after South Korea boosted its broadcasts of K-pop songs and propaganda messages across the two countries' heavily armed border. Their tit-for-tat Cold War-style campaigns are inflaming tensions, with the rivals threatening stronger steps and warning of grave consequences.
SOUTH KOREA PREPARING 'STARWARS' LASER DEFENSE SYSTEM TO TAKE OUT NORTH KOREAN DRONES
Seoul officials earlier said North Korea used the direction of winds to fly balloons toward South Korea, but some of the past balloons had timers that were likely meant to pop the bags of trash in midair.
The security service gave no further details about the rubbish found at the presidential compound. It refused to disclose whether President Yoon Suk Yeol was at the compound when the balloons were flying over his office, a no-fly zone in South Korea.
If North Korea is found to have used timers or any other device to deliberately dump trash on the presidential office, it would invite a strong response by South Korea. But experts say dropping balloons on selected ground targets requires advanced technology and that North Korea would certainly lack such an ability.

""Some of (the hundreds of balloons) launched by North Korea landed on the presidential compound by coincidence. North Korea has no technology to precisely drop balloons at certain targets,"" said Jung Chang Wook, head of the Korea Defense Study Forum think tank in Seoul.
Jung said that a GPS navigation device and a power system would need to be attached to a balloon to make it fall on certain sites and that North Korea doesn't possess such balloons. He said North Korea likely wanted the balloons to fall on Seoul, about an hour's drive from the border, after calculating factors like the weight of the trash bags tied to the balloons, the volume of air in the balloons and the weather conditions.
Lee Illwoo, an expert with the Korea Defense Network in South Korea, said strong winds in Seoul would also make it impossible for North Korea to target certain places with balloons.
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said earlier Wednesday that North Korea had resumed floating balloons across the border, the 10th such launch since late May.
The more than 2,000 North Korean balloons discovered in South Korea in the past weeks carried wastepaper, scraps of cloth, cigarette butts and even manure. North Korea has said it was responding to South Korean activists who have scattered political leaflets across the border via their own balloons.
North Korea’s balloons haven’t caused any major damage but have raised security jitters among people worried it could use such balloons to drop chemical and biological agents.
South Korea has avoided shooting at the balloons because of possible damage caused by falling bullets and the chance that the balloons might contain hazardous substances.
Lee said South Korea should still shoot down North Korean balloons in border areas because attacking them over the populous Seoul area would be too risky if they contain dangerous items like biological agents. But there are worries that doing so could cause skirmishes with North Korea. Jung said South Korea could use recently developed laser weapons to intercept North Korean balloons.
Experts say North Korea considers leafleting activities by South Korean civilian groups a major threat to its efforts to stop the inflow of foreign news and maintain its authoritarian rule. In furious responses to past South Korean leafleting, North Korea destroyed an empty South Korean-built liaison office in its territory in 2020 and fired at incoming balloons in 2014.
South Korea said Sunday it was ramping up its anti-North Korean propaganda broadcasts from loudspeakers at all major sites along the land border because the North was continuing its launches of trash-carrying balloons. South Korea restarted its loudspeaker broadcasts last Thursday for the first time in about 40 days in retaliation for North Korea's previous balloon activities.
Observers say the propaganda broadcasts can demoralize front-line North Korean troops and residents. In 2015, North Korea fired artillery rounds across the border in anger over South Korea's restart of propaganda broadcasts, prompting the South to return fire.

South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesperson Lee Sung Joon said the current South Korean broadcasts include K-pop songs and news on South Korean economic development. South Korean media reported the broadcasts also contained news on the recent defection of a senior North Korean diplomat and called the planting of land mines by North Korean soldiers at the border ""hellish, slave-like lives.""
South Korea has an estimated 40 loudspeakers — 24 stationary and 16 mobile ones. South Korea's military said Monday it was operating all of the fixed loudspeakers and plans to use the mobile loudspeakers as well.
North Korea hasn't officially responded to the South Korean propaganda broadcasts. But last week, Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, threatened new countermeasures against South Korean civilian leafleting, warning that South Korean ""scum"" must be ready to pay ""a gruesome and dear price"" for their actions."
42,CNN_43,North Korea’s trash balloons fall near South’s presidential office,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/asia/north-korea-trash-balloons-presidential-compound-intl-hnk/index.html,"
            Trash-laden North Korean balloons were found on the grounds of South Korea’s presidential office compound, officials said Wednesday, the latest in a series of incidents that have raised tensions and rhetoric on the Korean Peninsula.
    

            More than 3,000 North Korean balloons, often filled with garbage such as cigarette butts, discarded batteries and even manure have fallen in the South since May, according to South Korean officials – who have responded by resuming loudspeaker broadcasts of propaganda and entertainment like K-pop songs along the demilitarized zone (DMZ).
    

            The discovery at the presidential office Wednesday came after South Korean authorities warned the public to beware of falling objects as suspected North Korean trash balloons moved south toward the northern area of Gyeonggi province.
    

            “While monitoring trash balloons sent by North Korea in cooperation with the Joint Chiefs of Staff today, we identified trash that fell in the presidential office area in Yongsan,” the presidential security service said later in a statement.
    

            “No harmful or contaminating substances were found from an analysis by the response team.”
    

            South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) has advised people not to touch fallen balloons and to report any found to authorities.

            “North Korea’s actions clearly violate international law and seriously threaten the safety of our citizens,” JCS said in a statement after an earlier balloon incident. “All responsibility arising from the North Korean balloons lies entirely with North Korea, and we sternly warn North Korea to immediately stop its inhumane and low-level actions.”
    

            Pyongyang has previously said it sent balloons south in response to a civilian campaign in South Korea to float balloons carrying anti-North Korean propaganda in the opposite direction.
    

            For many years, South Korean activists and North Korean defectors have sent balloons to the North, loaded with material criticizing dictator Kim Jong Un and USB sticks filled with K-pop songs and South Korean television shows – all strictly prohibited in the impoverished, highly isolated nation.
    

            In a statement carried by North Korean state media earlier this month, Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of the North Korean leader, said dozens of balloons, “dirty leaflets” and other material sent from South Korea were again found in her country and near the border.
    

            Despite repeated North Korean warnings, the South Korean activists were “not stopping this crude and dirty play” she said.

            “It seems that the situation we cannot overlook is coming,” Kim Yo Jong said in a “stern warning” published by North Korea’s state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), adding there would be “a gruesome and dear price” to pay that could change the South’s “mode of counteraction” with the North.
    

            While the balloons have been going across the border, North Korea has kept up a stream of criticism against military drills by the United States and South Korea on the peninsula, the latest of those being the deployment of US Marine Corps F/A-18 and F-35B fighter jets to Suwon Air Base for joint aerial training this week.
    

            The South Korean Defense Ministry said the US planes will join with South Korean F-15, F-16 and FA-50 fighters in exercises that will end August 8.
    

            A US Defense Department release said the Marine Corps jets were dispatched “to enhance their standard of readiness and lethality with our South Korean allies and joint forces.”
    

            But a KCNA commentary claimed the joint maneuvers were an example of Washington “running high fever in its move to expand the overall structure of confrontation against” North Korea.
    

            North and South Korea have been divided since 1953, when an armistice ended the Korean War three years after the North invaded the South. But a peace treaty has never been signed, so the two technically remain at war.

42,WaPo_13,North Korean balloon drops trash on South Korean presidential office,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/24/korea-trash-balloon-presidential-office/,"For the past few months, North Korea has been pestering its southern neighbor with seemingly sporadic swarms of balloons ferrying trash. The garbage has fallen on South Korean roads, buildings and cars — more of a nuisance than a major security threat incoming from a nuclear-armed rival.But on Wednesday, the rhetorical rubbish landed on the presidential compound in Seoul, delivering what was perhaps the most humiliating of the unwanted loads from the North so far and raising security concerns and questions about whether the situation would devolve.The trash that landed on the presidential office in central Seoul descended from a flock of hundreds of balloons sent from the North on Wednesday, South Korea’s semiofficial Yonhap News Agency reported, citing the South’s Joint Chiefs of Staff. The garbage was discovered on the grounds of the compound by the Presidential Security Service.The Joint Chiefs of Staff said as many as 300 balloons were detected by 4 p.m. local time. Wednesday’s tally was “expected to rise as additional balloons are floating in midair,” Yonhap reported.Wednesday’s dump was the 10th such delivery since the balloon launches began at the end of May, according to data assembled by the Beyond Parallel project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. Among the items deposited across South Korea, according to the project: animal and human feces, batteries, cigarette butts, toilet paper, and clothes.The garbage on Wednesday landed mostly around Seoul, the data showed, the capital city home to more than 9.6 million people about 35 miles south of the border — though earlier waves have reached as far south as Jeonbuk, a province in South Korea’s southwest. The balloons appear to be rudimentary, unable to be steered or directed toward a specific location, making the hit on the presidential compound more a stroke of luck for Pyongyang than a targeted attack.Still, the garbage falling on the presidential office was a “significant PR embarrassment for the South Korean government because it shows how vulnerable they are to ‘soft terrorism,’ which could escalate,” said Victor Cha, Korea chair at CSIS.“Imagine if the balloons were filled with unidentified white powder rather than trash?” he wrote in an email to The Washington Post. Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, was assassinated with the nerve agent VX at an airport in Malaysia in 2017, police there said at the time.Seoul has retaliated by blasting propaganda broadcasts toward the North. South Korean activists have taken it upon themselves to send balloons of their own ferrying anti-North Korea fliers and USB drives containing K-pop and K-dramas. Sending leaflets to the North was briefly outlawed in the South before the law was struck down last year.The resumption of the broadcasts comes after Seoul stopped the audio warfare in 2015, when an angered North began a military buildup along the border.North Korea and South Korea are still technically at war with each other, having never signed a peace treaty to end last century’s Korean War, though the weaponry being lobbed across the demilitarized zone is now garbage and K-pop. (Insurers in the South have begun covering damage inflicted to cars by the balloons despite cutouts in policies exempting acts of war, the Korea Times reported.)South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has taken a more assertive stance against Pyongyang, dashing some activists’ hopes of reunification, as South Korea aligns itself more closely with Japan and the United States to manage risks in the region such as a more zealous Beijing.Cha, of CSIS, said the government in Seoul has “not looked for a conciliatory solution but has ramped up the escalation” with its broadcasts across the border.Ultimately, however, the tit-for-tat reflects most poorly on Pyongyang, displaying its “vulnerability and insecurity,” Cha said. North Korea’s leaders are “more afraid of BTS than US-South Korean military exercises or U.S. nuclear weapons,” he said."
49,NBC_51,"As Harris' campaign ramps up, Trump and allies sharpen race- and gender-based attacks",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/republican-attacks-kamala-harris-center-race-gender-dumb-dei-candidate-rcna162570,"When President Joe Biden announced he was dropping his re-election bid and throwing his support to his vice president, Kamala Harris, the dynamics of the entire presidential race radically shifted. 
No longer was it two white men born in the 1940s facing off — again — for who should return to the White House. Instead, it’s between Trump, a man who is 78, against Harris, who is 59 and would make history as the first woman and first woman of color to be president if she is elected. 
And within a day, Harris was already facing attacks that centered on her race and gender, making it clear that while Republicans may try to tie her to some of Biden’s policies, she will face criticisms he never did. 
It is some of the same playbook that Trump and his allies ran the last time a woman was on top of a major-party ticket. In 2016, Hillary Clinton’s qualifications, look and voice were also scrutinized. But this time, Republicans are also going after the background of Harris, the daughter of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father. 
Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., called Harris a “DEI vice president” on social media, referring to workplace policies that promote diversity, equity and inclusion that conservatives have maligned. 
“When you go down that route, you take mediocrity, and that’s what they have right now,” Burchett told CNN. 
Sebastian Gorka, a host on the conservative network Newsmax who served in the Trump administration, said Harris was going to be the nominee “because she’s female and her skin color is the correct DEI color.” He also said she “cackles like an insane woman.”
Fox News host Jesse Watters said Harris secured Hillary Clinton’s endorsement, “obviously, because she’s a woman.”
And Richard Grenell, U.S. ambassador to Germany in the Trump administration, told NBC News that Harris was part of a “revolving door of DEI appointments from the straight white male governor, who hands out appointments to keep different groups happy and at bay,” referring to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat. “Kamala Harris is a product of this whole system. She’s very far left, unvetted and untested.”
Before she became vice president, Harris won two terms as a district attorney in California and was elected three times statewide as attorney general and then U.S. senator. Trump, who had a successful career in real estate and entertainment, had no government experience before he became president.

In 2016, Trump repeatedly accused Clinton of playing the “woman’s card” to get where she is, going after her “strength” and “stamina” and mocking her voice. 
“She’s got nothing else going on,” he said of his opponent, who had been a senator from New York and secretary of state. “And frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don’t think she’d get 5% of the vote.”
“If she didn’t play the woman’s card she would have no chance, I mean zero, of winning,” he said on another occasion. 
“The only thing she’s got going is the fact that she’s a woman,” Trump also said in an interview with NBC’s “Today” show.
Trump brought out a “card” attack against Harris on Tuesday, but this time, it was the “race card.”
On a call hosted by the Republican National Committee, Trump said Harris “played the race card on a level you rarely see” during the Democratic primary debates with Biden in the 2020 election. 
“It’s a well-worn playbook for him,” said Democratic strategist Karen Finney, who was a spokesperson for Clinton’s 2016 campaign. “But the reality is we also know that people wouldn’t use the playbook if it didn’t work to some degree.”
“Even in 2016, there were so many times it was so over the top and so disgusting. But I think coming against Kamala Harris, and perhaps it will be both race and gender ... maybe the combination of both is what will stand out to people,” she added. “And I think the country is changing, and it’s going to be more blatant to people how disgusting and inappropriate it is.”
In a statement, Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Harris was “just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden — and she’s also dangerously liberal.”
“A vote for Kamala is a vote for more crime, inflation, open borders, high gas prices, and war around the world, and our team will make sure every American knows it,” she added. 
Going after DEI policies wasn’t yet in vogue in 2016, but the current criticism echoes the attacks that Clinton wasn’t qualified enough. On Monday, the New York Post reported that Trump told it in an interview that Harris was “vicious” and “dumb.” 
On Monday, Trump called Harris “Dumb as a Rock” on social media, and for years, he has consistently mispronounced her first name (as did many other speakers at last week’s Republican National Convention).  
In 2016, Trump also said Clinton didn’t have “the look” to be president — but she wasn’t the only one to face those insults. He also mocked his primary opponent Carly Fiorina for having a “face” that voters wouldn’t want to choose.
Trump has long insulted his opponents, including men. But the insults directed at Clinton echoed attacks that women in positions have power have long faced, questioning their qualifications, strength and appearance. 
Defending Fiorina — whom he had named as his running mate, even though he hadn't won the GOP presidential nomination — Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said at the time: “Donald has a problem with strong women. This is not subtle; it’s not complicated.” 
Cruz, another person who once had an acrimonious relationship with Trump after he ran against him in the 2016 primaries, has since put aside those differences and is backing him this time around. 
In a New York Times op-ed Tuesday, Clinton addressed the ""sexism and double standards"" that ""strong women candidates"" face in politics. 
""I’ve been called a witch, a 'nasty woman' and much worse. I was even burned in effigy. As a candidate, I sometimes shied away from talking about making history. I wasn’t sure voters were ready for that. And I wasn’t running to break a barrier; I was running because I thought I was the most qualified to do the job,"" she wrote. 
""Ms. Harris will face unique additional challenges as the first Black and South Asian woman to be at the top of a major party’s ticket. That’s real, but we shouldn’t be afraid. It is a trap to believe that progress is impossible,"" Clinton added. 
Harris has also already faced comments centered on her race and gender from Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. In 2020, Trump promoted the baseless “birther” conspiracy theory that Harris — who was born in the U.S. — isn’t eligible to be president because her parents were born in other countries. Trump has also pushed birther conspiracy theories about Cruz, former President Barack Obama and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. 
In 2021, Vance went after Democrats who don’t have biological children of their own, calling them “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” He mentioned Harris — who has two stepchildren, Cole and Ella — along with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. 
“How does it make any sense that we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?” he said at the time. 
His spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk told The Associated Press, “It’s well known that Senator Vance found success in life due in large part to the influence of strong female role models like his grandmother.”
Former Democratic National Committee Chair Donna Brazile said, “The most convenient playbook in American politics has always been race, and race is always going to be a driver of conversation.
“But this is no time to go back using a playbook from the 20th century,"" she added. “We’re in the 21st century. ... I don’t believe that the American people are interested in a conversation that will further divide and further polarize us.”
Some Republicans also quickly criticized the conservative attacks on Harris on Tuesday. 
“I disagree with DEI, but she is the vice president of the United States. She is the former U.S. senator. These congressmen saying it, they are wrong in their own instincts,” former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told NBC News Tuesday.
Asked for comment for this article, the Harris campaign pointed to comments from Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. 
“Of course it’s not appropriate, for heaven’s sakes. What, are they just going to say if you’re not a white male, it’s a DEI candidate?” she told HuffPost on Tuesday. “I’m sorry. No.”Amanda Terkel is politics managing editor for NBC News Digital."
67,NBC_69,10 migrants drown in rushing river crossing Darien Gap in Panama,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/10-migrants-drown-rushing-river-crossing-darien-gap-panama-rcna163531,"Ten migrants drowned trying to cross a rushing river in Panama’s Darien Gap that borders Colombia, Panamanian authorities said Wednesday.
The National Border Service said in a statement that the victims were swept away by the strong current and their bodies were later seen near the Indigenous community of Carreto.
An agency official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the case said on condition of anonymity that the drownings were believed to have occurred on July 16, but the area was so remote that they were only now able to release the information.
The prosecutor’s office was investigating details, including the victims’ nationalities, the official said. More than half of the migrants crossing the Darien come from Venezuela.
More than 500,000 migrants made the treacherous crossing through the jungle-clad border in a record-setting 2023. So far this year, more than 212,000 have entered Panama through the Darien.
It is the rainy season in Panama, making the numerous rivers that migrants have to cross more dangerous.
New Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino has pledged to stop migration through the Darien with assistance from the U.S. government.
Before these 10 deaths were announced, at least 29 migrants had died trying to cross the Darien, according to Panama’s border police. Last year, police recorded 84 deaths.
Drownings occur periodically in the Darien, especially during the rainy season, but authorities said this was one of the largest drowning death tolls they can remember.
In February, five Afghan migrants drowned and one disappeared just off the coast as they tried to enter Panama by boat from Colombia.
The drownings last week came just days after the Panamanian government blocked some popular routes with barbed wire in an effort to funnel migrants to one central receiving point. In other parts of the world, including the U.S. southwest border, enforcement efforts at some locations often push migrants to riskier, more remote routes.
The National Border Service statement Wednesday said that despite efforts to block some routes “transnational organized crime through local collaborators in Caribbean coastal communities insist on using unauthorized paths putting the lives of these people at serious risk.”

            Ten migrants drowned in a flooded river near Panama’s coastal community of Carreto while crossing the Darién Gap, Panama’s National Border Service (Senafront) said Wednesday.
    

            Senafront did not specify the nationalities of the migrants or when they drowned.
    

            The agency said the case is still under investigation but suspects that transnational organized criminals and local collaborators led the migrants through unauthorized border crossings, putting their lives at risk.
    

            The Darién Gap is a mountainous rainforest region connecting Colombia in South America to Panama in Central America that is a crucial passage for migrants hoping to reach the United States and Canada.
    

            There has recently been an increase in the number of migrants willing to risk their lives and safety on the 66-mile (106-kilometer) hike required to cross it and the United States and Panama signed an agreement earlier this month aimed at closing “the passage of illegal immigrants” through it.

            Since the beginning of July, Panama’s new government, led by President José Raúl Mulino, has placed barbed wire across several routes in the Darién Gap, so that migrants who enter illegally through the border with Colombia are forced to use a single authorized entrance, according to the country’s Ministry of Public Security.
    

            “I will not allow Panama to be a path open to thousands of people who enter our country illegally supported by an entire international organization related to drug and human trafficking,” Mulino said at his swearing-in ceremony.
    

            Senafront said the only authorized migration corridor is one that leads to Cañas Blancas, “where specialized patrols are available for their protection and humanitarian assistance.”

97,CNN_60,Netanyahu labels critics of war in Gaza ‘Iran’s useful idiots’ in speech to Congress,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/benjamin-netanyahu-address-washington/index.html,"
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out against protests of Israel’s ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza, broadly disparaging anti-Israel protesters as “Iran’s useful idiots” in an address to Congress on Wednesday.
    

            Netanyahu’s address to Congress comes at a crucial crossroads for the war. US officials have voiced optimism about the prospects of a deal that could free Hamas-held hostages and bring the conflict to an end. It also comes as many on the left have become increasingly dissatisfied with the way Netanyahu has waged the war, which has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians and left Gaza in the grips of a humanitarian catastrophe.
    

            The Israeli prime minister’s nearly hour-long address to Congress struck a bellicose tone as he vowed to “fight until we achieve victory.” Netanyahu falsely downplayed and deflected on the role of Israel in causing the ongoing civilian strife in Gaza. Although he made some reference to efforts to bring the hostages home, significantly more of the speech focused on the ongoing war and took aim at his foes – Iran, the International Criminal Court and protesters.
    

            The US has seen protests across the country on college campuses and elsewhere in opposition to the war against Hamas. On the day of Netanyahu’s speech, there were protests both outside and inside the US Capitol complex. Additionally, the Secret Service is investigating reports that protesters gained access to the hotel building where Netanyahu is staying in Washington, DC, releasing bugs in the hotel and pulling fire alarms, according to a source familiar with the matter.
    

            Netanyahu painted protesters with a broad brush, claiming that “many choose to stand with evil” and that “they stand with Hamas” and “rapists and murderers.”
    

            While Netanyahu heavily criticized protests against the war, both President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have affirmed the right to protest and indicated they believe pro-Palestinian protesters have legitimate grievances – while still criticizing rhetoric that has devolved into antisemitism.
    

            Speaking at a news conference in April, Blinken said he understands the “strong, passionate feelings” people have about the bloodshed in Gaza.
    

            “It’s a hallmark of our democracy that our citizens make known their views, their concerns, their anger at any given time. And I think that reflects the strength of the country, the strength of democracy,” he said about pro-Palestinian protests.
    

            Biden, who has repeatedly faced pro-Palestinian protests at his public events this year, often appears conciliatory toward those interrupting him.
    

            “I understand the passion,” he said after he was repeatedly interrupted during a campaign event at a South Carolina church earlier this year.
    

            In his address to Congress, Netanyahu referenced a recent statement from US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines that Iran is attempting to covertly stoke protests in the US related to the conflict in Gaza.
    

            In her statement, Haines said, however, that she wanted “to be clear that I know Americans who participate in protests are, in good faith, expressing their views on the conflict in Gaza,” adding that “this intelligence does not indicate otherwise.”
    

            “I have a message for these protesters: When the tyrants of Tehran, who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering their hair are praising, promoting and funding you, you have officially become Iran’s useful idiots,” Netanyahu said.
    

            Some members of Congress, mostly Democrats, did not attend Netanyahu’s speech, either as a protest of the war or due to previously scheduled events. The Israel-Hamas war has increasingly become a dividing line among Democrats, exposing rifts within the party.
    

            At one point, Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the lone Palestinian-American congresswoman, held up a sign during the speech that on one side said: “war criminal,” and the other side said: “guilty of genocide.”
    

            Netanyahu slammed those accusing Israel of genocide, suggesting that such accusations were antisemitic.
    

            “The outrageous slanders that paint Israel as racist and genocidal are meant to delegitimize Israel, to demonize the Jewish state, and to demonize Jews everywhere,” he said.
    

            Netanyahu specifically slammed the International Criminal Court’s allegations that Israel is starving Palestinians in Gaza, calling it “utter, complete nonsense” and “a complete fabrication.”
    

            According to the UN, 96% of the population of Gaza currently faces “crisis or worse levels of food insecurity.” Humanitarian aid workers say the war and restrictions imposed by the Israeli government on aid access to Gaza have brought the strip to the brink.
    

            Netanyahu thanked Biden during his speech for his support for Israel, even as Biden’s relationship with Netanyahu has grown steadily colder as the war in Gaza has lagged on and as the death toll in the beleaguered enclave continues to rise. Both leaders have known each other for decades, but have traded not-so-subtle barbs at each other as their disagreements with the war’s future have spilled into the public.
    

            “I thank President Biden for his heartfelt support for Israel after the savage attack on October 7,” he said, thanking Biden “for his tireless efforts on behalf of the hostages and for his efforts to the hostage families as well.”
    

            The speech to Congress comes as the bulk of the nation’s attention has been focused in recent weeks on discussions surrounding Biden’s age and mental fitness – which culminated in Biden announcing over the weekend that he would step down from the Democratic ticket – along with the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump and the Republican National Convention.
    

            “President Biden and I have known each other for over 40 years. I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel,” Netanyahu said.
    

            During his speech to Congress, Netanyahu emphasized the importance of close ties between the US and Israel.
    

            “For the forces of civilization to triumph, America and Israel must stand together,” Netanyahu said to loud cheers from lawmakers in attendance. “Because when we stand together, something very simple happens: We win, they lose.”
    

            There were moments of bipartisanship during the speech. Twice when Netanyahu praised President Joe Biden, both sides gave him a standing ovation. When Netanyahu condemned political violence, that prompted another standing ovation from both sides.

            Biden is scheduled to meet with Netanyahu on Thursday.
    

            Biden has said that Israel has reached its stated goal, described the country’s actions in Gaza as “over the top,” and plainly stated his desire for the war to end. The president has said it is “uncertain” whether Israel had committed war crimes. He has also hinted that he believes Netanyahu is dragging out the war only for the sake of his own political survival.
    

            Netanyahu, meanwhile, has accused the United States of “withholding weapons and ammunitions to Israel,” claims that American officials flatly rejected.
    

            Netanyahu forcefully defended Israel’s right to self-defense in his remarks, saying, “the hands of the Jewish state will never be shackled. Israel will always defend itself.”
    

            “As we defend ourselves on all fronts, I know that America has our back and I thank you for it – all sides of the aisle,” Netanyahu said.
    

            After arriving in Washington earlier this week, Netanyahu met with some American relatives of hostages held by Hamas. Not all participants were pleased with how that meeting ended.
    

            Trump and Netanyahu will also meet Friday at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump announced Tuesday.
    

            A number of Democratic lawmakers did not attend Netanyahu’s speech, with some declining to attend in protest over the war or because of previously scheduled events.
    

            Vice President Kamala Harris, who is now the presumptive Democratic nominee, did not preside in her constitutional role as president of the Senate during Netanyahu’s address; Harris will be in Indianapolis Wednesday, but she is planning to meet with Netanyahu on Thursday, a US official told CNN. Senate President Pro Tempore Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, also declined to preside over the speech.
    

            Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent of Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, said he would skip the address in protest of the “total war” Netanyahu’s government has waged in Gaza.
    

            “No. Netanyahu should not be welcomed into the United States Congress,” Sanders said in a statement. “On the contrary, his policies in Gaza and the West Bank and his refusal to support a two-state solution should be roundly condemned.”

100,CNN_5,Takeaways from FBI testimony: Trump shooter searched details of JFK assassination and flew drone near rally site,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/fbi-wray-house-hearing-trump-shooting/index.html,"
Donald Trump’s would-be assassin searched for details of the John F. Kennedy shooting from his laptop and flew a drone in the area near the rally just two hours before the former president took the stage, FBI Director Christopher Wray said Wednesday.
    

            The stunning revelations are the latest details about the investigation to come to light this week in congressional hearings about the Trump rally on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania.


            At the wide-ranging House Judiciary Committee hearing, Wray also shared that investigators believe that Thomas Matthew Crooks use a gun with a collapsable stock and that he accessed the roof of the building by climbing, not with a ladder.
    

            The hearing included a large share of politics, as Republicans repeatedly mentioned Vice President Kamala Harris as they sought to tie the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee to border policy and other actions, and Democrats asked Wray repeatedly about Project 2025.
    

            Here are the key takeaways from Wednesday’s hearing:
    

            According to the FBI’s analysis of Crooks’ laptop, Crooks searched how far Lee Harvey Oswald was when he shot and killed Kennedy in 1963.
    

            The search was on July 6, the same day he registered to attend the rally.
    

            “On July 6, he did a Google search for: ‘how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,’” Wray told the House Judiciary Committee.
    

            “That’s a search that’s obviously significant in terms of his state of mind,” the FBI director added. “That is the same day that it appears that he registered for the Butler rally.”
    

            Wray revealed that “around 4 p.m.,” Crooks “was flying the drone around the area” of the rally, approximately 200 yards from the stage.

            The drone was in the air for approximately 11 minutes, and investigators believe Crooks watched a live feed from the drone on his phone. CNN previously reported that the drone was found in his car following the shooting.
    

            In addition, Crooks had two explosives in his car at the time of the shooting and one in his home, but likely did not have the ability to detonate them from the roof where he was killed, Wray testified.
    

            “It looks like because of the on/off position on the receivers, that if he had tried to detonate those devices from the roof, it would not have worked,” Wray said.
    

            Wray said that investigators have been able to “reverse-engineer the flight path of the drone from the day of the rally,” and now think that the drone footage “would have shown [the shooter] what would have been behind him.”
    

            “It was almost like giving him a rear-view mirror of the scene behind him,” Wray said.
    

            The FBI is investigating the shooting as both an attempted assassination and as a potential act of domestic terrorism. FBI officials have repeatedly asserted that they believe Crooks acted alone, and Wray reiterated that there is no evidence of any co-conspirators.
    

            Investigators say that Crooks fired approximately eight times from an AR-style rifle at the former president before being killed by a US Secret Service counter sniper.
    

            The rifle Crooks used was purchased from his father, Wray testified.
    

            “The weapon that he used for the attempted assassination was an AR-style rifle that was purchased legally, that he – as my understanding – acquired, I think bought actually from his father, who was the one who originally bought it,” Wray said.
    

            Previously, officials said they believed the firearm belonged to Crooks’ father – not the shooter – and they didn’t know how Crooks accessed the weapon.
    

            “I have been saying some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment,” Wray said. “The shooter may be deceased but the FBI’s investigation is ongoing.”
    

            Investigators have gone through the shooter’s phone and computer, scoured his search history and bedroom and have interviewed his family and friends, but have struggled to identify what motivated the 20-year-old would be assassin to act.
    

            Crooks also had no prior contacts with the FBI, officials say, and had not been previously on their radar or databases.
    

            The FBI thinks Crooks used equipment and piping attached to the building to climb up onto the roof where he shot at Trump.
    

            “We now believe the subject climbed onto the roof using some mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping on the side of the AGR building,” Wray said. “In other words, we do not believe he used a ladder to get up there.”
    

            The FBI, according to Wray, confirmed that Crooks had previously purchased a roughly five-foot ladder.
    

            Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Christopher Paris testified Tuesday that Crooks was on the roof for roughly three minutes before he fired at Trump.
    

            As Wray testified, GOP members pushed the FBI director to discuss any meetings he has had with Harris during her tenure as vice president, a notable line of questioning now that she is the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.
    

            The questions ranged from whether Wray has regular briefings with Harris, what her behavior is like in those meetings and what sort of issues she has expressed concerns about.
    

            In one exchange, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz asked how frequently Harris attends briefings that Wray has with President Joe Biden. Wray declined to answer with any specificity.
    

            Wisconsin Rep. Tom Tiffany asked Wray whether Harris “has met with you in regard to the border, or whether she has “specifically asked you for a meeting” about the “threats that are at the border.”
    

            Wray said that he had “been in meetings that include the vice president” in which the border was discussed, but again declined to discuss specific meetings or conversations.
    

            Indiana Rep. Victoria Spartz also asked about Wray’s meetings about the border with Harris, asking whether the vice president has “actually initiated” meetings on a regular basis “as the leading border czar.” Wray did not answer.
    

            Wray pushed back against reports that Crooks searched for images of specific prominent public officials online, saying that it appears he was actually searching for news articles.
    

            “The shooter appears to have done a lot of searches of public figures in general, but so far we are seeing kind of news articles and things like that,” Wray said. He continued, “so the images that have been reported about, really what we are talking about there are when you do a news search of an article the image appears in a cache as opposed to like a search for that specific individual.”
    

            The FBI director cautioned that the effort to uncover Crooks’ motive is ongoing, but warned that “it is, quite frankly, a dangerous time to be a prominent public official.”
    

             Wray said Wednesday that an FBI employee is being internally investigated for posting something “totally inappropriate” about the Trump assassination attempt.
    

            Republican Rep. Chip Roy asked the director whether “any FBI agents texted, emailed or expressed disappointment that Trump survived the assassination attempt or otherwise editorialized about the assassination attempt?”
    

            Wray said he wasn’t aware of any agents acting inappropriately but that there had been one instance “of an individual who posted something that I consider outrageous, totally inappropriate, and unacceptable.”
    

            “That individual has been referred to our inspection division, which is our sort of internal affairs investigatory arm that does the disciplinary process,” Wray said.
    

            Wray did not say where the post was made.
    

            Wray said on Wednesday that the FBI informed the US Secret Service about an Iranian plot to assassinate former President Donald Trump, saying that it’s likely law enforcement agencies are going to see more such “brazenness” from Iran in the future.
    

            The director declined to provide details of “specific, classified information,” to the committee but stressed that his agency has been calling out “efforts by the Iranian government to attempt to retaliate for the killing of (Iranian General) Soleimani by going after current or former prominent US officials.”
    

            “I think we need to recognize the brazenness of the Iranian regime, including right here in the United States, and I expect that we’re going to see more of it and I expect there will be more coming on that,” Wray said.
    

            CNN has previously reported that US authorities obtained intelligence from a human source in recent weeks on a plot by Iran to try to assassinate Trump, a development that led to the Secret Service increasing security around the former president, multiple people briefed on the matter told CNN. There’s no indication that Thomas Matthew Crooks, the would-be assassin who attempted to kill the former president, was connected to the plot, the sources said.
    

 Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff pressed Wray on the agency’s hiring standards in an effort to criticize the Republican Party’s decision to make Trump, a convicted felon, its 2024 presidential nominee.
    

            “Do candidates for the FBI have to go through background checks?” Schiff asked, to which Wray said yes.
    

            “Would someone with dozens of felony convictions survive a background check for the bureau?” Schiff said.
    

            “No,” Wray replied.
    

            “So they would never be hired by the bureau?”
    

            “No,” Wray said again.
    

            “Clearly, the bureau has higher standards for their hiring than one of America’s great political parties,” Schiff said.
    

            Trump was convicted earlier this year on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records as part of a hush money scheme he orchestrated ahead of the 2016 election.
    

            Wray testified that he opposes the idea of having the head of the law enforcement agency report directly to the president, a proposal pushed by some Trump supporters.
    

            The restructuring proposal for the FBI is outlined in Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for the next Republican president that was created in part by more than 140 former Trump administration employees. Under the plan, the FBI director would no longer report directly to officials within the Justice Department and instead would answer to the president.
    

            “I don’t think that would be a wise approach,” Wray told Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson, when asked about the idea.
    

            “I was appointed by President Trump – I respect that. I think that’s part of our structure,” Wray said. “But independence in terms of how we do our work is what matters to me. And we need to be able to do our work in a way that is free from political interference.”
    

            Wray said he has not read or reviewed Project 2025 and did not comment specifically on it.

100,WaPo_71,"Trump rally shooter searched for info on JFK assassin, FBI chief says",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/24/wray-fbi-trump-shooting-testimony-capitol-hill/,"The gunman who tried to assassinate former president Donald Trump had searched online days earlier for information about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and used a rifle with a collapsible stock that may have made it easier for him to disguise the weapon before climbing onto a roof, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray said Wednesday.Wray’s testimony before the House Judiciary Committee offered the most detailed account to date of the actions of Thomas Matthew Crooks, the 20-year-old gunman who was fatally shot by a Secret Service sniper after opening fire during the July 13 campaign rally in Butler, Pa. One rallygoer was killed, two others were critically injured, and Trump suffered a graze wound to his ear.The rally shooting, two days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, rattled elected officials across the country and raised new fears about political violence in a tumultuous presidential election year. Wray sought to reassure lawmakers that his agency was doing everything possible to understand the gunman’s actions, while also cautioning that other federal investigators would be responsible for assessing the security failure that made the attack possible.A week before the rally, Crooks searched for answers to “how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,” Wray said — a reference to the assassin who used a rifle to kill President John F. Kennedy in Dallas in 1963.“That’s a search that’s obviously significant in terms of his state of mind,” the FBI director said during the hours-long hearing, which was dominated by questions about the attack on Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. “He was interested in public figures and — I think this is important — starting around July 6 or so, he became very focused on former president Trump and this rally.”That same day, Wray said, the gunman also registered to attend the outdoor rally.Crooks, who lived about an hour away in Bethel Park, Pa., fired at Trump from a rooftop just outside the rally security perimeter, using an AR-style rifle. FBI investigators have said so far that the gunman did not appear to have any discernible ideology, suggesting he was not motivated primarily by political animosity.Wray said the exact nature of Trump’s injury remains uncertain: “There’s some question about whether or not it’s a bullet or shrapnel that hit his ear.”“There’s a whole lot of work underway and still a lot of work to do,” Wray said. “The shooter may be deceased, but the FBI’s investigation is very much ongoing.”“We’d love to have a road map that tells us exactly what he’s thinking,” the director continued. “We haven’t found that yet.”Wray, who was nominated to lead the FBI in 2017 by then-President Trump, avoided discussing the security shortcomings that preceded the attack, saying those issues are under review by an inspector general and an outside group of experts. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned Tuesday under pressure from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers over the lapses.Somewhat unusually for the House Judiciary Committee, Wednesday’s hearing included hours focused mostly on the facts and substance of the Trump assassination attempt, rather than the partisan finger-pointing that typically dominates such sessions.Still, there was some partisanship.Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who chairs the committee, is a longtime Trump ally and critic of Wray, the FBI and the Justice Department. He began the hearing by criticizing what he called “the Biden-Harris Justice Department” — an acknowledgment that Vice President Harris is now running for the Democratic nomination after President Biden announced he would not seek a second term.Before Wray finished testifying, Trump attacked him on social media, saying he should resign not because of anything to do with the shooting, but because the FBI director answered questions about his interactions with Biden by saying he observed nothing awry in the president’s cognitive abilities.“If that is the case, Director Wray should resign immediately from the FBI, and stop ‘sweet talking’ Congress every time he goes up, which he loves to do,” Trump posted.Wray told lawmakers that the rifle used in the rally shooting was bought legally in 2013 by the gunman’s father, who sold it to his son in October 2023. The FBI determined that the family had 14 guns, the director said.The weapon had a collapsible stock, meaning the gunman might have been able to hide it from view while carrying it before the attack. Wray noted that witnesses at the rally reported seeing a man with a gun on the rooftop, but not earlier, which might be explained by the collapsible stock.The FBI director also confirmed a number of details from the investigation that have been publicly reported, including that there were eight spent bullet casings found near the gunman’s body — indicating that he fired at least that many times.Before Crooks opened fire, a local police peered over the roof and saw the man in a prone position with a gun, Wray said. Crooks turned to look at the officer, who then ducked down.“That’s seconds before the event,” Wray said.The director also described how Crooks apparently used a drone hours before the shooting to examine the area near the rally, but not directly overhead.“The drone was recovered in his vehicle,” Wray testified. “The shooter was flying the drone around the area, not over the stage. … We think that he was live-streaming, viewing the footage for about 11 minutes, about 200 yards away.”Two explosive devices were found in the shooter’s car, items that Wray called “relatively crude devices themselves, but they did have the ability to be detonated remotely.”However, because the remotely controlled devices attached to the homemade bombs were left in the “off” position, Wray said, it appears “that if he had tried to detonate those devices from the roof, it would not have worked.”Technical experts at the FBI lab in Quantico, Va., were able to crack open the gunman’s phone within two days of the attack. While they found some evidence of interest, the device did not provide an explanation for his motive, people familiar with the investigation have said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe the ongoing case.The gunman used some encrypted messaging applications, which Wray said have “unfortunately now become very commonplace” in FBI investigations, as popular messaging software often includes encryption.Asked whether the FBI believed there were any accomplices or co-conspirators in the shooting, Wray answered, “Not at this time, but again the investigation is ongoing.”"
104,CNN_67,What to know about the 25th Amendment as Trump makes wild claim about Biden,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/joe-biden-25th-amendment-what-matters/index.html,"
            President Joe Biden’s planned address to the nation on Wednesday night will be an opportunity to explain his decision not to run for reelection and show he is still up to the task of serving as president – a job he has for nearly six more months, until January 20, 2025.
    

            No matter what Biden says or how much his fellow Democrats try to build up his accomplishments as president, multiple Republicans have argued that the 25th Amendment to the Constitution should be used to remove Biden from office ASAP – something that’s not going to happen since no Democrat supports it.
    

            Former President Donald Trump, appearing at a rally in North Carolina Wednesday evening, made the unfounded claim that Biden was told by Democratic leaders that if he did not step aside in the election, he would be removed with the 25th Amendment.
    

            “The bosses, they said, ‘Either you get out, or we’re going to throw you out using the 25th Amendment,’” Trump said in prepared remarks opening his rally. While there’s no evidence to back up Trump’s wild claim about Biden, it is a verifiable fact that Trump’s own Cabinet considered the idea of using the 25th Amendment against him in 2021.
    

            Trump’s current running mate, Sen. JD Vance, said on Monday Democrats should use the 25th Amendment to remove Biden from office.
    

            “You don’t get to do this in the most politically beneficial way for Democrats,” he said on Fox News of Biden’s decision to end his presidential campaign. “If it’s an actual problem, they should take care of it the appropriate way.”
    

            Talk about the 25th Amendment with regard to Biden has been percolating among Republicans, but it is a nonstarter among Democrats who have universally praised Biden for making the decision to step aside in the presidential election.
    

            Even before Biden dropped out of the race, Rep. Chip Roy, the Texas Republican, filed a resolution in June after the president’s disastrous debate performance, calling on the 25th Amendment to be used against Biden.

            “They – the Democrats have been involved in a big cover-up here,” Johnson said.
    

            After Biden withdrew from the race, Missouri Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Republican, wrote letters to Harris and the Cabinet officials in the Biden administration, asking them to remove Biden from office.
    

            “If President Biden is unwilling to resign, for the sake of our great nation, you must do your duty to relieve him of his constitutional powers and duties,” Schmitt wrote in a letter sent to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and posted on Schmitt’s website.
    

            The idea that Biden is unfit to serve is also in contrast to the Trump campaign’s argument that Biden should continue as the Democratic nominee; it filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission arguing Biden should not be able to transfer his campaign war chest to Vice President Kamala Harris.
    

            It’s hard to believe now that Republicans have reunified around Trump as their presidential candidate – and now that many of them doubt the severity of the January 6, 2021, insurrection – but use of the 25th Amendment was most recently seriously discussed with regard to Trump by his fellow Republicans that year.
    

Betsy DeVos, who was Trump’s secretary of education, confirmed to USA Today that she and other Trump Cabinet officials considered using the method to remove Trump from office. When it became clear to her that then-Vice President Mike Pence would not support the idea, she resigned from the Trump administration on January 7, 2021.
    

            “There were more than a few people who had those conversations internally,” she said.
    

Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who has since recommitted himself to Trump and developed some amnesia about the severity of the January 6 attack, can be heard on a January 8, 2021, recording obtained by New York Times reporters in which he says the 25th Amendment can’t be used against Trump because it “takes too long.”
    

            It is, indeed, a complicated process, as we first investigated back in January 2021.
    

            To forcibly wrest power from a sitting president, the vice president would have to be on board, according to the text of the amendment. Read the full language here.
    

            Harris, who has consistently praised Biden and has shown absolutely no indication she thinks Biden is unfit for office, would also need a majority of Biden’s Cabinet officials to agree the president is unfit for office and temporarily seize power from him. Like Harris, they have also expressed complete support for him finishing his term.
    

            In the extremely unlikely event Biden’s allies were to turn on him, Biden could dispute their move with a letter to Congress. Harris and the Cabinet would then have four days to dispute him, after which Congress would be called on to vote – it requires a two-thirds supermajority, usually 67 senators and 290 House members, to permanently remove the president.
    

            Congress could also appoint its own body to review the president’s fitness instead of the Cabinet. In 2020, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced a bill to create a congressional body for this purpose with regard to Trump, but it was not signed into law.
    

            No president has ever been removed from office in this way. The amendment was ratified in 1965, in the wake of the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy, whose predecessor Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered major heart attacks. It was meant to create a clear line of succession and prepare for urgent contingencies.
    

            Eisenhower suffered a debilitating heart attack while in office in the 1950s. That was before the 25th Amendment, so there was no constitutional rule. Instead, he came to an agreement with then-Vice President Richard Nixon about handing over power.
    

            The portion of the 25th Amendment that allows the vice president and Cabinet to remove the president had in mind a leader who was in a coma or suffered a stroke.
    

            The Reagan administration drafted, but did not sign or transmit, letters to the Senate that would have taken power from Reagan after he was shot in 1981. You can see them at the Reagan Library’s website.

127,CNN_38,US reality show contestant kills and eats protected bird in New Zealand,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/asia/reality-show-protected-bird-new-zealand-intl-hnk/index.html,"
            A reality show contestant who killed and ate a protected bird has been let off with a warning after New Zealand wildlife officials said cast members were tired, hungry and placed in a “unique” situation.
    

            Spencer “Corry” Jones, an American white water river guide, killed and ate the large, flightless weka during filming of “Race to Survive: New Zealand” last fall, CNN affiliate RNZ reported Tuesday.
    

            The weka, named on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s red list of threatened species, is protected in mainland New Zealand, where the penalty for killing one is a prison sentence of up to two years or a fine of nearly $60,000.
    

            “Race to Survive” pits nine teams of two contestants in a 150-mile race across New Zealand’s harsh terrain, in which they must find their own food and water to compete for a $500,000 prize, according to USA Network, which airs the show.

            In a clip from the show, Jones apologizes and says he knew eating the weka was against the law, but he was desperate and hungry, RNZ reported.
    

            Jones and his teammate Oliver Dev were disqualified after the incident.
    

            CNN has reached out to Jones for comment.
    

            New Zealand’s Department of Conservation said following an investigation it had issued written warnings to Jones and the show’s producers – but stopped short of tougher action.
    

            “The unique set of circumstances – cast members were fatigued and suffering from significant hunger, in an unusual group dynamic situation – meant we felt a warning letter was prudent,” said Dylan Swain, the department’s team lead for investigations.
    

            “Nonetheless, killing and eating a native protected species in this matter is unacceptable and the company is ‘on notice’ about the need for its program participants to adhere to conservation legislation.”
    

            The weka has a “famously feisty and curious” personality, according to the department, and is known for its loud “coo-et” call, which is presented as a duet, with the male taking on the lower, slower part.
    

            “Weka are usually heard, not seen,” the department says on its website.
    

            Once widespread, its populations now fluctuate depending on food conditions, which had led to the bird’s legal protection in mainland New Zealand. The harvest of weka is legal on some of the country’s surrounding islands.
    

            Swain said the producers of “Race to Survive” had a permit to film on public conservation land and were aware that protected species and plants could not be harvested or eaten.
    

            In a statement, “Race to Survive” production said it alerted authorities as soon as they became aware of the weka incident.

            “Contestants were all thoroughly briefed ahead of time, and reminded throughout the competition, of all of New Zealand’s wildlife rules and guidelines,” its statement said.
    

            “It was determined that a contestant did in fact violate a rule, so appropriate action was taken, and the team was disqualified from the competition.”
    

            Jones and Dev were favored to win before they were pulled off the course, according to USA Network.
    

            New Zealand has a plethora of unique flora and fauna due to its long geological isolation from the supercontinent Gondwana, according to independent conservation organization Forest and Bird.
    

            This long isolation and the absence of mammalian predators means many native species are defenseless against attack – including flightless birds like the weka.

127,WaPo_45,"American reality show contestant kills, eats protected bird in New Zealand",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/24/race-to-survive-contestant-new-zealand-bird-weka/,"An American contestant on a reality TV show is under fire for killing — and eating — a large flightless bird that is protected in mainland New Zealand, an offense that can lead to up to two years in prison or a significant fine.Spencer “Corry” Jones, who lives in Wyoming, was taking part on “Race to Survive: New Zealand” in October last year when he killed and ate the weka, a bird that has become extinct over large tracts of the mainland. Killing a weka can led to a penalty of up to 100,000 New Zealand dollars, or $59,000.Following an investigation, the country’s Department of Conservation issued Jones and the production team with a written warning instead, noting the “unique set of circumstances” of the show.In the show, which runs on USA Network, nine pairs of contestants navigate 150 miles of harsh terrain in a bid to win $500,000. Competitors must find their own food and water while also racing to the finish line.“The unique set of circumstances — cast members were fatigued and suffering from significant hunger, in an unusual group dynamic situation — meant we felt a warning letter was prudent,” Dylan Swain from the New Zealand Department of Conservation’s investigations team said in an emailed statement Wednesday.“Nonetheless, killing and eating a native protected species in this matter is unacceptable and the company is ‘on notice’ about the need for its program participants to adhere to conservation legislation.”“I made a mistake,” Jones said in a clip shared by USA Network after he and his teammate were disqualified from the show. “It was shortsighted. ... It was foolish. But the competition is very real. The difficulty of this is real, and survival in the bush in New Zealand is not easy.”“I knew it was breaking a rule, but that’s not important when you’re hungry,” he continued, noting that it was “difficult to be in a place where you’re so desperate and hungry .... and there’s creatures running around camp that we’re not allowed to eat.”The weka is native to New Zealand and has “a famously feisty and curious personality,” according to the country’s Department of Conservation, which says the bird’s “populations are subject to large fluctuations.”They are “charismatic birds that are often attracted to human activity,” according to New Zealand Birds Online, a digital encyclopedia of the nation’s birds. But those who live near them “often have a less charitable opinion, as they have to live with ever-watchful weka snatching opportunities to raid vegetable gardens, pilfer poultry food and eggs, and even steal dog food from the bowl,” it said.Most native species are protected by law in New Zealand and it is illegal to hunt them. There are four subspecies of weka, only one of which is considered to not be threatened, according to the Department of Conservation.Jones apologized for his actions on the show, adding that “it doesn’t sit lightly with me.”“What I did disrespected New Zealand and I’m sorry.”"
175,WaPo_70,The NBA and WNBA have a massive new TV and streaming deal,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/24/nba-wnba-nbc-amazon-espn-rights/,"The NBA and WNBA on Wednesday announced a slew of media rights deals worth around $76 billion over 11 years that will keep the NBA Finals on ESPN and ABC, while adding new partners in Amazon and NBC.But there could be complications. Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns longtime NBA partner TNT Sports, informed the league this week that it has exercised what it believes to be matching rights for the Amazon deal. The league rejected that match and a legal fight could be ahead. Still, the league is pushing ahead full-steam.The agreements, which are set to begin after next season, amount to an incredible windfall for the leagues and are expected to lead to the first $100-million players in American sports. Here’s everything you need to know.Disney-owned ESPN and ABC will continue to broadcast the largest NBA package of games, including the NBA Finals and one conference finals most years. More than 20 regular season games will appear on ABC — usually on Saturday nights and Sunday afternoons — and ESPN and ABC will broadcast all five Christmas Day games.But the league will have two new partners: Amazon and NBC, which will alternate broadcasting the other conference finals each year. During the regular season, NBC’s Peacock platform will exclusively broadcast games on Monday night, while NBC will air the All-Star Game and dozens more games on Sunday and Tuesday nights. Amazon will broadcast games on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, and will also air at least one game on Black Friday and the NBA’s in-season tournament. Amazon will also distribute the play-in tournament games in the postseason.NBC will be an NBA partner for the first time since it aired games throughout the 1990s, when its theme song, “Round Ball Rock,” and Michael Jordan’s heyday were part of a golden age for the league. Amazon continues its push into live sports to help its burgeoning ads business after inking Thursday Night Football two years ago.As for fans, they will now need a cable package and subscriptions to ESPN Plus, Peacock and Amazon Prime to watch NBA games.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.The WNBA, on the heels of the league’s exploding popularity and TV ratings, is set to receive $2.2 billion over 11 years, according to a person familiar with the figures. The NBA negotiated this deal on behalf of both the WNBA and NBA. The amount represents a substantial increase from the current media deals for the league, which are valued at around $60 million, and will help the league increase player salaries and put the league and its teams on better financial footing.There are two additional WNBA packages, currently on ION and CBS, that will be negotiated later this year and are expected to raise the total value of the WNBA’s broadcast rights.The WNBA Finals will rotate between NBC networks, ESPN/ABC and Amazon. The deal calls for at least 25 regular season games on Disney platforms each season, at least 50 on NBC platforms and at least 30 on Prime Video.Big bucks. Disney is paying nearly double the amount of its previous deal, up to $2.6 billion per year from $1.4 billion in its current deal. NBC will pay $2.5 billion and Amazon around $1.8 billion each year. The staggering amounts are far above the national TV deals for Major League Baseball ($1.9 billion per year) and the NHL ($625 million), though still behind the NFL., which nets over $10 billion per year.The NBA’s regular season TV ratings have declined by some 30 percent over the last 10 years, which caused some media prognosticators to question how much the NBA would be able to collect in its new deals. But those dips don’t look so bad compared to entertainment television. According to Sportico, the four broadcast networks lost 80 percent of their prime-time viewers in the 18-49 age demographic over the same time period.In a continually fragmenting media landscape, the NBA is leaning heavily on broadcast TV, with NBC and ABC, and streaming, while moving away from cable. The league took advantage of traditional media companies that are squeezing what they can out of the old models of distribution, and streaming platforms that want to use live sports to draw new subscribers.The Amazon piece of the deal isn’t buttoned up because TNT remains a wild card. TNT Sports believes it has the right to match Amazon’s portion of the deal and informed the NBA it was doing so this week. The NBA rejected TNT’s matching attempt, saying that TNT failed to explicitly match the terms of the deal.Warner can now mull its options, including suing the league. One thing is certain: There will be lawyers, and likely a lot of billable hours. “We have matched the Amazon offer, as we have a contractual right to do, and do not believe the NBA can reject it,” TNT Sports wrote in a statement Wednesday, adding, “We think they have grossly misinterpreted our contractual rights with respect to the 2025-26 season and beyond, and we will take appropriate action.”If Warner’s quest to hang on to the NBA is unsuccessful, it will save billions of dollars but will still need to find programming that ensures that cable providers still pay a premium price to carry TNT. The network has inked a number of smaller deals to broadcast the French Open and Big East basketball in coming years and has sub-licensed multiple College Football Playoff games from ESPN.Sir Charles is arguably the best known sports broadcaster in the country. He joined TNT after he retired and has been with the network for more than 20 years. If TNT’s legal challenges don’t net the network any NBA games, he will have one more season left on TNT’s pre- and postgame show, “Inside the NBA.” He has suggested he may retire after that, but he has threatened retirement before and will almost certainly get a few offers from the NBA’s remaining media partners."

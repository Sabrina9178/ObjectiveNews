Kevin Durant led the way for USA, scoring 23 points on 8-of-9 shooting. Durant, who missed all of exhibition play leading up to Paris, looked dominant coming off the bench. LeBron James, playing in the Olympics for the first time since 2012, recorded 21 points, 8 rebounds and 9 assists, picking up where he left off in London 12 years ago.

Nikola Jokić, a three-time NBA MVP, led Serbia with 20 points and 8 assists, adding 5 rebounds for good measure. But the Serbians were overwhelmed by the talent on the USA side. After a back-and-forth first quarter, the United States took the lead late in the opening 10 minutes and never gave it up the rest of the way.
USA’s shooting was off the charts in its opener. The U.S. shot 62.3% from the field, including 56.3% from three. Moving players like Devin Booker and Stephen Curry around off the ball proved problematic for the Serbian defense, and the States’ other perimeter stars were able to take advantage of their screens and movement. Meanwhile, the front-court rotation of Joel Embiid, Bam Adebayo and Anthony Davis was stout defensively, walling off the paint for practically every Serbian player outside of Jokić.
Contributions came from all over the U.S. roster. Jrue Holiday scored 15 points in addition to his on-ball defensive prowess. Booker had 12, while Curry and Anthony Edwards each added 11. Edwards brought his trademark attitude as well, inviting some Serbian defenders to dance on a couple of his buckets.
While Durant’s return beefed up the USA attack, it also tightened the rotation. Durant came off the bench and seemingly put Jayson Tatum on ice — for now. Tatum, a reigning NBA champ, didn’t see any action in the opening game. With plenty of firepower on the wing between James, Durant, Booker and Davis, coach Steve Kerr opted for more defensive-minded players next to them, ironically in Tatum’s Celtics teammates Holiday and Derrick White.
Though the U.S. is a heavy favorite to win its fourth-straight gold medal, Sunday’s win was impressive. What Serbia lacks in NBA depth it makes up for in cohesion. Serbia won silver during last year’s FIBA World Cup, and also features current NBA stars Nikola Jović and Bogdan Bogdanović.
USA’s next group game is against South Sudan on Wednesday. The two teams played recently, with the U.S. eking out a 101-100 win on July 20.Rohan Nadkarni is a sports reporter for NBC News. "
5,CNN_35,"LeBron James and Kevin Durant power Team USA past Serbia, 110-84, in opening Olympic contest",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/sport/usa-defeats-serbia-2024-olympics/index.html,"
            LeBron James made his emphatic return to Olympic basketball on Sunday, turning in a dominant performance in a 110-84 win against Serbia, his first contest at the Games since 2012.
    

            It was the first time James had played in the quadrennial tournament since winning his second consecutive gold medal at the London Games and it was clear the 39-year-old all-time leading NBA scorer was bringing as much energy as he can to Paris. The US next plays South Sudan on Wednesday, who ran the Americans close in an exhibition game in London before the Games that was decided by just a point.
    

            James’ 21 points, eight rebounds and nine assists helped provide the spark for Team USA throughout the contest. The ever-present four-time NBA champion seemed to always be on the verge of breaking out of the US backcourt on the fast break, exemplified by a tough, contested layup in the third quarter, in which the Los Angeles Lakers star powered through a Serb defender for a bucket.
    

            The first half though was all about Kevin Durant, who scored 21 points on 8-for-8 shooting. It’s the Phoenix Suns forward’s fourth time at the Olympics and his performance proved just how much the two-time NBA champion loves this particular competition.
    

            Durant is recovering from a calf injury and his playing time was limited during the game, otherwise he might have ended the contest with an even more ridiculous stat line. He finished with 23 points.
    

            On a team laden with stars, two first-time Olympians also stood out against Serbia.
    

            Anthony Edwards made his Olympics debut and already has his first highlight reel play. With a deft spin-and-pump-fake move along the baseline on Team USA’s final possession of the third quarter, the Minnesota Timberwolves guard sent a Serb defender flying past him toward the sideline as he went to the basket. Edwards was left with an uncontested shot that he easily floated in for a bucket, putting the US up by 19 heading into the final frame.

            The move and bucket from Edwards set off celebrations among his teammates, including Steph Curry breaking into dance. Edwards finished with 11 points and five rebounds.
    

            It appeared to be the turning point that put Team USA on its way to a blowout win after Serbia hung around for much of the first three quarters of the game.
    

            Curry’s three-point shooting proved to be a major asset in the early going as Serbia jumped out to a hot start. A couple of key buckets in the early part of the first quarter helped stymie the Europeans’ run and kept the US from having too big of a hole to dig itself out of.
    

            The Golden State Warriors star was largely quiet for the rest of the game, missing a couple of shots that he might like to have back as he gets used to the shorter international three-point line. He finished the game with an exclamation point three-pointer for 11 points.
    

            Jrue Holiday and Devin Booker also turned in solid performances with 15 and 12 points respectively.
    

            Serbia figures to be a force in this tournament though thanks to its talismanic forward Nikola Jokić. The Serbians refused to go away in the game, even as Team USA picked up steam in the second half with the three-time NBA MVP Jokić finished with 20 points, eight assists and five rebounds.
    

            Serbia’s next game is on Wednesday against Puerto Rico.

5,WaPo_58,Kevin Durant’s return powers U.S. men to opening win over Serbia,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/28/usa-basketball-serbia-paris-olympics/,"VILLENEUVE-D’ASCQ, France – Three weeks ago, Kevin Durant slumped by himself in the corner of UNLV’s gym with his hooded sweatshirt pulled tight over his head. The 35-year-old star had missed USA Basketball’s first training camp that day with a calf injury that hadn’t yet been disclosed to the media, and he looked frustrated in his self-imposed detention.As LeBron James and Stephen Curry stole the headlines throughout the U.S. team’s run up to the Paris Olympics, Durant was listed as day-to-day but kept missing games. The three-time gold medalist never appeared in any of the Americans’ five exhibition games, not even when they endured close calls with Australia, South Sudan and Germany.But Durant’s long-awaited return to the court came in triumphant fashion Sunday, when he scored 23 points and made his first eight shots in the Americans’ 110-84 victory over Serbia in its Olympics opener. The victory over Nikola Jokić and the Serbians, who are among the medal favorites, puts the United States on the fast track to the quarterfinals, as their remaining Group C games will be against South Sudan and Puerto Rico, who both rank outside the top 15 in the FIBA World Rankings.U.S. Coach Steve Kerr elected to bring Durant off the bench rather than use him in the starting lineup during his first game action since his Phoenix Suns were swept out of the first round of the playoffs in April. Durant promptly sank his first shot attempt — a three-pointer from the right angle — and proceeded to go 8-8 from the field, including 5-5 from beyond the arc, in the first half. He led all scorers at the break with 21 points, and he helped the Americans erase an early 10-2 deficit to take a 58-49 halftime lead.Durant’s return brought better flow and spacing to a U.S. offense that struggled with turnovers and stilted play throughout its exhibition slate. James added 21 points, 7 rebounds and 9 assists in the victory, receiving loud ovations from the international crowd with each successive dunk and driving finish. To accommodate Durant, Kerr removed Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum from his rotation for the first time this summer.After the Americans dismantled the Serbians 105-79 in a July 17 exhibition, Sunday’s contest was a much more intense affair. The Serbian fans left a big imprint on their highly-anticipated opener against the United States, shooting off air horns during live action and loudly chanting “MVP” for Jokić, who finished with a team-high 20 points to go with four rebounds and seven assists.Meanwhile, U.S. center Joel Embiid heard loud boos throughout the night, presumably from French fans disappointed he decided to play for the U.S. instead of France, where he also holds citizenship. Embiid struggled in his Olympic debut, tallying four points and two rebounds in 11 minutes while getting pulled from the court during his first rotation less than three minutes into the game. The 2023 NBA MVP also committed an unsportsmanlike foul in the third quarter, and the Americans were minus-eight with him on the court and plus-18 when he was on the bench.For the United States, which knew its biggest test of the opening round would come in its first game, the blowout victory should provide the chance to breathe a sigh of relief. Through its first two days, the men’s basketball tournament has been dominated by favored teams and has featured relatively few surprises. That’s good news for James, Curry, Durant and company, who are hoping to capture the United States’ fifth consecutive gold medal in Paris on Aug. 10."
6,NBC_7,Léon Marchand wins Olympic gold in 400 IM and the admiration of France,https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/olympics/le-marchand-wins-olympic-gold-400-im-admiration-france-rcna163996,"NANTERRE, France — Frenchman Léon Marchand electrified a partisan crowd Sunday with an Olympic record time in the swimming 400-meter individual medley before American Torri Huske and Italian Nicolo Martinenghi also won their first gold medals.
A capacity crowd filled Paris La Défense Arena, with thousands of fans decked out in bleu, blanc et rouge in hope of crowning a new national hero. Marchand did not disappoint.
His time of 4:02.95 broke the Olympic record of all-time great Michael Phelps and fell just short of the world record held by Marchand himself.
“I think it’s a dream for every one of us,” he told NBC, wearing the gold around his neck. “I got the chance to do it today. That was amazing. I don’t know how to describe it.”
About 13 minutes before the race started, fans spontaneously broke out in song with “La Marseillaise” and chanted “Léon, Léon, Léon!”
And once the race started, the deafening cheers got through to Marchand. As he pulled away from the field in the breaststroke, fans rhythmically cheered each time his head popped out of the water.
“The breaststroke was insane, because I could hear whole stadium, so that was amazing to do,” said Marchand, who won France's first swimming gold since 2012.
Japan’s Tomoyuki Matsushita, who stayed close to Marchand during the butterfly, took silver, and Cincinnati native Carson Foster secured bronze.
Marchand, 22, who swam at Arizona State under the guidance of Phelps’ coach, Bob Bowman, isn’t done yet. He’s expected to compete in the 200 IM, the 200 butterfly and the 200 breaststroke later in these Games.
Later in the evening, Huske, of Arlington, Virginia, won the women’s 100-meter butterfly, erasing heartbreak from three years ago when she finished in fourth place by a hundredth of a second.
“Like you said, I just missed the podium last time by a hundredth, so I’m so thankful to be here, and to do it with Gretchen is just amazing,” Huske said. “I’ve had a long road, but I have a lot of support, and I’m so thankful for all of it.”
She went 1-2 with fellow American Gretchen Walsh as China’s Zhang Yufei won bronze.
“I feel like I’m in shock right now,” Huske said. “Like I don’t even know how to process it, like I feel like I’m going to cry but, like, I’m also smiling. It’s really surreal.”
Before “The Star-Spangled Banner” played and the American flag was raised, Huske made sure Walsh joined her on the podium’s top step. They joyously clasped and raised hands moments after “home of the brave.”
Walsh said there was pressure on her as both the world and Olympic record holder in the event.
“Seeing the one-two up there, though, was amazing. I’m so proud of Torri, and I’m proud of myself,” she said. “I think that was what America needed and wanted, and it was a really special moment that we shared out there on the podium.”
In the men’s 100 breaststroke, American Nic Fink and Great Britain’s Adam Peaty tied for silver as Martinenghi took gold.
Fink finished fifth in the 200 breaststroke in Tokyo and still has the sweatsuit he was hoping to wear to the podium.
""One of my least favorite feelings was bringing podium sweats and never getting a chance to wear them, so that was definitely a bummer in Tokyo,"" he said after he won silver Sunday. ""The fact that I was able to make that next step here is a lot more fun."" 
Fink, who has a master’s degree in electrical and computer engineering from Georgia Tech, works a full-time job while training for the Olympics. He said the 9-to-5 routine helps him be ""well rounded"" and ""balanced."" 
At the advanced swimming age of 31, Fink wouldn't rule out another attempt at glory in Los Angeles in 2028.
""As for my future, you know, I could've probably closed the door a couple of times on my career, and it's only gotten better and better,"" Fink said. ""So I don't want to say anything definitive. And you know, L.A. is four years away, but a home Olympics would be pretty cool. So we'll see.""David K. Li is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital."

25,CNN_10,"US Defense Secretary Austin holds trilateral meeting with Japanese, South Korean counterparts, first in 15 years",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/asia/us-austin-trilateral-japan-south-korea-intl-hnk/index.html,"
            Defense chiefs from the United States, South Korea and Japan vowed to strengthen cooperation to deter “nuclear and missile threats” from North Korea during a meeting in Tokyo Sunday, the first of its kind in 15 years as the countries move to tighten coordination in an increasingly tense region.
    

            The trilateral meeting comes nearly one year after a landmark summit between the three countries held by US President Joe Biden at Camp David – part of a bid by Washington to strengthen ties with two of its key allies in Asia as it eyes North Korean provocations and Chinese aggression in the region.
    

            In a joint statement Sunday, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Japan’s Minister of Defense Minoru Kihara and South Korea’s Shin Won-sik “recalled their enduring commitment to strengthen trilateral security cooperation to deter nuclear and missile threats” from North Korea.
    

            They also expressed “grave concern” over the “increasing military and economic cooperation commitment” between Moscow and Pyongyang, according to the statement. Numerous governments have accused North Korea of supplying Russia with weaponry for its war in Ukraine and the two neighbors last month signed a new defense pact.
    

            The burgeoning trilateral coordination between the US, Japan and South Korea marks a shift in regional relations, with Seoul and Tokyo – both long-standing US allies – widely seen as working to put aside historic animosity and mistrust to better address shared security threats.
    

            Following last year’s summit, Kishida announced that annual recurring summits will be held among several of the nations’ highest officials, including the ministers of foreign affairs and defense, and national security advisers, along with the financial, industry, and commerce ministers. The leaders also announced new military exercises and a hotline for crisis communications.
    

            The increasing coordination has sparked pushback from Beijing, which when asked about the leaders’ trilateral summit at Camp David last year said the Asia-Pacific region shouldn’t be “turned into a wrestling ground for geopolitical competition.”
    

            Sunday’s joint statement didn’t explicitly refer to China, but the defense chiefs reiterated their opposition to “any unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the waters of the Indo-Pacific” and noted that they shared assessments of “recent maritime and air military activities in the Indo-Pacific region, including the South China Sea.”
    

            China has been aggressively asserting its claims in the contested waters of the South China Sea, maintaining an extended presence near Japanese-controlled islands Beijing claims in the East China Sea, as well as ramping up its military intimidation of the self-ruling island of Taiwan.
    

            The defense chiefs also formalized a trilateral agreement that reaffirms the “unwavering nature of the new era of trilateral cooperation,” according to a joint statement.
    

            This would “institutionalize” trilateral security cooperation among their countries’ defense authorities, including senior-level policy consultations, information sharing, trilateral exercises, and defense exchange cooperation.
    

            According to a defense official, Secretary Austin is also expected to announce that the US intends to reconstitute US Forces Japan (USF-J) as a joint force headquarters to serve as a counterpart to Japan’s Joint Operations Command (J-JOC).
    

            Details of this implementation, which would give the reconstituted USF-J a direct leadership role “in both peace time and potential crises,” will be figured out in working groups led by US Indo-Pacific Command, according to the official.
    

            “The intent here is for USF-J to become a standalone three-star joint force headquarters. Eventually separate and apart from 5th Air Force,” said the official, who added that there is no intention to integrate Japanese forces into the US commands.
    

            “We view this as a historic announcement among the strongest improvements to our military ties in 70 years. Bottom line is that this is a transformative change,” the official said.
    

             “When this transition is complete, USF-J will have a direct leadership role in planning and leading US forces in both peace time and potential crises, and they’ll be doing that side by side with Japanese forces like never before.”

            A stretch of the major highway between California and Las Vegas was closed for 48 hours after a tractor trailer carrying hazardous materials overturned and caught on fire.
    

            The California Highway Patrol announced Sunday morning that all lanes of Interstate 15 were open after crews worked overnight to “carefully move the hazardous materials container a safe distance away from the roadway.”
    

            The truck lost control and overturned onto Interstate 15 near Barstow, California, around 6 a.m. Friday, according to the California Highway Patrol. The truck was pulling a flatbed trailer containing lithium-ion batteries that detached from the truck and eventually caught on fire.
    

            “Due to the lithium-ion, water cannot be added to the fire, the batteries must burn out on their own,” the patrol said.
    

            Both northbound and southbound lanes were initially closed due to the potential hazardous situation, but southbound lanes later reopened and northbound lanes remained closed until Sunday morning.
    

            “The primary concern is the air quality due to the hazardous materials and chemicals involved,” San Bernardino County Fire said. “Air monitoring is assessing for hydrogen cyanide, chlorine, and sulfur dioxide. These chemicals pose significant health risks at elevated levels, with hydrogen cyanide and chlorine being particularly dangerous even at low concentrations.”
    

            Efforts to remove the 75,000-pound container carrying the hazardous material from the highway were made more difficult by the vehicle’s weight, according to San Bernardino County Fire.
    

            It typically takes around four hours to drive from Las Angeles to Las Vegas, but on Saturday, Barbara Gray said it took her and her friends 12 hours to get to Sin City due to the crash.
    

            She told CNN that she and her friends initially thought the impact of the crash was “not that bad.”
    

            “There was no indication of how insane it actually was,” Gray said. “Pretty much after Barstow, it was completely gridlocked. There would be 30 to 45 minutes at a time where we simply did not move.”
    

            Gray said people had to use the bathroom on the side of the road amid over 115-degree heat.
    

            “We luckily did not run out of gas. Thank God. I don’t even know what we would have done because there was no assistance,” Gray said. “There was nowhere to call anybody. There was no service on our phones.”
    

            “People were really in a bad spot, and it was an emergency,” Gray said.
    

            “People gave me some snacks, and then a guy asked me for water because he didn’t have any, so I had to give him water,” Gray said.
    

            The gridlock finally broke open after getting past a stretch of construction that was not connected to the truck fire.
    

            “It was extremely frustrating,” Gray said. “And it was scary. Honestly, it was very scary.”
    

            Charles Gallagher, another driver who was caught in traffic on the highway, called the situation a “complete mess.” Gallagher, who was headed home to Las Vegas, told CNN that what should have been a four-hour-drive home instead took 11 hours.
    

            Gallagher and his family left Los Angeles at 3:30 p.m. Friday and ran into traffic in Barstow around 6 p.m., when they were rerouted to Interstate 40.
    

            Eventually, after realizing traffic wasn’t going to move any time soon, the family turned around and stayed the night in Barstow. When they left early Saturday morning, they decided to take I-40 as I-15 was still closed.
    

            “There were times that we were at a standstill for 45 minutes or more,” he said. “Many of us would get out to stretch.”
    

            They were stuck on I-40 for seven hours before getting on Route 66 and eventually making it home to Las Vegas on Saturday afternoon, Gallagher said.
    

            The family had stocked up on water bottles that they placed in an insulated bag and had a tank full of gas. Whenever they stopped, they put the sun shade over the front window to help keep cool inside, Gallagher added.
    

            With temperatures well over 100 degrees in the area, fire officials handed out water to some of the stranded drivers.

32,CNN_9,California town decimated by 2018 wildfire threatened again by state’s largest this year as fires plague Oregon and Canada,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/us/park-fire-paradise-evacuation-warning-oregon-canada-wildfires/index.html,"
            As the Park Fire continues to rapidly grow and threaten thousands more acres of northern California, an evacuation warning has been issued for the town of Paradise, a place where people know the horrors of a raging wildfire all too well.
    

            In 2018, the deadliest wildfire in state history, the Camp Fire, incinerated much of the town. Three years later, the Dixie Fire burned nearby. And now, residents of Paradise say the smell of smoke is already enough to traumatize them anew.

            Paradise Mayor Ron Lassonde was visibly emotional as he told CNN affiliate KCRA it was “hard to talk about” the Park Fire as it brought back memories of 2018.
    

            “Every once in a while, we smell smoke or see smoke like that, it does trigger us. It triggers the people here in Paradise. When you go through trauma, that’s what happens,” Lassonde told KCRA.
    

            Ava Elsner, who lived through the fire six years ago, told CNN she fears for her neighbors as the Park Fire – now the seventh-largest wildfire in California history – burns nearby.
    

            “I don’t want anyone else to experience this. It’s the most traumatizing, terrifying, and saddening thing to have a whole community go up in flames, and to lose all your personal items … so to see my parents go through this is just really hard,” Elsner told CNN. “I want to stay strong for them and comfort them the way that they did for me. And it’s just, it’s just difficult.”
    

            Meanwhile, wildfires are burning across the mountain west, in the US and north of the border in Canada, as firefighters deal with strong winds, low humidity and high temperatures to try to get the blazes under control.
    

            There are 86 large wildfires burning across the US, including 37 in Oregon and 14 in California, according to the Interagency Fire Center, and hundreds in Canada reported by its Fire Center. Here’s a brief rundown of some of the largest fires:

            • Park Fire – Butte and Tehama counties, California: The Park Fire has become California’s largest wildfire this year, covering more than 350,000 acres, or 546 square miles, which is bigger than Phoenix. President Joe Biden has directed his administration to do “everything” possible to support ongoing fire suppression efforts, according to a White House official. It began Wednesday in the Chico area, forcing thousands of people to evacuate.
    

            • Durkee Fire – Baker and Malheur counties in Oregon: The largest active wildfire in Oregon is the Durkee Fire, which has burned more than 288,000 acres. It started July 17 near the Oregon-Idaho state line. Amid high temperatures, extremely dry vegetation and strong winds, the fire was 49% contained as of Saturday evening, according to Oregon Wildfire Response and Recovery.
    

            • Jasper National Park Fire – Jasper, Alberta: Large sections of the largest national park in the Canadian Rockies are being consumed by “a wall of flames.” As of Saturday evening, the fire is at just under 80,000 acres, according to park officials, making it the largest wildfire in more than 100 years in Jasper National Park. Thousands of visitors and residents fled as flames devastated an estimated 30% of the town’s structures. Around 134 wildfires are burning throughout Alberta as firefighters from eastern Canada and internationally have been recruited to help with the fight, 34 of which remain out of control, officials said Saturday.
    

            A firefighting pilot was found dead in a single-engine air tanker on Friday after going missing the night before while working in the vicinity of the 221-square-mile Falls Fire burning in the Malheur National Forest, among several large wildfires burning across Oregon, according to officials.
    

            Meanwhile, the lightning-sparked Durkee Fire is the largest of the wildfires currently burning across Oregon, which has been the hardest hit by fires in recent days.
    

            Three people were injured and four homes and 19 other structures were destroyed as the fire spread, according to the Oregon Department of Emergency Management.
    

            Evacuation recommendations in Malheur County have been lifted as of Thursday afternoon. In Baker County many areas’ evacuation levels were reduced or eliminated, according to the county’s Sheriff’s Office.
    

            In Alberta, two wildfires converged in the Jasper National Park area, becoming what authorities are referring to as the Jasper Wildfire Complex. Officials say the losses are significant, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has deployed federal support to help battle the blaze.
    

            “Homes and businesses have been lost to a wildfire that people are calling a ‘wall of flames,’” Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said.
    

            In Jasper, a popular tourist town in Alberta, 25,000 residents and visitors were forced to evacuate from a fast-moving blaze, which has damaged 30% of the town’s structures, officials said during a news conference Thursday.

            It remains difficult to measure exactly how big the complex – which also includes a third nearby fire – is due to extreme fire behavior and thick smoke cover.
    

            “We will recover from this,” Smith said while holding back tears. “To those in Alberta and around the world who have experienced the magic of Jasper, the magic is not lost, and it never will be.”
    

            The owner of Maligne Lodge in Jasper told CNN news partner CTV News she was shocked when she saw a photo of the 98-room hotel up in flames. It had been in the family since 1961 after her father purchased the property, and she had been working there since she was a child.
    

            “As soon as we’re given the go-ahead, we’ll be in there rebuilding our hotel,” Karyn Decore said.
    

            Nearly 4,000 firefighters are “on the front lines, battling the blaze” of the Park Fire, according to Cal Fire.
    

            The Park Fire is burning just three weeks after the Thompson Fire in Butte County burned more than 3,700 acres, forced people from their homes, and destroyed more than two dozen structures, including houses.

            “Yes, there’s a fire back there,” Paradise Mayor Lassonde told CNN affiliate KCRA, appearing to be distressed. “Yes, people’s houses are being destroyed. Yes, we’ve got over 1,000 firefighters out there, risking their lives, to keep us safe.”
    

            One Butte County evacuee, Tim Ferguson, said he lost his father in the Camp Fire, and it’s painful thinking about having to go through the experience again, according to an interview with CNN affiliate KOVR.
    

            “We’ve got our home, and we’ve been working on it a lot lately, fixing it up, and it’s just we’re at the verge of maybe losing all that,” Ferguson said.
    

            A heavy plume of smoke once again looms over the county as crews battle thick flames torching everything in their path. The Park Fire has left graveyards of burned cars and charred, hallowed out structures, video from the Chico and Cohasset areas of Butte County shows.
    

            A 42-year-old man identified by authorities as Ronnie Dean Stout II has been arrested on suspicion of pushing a burning car 60 feet into a gully, “spreading flames” that caused the Park Fire. Stout will likely face an arson charge, though it’s unclear what count or whether enhancements will be added, Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said Thursday.
    

            The DA’s office told CNN Stout has not retained an attorney and will be assigned a public defender at his arraignment.
    

            Cal Fire initially estimated the fire had destroyed more than 100 structures, but on Saturday said crews on the ground have so far confirmed 20 structures destroyed.
    

            California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for both counties Friday. The state also secured a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to ensure there are enough resources to fight the fire.
    

            Elsner said the Park Fire has forced her and her parents to take shelter at the same location they stayed at in 2018. She told CNN, in tears, the experience is causing her significant PTSD from the Camp Fire and flashbacks triggered by the flames and “charred bits of remnants.”
    

            Elsner’s mother, Mary Graeff, said it’s been challenging comforting her daughter through this. “It was just hard, you know, to be that age and then lose absolutely everything. So that was hard. And watching your child go through that was awful,” Graeff said through tears.

36,CNN_15,US to reconfigure military forces in Japan as regional tensions mount,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/asia/us-austin-trilateral-japan-south-korea-intl-hnk/index.html,"
            The United States will reconfigure its military forces in Japan as the two countries move to deepen defense cooperation, Washington and Tokyo said Sunday, in a sweeping step to modernize their alliance in the face of mounting security threats in Asia.
    

            The announcement comes as Japan and the US warily eye a region where China is seen as increasingly aggressive in asserting its disputed territorial claims and North Korea continues its illegal weapons program – while both tighten ties with Russia as it wages war in Ukraine.
    

            US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and their Japanese counterparts Minoru Kihara and Yoko Kamikawa announced the plan in a joint statement following a meeting in Tokyo, where they also called China’s “political, economic, and military coercion” the “greatest strategic challenge” in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.
    

            The move is likely to stoke the ire of Beijing, which has watched warily as the US has bolstered ties with regional allies in a part of the world where observers say China seeks to be the dominant power – and where it’s accused the US of fostering a Cold War-style bloc mentality.
    

            Under the new plan, US forces in Japan would be “reconstituted” as a joint force headquarters reporting to the Commander of US Indo-Pacific Command to “facilitate deeper interoperability and cooperation on joint bilateral operations in peacetime and during contingencies,” according to the statement.
    

            In April, US President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida vowed during a summit in Washington to “upgrade” their respective command-and-control framework “to strengthen deterrence and promote a free and open Indo-Pacific in the face of pressing regional security challenges.”
    

            Details of the implementation would be figured out in working groups led by US Indo-Pacific Command, a senior US defense official said ahead of Sunday’s announcement, adding that there is no intention to integrate Japanese forces into the US commands.

Japan’s Kishida warns world at ‘historic turning point’ as he touts US alliance ahead of Biden summit


            US Forces Japan (USFJ), whose headquarters is Yokota Air Base, consists of approximately 54,000 military personnel stationed in Japan under a 1960 mutual cooperation and security treaty.
    

            “We view this as a historic announcement among the strongest improvements to our military ties in 70 years. Bottom line is that this is a transformative change,” the official said.
    

            “When this transition is complete, USFJ will have a direct leadership role in planning and leading US forces in both peace time and potential crises, and they’ll be doing that side by side with Japanese forces like never before.”
    

            The expected reconfiguration comes as Japan shifts its defense posture, veering away from the pacifist constitution imposed on it by the United States in the aftermath of World War II, with a plan to boost defense spending to about 2% of its GDP by 2027 and acquire counterstrike capabilities.
    

            These changes have cemented Japan’s centrality to Washington’s regional security strategy and its push for increasing coordination with allies and partners amid rising regional tensions – and as it increasingly sees security in Europe and Asia as intertwined in the wake of the war in Ukraine.
    

            China was repeatedly mentioned with pointed language in the joint statement, with the ministers outlining shared concerns including what they described as Beijing’s “intensifying attempts to unilaterally change the status quo” in the East China Sea, its “threatening and provocative activities in the South China Sea,” and its “support for Russia’s defense industrial base.”
    

            China has been aggressively asserting its claims in the contested waters of the South China Sea and maintaining an extended presence near Japanese-controlled islands Beijing claims in the East China Sea. Western leaders have accused Beijing of “enabling” Moscow’s war in Ukraine through the provision of dual-use goods, a charge Beijing denies.
    

            The ministers also said Taiwan’s “political transition period should not be used as a pretext for provocative actions across the Taiwan Strait,” a statement that follows Chinese military drills encircling the self-ruled democracy Beijing claims just days after Taiwan swore in a new president in May.
    

            In the statement, they also condemned North Korea’s missile testing and nuclear weapons programs, and condemned deepening Russia-North Korea cooperation, including Russia’s “procurement of ballistic missiles and other materiel from North Korea” for use in Ukraine.
    

            The meeting follows a trilateral meeting earlier Sunday between defense chiefs from the United States, Japan and South Korea, the first of its kind in 15 years – and yet another sign of the tightening coordination of regional US allies.
    

            That came nearly one year after a landmark summit between the three countries held by Biden at Camp David. The burgeoning trilateral coordination between the US, Japan and South Korea marks a shift in regional relations, with Seoul and Tokyo – both long-standing US allies – widely seen as working to put aside historic animosity and mistrust to better address shared security threats.
    

            On Sunday, the three defense chiefs vowed to strengthen cooperation to deter “nuclear and missile threats” from North Korea and formalized a trilateral agreement that reaffirms the “unwavering nature of the new era of trilateral cooperation,” according to a joint statement.
    

            This would “institutionalize” trilateral security cooperation among their countries’ defense authorities, including senior-level policy consultations, information sharing, trilateral exercises, and defense exchange cooperation.

42,CNN_43,Venezuelans vote in crucial presidential election as opposition signal high voter turnout,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/americas/venezuela-presidential-election-polls-open-intl-latam/index.html,"
            Venezuelans headed to the polls on Sunday to vote in a highly consequential presidential election in which the country’s longtime strongman, Nicolas Maduro, will face one of his greatest political challenges yet, say analysts.
    

            Long lines began to form outside polling centers in the capital, Caracas, before they were due to open at 6 a.m. ET. Opposition leaders later said there had been a high voter turnout of more than 9 million people as of Sunday afternoon.
    

            Voters in Caracas appeared optimistic. “[After] 25 years, I see that there is a real chance to change. I see a lot of people getting together to vote,” voter Mariana Schemel said.
    

            Others spoke about wanting to help their country, which has seen an exodus of Venezuelans fleeing economic collapse. “I’m doing this for my children and my grandchildren,” voter Amelia Perez told CNN. She has three sons, one of whom is living in Washington, D.C. “I want him to come back and I don’t want my children to leave. All the rest of my family already left.
    

            Maduro, who took the mantle of the ruling Chavismo movement after his predecessor Hugo Chavez’s death in 2013, is seeking his third consecutive six-year term in office. Of the nine other candidates running for the presidency, his biggest challenger is a unified opposition movement that overcame their divisions to form a coalition known as the Democratic Unitary Platform.

The woman behind Venezuela’s upstart opposition movement


            The opposition movement has maintained its momentum despite sustained government repression, in which their first-choice candidate, María Corina Machado, was disqualified from running. Machado, an avowed capitalist who has promised privatization of several state industries, has since rallied for her replacement, the soft-spoken former diplomat Edmundo González Urrutia.
    

            The vote has come at a crucial moment for Venezuela, which has experienced violent repression under Maduro’s watch and the worst economic collapse of a peacetime country in recent history. The oil-rich nation, once the fifth-largest economy in Latin America, has seen its economy shrink in the last decade to the equivalent of a medium-sized city, according to data from the International Monetary Fund. 


            Punishing sanctions on the regime by the United States and European Union have failed to topple the populist incumbent, who argues that Venezuela’s woes are due to being a victim of an “economic war.”
    

            Around eight million Venezuelans have fled the country amid shortages of vital goods and soaring inflation.
    

            There has been mounting concern that the opposition will not see a fair contest as Maduro’s government controls all public institutions in Venezuela and has been accused of rigging previous votes, which it denied. Experts note, however, that concerns of vote tampering may be mitigated by the planned presence of opposition party representatives at each polling station.
    

            The opposition coalition reported what they said were minor irregularities on Sunday, but voting proceedings appeared to be smooth in most of the country.
    

            More than 21 million people are registered to vote, both in the country and abroad. Machado reported a 41% voter turnout by Sunday afternoon, which represents more than 9 million voters.
    

            “This is huge. If this continues, it will be a historic participation figure,” Machado said in a statement released Sunday afternoon. “What you are seeing is the most important civic act in our history.”

            Machado’s statement also spoke of reported “problems” at some voting stations. “In our monitoring there were 1,300 stations in which there were problems for our observers to enter. At this time there are only 13 tables with problems.”
    

            Machado said 18 voting stations out 30,000 nationwide “couldn’t be set up.” The opposition leader also reported a “slowdown in the process and scanning of ID cards that is not justified in any way. We hope this will be eliminated and speed up the process.” However, Machado says these have been “exceptions to a process that develops peacefully.”
    

            Electoral authorities say only an identity card is needed to be eligible to vote, and a Sunday statement from the election body, the National Electoral Council (CNE), said that there is no dress code for polling centers.
    

            But in Caracas, a 55-year-old voter told CNN he was turned away from a polling center by soldiers for wearing cargo shorts. After queuing for several hours, Henrique Mendoza said the military patrolling around the center would not let him in due to his outfit.
    

            When Maduro voted at 6 a.m. in the capital, he urged citizens to respect the results of the election. His main challenger González said the opposition coalition is “going to wait for the results from the National Electoral Council, however, we also have our methods and mechanisms to know the progress of today’s electoral process.”

            The election campaign has seen at least 71 people arbitrarily detained – the majority of whom provided some sort of service to the opposition – and a dozen online media outlets blocked within the country, according to human rights organization Laboratorio de Paz.
    

            The government has also created significant impediments for the millions of Venezuelans abroad to vote, including widely unattainable passport and residency requirements. Only 69,211 Venezuelans living abroad are eligible to vote in this year’s poll, according to data published by the CNE.
    

            A limited group of election observers, including a team from The Carter Center – a non-profit organization set up by former US President Jimmy Carter – will be on the ground. But several international election observers have announced this week that they will no longer travel to Venezuela to monitor the vote.
    

            Latin American leaders, including Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, have called on Maduro to commit to stepping down if he loses. Venezuelan opposition figures have also appealed to the country’s military, that has long supported Maduro and his predecessor, to respect the results. The Venezuelan leader has said his victory will ensure “peace” in the country.
    

            How the army reacts to the outcome could be an important factor in any scenario, but analysts say it impossible to parse where it stands.
    

            “The military is absolutely key. But I must also say that the military is very hermetic, [and] it is very difficult to access information about what it is thinking,” Laura Cristina Dib, the Venezuela Program Director of Venezuela Program at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), told CNN.
    

            Polls will close at 6 p.m ET.

42,WaPo_27,Venezuelans vote in election that could oust an autocrat,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/28/venezuela-election-maduro-gonzalez/,"CARACAS, Venezuela — The Venezuelan opposition was hopeful of an election victory Sunday that could bring an end to the authoritarian government of Nicolás Maduro and the socialist state that has controlled this crisis-stricken South American nation for a quarter-century.Exit polling released after voting centers began to close Sunday evening showed opposition candidate Edmundo González taking 65 percent of the vote, more than doubling Maduro’s 31 percent, Edison Research reported. Venezuelans were waiting for official results.The opposition, suffocated by Maduro’s autocratic rule and historically hobbled by infighting, sees its best chance in more than a decade to unseat the strongman, whom many here blame for this oil-rich country’s economic collapse and the exodus of millions of migrants, hundreds of thousands of them to the United States.Maduro has barred the opposition’s chosen candidate, arrested campaign workers and blocked access to state media. Still, the opposition says it can win — and by a landslide. A high turnout could provide a significant boost; by 4 p.m., González’s campaign estimated that 11.7 million Venezuelans had voted, a participation rate of more than 54 percent.But in a country where the electoral council, courts and military are controlled by Maduro, the outcome remained far from certain. He and his team were confident they can win, according to people familiar with their conversations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the conversations. If he loses the vote, he’s not expected to cede power willingly.There were reports of blocked access, delays and some violence. In Maturín, a state capital some 350 miles east of Caracas, local opposition leaders said a voting center coordinator and her mother were demanding access for opposition poll watchers when members of a colectivo — armed Maduro supporters on motorbikes — rode up and shot the mother in the leg.Voting centers were scheduled to open 6 a.m. Sunday, but at a school in the Chacao neighborhood of Caracas, a group of 18 people arrived three hours early. They would wait for more than six hours, amid delays opening some voting tables.By 9 a.m., some of the hundreds of people began to chant: “We want to vote!” Esther Pérez Villegas, whose husband was among those waiting, stepped in to help organize the lines. “Anxiety is high, very high, because of all of the uncertainty we feel,” she said.Noemi Tovar, 61, had been in line since 3 a.m. “If I have to wait all day, I’ll wait all day,” she said.“We’ve made lines here for many things — for food, for gasoline,” said Martha Salas, 62. “This is for so much more — for a vote.”Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said problems at voting centers “were exceptions to a process that is developing peacefully.”“The way things are going, I think we are going to have, as they say, irreversible results,” she said at a voting center in Caracas.Somerville, N.J.,-based Edison Research, which interviewed more than 6,800 voters at 100 locations, said González outpolled Maduro among men and women, rural, suburban and urban voters, and every age group.“Our exit poll projects a resounding victory for Edmundo González,” executive vice president Rob Farbman said. “The opposition candidate had broad support across nearly all demographic backgrounds.”The opposition was betting it could turn out voters for a victory so overwhelming that Maduro will be forced to accept the results and begin to negotiate his exit.The number of eligible voters for the election is estimated at about 17 million. Several voting centers saw long lines. It was not possible to determine whether this reflected the greater turnout that the opposition had said would be its key to victory, but some voters in Caracas said they hadn’t seen such long crowds in many years.“I haven’t seen this kind of voter intention since Chávez,” said Vladimir Ramos, a 60-year-old engineer waiting in line. Hugo Chávez, Maduro’s mentor and predecessor, founded Venezuela’s socialist state in 1999 and led it until his death in 2013.“I think people are no longer afraid,” said Natalie Moreno, 47.By 12:40 p.m., Maduro addressed the nation to announce the activation of Operation Remate — a word meaning “finish it off” — a government-led effort to rally supporters to the polls. Maduro campaign staff and supporters called people to pressure them to vote and offer food and supplies.“Let’s mobilize ourselves with force,” Maduro said in a message aired by state television. “Let’s vote with strength as was planned, and with the force of the” social programs.The government aid was flowing in the rural eastern state of Delta Amacuro. In an Indigenous community there, people were being offered bags of food in exchange of support, said Yoxsamar Jiménez, a poll watcher for the opposition.“But that’s normal here,” she said. More concerning, she said: Poll watchers were not allowed inside, and the center’s coordinator hit Jiménez.“To avoid violence, we couldn’t do anything so we had to leave the table,” Jiménez said. “The table is alone, and they’re doing whatever they want in that center.”If Maduro loses, the United States could play a critical role in a potential negotiated transition, offering legal incentives and relief from sanctions to give Maduro a way out that doesn’t lead him straight to prison.The United States stands ready to “consider measures that would facilitate a peaceful transition of power,” a senior Biden administration official said Friday, speaking on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the administration.A Maduro defeat would be a significant foreign policy win for the Biden administration. U.S. officials negotiated a deal last year in which Maduro pledged to hold a competitive election in exchange for some sanctions relief. With irregular immigration at the center of the U.S. presidential campaign, success in Venezuela could boost Vice President Harris’s bid against former president Donald Trump.Venezuela’s opposition candidate, the former diplomat Edmundo González, was unknown to most Venezuelans just months ago. Now polls predict he could beat Maduro by double digits. He is a stand-in for longtime Maduro critic Machado, the “Iron Lady” who draws tens of thousands of Venezuelans to her near-messianic campaign caravans — and has been disqualified from running by Maduro’s supreme court.Her campaign focuses on a simple message: Vote for us, and your loved ones can come home.“The central theme is family, in the sense that this could be the last opportunity to reunite our families,” she told The Washington Post. “This is not just an electoral campaign. This is a redemption movement, for liberation.”Maduro’s campaign has portrayed the opposition as an extreme, right-wing threat that would bring instability.Some voters in Caracas seemed to agree. Hector Trujillo, a 79-year-old retired architect, said he was voting for “peace” and the continued improvement of the economy. He blamed U.S. sanctions for the country’s troubles. He feared the opposition would “eliminate everything,” including the country’s welfare benefits.The run-up to the election was far from free and fair. European Union observers who planned to monitor the vote were disinvited, leaving only small teams from the Atlanta-based Carter Center, a U.N. panel of experts and a grass-roots group of thousands of ordinary Venezuelans who have been training to watch polling centers.Machado gave a call to action last week: Vote early, stay near the polls and alert the opposition to any suspicious activity. “We will all become citizen reporters,” she said.Ana Rosas, 26, voted Sunday for the first time in her life. Rosas, who now lives in El Salvador, is among the millions of Venezuelans dispersed across the world — and among the scores who returned home to vote.“I have goose bumps,” she said. “I still can’t believe I’m able to vote. I hope it makes a difference.”In Miami, dozens of Venezuelans, unable to vote from abroad, gathered at the Dolphin Mall to watch coverage of the election. Many wore shirts of red, yellow and blue, the colors of the Venezuelan flag, that read “Venezuela Libre.”“God willing, today the country will be free,” said Lennyn Padilla, 47, tears in his eyes. “I’m emotional because when I speak about it my throat closes up. It makes me so sad.”Victor Manuel Morina Parra, a 59-year-old bus driver in Caracas, said he has noticed discontent among his passengers. He moved from his farm in the countryside to the Katia neighborhood of the capital, he said, because his rural town was “in a state of total abandonment.”“We no longer have help from the government. There’s no fuel, the electricity goes out every eight hours,” he said. “That’s why we want change. For our children, for our grandchildren.”Venezuelans are watching the armed forces and how they respond to any attempt to manipulate the election.Leopoldo López, an opposition leader, said members of the military should consider their own interests, “their own stability, their own future.”“Today, with Edmundo, a transition could be a better source of stability,” he said, “rather than Maduro telling them to go out to kill, to repress, to impose the state.”Maduro has warned of a “bloodbath” if he loses.“The destiny of Venezuela depends on our victory,” he told rallygoers this month. “If we want to avoid a bloodbath or a fratricidal civil war triggered by the fascists, then we must guarantee the biggest electoral victory ever.”Maduro’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López, said last week he would uphold the law. He called for “the one who won to take charge of his government project and the one who lost, go to rest.”"
44,CNN_26,Simone Biles fights through calf injury to produce impressive performance on Olympic return,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/sport/simone-biles-return-paris-olympics-2024-spt-intl/index.html,"
            Simone Biles fought through pain in her calf on Sunday to post an impressive all-around score and display the qualities which have made one of the greatest gymnasts of all time on her return to the Olympics.
    

            After she produced a flawless balance beam routine which scored 14.733 – the highest on the apparatus – Biles landed awkwardly while warming up for her floor routine and exited the arena before reemerging to get her lower left leg heavily taped.
    

            Cecile Landi, her coach, told reporters after the competition that Biles had been dealing with calf pain a couple weeks before Paris that flared up again during Sunday’s competition.
    

            “She felt a little something in her calf. But yeah, that’s all,” Landi told reporters.

Simone Biles ‘in a really good place’ as she prepares to further her extraordinary legacy at the Paris Olympics


            She appeared in pain, walking with a heavy limp, but still managed to twist through the air with her usual force on every other apparatus, scoring an impressive 15.800 on the vault, 14.433 on the uneven bars and 14.600 on the floor.
    

            Overall, she registered an all-around score of 59.566, the highest total as of yet and more than three points ahead of her teammate Suni Lee, though she and the USA team won’t have a confirmed spot in the finals until later on Sunday once every country has completed its qualifying round.
    

            When asked by reporters if she was OK following competition on Sunday, Biles sad, “Yup! As good as I can be.” She didn’t stick around to talk further and Landi said there are currently no concerns about her ability to compete throughout the Olympics.
    

            Biles has endured a long and much documented road back to the Olympics, the competition where she experienced a mental block known as “the twisties” that forced her to withdraw from multiple events, including the women’s team final, three years ago in Tokyo.
    

            Biles kept moving throughout much of Sunday’s qualifying, rarely taking time to sit unless she was getting training, in an attempt to keep her calf loose. While she was obviously in discomfort through the day’s final three rotations, she hardly slowed down and moved with the explosiveness that is her trademark.
    

            Once she completed all her routines, joy seemed to radiate from Biles as she grinned, waved to the crowd and danced in celebration with her teammates.
    

            She ended the second subdivision of the day leading in the all-around competition and having the top scores on the vault and floor routine – both of which came after her apparent injury – and the second-best score on the balance beam.
    

            “Simone was great. She was outstanding,” said Chellsie Memmel, the technical gymnastics lead for USA Gymnastics, to reporters following the competition. “That’s how she trains. I mean, she comes out and she comes into the gym and she does her job. She did that at podium (training). She just did it again here. So she’s fun to watch.”
    

            Memmel told reporters that she couldn’t publicly repeat the thoughts that went through her head after Biles appeared in pain, but was impressed by the star’s gritty performance.
    

            “She is an outstanding gymnast and person – just, like, overall human – so what she was able to do with looking like she you know, had some soreness or something in her lower leg. It is remarkable,” Memmel said.
    

            Gymnastics qualifying continues throughout the day on Sunday, so it won’t be until the evening in Paris for it to be clear who will go through to the medal competition on Tuesday.

            Mark Meadows’ lawyers say they’ve asked the Supreme Court this weekend to take up his bid to move the Georgia election subversion prosecution against him to federal court, where the former White House chief of staff to ex-President Donald Trump would bring arguments that he is entitled to immunity from the charges.
    

            “It is hard to imagine a case in which the need for a federal forum is more pressing than one that requires resolving novel questions about the duties and powers of one of the most important federal offices in the Nation,” Meadows’ lawyers wrote in the new filing, which pointed to the justices’ recent ruling that gave Trump some immunity in the federal election subversion prosecution.
    

            The US 11th Circuit Court of Appeals said last year that the Georgia prosecution against Meadows should move forward in state court, concluding that former federal officials are not covered by that statute “removing” state cases against government officials to federal court. Chief Judge William Pryor’s opinion for the court also said that “the events giving rise to this criminal action were not related Meadows’s official duties.”

            Since that December ruling, Meadows has obtained multiple extensions on his deadline to ask the Supreme Court to review the dispute. In the meantime, the high court’s conservative majority handed down the immunity ruling earlier this month that said Trump had at least “presumptive” immunity for any of his official acts as president that were targeted in the federal criminal charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith. That case, which was brought in Washington, DC, will go back to the trial court for the judge to sort out which alleged acts in Smith’s indictment are subject to presidential immunity under the Supreme Court’s ruling.
    

            Meadows’ new filing repeatedly referred to the Trump ruling, with his lawyers writing that “a White House Chief of Staff facing criminal charges based on actions relating to his work for the President of the United States should not be a close call—especially now that this Court has recognized that federal immunity impacts what evidence can be considered, not just what conduct can form the basis for liability.”
    

            Meadows also used the Trump immunity ruling to argue that, in his case, his status as a former official should not affect his ability to move the proceedings to federal court.
    

            “Just as immunity protection for former officers is critical to ensuring that current and future officers are not deterred from enthusiastic service, so too is the promise of a federal forum in which to litigate that defense,” Meadows wrote.
    

            His lawyers told the justices that if they were not willing to give a full review of Meadows’ case, they should at least wipe away last year’s 11th Circuit ruling and send the case back down for lower courts to reconsider in light of the Trump immunity opinion.
    

            The Georgia case is at a standstill while an appeals court considers ethics allegations against Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis — an issue that will not be resolved before the election.

52,WaPo_78,Mark Meadows takes bid to toss Georgia election charges to Supreme Court,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/07/28/mark-meadows-georgia-supreme-court/,"ATLANTA — Mark Meadows, Donald Trump’s former White House chief of staff, took his battle to throw out the Georgia election interference case against him to the U.S. Supreme Court, asking the high court to overturn a lower-court ruling that rejected claims that his alleged conduct was tied to his official federal duties.The move comes more than seven months after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit upheld a lower-court ruling from September that found Meadows had not proved his alleged conduct charged as part of the sweeping criminal racketeering case was related to his official duties as Trump’s most senior White House aide.Meadows’ petition to the Supreme Court, dated Friday, sharply criticizes the 11th Circuit decision, describing it as “the first court ‘in the 190-year history of the federal officer removal statute’ to hold that the statute offers no protection to former federal officers facing suit for acts taken while in office.”The filing contends the appellate decision was “egregiously wrong, wholly unprecedented, and exceptionally dangerous” and points to the Supreme Court’s recent decision granting Trump immunity for official presidential acts in his federal election interference case as reason for the court to intervene in Meadows’ case. The Washington Post obtained the petition, which was first reported by CNN.“That decision makes clear that federal immunity fully protects former officers, often requires difficult and fact-intensive judgment calls at the margins, and provides not just a substantive immunity but a use immunity that protects against the use of official acts to try to hold a current or former federal officer liable for unofficial acts,” the filing states. “All of those sensitive disputes plainly belong in federal court.”Meadows was indicted along with Trump and 17 others in August on charges they illegally conspired to try to overturn Trump’s 2020 election loss in Georgia. Meadows, who has pleaded not guilty, had sought to move his case to federal court, claiming protections under a federal statute that allows federal officials to move legal cases against them from state to federal court when the charges are tied to official duties.A three-judge appellate court heard oral arguments in December on the issue and appeared skeptical of Meadows claims that his alleged actions outlined in the Fulton County indictment were tied to his official government duties.In a Dec. 18 opinion written by Chief Judge William Pryor, a noted conservative jurist, the panel rejected Meadows’ arguments, writing the federal removal statute “does not apply to former federal officers, and even if it did, the events giving rise to this criminal action were not related to Meadows’s official duties.”Meadows’ attorneys later asked the full 11th circuit appellate bench to reconsider, but the request was denied.The appeal comes three months after Meadows and other several other Trump allies were indicted in Arizona on similar charges of seeking to overturn Trump’s 2020 loss in that state. Meadows pleaded not guilty to those charges in June.The developments come as the Georgia election case is largely on pause, as Trump, Meadows and several other co-defendants seek to overturn a ruling allowing Fulton County District Attorney Fani T. Willis (D) to continue prosecuting the case amid claims she had an improper romantic relationship with the now-former lead prosecutor on the case.That appeal is now pending before the Georgia Court of Appeals, which has scheduled oral arguments for Dec. 5 — a month after the November election."

Hezbollah denied any connection to the attack. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and top Israeli officials promised to retaliate against the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group, raising fears of a wider escalation in regional hostilities.Netanyahu returned to Israel on Sunday from his visit to the United States and is set to meet with his security cabinet later in the day.In a Sunday morning tweet, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant mourned the victims of the Majdal Shams attack and said all people living in the area “suffer” on account of Hezbollah. “We will ensure Hezbollah, the proxy of Iran, pays a price for this loss,” he wrote. Earlier, Netanyahu warned: “Hezbollah will pay a heavy price for this that it has not paid so far.”“We are deeply saddened by the loss of life,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters at a Sunday news conference in Tokyo, where he has been meeting his Japanese counterparts. “Every indication is that indeed … the rocket was from Hezbollah,” he added.While the Biden administration believes Hezbollah carried out the attack, the working assumption is that it was an accident, a senior U.S. official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive assessments. The person cautioned that U.S. officials don’t yet have a definitive conclusion about the intention behind the attack.Fighting along the Lebanon-Israel border has intensified in recent months, with regular exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israel’s military. For months, the United States has pushed to de-escalate hostilities on that front. Blinken reiterated Sunday that he and other top U.S. policymakers “don’t want to see the conflict escalate,” and that they were working to ease tensions and bring about a cease-fire deal in Gaza, which he said would reduce flare-ups on the Israel-Lebanon border.Bou Habib, the Lebanese foreign minister, told Reuters that the United States had asked the Lebanese government to pass on a message of restraint to Hezbollah, too.Hundreds of mourners gathered in Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights, home to the Arabic-speaking ethnic Druze community, on Sunday for the funeral of those killed in the rocket attack. The spiritual leader of the community, Sheikh Muwafek Tarif, described it as a day of mourning in an interview to Israeli news outlet Ynet. He said there was a lot of anger in the community and questioned what the Israeli government had done for the area’s security.“Harming civilians is a black line. The government must bring security to the residents,” he said.Assad Abu Saleh, who lives in Spain but was visiting relatives in Majdal Shams when the strike occurred, said several of the victims belonged to his extended family. “It’s a catastrophe,” he told The Washington Post during the funerals Sunday. He saw “parts of bodies” and people without heads at the site, he said.“This war, this stupid war, has to come to an end,” he said. But he could not see the end. “Both sides are too stubborn to settle for negotiations.”Majd Abu Saleh, an engineer, said he was about 160 feet away when the projectile landed. “All our children, all the time, they are playing” in the soccer field. His 9-year-old daughter left the field about five minutes before the strike, he said, and three of her friends were killed.Video he recorded when he arrived showed a terrible scene: at least nine children in soccer jerseys and cleats, motionless, their bodies contorted or pierced by shrapnel on the green field.“I wish to be finished with this tragedy and this crazy war,” said Fawzi Abu Jaber, 72, who said he has lived his whole life in Majdal Shams. The United States, he said, “must back peace, not the war, and not the Israeli government, which doesn’t want peace. Not in Lebanon and in Gaza but in all the Middle East.”Paramedics arrived at the soccer field Saturday to a “very difficult scene,” said United Hatzalah, an Israeli volunteer-based emergency medical services organization. Dozens of children lay injured. Nine of the victims were declared dead on the scene because of the severity of their injuries, the group said in an email. Israel’s military said those injured and killed were between 10 and 20 years old.The Golan Heights, where Majdal Shams is located, is a 500-square-mile strip along the border between Syria and Israel that was seized by Israel in 1967 and formally annexed in 1981. In 2019, President Donald Trump upended years of the status quo by making the United States the only country apart from Israel to recognize it Israeli territory.“There is no doubt that Hezbollah has crossed all the red lines here, and the response will reflect that,” Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Channel 12 on Saturday, adding: “We are nearing the moment in which we face an all-out war against Hezbollah and Lebanon.” A 34-day-war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 left hundreds of soldiers and civilians dead and injured on both sides. Hezbollah has since received large shipments of rockets and drones from Iran and produced its own weapons and has air defense capabilities.Iran’s Foreign Ministry warned Israel against any “new adventure” in Lebanon and backed Hezbollah’s assertion that the group was not behind the Majdal Shams attack. Spokesman Nasser Kanani said Israeli claims that Hezbollah is responsible for the strike are a “fake scenario” attempting to divert attention from the war in Gaza, according to a Foreign Ministry statement Sunday. The United States and the United Nations have a “moral responsibility” to prevent Israel “from starting a new fire whose flames will spread,” Kanani said.German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock condemned the Majdal Shams strike on Sunday, adding, “It is important to act with cool heads. Far too many people have died already in this conflict.”The attack in Majdal Shams followed a deadly strike in central Gaza, where local health authorities said at least 30 Palestinians were killed when Israel bombed a school that was sheltering displaced people. The Israel Defense Forces said it targeted a Hamas command and control center inside the Khadija school compound.At least 39,324 people have been killed and 90,830 injured in Gaza since the war began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack, including more than 300 soldiers, and says 329 soldiers have been killed since the launch of its military operation in Gaza.Heidi Levine, Kareem Fahim, Michael Birnbaum, Alon Rom and Lior Soroka contributed to this report."
107,WaPo_76,"Simone Biles, after an injury scare with a packed house, has an ‘amazing’ day",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/28/simone-biles-injury-scare-paris-olympics/,"PARIS — The last time Simone Biles stood on the vault runway at the Olympic Games, her body betrayed her. Since then, she has been unstoppable as she proved, in routine after routine, that she has worked past the mental block that derailed her three years ago in Tokyo — and that she is still the world’s best gymnast.But during her first competitive performance in Paris, in the qualifying round here Sunday, Biles’s body threatened to thwart her again.This time, it was a physical ailment, rather than the dangerous mind-body disconnect that rattled Biles amid the pressure of the previous Olympics. But it still seemed like déjà vu, with Biles alongside the team doctor as questions lingered about whether the sport’s biggest star would be able to continue.During warmups before floor, Biles felt minor pain in her left calf, a reemergence of an issue from a couple of weeks ago, her coach, Cecile Landi, said afterward. Wrapping her lower leg with tape was enough to help Biles push through. But while she warmed up her vaults soon after, she at one point crawled alongside the runway and hopped on one foot. She then practiced her difficult Yurchenko double pike and landed short, an unusual error for Biles — and a sometimes painful mistake.The uncertainty lingered briefly, palpable in an arena packed with thousands of fans and a few A-list admirers, including Tom Cruise, Ariana Grande and Jessica Chastain. But Landi said finishing Sunday’s competition was never in doubt for Biles, who did not talk with reporters afterward.When it counted, Biles sprinted down the runway and soared off the vault, flipping twice in a pike position. It’s the hardest vault in women’s gymnastics, but Biles makes it look easy — even amid an injury scare. As she headed to bars, “she started to feel better,” Landi said. Biles hit another routine to post a 59.566 all-around total, her second-best mark since Tokyo and the highest score in the qualifying round.Biles’s performance was “pretty amazing,” Landi said, adding that she does not have any concerns about whether Biles will be able to continue competing.Despite the injury and some minor errors, Biles managed to lead the U.S. women through the meet as a steadying force. She stepped out of bounds on floor, just after the calf pain flared up, and she ended up having too much power on vault, despite not rotating enough in warmups, so she took two big steps backward.The other Americans had more nervy moments: All the gymnasts who joined Biles in the beam lineup wobbled on multiple skills, particularly 16-year-old Hezly Rivera in her Olympic debut. And Jade Carey, who said on social media that she hasn’t been feeling well, bailed out of her final tumbling pass on floor, leading to a low score that will keep her from defending her Olympic gold medal on the apparatus.i haven’t been feeling the best the past few days but i gave it everything i had today. thank you for all the support i have received. i’m so grateful ❤️❤️ https://t.co/52r9JtsXkNEven with the mishaps, the U.S. team’s mark of 172.296 led the field and was more than five points ahead of second-place Italy. The Americans will be the heavy favorites to win the team gold Tuesday, particularly given the absence of Russia, a longtime power in gymnastics, whose athletes are banned from team competition here. The athletes from the Russian Olympic Committee won the gold ahead of the Americans in Tokyo after Biles’s withdrawal led to a chaotic team final.In the qualifying round, Sunisa Lee, the reigning Olympic all-around champion, edged Jordan Chiles by less than one-tenth to earn a spot in the all-around final. Though Chiles’s 56.065 was the fourth-best mark overall, countries cannot have more than two gymnasts in each final, and Lee (56.132) narrowly prevailed. Rebeca Andrade of Brazil will be Biles’s top challenger in the final, but she trailed Biles by close to two points in the opening round of competition.Biles, expected to win the all-around gold, will be the headliner each time she competes. But Landi has said that having three other returning Olympians on this team eases the pressure on Biles.And together, the gymnasts have described this Olympics as their “redemption tour.” All four returners — Biles, Lee, Carey and Chiles — have something they want to achieve that they missed out on three years ago, nobody more so than Biles. The injury, no matter how minor, only adds to the curiosity around how Biles will manage this massive spotlight.In her first test, though, Biles excelled. She tallied the best score of the day on vault and floor, as well as the second-best mark on beam. After she finished her final routine, she waved to the crowd and then danced with Chiles to celebrate. The calf issue added uncertainty to Biles’s Olympic quest, which could end with up to five gold medals, but her dominant performance amid the trouble resembled all of her other outings since Tokyo. One after another, Biles’s brilliant routines washed away the concern."
114,WaPo_74,U.S. women’s soccer routs Germany to clinch Olympic quarterfinal berth,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/28/us-soccer-germany-women-olympics/,"MARSEILLE, France — The United States-Germany women’s soccer match Sunday seemed better suited for the Olympic medal round, not the second day of group play before a small crowd far from the merriment of Paris. Looking away for an instant during an intoxicating first half meant you risked missing something wonderful between teams that have won trophies and admirers for their excellence over decades.During a 45-minute rush of fun featuring four goals, Sophia Smith showed no ill effects from an ankle injury suffered in the opener, scoring twice before intermission as the Americans stormed to a 4-1 victory and a quarterfinal berth.A victory or draw by the Americans (2-0-0) on Wednesday against Australia (1-1-0) in Marseille would secure Group B’s top slot and a quarterfinal place Saturday in Paris. Germany (1-1-0) will face Zambia (0-2-0) in the other match. Two teams will receive automatic berths, and one could advance as a third-place team.Smith opened the scoring in the 10th minute. After Germany drew even, Mallory Swanson scored her third goal in two matches and Smith struck again just before halftime. Lynn Williams, Smith’s late replacement, added an 89th-minute goal.Germany is ranked No. 4, one slot ahead of the United States, which is at its lowest spot since FIFA launched the women’s rankings in 2003. The substandard U.S. showing at the World Cup last year prompted the hiring of Emma Hayes, a renowned British club coach without international experience.After completing her work with Chelsea, Hayes took over in earnest in May. She named several young players to the Olympic squad and left veteran striker Alex Morgan, among others, off it.Her first Olympic test got off to a sensational start against Zambia on Wednesday with three first-half goals before puttering out. Including two tuneup games, the Americans squandered an enormous number of chances against badly overmatched opponents and scored just four goals.Sunday’s first-half breakout came against a German side that had rolled to a 3-0 victory over Australia in its opener.With Smith cleared to play after leaving the opener with a first-half ankle injury, Hayes did not make any changes to the lineup. With her team comfortably ahead of Zambia, Hayes did not want to risk inflaming Smith’s injury and losing a key player for the Germany showdown.Front-line depth is a concern because of small game-day rosters — 18 instead of 23 like at the World Cup — and the absence of Jaedyn Shaw, who was unavailable again with a leg injury.The U.S. defensive unit — featuring defensive midfielder Sam Coffey and the back line of Emily Fox, Naomi Girma, Tierna Davidson and Crystal Dunn — was close to perfect handling Zambia star Barbra Banda. (The 24-year-old striker had a hat trick and an assist in a 6-5 loss to Australia on Sunday.) Germany posed a diversified threat, led by captain Alexandra Popp.The United States had not crossed paths in the Olympics with the 2016 gold medalists since the 2004 Athens Games. It has dominated the series with a 23-5-7 record, but Germany won a 2022 friendly in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and eight of the previous 10 meetings were decided by one goal or ended in a draw.Germany had a brilliant opportunity to crack the match open in the fourth minute after Lindsey Horan’s giveaway in midfield. Alone inside the penalty area, Lea Schüller did not place her shot well enough, allowing Alyssa Naeher to make a fine leg save.Six minutes later, the Americans went ahead on a goal featuring superb buildup and execution. Emily Fox, Trinity Rodman and Rose Lavelle worked the ball on the right side. Lavelle’s pass liberated Rodman flashing past her marker. As Rodman crossed, Swanson’s near-post run caused distraction. On the back side, Smith met the ball for a simple one-timer.Germany answered in the 22nd minute. Pushed forward, right back Giulia Gwinn was afforded time and space to drive a 25-yard shot with perfect placement beyond Naeher’s stretch and into the far corner.The Americans needed just four minutes to reclaim the lead. Smith won the ball beyond the penalty area and ripped a rising shot. Ann-Katrin Berger made a two-handed save but failed to hold the ball or push it out of danger. Swanson got to it first, stabbing the rebound past Berger for her 37th career goal.The U.S. team lost Davidson to an apparent knee injury late in the half. Emily Sonnett entered.As Davidson was making her way to the bench, Smith scored again. Initially, she whiffed on a left-footed one-timer. She stuck with it, pushed the ball along the top of the penalty area and tagged a right-footed shot that caromed off defender Felicitas Rauch, took flight, flew over Berger, hit the right post and spun across the line for her 22nd international goal.Early in the second half, Germany pushed hard. Jule Brand nicked the right post, and Naeher blocked Sjoeke Nüsken inside the six-yard box.The U.S. team regained its composure and saw out the victory. Smith left to a standing ovation in the 85th minute — four minutes before Swanson set up Williams on the left side of the box for an angled shot into the far corner."

The Americans’ forward trio of Sophia Smith (two goals today), Mallory Swanson (one goal today, three thus far in the tournament) and Trinity Rodman repeatedly showed its quality, and goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher made key saves in both the first and second halves. The other U.S. goal was scored by Lynn Williams, a popular veteran, making for a feel-good showing all around as the side went to the top of its qualifying group with a game to go against Australia on Wednesday before the knockout round begins."

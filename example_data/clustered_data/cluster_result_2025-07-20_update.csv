Jon Tester calls on Biden to bow out",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/democratic-sen-jon-tester-calls-joe-biden-drop-out-2024-election-rcna162644,"Sen. Jon Tester of Montana became the second Democratic senator to call for President Joe Biden to bow out of the presidential race Thursday.
""While I appreciate his commitment to public service and our country, I believe President Biden should not seek re-election to another term,"" Tester said in a statement.
Tester is running for re-election to one of the most vulnerable Senate seats for Democrats this fall.
He said he has ""worked with President Biden when it has made Montana stronger, and I’ve never been afraid to stand up to him when he is wrong.""
Tester informed Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., of his plans before he made a public statement, according to a source with knowledge of the situation. Schumer told Tester to do what he thought was best.
Tester is only the second Democratic senator to call on Biden to bow out of the race, following Peter Welch of Vermont. 
Shortly after Tester's announcement, Rep. Jim Costa, D-Calif., also called on Biden to step aside.
""For the good of the country, I think it is time for the President to pass the torch to the next generation to carry on the legacy he started,"" Costa said, after praising Biden's presidency. ""Democrats need to unite and deliver their strongest team to the American people in this election.”
Costa, who has served in Congress since 2005, represents a district that includes Fresno. He won re-election in 2022 with 54.2% of the vote.
Including Tester and Costa, 22 congressional Democrats have now called on Biden to exit the race.
Tester's comments come after he said in a July 8 statement that Biden ""has got to prove to the American people — including me — that he’s up to the job for another four years."" 
Representing a red state, Tester has criticized Biden before, including over the timing of his border policies and his Environmental Protection Agency regulations.
Reached for comment, the Biden campaign pointed to remarks from Cedric Richmond, a co-chair of Biden’s re-election campaign, who reacted to the news during an interview on MSNBC.
“I like Sen. Tester. I think he’s one of our great fighters in the Democratic Party,"" Richmond said. ""But on this, I will tell you, I think he’s wrong, and I think that we should be focused on re-electing the president and the vice president, and our senators and our Congress people should be running their race to get re-elected.""
""There’s a lifetime between now and Election Day, and if we focus on what we should, we’ll come out on top,"" Richmond continued.
The Biden campaign also pointed to earlier comments from Quentin Fulks, the principal deputy campaign manager, who said that Biden ""is not wavering on anything."" The president has said multiple times that he's staying in the race.
Tester's Republican challenger slammed him in a statement on X, asking whether Tester is ""finally admitting he lied when he told us Biden is 100% with it?!""
""Two-Faced Tester is desperately trying distance himself from the train wreck he’s enabled and forced on Montanans,"" said Tim Sheehy, who is running for Tester's seat.
Tester told NBC News in August that he believed Biden was ""absolutely 100% with it"" when he was asked whether he had any concerns about Biden's age.Megan Lebowitz is a politics reporter for NBC News.

0,CNN_5,"Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, vulnerable Democrat up for reelection, calls on Biden to drop out of the race",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/18/politics/jon-tester-calls-biden-drop-out/index.html,"
            Montana Sen. Jon Tester, a vulnerable Democrat up for reelection in a deep-red state, has called for President Joe Biden to end his bid for a second term.
    

            ”I have worked with President Biden when it has made Montana stronger, and I’ve never been afraid to stand up to him when he is wrong,” Tester said in a statement Thursday. “And while I appreciate his commitment to public service and our country, I believe President Biden should not seek re-election to another term.”
    

            Tester is the second Democratic senator to ask Biden to withdraw as the party’s presumptive presidential nominee. Earlier this month, Vermont Sen. Peter Welch called on Biden to “withdraw from the race” in a Washington Post op-ed.
    

            Tester’s announcement comes hours after CNN reported that many senior-ranking White House and Biden campaign officials now privately believe that the president must abandon his reelection campaign soon.
    

            “The next 72 hours are big,” one Democratic governor in close touch with party officials relayed to aides on Thursday. “This can’t go on much longer.”
    

            Democrats continue to wrestle with not only Biden’s reelection bid but also its ability to hurt the party in down-ballot races. CNN reported Wednesday that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi privately told Biden that he could destroy Democrats’ chances of winning the House. In the Senate, Democrats and the independents who caucus with them have a difficult road to maintain their majority, with 23 seats to defend compared with just 11 for Republicans.

2,NBC_3,"Three years after Covid, worldwide IT outage again reveals fragility of global commerce, supply chains",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/worldwide-computer-outage-reveals-fragility-global-commerce-rcna162672,"A failure in the interconnected web that constitutes the global supply chain threatens to disrupt daily commerce for an indefinite period, showing how widespread reliance on the same system can create a worldwide crisis when that system goes down.  
It was still not known Friday morning how long it would take to address the issue, which cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike attributed to an improperly executed update on Microsoft systems.
Although Microsoft itself was not directly responsible for the outage, the worldwide reliance on a single common operating system and a major cybersecurity company, while useful when everything is running smoothly, creates the potential for a single point of failure to take down the entire planet, experts say.
In addition to many major airlines being unable to clear flights for takeoff, everything from port authorities to train systems, alongside hospitals and banks, were affected.  
Wesley Miller, a research analyst and former Microsoft employee who writes about IT issues, said the outage shows the price of interconnectedness and the dangers of market concentration.
Not only was there an overreliance on Microsoft, he said, but Friday's outage could also be blamed on the consolidation of vendors in the cybersecurity space. Backed by Google and one of the most valuable cybersecurity firms in the world, CrowdStrike has made a number of strategic acquisitions in recent years. 
""At end of the day, everyone is operating with one thing, and they're trying to move faster than bad guys to avoid getting attacked,"" Miller told NBC News. 
Miller also placed some blame on the lingering staffing challenges created by Covid.
“Teams everywhere are really stretched thin; IT staff, testing staff, everyone is pulled to their max,” he said. “Everyone is still pretending everything is fine, when there’s been massive changes all around us.”  
Ironically, high-profile examples of companies not affected by the outage have previously faced their own issues because they weren't using state of the art technology. Notably, Southwest and Frontier airlines appeared to be the only large U.S. air carriers operating without incident Friday. Two years ago, Southwest's entire system shut down as a result of its reliance on an antiquated scheduling system. 
""This will happen and keep happening as long as everything is built around fragile supply chains where the same companies turn up time and time again,"" Jennifer Cobbe, assistant professor of law and technology at the University of Cambridge, posted on X Friday.  
""This means no resilience: One of them goes down, potentially everything goes down — with widespread and unforeseeable consequences.""
The speed at which companies must now move to compete with one another creates inherent instability, Miller said.   
""We're clearly operating faster than the systems we’ve built can handle,"" he said. ""We need to start taking a look at more failsafes.""
Miller is not optimistic they will be easily implemented. 
In the wake of the pandemic, there was a great amount of discussion about how to make global supply chains more resilient. In 2021, President Joe Biden held a Summit on Global Supply Chain Resilience alongside European Union nations and 14 other countries. Last fall, the White House released a new Issue Brief on the topic, noting: ""Economic research has long been clear that deeply intertwined supply chains can turn micro disruptions into macro-level effects.""
The brief noted that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, as well as the Biden administration's CHIPS & Science Act and Inflation Reduction Act, were all designed to help boost supply-chain resiliency.
But Miller believes companies' requirements to maximize profits means the global commerce system will continue to be vulnerable indefinitely, he said.
""There’s so little shareholder value in taking a little extra time to do the right thing,"" he said. Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com."

In some cases, travelers were given hand-written boarding passes.

4,NBC_5,Biden's family starts discussing his possible exit plan from the 2024 race,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/bidens-family-starts-discussing-exit-plan-2024-race-rcna162658,"WASHINGTON — Members of President Joe Biden’s family have discussed what an exit from his campaign might look like, according to two people familiar with the discussions. 
The overall tone of the conversations has been that any exit plan — should Biden decide to take that step, as some of his closest allies increasingly believe he will — should put the party in the best position to beat former President Donald Trump while also being worthy of the more than five decades he has served the country in elected office, these people said. 
Biden’s family members have specifically discussed how he would want to end his re-election bid on his own timing and with a carefully calculated plan in place. Considerations about the impact of the campaign on his health, his family and the stability of the country are among those at the forefront of the discussions, the people familiar with those discussions said.
The prospect of Biden’s considering stepping aside, much less that his family is gaming out a possible exit plan, is an extraordinary development that comes after he has repeatedly said he would not relinquish his position as the presumptive nominee of the party. 
But concerns have mounted among party leaders, donors and even officials who are part of his re-election effort with every day that has passed since a devastating debate three weeks ago. At the same time, Democrats are watching Republicans rally around Trump, who just survived an assassination attempt and accepted his party’s nomination Thursday night. 
White House spokesman Andrew Bates denied that any such exit discussions are happening among the family. 
""That is not happening, period,"" he said. ""The individuals making those claims are not speaking for his family or his team — and they will be proven wrong. Keep the faith.""
On MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" Friday, Biden campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon acknowledged that the campaign has seen some ""slippage,"" but she said it's been ""a small movement"" and insisted Biden is ""absolutely"" still in the race. 
Ron Klain, Biden’s former White House chief of staff and an adviser to him for decades, said in an interview that Biden is hearing the public and private calls for him to exit the race.
“I think he’s feeling the pressure,” said Klain, who has spoken to Biden recently. “I want him to stay in.”
Klain’s take is that it makes no sense for Biden to be pushed aside. He said some in his party underestimate Trump at their own peril and undervalue the fact that Biden is the only one who has beaten him.
Biden and the people closest to him have felt burned by efforts to push him out that they see as backhanded and disrespectful. The family is distraught and moving through the stages of anger and grief over how people they perceived to be friends have treated the president.
“There was a much more dignified way to do this if this is what they wanted,” a Biden ally said. “This is no way to treat a public servant who has done a lot for this country.”
Discussions about how to game out a fitting plan for Biden to step aside have also played out among senior staff members, not just the president’s family, according to a person close to the re-election effort. Bates also denied these discussions are happening. 
The family members Biden has relied on most include first lady Jill Biden, his son Hunter and his sister, Valerie Owens, as well as a few longtime close aides who have been at the core of the discussions.
The conversations about Biden’s political future have raged while he remains at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, sidelined after he tested positive for Covid on Wednesday. 
On Thursday, some of Biden’s closest aides were calling trusted allies to get a sense of where they thought his political standing is, according to a person familiar with the phone calls. 
A Democratic lawmaker described Biden in this moment as “reflective."" A third person close to Biden described the president as politically “fighting for his life.”
There are growing expectations among some allies that if Biden were to exit, it could be in the coming days. But they also caution that it still is up to him to make the decision and that he is not wired to quit even when he faces seemingly insurmountable adversity. 
About the possibility any announcement is imminent, a person close to the Bidens said, “We don’t even know what we’re doing tomorrow.”  
Still, Biden is not insusceptible to the mounting pressure from his own party, and he has said himself since the debate that he may consider leaving the race if there were no path for him to win. 
“I think it’s inevitable,” a second person close to the re-election effort said of Biden’s withdrawing from the race. 
As reports surfaced, including from NBC News, that Biden had shown signs that he could budge from his insistence that he remain the nominee, rumors and reports — some that the president's allies flatly denied — began to fly. They included speculation about timing of a potential exit, whether Biden would immediately endorse Vice President Kamala Harris and who was on the shortlist to be her vice presidential running mate.  
Among the reports: that longtime speechwriter and historian Jon Meacham was writing Biden’s exit remarks. 
Meacham rebuffed the account. 
“The report is totally false,” he said. 
Amid the turmoil the Biden campaign sent out talking points to Democrats, according to a Democratic strategist: “President Biden has not spoken to congressional leadership today. The president is his party’s nominee, having won 14 million votes during the Democratic primary. He’s running for re-election, and that will not change until he wins re-election.” 
As many in his own party turned against him, Biden continued this week to check in with allies and gauge their sentiments. 
“With all the rumors that I’m leaving, I’m not,” Biden told the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader and MSNBC host, in a phone call Monday, Sharpton said.
“I will support whatever you decide,” Sharpton said he told the president.
Sharpton said in an interview Thursday that legacy is something Biden “has to think of” as he contemplates his political future. “If there’s anyone that could make a comeback … it’s Joe Biden. Whether he chooses to or not, I don’t know.”
Some in Biden’s camp had hoped he would be able to weather the storm of pressure for him to step aside — that news events, including the Republican National Convention, would turn the national conversation away from whether and when he might end his campaign. But even the attempted assassination of Trump on Saturday did little to quell the furor around Biden. If anything, Democrats have since turned up the heat.
A major factor driving the private pressure on Biden is the fear among Democrats that his candidacy could rob them not only of the White House and the Senate but also of a chance to flip the House to their control. That helps explain why senior lawmakers have pushed on Biden to reconsider his decision to stay in the race.
“The House is on the brink,” said Brian Wolff, the treasurer of the House Majority PAC, the main super PAC supporting House Democratic candidates. “These candidates don’t deserve that.”
Wolff said Democratic incumbents and challengers in tough races cannot risk splintering their own voter coalitions by publicly taking one side or the other as Biden considers his options.
“They can’t afford to alienate the base that wants to support Biden or the base that wants someone else,” he said.Carol E. Lee is the Washington managing editor.

4,NBC_17,"Eight more Democrats, including Pelosi allies, call for Biden to exit 2024 election",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/eight-democrats-pelosi-allies-call-biden-exit-2024-election-rcna162726,"WASHINGTON — Eight congressional Democrats on Friday joined the growing chorus of lawmakers calling on President Joe Biden to step aside as the party’s nominee, bringing the total number of Hill Democrats who want someone else at the top of the ticket to 30.
The new defections include two close allies of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as well as a third senator.
New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, who is running for re-election this fall, became the third Senate Democrat to call on Biden to leave the race, joining Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont and Sen. Jon Tester, who is facing a tough re-election bid in Montana. 
The latest Biden defections in the House hail from some of the president’s core constituencies of support. Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Texas, became the first member of the Congressional Black Caucus — whose leaders campaigned with Biden this week in Nevada — to call on Biden to bow out.
Veasey and three other House Democrats — Rep. Jared Huffman of California, Chuy Garcia of Illinois, and Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, issued a joint statement Friday praising Biden’s decades of public service but saying it is now time for the 82-year-old president to “pass the torch” to give Democrats the best chance of beating Republican nominee Donald Trump in November.
Garcia is a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, whose chairwoman, Rep. Nanette Barragán of California, also campaigned with Biden in Nevada this week and whose affiliated super PAC endorsed Biden on Friday. Other Hispanic Caucus members who earlier called for Biden to step aside are Reps. Raul Grijalva of Arizona and Mike Levin of California.
Meanwhile, Pocan is chairman of the Congressional Equality Caucus, formerly the LGBTQ+ Caucus, and the former co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, whose most high-profile members — including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. — have been urging Democrats not to dump Biden.
Huffman is also a progressive who is a close ally of Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and represents a San Francisco Bay Area district next to hers.
Another close Bay Area ally of Pelosi's, longtime Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., also joined the group of detractors Friday, releasing a letter that she sent to Biden Thursday night. In it, Lofgren mentioned her work on the House Jan. 6 Committee, warning that Trump ""remains as grave a threat to the Constitutional order and rule of law that he was on January 6, 2021 when he incited insurrection.""
“We must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign,"" Veasey, Garcia, Pocan and Huffman wrote in their joint statement. ""These perceptions may not be fair, but they have hardened in the aftermath of last month’s debate and are now unlikely to change.""
“We believe the most responsible and patriotic thing you can do in this moment is to step aside as our nominee while continuing to lead our party from the White House. Democrats have a deep and talented bench of younger leaders, led by Vice President Kamala Harris, who you have lifted up, empowered, and prepared for this moment,” the quartet continued. “Passing the torch would fundamentally change the trajectory of the campaign. It would reinvigorate the race and infuse Democrats with enthusiasm and momentum heading into our convention next month.”
Separately, Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois called on Biden to drop out in an op-ed for the Chicago Tribune published Friday. “As long as this election is ... litigated over which candidate is more likely to be held accountable for public gaffes and ‘senior moments,' I believe that Biden is not only going to lose but is also uniquely incapable of shifting that conversation,"" he wrote.
And Rep. Greg Landsman, an Ohio Democrat who is one of Republicans' top targets in 2024, said in a lengthy thread on X that ""there's too much on the line"" in 2024 for Biden to continue as the Democratic nominee.
The new batch of defections means that more than 10% of House and Senate Democrats — 30 out of 264 — are calling for Biden to exit the race. 
Biden, however, has repeatedly said he's not going anywhere, and that he has earned the nomination, backed by 14 million Democratic primary voters.  
Appearing on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" on Friday, Biden campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon conceded that it's been a ""tough several weeks"" for Biden since his disastrous debate performance and that there has been ""some slippage in support."" But she argued that Biden still has a path to defeating Trump and that he will be out on the campaign trail next week once he recovers from Covid.
“You have heard from the president directly time and again. He is in this race to win and he is our nominee and he’s going to be our president for a second term,"" she said.Scott Wong is a senior congressional reporter for NBC News.

Delegates and guests attending the Republican National Convention (RNC) in Wisconsin are making predictions about President Biden's political future amid reports he is closer to exiting the 2024 presidential race.
Fox News Digital spoke with multiple RNC attendees outside Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, the site of the convention, and most felt Biden would ultimately drop his re-election bid but that it would matter little when the votes are finally counted.
""I think [former President] Trump's going to mop the floor with anybody they put up,"" one attendee said, adding that it seemed Biden was ""on the way out the door.""

""I don't think it really matters. I think whoever they have, their bench is kind of shallow and weak right now.""
Another attendee told Fox he felt vindicated after predicting months earlier Biden wasn't going to end up being the Democrat presidential nominee.
""I think Saturday may have changed things slightly, but I doubt it,"" he said, referencing the failed assassination attempt against Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania. ""The globalists have a mission. They don't care anymore about Joe Biden. … I don't think it matters who they run. I don't think they have a shot to win a legitimate election at this point.""

Others also predicted Biden would drop out, but some expressed hope he would stay in the race or thought that Democrats couldn't afford to dump him from the ticket so close to the election.
""They bet with him, and they keep telling us how far ahead in the polls he is, so they need to keep backing him all the way. I think it'd be disastrous if they change right now,"" she said.
""I think he understands, and his compatriots understand, he needs to drop out. So, I think he will. I have no idea who they're going to put up, you know, to replace him. I would hope it wouldn't be Kamala, but I have no idea,"" another said.

One attendee said it would be ""totally fine"" if Vice President Harris became the nominee or even California Gov. Gavin Newsom or former first lady Michelle Obama. ""The people, I think, are waking up to know that that's just not the party of the people anymore. So, it doesn't matter.""
The attendees also unanimously praised Trump's vice presidential running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, after his Wednesday convention speech, calling him ""empathetic,"" ""high energy"" and ""relatable.""

Reuters reported Thursday that Biden is now ""soul-searching"" about the future of his candidacy, citing sources familiar with the matter, while NBC News reported a source close to the president as saying, ""We’re close to the end.""

He said this would be the only time he would recount that day’s events because it was too painful to recount. The former president touched on many of his usual stump-speech themes — saying the world was teetering on the brink of World War III and, without evidence, accused opponents of “cheating on elections.” He also promised to finish the campaign strong. “Otherwise, we’ll blow it,” Trump added. “And we can’t let that happen.”"

6,NBC_7,How the Secret Service protects presidents — and what went wrong at the Trump rally,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-assassination-attempt-secret-service-rally-shooting-missteps-rcna162278,"It typically starts with a meeting with campaign staffers and usually ends without incident — a presidential candidate striding off stage and being whisked to the next stop on the campaign trail.
But the U.S. Secret Service’s advance planning for what outwardly seems like a routine political event is actually an intricate, multilayered process. It typically involves several specialized and senior agents strategizing, assessing and approving a detailed protection mission behind the scenes for days ahead of time, according to five former agents and one current one who have been directly involved in such planning.
For an outdoor campaign event, a comprehensive security plan put into place by the agency generally runs smoothly, said the former agents, some of whom spoke anonymously to discuss security practices. 
But last Saturday’s campaign rally that turned deadly in Butler Township, Pennsylvania — with multiple shots fired at former President Donald Trump and into a crowd, killing one man and critically wounding two others — underscores what can go wrong despite that detailed planning, the ex-agents said.
“There is no such thing as 100% security,” said Paul Eckloff, who served as a Secret Service agent for 22 years, including on details protecting Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Trump. “There will be vulnerabilities. You try to mitigate those as much as you possibly can. You monitor the things you can, and you plan for contingencies.”
Here’s how the Secret Service typically plans security for presidential candidate campaign events — along with the evident breakdowns in the plan at the Trump rally, according to the former agents.  
Planning usually begins with the Secret Service sending an advance team to scout the venue and meet with the candidate’s staff three to five days before an event, the former agents said. The advance team typically consists of a mix of agents with assigned tasks, including a designated lead and site agent, as well as special operations and technical agents, said Anthony Cangelosi, a former agent-turned-criminal justice college lecturer who was assigned to security details on several stops during Democrat John Kerry’s presidential campaign in 2004. 
Among other tasks, the advance team assesses the site for potential “vulnerabilities” and identifies the “assets” — meaning agents and equipment — needed to provide security, he said. The team also identifies where to stage a command post and where within the venue to assign agents, Cangelosi said.
The advance team designates the venue’s security perimeters, or zones, and assigns agents and supporting law enforcement personnel accordingly, he said. The inner perimeter is closest to the candidate or “protectee”; the middle perimeter, within the venue but farther away, is next; and then the outer perimeter.
The building the gunman scaled on Saturday was outside the inner security perimeter, though it was only about 148 yards from where Trump was speaking and well within range of the gunman’s rifle.
The building, owned by a glass research company, was noted as a “point of interest” in two advance security meetings, Butler Township’s manager said. Two people familiar with the planning told NBC News that the building was identified by the Secret Service as a vulnerability that required specific attention. 
The Secret Service typically assigns the more senior agents in a candidate’s personal detail  — or “shift” agents, as they’re called — to posts within the inner perimeter. The middle perimeter is often manned by agents who are pulled from local Secret Service field offices and assigned as “post-standers” responsible for securing specific and targeted areas, Cangelosi said.
The federal agency typically relies on local law enforcement officers, called “counterparts,” to assist with event security by assigning them to posts on the outer perimeter, the agents said.
Because of the Secret Service’s “limited resources and manpower, they have to rely on local counterparts to fulfill some of those outer perimeter posts,” said Michael Matranga, an agent for 12 years who served on several protective details safeguarding Obama.
A Secret Service spokesman has said that the agency designated the building the gunman used as being under the jurisdiction of local law enforcement, but a full picture has yet to emerge as to how the shooter was allowed to climb atop it to fire at Trump.
Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle told ABC News that local police were inside the building when the gunman scaled it, but a Secret Service official later told NBC News that a local SWAT team was inside another building in the same complex.
A former Secret Service official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that even if there weren’t enough people to cover the building, there were alternatives — such as putting a bus or tarp in front of the building to block the line of sight to where Trump was speaking.  
“It’s true there are finite assets, but you work within that,” the former official said. “Change the location of the rally, cover or block the roof, etc. This is just textbook.” 
Once threat assessments, venue vulnerabilities and agent assignments are drafted, the plan is shared with senior agents, each of whom can offer input and ask for changes before signing off, the agents said. Special operations and technical agents, such as the lead countersniper, separately draft their own plans for the event.
“They will have a countersniper advance, where a survey is done with plotting, mapping, pictures, quadrants, lines of sight, angles and lines of fire delineated,” Eckloff said.
Each countersniper is outfitted with rifles custom-built for them by the Secret Service, Eckloff said. Referred to as JARs — short for “just another rifle” — the weapons are “zeroed,” or set to ensure the accuracy of the sight, up to a day beforehand and can “neutralize a threat from as far as 1,000 yards away” — roughly the distance from the roof of the White House to base of the Washington Monument, he said.
A countersniper agent assigned to a campaign event typically is paired with another agent from the local field office who leads a “countersniper response team” tasked with checking out real-time issues that crop up during the event, Matranga said. If a countersniper assesses an immediate threat to life or bodily injury during the event, that agent can shoot to kill, he added.
“The policy at the Secret Service is we do not have a 'green-light system' where they need to seek authority,” Matranga said. “They do not need anybody’s permission to neutralize someone.”
But Cangelosi added that a countersniper likely won’t shoot unless they see a weapon, which might not readily be visible.
“If there’s no immediate threat, you’re not going to take a shot,” he said.
Cheatle released a statement after the shooting praising the countersniper team’s response. 
“Secret Service personnel on the ground moved quickly during the incident,” she said, “with our counter sniper team neutralizing the shooter and our agents implementing protective measures to ensure the safety of former president Donald Trump.” 
In the hours or days before the event, senior agents conduct three to four walk-throughs of the venue to assess the security plan, with the lead agent, the site agent, the field office supervisor and the candidate’s detail supervisor all given an opportunity to review the protective strategy and call for changes, Matranga said. Several team briefings and one-on-one discussions also are held, with supervisors quizzing post-standers and local counterparts to ensure each clearly understands their objectives and areas of responsibility, the former agents said.
Post-standers are agents deployed to their posts at least several hours before an event begins and before a bomb squad sweep of the venue, the agents said.
“Once an individual is posted, they have to maintain the integrity of that sweep,” said Matranga, who owns and runs a Texas-based security firm, M6 Global Defense. “If you walk off that post, you’ve now compromised the entire site, because that sweep has already been conducted.”
As soon as screening posts with metal detectors are opened to the public — typically several hours before an event begins — “it’s game time,” Eckloff said.
Planners typically designate a communications hub at each event site where supervisors field real-time reports over radio that can be immediately shared across multiple law enforcement radio frequencies as necessary. 
On Saturday, the gunman was photographed as a suspicious person more than an hour before he opened fire, and the Secret Service was notified about 10 minutes before Trump took the stage, three sources familiar with a Senate briefing on Wednesday told NBC News. The details of the real-time communications between law-enforcement agencies aren’t yet known. 
Every event gets its own confidential security plan shared only as needed, to make sure it doesn’t get out, Cangelosi said. Even if the same venue is used again during the campaign, the Secret Service plans security for each event from scratch, the agents said.
Breakdowns in security plans typically occur when someone “fails to execute their duties and responsibilities, or what we could call a weak link,” Cangelosi said. “When the chain is broken, it could be minor, it could be catastrophic.”
The attempt on Trump’s life has led to strong criticism of the Secret Service by law enforcement experts and politicians. It also set off a wave of finger-pointing across law enforcement agencies as to who was responsible for securing the building the gunman used. 
The Secret Service initially blamed local authorities, without naming specific agencies. Officials in Butler Township have since pushed back, crediting their police officers who were assigned to traffic control with racing to confront the gunman first, and the Secret Service has praised the officers who “ran towards danger.” 
One former agent who asked not to be named said the Secret Service “is always in charge” at such events “no matter what anyone says.”
“They make the plan,” the agent said. “Locals need to follow it, but it’s up to [the Secret Service] in every way to make sure that happens.”
Another agent still active with the Secret Service described security at such events as more of a “partnership,” but agreed responsibility for the plan is ultimately the agency’s.
The House Oversight Committee subpoenaed Cheatle to testify at a hearing next week as part of an investigation into the assassination attempt. The Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General also announced this week that it is reviewing “the process implemented” by the Secret Service to secure the  event. 
While no plan is perfect, Eckloff said the Secret Service’s advance planning techniques for campaign events represent a “flexible and adaptive mission model” that quickly incorporates lessons learned from events that go wrong.
In an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Cheatle committed to making changes to Secret Service policies if needed based on an internal review. 
Eckloff predicts that the failures at the Trump rally will lead to “a historical sea change” in terms of how security is done going forward.
“I do think you’ll see a huge effect,” said Eckloff, who surmised that immediate changes with the Secret Service’s security at campaign events are likely to include extended security perimeters and more manpower.
“They’re certainly not going to wait for the outcome of a congressional inquiry to make adjustments,” he said.Lewis Kamb is a national FOIA reporter for NBC News, based in Seattle.

6,CNN_68,Secret Service boosts and rethinks security for first Trump-Vance rally and campaign,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/secret-service-trump-vance-rally-security/index.html,"
            The US Secret Service is scrambling to increase security ahead of former President Donald Trump’s first campaign rally since the failed assassination attempt on his life last week, sources familiar with the planning told CNN.
    

            The security around Trump’s future rallies and events is being entirely rethought, including where they should be held – whether indoors or in more secure outdoor locations. Outdoor events for Trump like the one in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he was nearly assassinated, will likely be severely limited, sources said, if not entirely done away with.
    

            The ramp up in security reflects several new assessments by law enforcement since Saturday’s shooting, officials familiar with the assessments told CNN, including concern about a possible copycat incident and others who may be inspired to carry out another attack after seeing the previous one narrowly fail.

            Multiple people familiar with the planning for this weekend’s rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, at an indoor arena said that both Secret Service and local law enforcement have recently increased the number of officers who will work on securing the event.
    

            During a board of commissioners meeting on Thursday, Kent County, Michigan, Undersheriff Bryan Muir said the sheriff’s office was given a “last-minute request” from the Secret Service for 50 to 60 officers from the department to help with security for the rally.
    

            “We assist the Secret Service,” a spokesperson for the sheriff’s office told CNN, adding that the Secret Service was leading all security planning for the rally. “We just provide assistance.”
    

            The security apparatus around Trump has entirely changed in recent days, people familiar with the matter have told CNN, including through local law enforcement.
    

            An example of this increased security occurred late Thursday night and into Friday morning, when a New Jersey law enforcement helicopter circled the Newark airport dozens of times until Trump’s plane arrived and he was secured in his motorcade following his speech at the Republican National Convention.
    

            Security around Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence has also changed in recent days, with new road closures announced by the Palm Beach Police Department on Thursday which will last through the 2024 election.
    

            “Due to enhanced security measures involving Mar a Lago and U.S. Secret Service-protected persons, South Ocean Boulevard will be closed to through traffic,” the department said, adding that the closure around Mar-a-Lago would be “in effect 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, until the November general election at a minimum.”

            One source familiar with the security planning said the shooting will prompt numerous exercises between local and federal law enforcement agencies on how to handle large events, exercises that have been reduced since the Covid-19 pandemic. The source said the lack of these exercises have resulted in security gaps, including communication breakdowns between law enforcement partners.
    

            The source added that after-action reports, like those coming from last Saturday’s shooting, immediately change the way security is handled at similar future events, including how exits and entrances are protected, widening the buffer zone, and other public safety measures.
    

            Saturday’s rally in Grand Rapids will be the first official campaign rally with both Trump and Republican Vice Presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance.
    

            Asked if Michigan State Police would be involved in security for Saturday’s rally, director of communications Shanon Banner told CNN the department doesn’t discuss security procedures.
    

            “The Secret Service is responsible for the security planning for presidential visits, but we stand ready to assist them with whatever they need,” Banner wrote in an email.
    

            The Secret Service would not comment on security planning for the rally or Trump.

9,NBC_10,"Israeli settlements violate international law, U.N.'s top court says in a landmark opinion",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/icj-united-nations-israel-settlement-violate-international-law-rcna162667,"Policies and practices used by Israel in its occupation of Palestinian territories are in breach of international law, the United Nations' top court said in a landmark opinion Friday.
The International Court of Justice said in its opinion, which was read out by Judge Nawaf Salam, president of the world body, that Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as ""the regime associated with them"" were established and are being maintained in violation of international law. 
The ICJ said Israel should cease all new settlement activities and evacuate settlers from Palestinian territories. 
It further said that Israel systematically discriminated against Palestinians and branded the occupation of the territories as ""de facto annexation,"" and that Israel's exploitation of natural resources in the Palestinian territories likewise violate international law. 
Its “unlawful policies and practices” were “in breach of the Israeli government's obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination,” the court said. 
The International Court of Justice, which is based at The Hague in the Netherlands, had been looking into the legal consequences of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories following a request from the United Nations General Assembly.
The General Assembly had asked the court in January 2023, prior to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack and the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, to deliver an opinion on Israeli ""policies and practices"" toward Palestinians and on the legal status of the occupation of Palestinian territories, including the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza.
In a statement on Friday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed the ICJ's decision as “false,” saying that “The Jewish people are not conquerors in their own land,” referring to Jerusalem and the West Bank.
Benny Gantz, a more moderate Israeli politician and a former member of the war Cabinet, said the opinion “harms security and stability in the region,” and that Israel “will continue to defend ourselves against those who seek to destroy us.”
By contrast, the Palestinian Authority’s foreign affairs ministry called the opinion “a watershed moment,” adding that the ruling meant that the “international community is under an obligation not just to reaffirm the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination but to see to it that this right is implemented immediately.”
Mustafa Barghouti, general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative and a veteran Palestinian political activist, welcomed the ICJ’s opinion as a “great victory for the Palestinian people and a major blow to Israel.”
“No more excuses. The international community must force Israel to end the occupation,” B’Tselem, a Jerusalem-based nonprofit organization that documents human rights violations in the Palestinian territories, said in a statement Friday.
The court's advisory opinion is not legally binding, but it could have a significant political impact as Israel faces mounting backlash and isolation over its deadly military offensive in Gaza, where nearly 39,000 people, including thousands of children, have been killed since the war began, according to local health officials. 
It also comes just a day after Israel's parliament, the Knesset, voted overwhelmingly in favor of a resolution rejecting the establishment of a Palestinian state, despite growing pressure from the global community, including from the United States, which has for decades officially supported the idea of a two-state solution.
The ICJ's opinion Friday is separate from another ongoing case brought to the court by South Africa accusing Israel of committing genocide in its offensive in Gaza, an accusation both the U.S. and Israel have denied.  
The General Assembly had asked the ICJ to weigh in on the ""legal consequences arising from the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, from its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967.""
It also asked the court to give its opinion on how the policies and practice of Israel affected the ""legal status of the occupation"" and what the legal consequences might be ""for all States and the United Nations."" 
Israel occupied the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in 1967 during the Six-Day War. In 2005, faced with international and domestic pressure, Israel withdrew troops and thousands of Israeli settlers from Gaza, leaving the enclave to be governed by the Palestinian Authority while continuing its occupation of the West Bank and Jerusalem. 
In 2006, Hamas was elected into power, replacing the Palestinian Authority as Gaza's governing body. In response, Israel significantly tightened its control over Gaza’s borders, coastline and airspace, imposing a blockade that, for 17 years, has crippled Gaza's economy, with a widespread, devastating impact on Palestinian civilians' daily lives. Israel says that the blockade is required to ensure the safety of its population from Hamas.
Across the West Bank, hundreds of thousands of Israelis have built sweeping settlements, many of which have displaced Palestinian communities. The international community largely considers these settlements to be illegal. 
In March, Israel also approved the appropriation of nearly 5 square miles of land in the Jordan Valley, in the largest seizure of land in the West Bank in decades. U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric called the move “a step in the wrong direction,"" adding: “The direction we want to be heading is to find a negotiated two-state solution.”
Meanwhile, Israel's annexation of east Jerusalem, where the city's most sensitive holy sites are based, is not internationally recognized.
As an occupying power, Israel’s actions in the territories are expected to comply with rules under international law that govern occupation. 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously said Israel does not recognize the legitimacy of the discussions at the ICJ. He decried the case as part of a “Palestinian attempt to dictate the results” of a political agreement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict without negotiations.Chantal Da Silva reports on world news for NBC News Digital and is based in London."

The United Nation’s top court has ruled Israel’s settlements in the Palestinian territories are illegal, and they must be removed immediately.
""The State of Israel is under the obligation to bring an end to its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as rapidly as possible,"" ICJ President Nawaf Salam said when he delivered the court’s findings on Friday, stressing that the ""continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is illegal."" 
The opinion is merely advisory and is not legally binding. The court specifically aimed to provide its view on Israel’s policies and practices as well as the legal status of the settlements, the BBC reported. 
The court in May demanded Israel ""immediately halt its military offensive"" against Hamas in Rafah, the Palestinian terrorist group’s final stronghold in the Gaza Strip.

Incredibly, the court openly states it didn't need to find any specific facts in violation of international law before reaching its conclusions, including before making the slanderous claim that Israel is guilty of the crime against humanity of apartheid.

10,NBC_11,"Oil tankers on fire after colliding close to Singapore, crew rescued",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/oil-tankers-fire-collision-singapore-rcna162732,"SINGAPORE — Two large oil tankers were on fire on Friday after colliding near Singapore, the world’s biggest refuelling port, with two crew members airlifted to hospital and others rescued from life rafts, authorities and one of the tanker owners said.
Singapore is Asia’s biggest oil trading hub and the world’s largest bunkering port. Its surrounding waters are vital trade waterways between Asia and Europe and the Middle East and among the busiest global sea lanes.
The Singapore-flagged tanker Hafnia Nile and the Sao Tome and Principe-flagged tanker Ceres I were about 55 km (34 miles) northeast of the Singaporean island of Pedra Branca on the eastern approach to the Singapore Straits, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) said.
The 22 crew of the Hafnia Nile and the 40 on the Ceres I were all accounted for, the MPA said, which was alerted to the fire at 6:15 a.m. (2215 GMT)
The owner of Hafnia Nile confirmed the vessel was involved in a collision with Chinese owned Ceres I.
Photographs released by the Singapore Navy showed thick black smoke billowing from one tanker and crew being rescued from life rafts and flown to hospital.
The environmental authorities in neighbouring Malaysia said they had been told to prepare for potential oil spills.
Norway’s Gard, one of Hafnia Nile’s insurers, told Reuters it was too early to assess the environmental impact.
“We are supporting our member as they are dealing with the incident,” Gard said.
Navigational traffic had not been affected, although the status of the vessels or any pollution was unknown at present, a spokesperson at the UN’s International Maritime Organization (IMO) said.
“No aerial surveillance has been conducted so far,” the spokesperson said.
“Salvage and fire-fighting assets have been arranged by both vessel owners to support the fire-fighting efforts and subsequent towage of the vessels to safety.”
The IMO spokesperson said a salvage team had been appointed and was en route to the area.
The 74,000 deadweight-tons capacity panamax tanker Hafnia Nile was carrying about 300,000 barrels of naphtha, according to ship-tracking data from Kpler and LSEG.
The Ceres I is a very large crude carrier supertanker, which ship-tracking data last showed was carrying around 2 million barrels of Iranian crude.
“The Ceres I has been a boat that has gone dark many times over the years,” said Matt Stanley, head of market engagement EMEA & APAC with Kpler, referring to when vessels switch off their AIS tracking transponders.
Stanley said the last AIS signal the vessel transmitted around March indicated it was carrying Iranian crude, which the U.S. has tried to curtail, including imposing sanctions on ports, vessels and refineries involved in the trade.
“She was at anchorage (on Friday). We can be fairly sure that she was carrying Iranian crude and was going to China,” Stanley said.
S&P Global said in an April report that China buys around 90% of Iran’s crude exports, often at discounted prices.
The Ceres I has not moved since July 11, according to LSEG shipping data.
The area Ceres I is anchored in is known to be used by so-called dark fleet ships for the transfer of Iranian oil in contravention of U.S. sanctions, said Michelle Wiese Bockmann, principal analyst at Lloyd’s List Intelligence.
“The Ceres I has repeatedly been involved in transferring or shipping Iranian oil in breach of U.S. sanctions,” she said.
Shipping sources have said the tanker was also involved in transporting Venezuelan oil, which is also under U.S. sanctions, to China in recent years.
The China-based owner of the Ceres I could not immediately be reached for comment. China has repeatedly said it is opposed to unilateral sanctions.
Up to 850 oil tankers are estimated to operate the shadow fleet transporting oil from countries such as Iran and Venezuela as well as Russia, which has multiple restrictions on its oil exports.
Shipping industry officials have warned that safety issues are growing because of the ageing and unregulated vessels.
The Ceres I vessel was built in 2001 while the Hafnia Nile was built in 2017, shipping data showed. It was unclear who provided insurance for the Ceres I, which was not covered by top tier providers like Gard, according to other data.Reuters"

Sherrod Brown of Ohio called on President Joe Biden to end his re-election campaign Friday, becoming the fourth Democrat in the chamber to ask Biden to drop out of the race.
“Over the last few weeks, I’ve heard from Ohioans on important issues, such as how to continue to grow jobs in our state, give law enforcement the resources to crack down on fentanyl, protect Social Security and Medicare from cuts, and prevent the ongoing efforts to impose a national abortion ban,” Brown said in a written statement shared first with NBC News. “These are the issues Ohioans care about and it is my job to keep fighting for them.”
“I agree with the many Ohioans who have reached out to me,” Brown added. “At this critical time, our full attention must return to these important issues. I think the President should end his campaign.”
Brown’s call follows one Thursday from Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., who, like Brown, faces a tough re-election campaign this fall, and another Friday from Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., urged Biden to withdraw from the race last week. More than 30 congressional Democrats now want someone other than Biden to be their party’s presidential nominee.
The push for Biden to exit comes after a debate performance with Trump last month that raised alarms about the president’s age and health — and about his ability to lead the Democratic ticket this fall. The push has intensified in recent days, with speculation increasing about Vice President Kamala Harris and others stepping in for Biden.
Brown, according to his campaign, will not weigh in on the process to choose a new Democratic nominee and believes Biden should serve the rest of his term.
The three-term Ohio senator had previously said that voters in his state, which former President Donald Trump twice won by 8 percentage points, had “legitimate questions about whether the president should continue his campaign” and that he intended to listen to their concerns. But he had stopped short of calling for Biden to end his re-election bid. 
Brown’s Trump-endorsed Republican challenger, businessman Bernie Moreno, has been linking him closely to Biden’s struggles for weeks.
Moreno, reacting to Brown’s announcement later Friday, asserted that his opponent had not gone far enough.
“If Joe Biden is unfit to run, he is unfit to serve,” Moreno said in an emailed statement from his campaign. “I am formally calling on Joe Biden to resign the Presidency because his continued presence in the situation room is a national security threat.

42,WaPo_27,"3 takeaways from Trump’s speech, final night of the Republican convention",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/19/rnc-trump-speech-highlights/,"MILWAUKEE — Welcome to The Campaign Moment. This week, we’re running through the big moments and trends from the Republican National Convention.(Did a friend forward this to you, or are you seeing this on the website? If so, sign up for this newsletter here. And make sure to check out the Campaign Moment podcast.)The 2024 GOP convention came to a close Thursday night, with former president Donald Trump formally accepting his party’s nomination just five days after surviving an assassination attempt.But even that story wasn’t necessarily the biggest of Thursday, as the potential exit of the opponent Republicans had spent four days attacking — President Biden — loomed larger and larger.Here’s our final set of takeaways from the convention week that was.1. A tale of two Trump speeches: powerful and perplexingThe first 15 minutes of Trump’s speech were powerful, as he recounted Saturday’s assassination attempt.The rest of the more than 90-minute-long speech was thoroughly confusing. It meandered between points, often going off-script with ad-libs that left a standard-issue Trump campaign speech without the kind of coherent, lofty theme that defines traditional presidential convention fare. And Trump’s initially subdued manner and calls for unity didn’t match the content of an often-divisive speech.Trump grabbed the audience with a promise to discuss what happened Saturday, but qualified it by saying he would only do it once, “because it’s actually too painful to tell.”He celebrated slain firefighter Corey Comperatore and two others who were shot.Perhaps the most powerful moment came when Trump said, “I’m not supposed to be here tonight.” The crowd began chanting, “Yes you are!” Trump ultimately responded, “Thank you, but I’m not.”“Despite such a heinous attack, we unite this evening more determined than ever,” Trump wrapped up that section. “I am more determined than ever. So are you. So is everybody. … Our resolve is unbroken, and our purpose is unchanged.”Also unchanged: Virtually the rest of his speech, undifferentiated from a normal Trump stump speech.Despite the call for unity, Trump soon referred to “crazy Nancy Pelosi,” repeatedly cited false allegations of stolen elections, called for the firing of the head of the United Auto Workers, cited the “China virus” and the “invasion” at the Southern border. He called a Democratic senator a “total lightweight.” He even repeated a puzzling allusion to “the late, great Hannibal Lecter,” from “The Silence of the Lambs,” which he’s used before.All of it was familiar from Trump’s speeches — as was the extensive ad-libbing. But this wasn’t just any Trump speech. This was a different venue, his introduction to many more casual voters who might not eat up his many musings.The assassination attempt probably drew even more eyeballs to him, and it’s not clear what those new viewers took away, beyond that Trump was nearly killed five days ago.“So I’d better finish strong,” Trump said at one point. “Otherwise we’ll blow it. And we can’t let that happen.”2. Republicans trolled Democrats on replacing BidenAs Democrats appeared to inch closer to replacing their 2024 standard-bearer, Republicans decided now would be a good time to stir the pot.Previously, some high-profile Republicans made clear their preference for facing Biden and began attacking Vice President Harris more. But Wednesday, their move was to try to stoke Democratic divisions, casting any attempt to replace the nominee as a brazen and even undemocratic one.Top Trump campaign adviser Chris LaCivita, at a CNN/Politico event, called it an attempted “coup” and an effort to “depose” Biden “that’s going to create a whole host of different issues.”At another event, former Trump acting director of national intelligence Richard Grenell called efforts to switch nominees “outrageous” and urged the media to declare that “you don’t get to dump this [president]. This is what happens in other countries, not in America.”On X, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) labeled it an “insurrection.”None of these descriptions actually fit; Democrats are trying to persuade Biden to drop out, not overturn the primary results themselves. But as the Biden loyalists get a little quieter, there’s certainly value for Republicans in framing things this way in hopes of riling them (or perhaps even Biden) up.At the very least, Republicans seemed to be having some fun trolling Democrats over their discord.3. They leaned in on the assassination attempt — and maybe God’s favoritismTrump wasn’t the only one to focus extensively on the assassination attempt.Speakers repeatedly pitched it and Trump’s response as evidence of Trump’s resolve, courage — and possibly even God’s will that he be president.Eric Trump focused on it, calling Trump “a man who survived a bullet that was intended to eliminate him permanently from our future and from our family.”“You wiped the blood off your face,” Eric Trump said. “And you put your fist in the air, in a moment that will be remembered as one of the most courageous acts in the history of American politics.”Trump lawyer Alina Habba said Trump “did not just take a bullet in Butler, Pennsylvania. He has and will continue to take them for each and every one of us.”While other Trump supporters have posited that God intervened to save Trump, a couple of speakers seemed to go a little further to suggest it showed God’s favoritism.Evangelical leader Franklin Graham, unlike many others pointing to possible divine intervention, noted that firefighter Corey Comperatore was not spared.“I cannot explain why God would save one life and allow another one to be taken,” Graham said. “I don’t have the answer for that.”Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson suggested that he did have that answer.“When he stood up after being shot in the face, bloodied, and put his hand up, I thought at that moment that was a transformation. This was no longer a man. Well, I think that I think it was divine intervention,” Carlson said, adding: “This was the leader of a nation.”Carlson added: “I think a lot of people are wondering, what is this? This doesn’t look like politics. Something bigger is going on here. I think even people who don’t believe in God are beginning to think, well, maybe there’s something to this, actually.”"
48,FOX_27,Washington Post deletes 'unacceptable' post scolding American hostage parents for not being critical of Israel,https://www.foxnews.com/media/washington-post-deletes-post-scolding-american-hostage-parents-not-being-critical-israel,"Orna and Ronen Neutra, the parents of an American held hostage in Gaza, address the Republican National Convention.
The Washington Post came under fire after it scolded the parents of an American hostage in Gaza for not publicly criticizing Israel's ""assault"" there and admitted Friday that its social media post was ""unacceptable.""
""Omer Neutra has been missing since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. When his parents speak publicly, they don't talk about Israel's assault on Gaza that has killed over 38,000 Palestinians, according to local officials. Experts have warned of looming famine,"" the Post wrote on X. 
The post linked to an interview the paper conducted with Omer's parents, Orna and Ronen Neutra, ahead of their speech on day three of the Republican National Convention.
The Post's social media post attracted fierce criticism before the paper took it down hours later.
In another X post published Friday morning, the paper explained that it deleted the initial post because it had ""mischaracterized the efforts of Neutra’s parents."" The paper followed up hours later with a more thorough explanation.
""A previous post referencing the below story was unacceptable and did not meet our editorial standards, and The Post has deleted it. The reporter of the story was not involved in crafting the tweet. We have taken the appropriate action regarding this incident,"" The Post wrote on X.
Omer, 22, grew up in Long Island, New York, and was a dual American-Israeli citizen serving in the Israel Defense Forces. He is believed to have been abducted by Hamas on October 7 during its horrific terrorist attack.

A new version of the original post now reads, ""Omer Neutra, an American hostage in the Israel-Hamas war, has been missing since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. His parents have mounted a relentless effort to get him released, speaking to anyone who might be able to support their cause.""
While the social media post was taken down, a similar paragraph remains in the body of the full story posted on the Post's website.
""When the Neutras speak publicly, they don’t talk about the ferocity of Israel’s counterattack, which has killed more than 38,000 Palestinians and left nearly 90,000 injured, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Swaths of the territory have been pulverized and international experts have warned of looming famine,"" the article reads.
Immediately after this graph, the Post quotes the Neutras expressing empathy for Gazans.

""What’s happening in Gaza is ‘horrible,’ Orna said, but Hamas could end it by releasing the hostages. Ronen echoed that sentiment: Hamas is ‘not only holding hostage our son, they’re also holding hostage the people of Gaza,’"" the story continues.
The Post referred Fox News Digital to its statements on X when reached for comment.
The paper has come under fire from Jewish groups for its reporting on the war in Gaza since the Hamas terror attack last October.
An antisemitism nonprofit accused the paper of ""aligning"" itself with pro-terrorist groups since the October 7 attacks after publishing a sympathetic story in April about individuals who'd lost their jobs for defending Hamas.

50,FOX_26,"5 more House Democrats call on Biden to drop out, third US senator",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/5-more-house-democrats-call-biden-drop-out,"WSJ editorial page assistant editor James Freeman joined 'America's Newsroom' to react to the report as the president faces growing calls to step aside. 
Five more House Democrats on Friday joined the growing number of congressional lawmakers who have called on President Biden to drop out of the 2024 election. 
In a joint statement, Reps. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., Marc Veasey, D-Texas, Chuy Garcia, D-Illinois and Marc Pocan, D-Wisc., urged Biden to ""pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders."" 
""Mr. President, with great admiration for you personally, sincere respect for your decades of public service and patriotic leadership, and deep appreciation for everything we have accomplished together during your presidency, it is now time for you to pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders,"" the lawmakers wrote.

""We must defeat Donald Trump to save our democracy, protect our alliances and the rules-based international order, and continue building on the strong foundation you have established over the past four years,"" they said.
""At this point, however, we must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign. These perceptions may not be fair, but they have hardened in the aftermath of last month's debate and are now unlikely to change. We believe the most responsible and patriotic thing you can do in this moment is to step aside as our nominee while continuing to lead our party from the White House.""
Veasey is the first member of the Congressional Black Caucus, a group that has strongly backed Biden, to call for the president to step aside.

A fifth House Democrat, Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, separately urged Biden to drop out in an op-ed for the Chicago Tribune. 
""It’s time for Joe Biden to pass the torch,"" Casten wrote.
""[P]olitics, like life, isn’t fair. And as long as this election is instead litigated over which candidate is more likely to be held accountable for public gaffes and ‘senior moments,’ I believe that Biden is not only going to lose but is also uniquely incapable of shifting that conversation.""
Additionally, Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., on Friday called on Biden to suspend his presidential campaign. He is now the third Democratic senator to do so. 
""While the decision to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden's alone, I believe it is in the best interests of our country for him to step aside,"" Heinrich said in a statement.

There are now 28 Congressional Democrats who have called on Biden to step aside. That number represents more than 10% of elected Democrats in Congress. 
Behind the scenes, more and more Democratic party officials, top donors and key Biden allies are reportedly urging the president to reconsider his decision to stay in the race. Should Biden drop out ahead of the Democratic National Committee convention in August, Vice President Kamala Harris is acknowledged to be in the best position to receive the party's nomination — although some Democrats fear she would also lose to Trump and prefer that a candidate unaffiliated with the current administration be nominated in an open convention.
Biden has made no public indication that he intends to step aside, and his campaign has forcefully denied all suggestions to the contrary.

""Absolutely the president is in this race, you’ve heard him say that time and again,"" Biden Campaign Chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said Friday on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" 
""I’m not here to say this hasn’t been a tough several weeks for the campaign, there’s no doubt that it has been, and we’ve definitely seen some slippage in support. But it has been a small movement.""

50,WaPo_152,"Twelve more Democrats, including two senators, call on Biden to drop out",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/19/democrats-biden-withdraw-clash/,"REHOBOTH BEACH, Del. — Two senators were among a flood of at least a dozen Democrats who called on President Biden to drop out of the presidential race Friday — the largest single-day wave of lawmakers asking him to step aside since his disastrous debate performance last month.Sens. Sherrod Brown (Ohio) and Martin Heinrich (N.M.) and 10 House members on Friday added their names to the rapidly growing list of Democrats worried that Biden was on track to lose the election to Republican nominee Donald Trump. But the president’s campaign reiterated in no uncertain terms that he would be staying put.The tense standoff between the president and his party set up a pivotal clash that is expected to intensify this weekend and could reach its culmination next week. The increasingly intense impasse between supporters and skeptics of the president suggests there is no end in sight to the Democratic infighting that has surrounded Biden’s candidacy as both sides have grown more dug-in and willing to allow the standoff to play out in public.“I think the President should end his campaign,” Brown said in a statement Friday. Heinrich, hailing from a traditionally Democratic state aides fear has suddenly become competitive, called on Biden to “step aside” for the good of the country.The president’s aides remained defiant in the face of the biggest threat to his candidacy so far.“He’s not going anywhere,” Biden campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” saying the president was “absolutely’ committed to continuing his campaign. She called him the “best person to take on Donald Trump” and suggested that the growing angst among top Democrats about Biden’s candidacy does not reflect the broader sentiment across the party.Less than two hours after O’Malley Dillon’s appearance, four House Democrats released a joint statement calling on Biden to “pass the torch,” the broadest collective effort from Congress thus far — and a move some officials said was representative of a larger, growing groundswell against Biden among lawmakers that could erupt into view if Biden does not step aside over the weekend. By the end of the day, the 12 additional Democratic lawmakers who called on Biden to step aside Friday marked the highest total of any day since such calls began July 2.“We must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign,” Reps. Jared Huffman (Calif.), Marc Veasey (Tex.), Jesús “Chuy” García (Ill.) and Mark Pocan (Wis.) told Biden in the joint statement.The push highlighted an unmistakably ramped-up push in Congress to oust the president from the ticket. Lawmakers including Reps. Gabe Vasquez (N.M.), Betty McCollum (Minn.), Zoe Lofgren (Calif.) and Morgan McGarvey (Ky.) added their names to a fast-growing list. The total number of congressional Democrats urging the president to bow out has now risen past 35, more than 12 percent of all Democrats in Congress.It is clear the diverse group of Democratic stakeholders are seeing this moment very differently. Some people close to Biden are urging Democrats to give him the time and space to end his candidacy on his own, to end his half-century of political life with grace. Other Democrats say they have spent weeks giving the president every opportunity to leave with dignity on his own terms, only to see them all rebuffed.Yet others are fully backing the president’s continued candidacy. O’Malley Dillon has told campaign aides privately that recent reports that Biden is considering imminently dropping out of the race are far removed from reality, according to a person familiar with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Top White House adviser Anita Dunn has echoed that sentiment, giving some campaign aides confidence that Biden remains committed to being the Democratic nominee even as he appears to be losing the confidence of significant portions of his party.Yet the pressure to push Biden aside was only intensifying Friday ahead of what some officials described as a crucial weekend, given that the Democratic National Convention is a month away — and the party is planning a virtual nominating process sooner to lock in the nominee.That has fostered a “now or never” mood on Capitol Hill, with multiple lawmakers discussing a public effort to oust Biden from the race. A new Political Action Committee called Pass the Torch announced Friday that it was launching ads in Washington and Rehoboth Beach, Del., urging Biden to end his reelection bid. A group of Democratic delegates gathered via Zoom on Friday to discuss how an open convention would work.All the while, Biden remained behind closed doors at his home in Rehoboth Beach, where he is self-isolating after testing positive earlier this week for the coronavirus and experiencing mild symptoms. In a statement Friday, Biden said he planned to return to the campaign trail next week.“The stakes are high, and the choice is clear,” Biden said in the statement, a response to Trump’s speech at the Republican National Convention on Thursday. “Together, we will win.”Biden’s doctor said Friday that the president continues to experience a loose cough and hoarseness, though his vital signs are normal and his symptoms have improved. Meanwhile, his political standing appears to be worsening. In a sign that Biden is planning to move forward with his bid for a second term, he plans to join comedian David Letterman for a July 29 fundraiser at the home of Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, a according to a person familiar with the planning. Yahoo News reported the planned fundraiser earlier.The makeup of the four lawmakers behind Friday’s joint statement is significant, since they are all members of larger groups that have expressed support for Biden. Pocan is the former chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which has largely stuck with Biden. Garcia is a member of the Hispanic Caucus, whose fundraising arm endorsed Biden on Friday. Veasey is a member of the Black Caucus, whose leadership has also stood with the president.“Passing the torch would fundamentally change the trajectory of the campaign,” they wrote.Both Huffman and Veasey directly raised concerns to the president about his ability to win during separate calls that lawmakers held with Biden last weekend.Heinrich suggested Biden could not win against Trump. “The return of Donald Trump to the White House poses an existential danger to our democracy,” he said. “We must defeat him in November, and we need a candidate who can do that.”Heinrich is running for reelection in New Mexico, a state that Biden won by 11 points in 2020, but aides say the presidential race is tied in the state.More lawmakers are expected to follow suit in coming days, as polls appear to be solidifying with Biden trailing Trump in important battleground states. That would create the spectacle of a party torn apart and publicly at war with its leader, but a growing number of Democrats are concluding there could be little alternative.“There’s been a gradual shift — it may be accelerating somewhat — with a few more obviously, speaking publicly, and a good number privately,” said one senator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations with colleagues and the White House. “I think also the mood in the White House or the campaign also seems to be shifting somewhat, so I think the two trends are complementary.”But, publicly, Biden’s team is showing no sign of shifting.On Friday, Biden campaign aides pointed to support the president had received from key figures including liberal lawmakers such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). During a lengthy Instagram Live session Thursday night, Ocasio-Cortez told supporters that ousting Biden would lead to chaos and harm the party’s chances of defeating Trump. Sanders, speaking on “Morning Joe” offered a full-throated endorsement of Biden, saying the president could help Democrats win “in a big way.”Campaign officials said they were planning multiple press events and volunteer events in the coming days, aiming to showcase that Biden’s candidacy was forging ahead.The campaign also touted Friday’s endorsement of Biden by BOLD PAC, the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. The group said in a statement that Biden and Vice President Harris “have delivered for the Latino community.”But not all members of the PAC or the Hispanic Caucus are supportive of Biden remaining at the top of the Democratic ticket. Reps. Raúl Grijalva (Ariz.), Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (Wash.), Garcia (Ill.) and Mike Levin (Calif.) are among House Democrats who have called for the president to leave the race. The group had agreed to endorse Biden before Biden’s debate performance on June 27, which rocked the president’s candidacy after he struggled to complete his sentences, according to multiple people familiar with the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.Members of BOLD PAC, which includes a majority of Hispanic Democrats in Congress, were only alerted shortly before the release went out.More House Democrats are in discussions about how and when to publicly call on Biden to step down. Some believe there is no need to participate in sinking an already waterlogged ship, others want to give Biden the weekend and still more, like the four who jointly spoke out Friday, believe it is important to keep up the pressure.In the Senate, a group of Democrats is also discussing whether to come forward as a group to call on Biden to step aside. They are also discussing the timing — whether to do it after the weekend or sooner, according to three people familiar with the discussions.The mood among Democratic senators has shifted against Biden’s candidacy just in the last few days, according to multiple senior aides. Last week, Democratic senators were divided. But as new polling has shown that states he easily won in 2020, including New Mexico and Virginia, are now essentially tied, Democrats are increasingly fearing they could lose if Biden heads the ticket.Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), who is in a tough reelection in a conservative state, added his name to the calls to withdraw on Thursday.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and his lieutenants spent the week continuing to hear from concerned members. They have not warned members against coming out against Biden, as they did in the days immediately after the debate. Instead, they are telling their colleagues to do what is best for their campaigns.Jeffries told reporters Friday he was continuing to support Biden as “our nominee,” though his remarks were little changed from previous public comments, in which he has suggested the president needs to make a decision about his candidacy.Some in the president’s orbit suggest the mounting pressure campaign is counterproductive.“Message to everyone trying to affect the president’s decision about whether to pass the torch: GIVE JOE BIDEN THE SPACE & TIME TO PROCEED AT HIS OWN PACE.” Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard Law School who has spoken to Biden since the debate, wrote on X on Friday. “Stop pressuring the man. He has earned the right to your respect.”The debate over Biden’s candidacy became even more tense in the aftermath of the Republican National Convention, which ended with a lengthy, meandering and at times dark speech by Trump. The display convinced several Democratic officials that Trump could be beaten if the party has the right candidate.“Donald Trump’s dark vision for the future is not who we are as Americans,” Biden said in a statement after the speech. “Together, as a party and as a country, we can and will defeat him at the ballot box.”Many in the party remain unconvinced. The 30-second ads by Pass the Torch feature Democratic voters in Pennsylvania urging Biden to step aside. Delegates Are Democracy, another newly formed group, held a Zoom for delegates to the Democratic National Convention to inform them how an open primary would work if Biden were to step aside.Elaine Kamarck, an expert on presidential nominations and a member of the Democratic National Committee, told the gathered delegates that if Biden were to bow out of the race, the road to an open convention could be fast-moving and “fascinating.”“Basically, think of it as a redo of the primary system in a very, very, very compressed period of time,” she said.Caldwell reported from Washington and Sotomayor from Milwaukee.

65,CNN_9,Fact-checking night 4 of the Republican National Convention,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/18/politics/fact-checking-night-4-republican-national-convention-trump/index.html,"
            The final night of the Republican National Convention has kicked off in Milwaukee. President Donald Trump is expected to speak later in the evening.
    

            CNN’s Facts First team is fact checking the program, and this story will be updated throughout the night.
    

            Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed at the Republican National Convention Thursday that the US-Mexico border was “closed” during Donald Trump’s presidency.
    

Facts first: Pompeo’s claim is false. 


            While Trump tightened the border during his tenure, illegal crossings into the US from Mexico still numbered in the tens of thousands each month leading up to when he left office. At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Trump administration limited non-essential travel on the US-Mexico border and prohibited migrants from crossing it in an effort to mitigate the spread of the virus. President Joe Biden later extended the restrictions.
    

            The former president’s biggest effort to “close” the border was met with resistance by federal courts, and the Supreme Court later gave Biden the green light to end the controversial “Remain in Mexico” policy.
    

From CNN’s Devan Cole


            For the fourth straight night, the Republican National Convention played a video in which former President Donald Trump urged Republicans to use “every appropriate tool available to beat the Democrats,” including voting by mail. Trump relentlessly disparaged mail-in voting during the 2020 election, falsely claiming it was rife with fraud, and he has continued to sharply criticize it during the current campaign
    

            But Trump’s comments in the convention video also included some of his regular false claims about elections. After claiming he would “once and for all secure our elections” as president, Trump again insinuated the 2020 election was not secure, saying, “We never want what happened in 2020 to happen again.” And he said, “Keep your eyes open, because these people want to cheat and they do cheat, and frankly, it’s the only thing they do well.”
    

Facts First: Trump’s claims are nonsense – slightly vaguer versions of his usual lies that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen and that Democrats are serial election cheaters. The 2020 election was highly secure; Trump lost fair and square to Joe Biden by an Electoral College margin of 306 to 232; there is no evidence of voter fraud even close to widespread enough to have changed the outcome in any state; and there is no basis for claiming that election cheating is the only thing at which Trump’s opponents excel.


            The Trump administration’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security, said in a post-election November 2020 statement: “The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history.”

            Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday evening that under former President Donald Trump’s administration, “not a single Chinese spy balloon flew across” the US.
    

            “We’d begun on an honorable exit from Afghanistan, and not a single Chinese spy balloon flew across the United States of America,” Pompeo said.
    

Facts First: The claim that there were no spy balloons under Trump is false.


            Three suspected Chinese spy balloons transited over the continental US during the Trump administration, but they were not discovered until after President Joe Biden took office. Gen. Glen VanHerck, then commander of US Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command, said in 2023 that a “domain awareness gap” allowed the balloons to travel undetected.

            Linda McMahon, who served in the Trump administration as the Small Business Administrator, suggested at the Republican National Convention Thursday that China paid the tariffs that the former president put on roughly $300 billion of Chinese-made goods. “Instead of taxing American companies, Donald Trump put tariffs on China that raised billions of dollars and protected American industries,” she said.
    

Facts First: This characterization of Trump’s tariffs is misleading. 


            It’s true that Trump’s tariffs on China raised billions of dollars for the US government, but the duties were paid by US companies – not China.
    

Study after study, including one from the federal government’s bipartisan US International Trade Commission (USITC), has found that Americans have borne almost the entire cost of Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products.
    

            Once an importing company pays the tariff, it can decide to eat the cost or pass all or some of it to the buyer of its goods – whether that’s a retailer or a consumer.
    

            Many economists agree that tariffs act as a tax on American consumers.
    

            “A tariff is just a form of a tax,” Erica York, a senior economist and research director at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, told CNN earlier this year.


            Tariffs can benefit some companies by raising the prices of competing foreign-made goods, but the duties can hurt other companies by raising component parts they need to manufacture.
    

            For example, Trump’s tariffs were imposed, in part, to boost the US manufacturing sector – but that industry lost jobs.
    

Federal Reserve economists found a net decrease in manufacturing employment due to the tariffs in 2019. That’s mostly because goods became more expensive to US consumers. Plus, retaliatory tariffs put on American-made goods made other US manufacturers less competitive when selling abroad.
    

From CNN’s Katie Lobosco


            A video played on the final night of the Republican National Convention tried to attack President Joe Biden by featuring quotes from then-candidate Ronald Reagan’s famous rhetorical questions about the President Jimmy Carter era at a presidential debate against Carter in 1980.
    

            At one point, the video featured Reagan’s voice asking if, compared to four years ago, “Is America as respected throughout the world as it was?” On-screen text answered the question with the words “allies no longer trust the United States,” attributing them to a September 2021 article in Foreign Affairs magazine.
    

Facts First: This quote is misleading. The article in Foreign Affairs didn’t actually declare that allies no longer trust the United States. Rather, the article noted that “critics of President Joe Biden” make the “claim” that allies no longer trust the US after Biden’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan – but the article then went on to argue that “these concerns about credibility are overblown.”


            The convention video also featured Reagan’s voice asking, “Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago?” But if you go back precisely four years from the most recent unemployment rate, the answer is: less unemployment. The current unemployment rate is 4.1% for June 2024; four years prior, in June 2020, the unemployment rate was 11.0% amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
    

            There is a reasonable basis for this part of the video, though, if you interpret “four years ago” more broadly to refer to any time in 2020. Before the pandemic, in the first two months of 2020, the unemployment rates were 3.6% and 3.5%.

            A Seattle police officer has been fired over the “dehumanizing laughter” and “cruel comments” he made after the 2023 death of an Indian graduate student who was struck by a police vehicle, the police chief says.
    

            Seattle interim Police Chief Sue Rahr terminated former officer Daniel Auderer on Wednesday and justified her decision to the department in an internal email, attaching the department’s disciplinary action report alongside it.
    

            “There is no doubt that the named officer’s cruel comments and callous laughter about the tragic death caused deep pain to Ms. Kandula’s family, but also immeasurable damage to the public trust of police in the Seattle community, across the nation, and around the world,” Rahr wrote in the internal memo, noting many in the community said Auderer’s “dehumanizing laughter” heard on video was “more outrageous and disturbing” even than Kandula’s death.
    

            “It is my duty as the leader of this organization to uphold the high standards necessary to maintain public trust,” Rahr wrote. “For me to allow the officer to remain on our force would only bring further dishonor to the entire department.”
    

            On January 23, 2023, Jaahnavi Kandula, a 23-year-old graduate student from Andhra Pradesh, India, was fatally struck by Seattle Police Officer Kevin Dave’s police patrol vehicle while she on a crosswalk. Eight months after the incident, police released body-worn police camera footage that captured a phone conversation in which Auderer, the day after he was sent to the scene to examine if the officer whose vehicle hit her had been impaired, can be heard laughing, saying Kandula’s life had “limited value.”

            “But she is dead,” Auderer says on the body-worn camera footage, apparently in response to the person on the phone.
    

            “No, it’s a regular person,” Auderer then says. Moments later, he replies: “Yeah, just write a check” and laughs.
    

            “Yeah, $11,000. She was 26 anyway,” he adds, mistaking Kandula’s age. “She had limited value.”
    

            CNN has reached out to Auderer for comment but did not immediately receive a response.
    

            The video’s release last year sparked outrage across the nation, especially within the South Asian diaspora – inspiring rallies, meetings with elected officials and online petitions demanding justice for Kandula. It also grabbed the attention of onscreen celebrities like Priyanka Chopra, Farhan Akhtar and Lilly Singh, who posted online about her death.
    

            Auderer, who is also vice president of the Seattle Police Officers Guild, “intended the comment as a mockery of lawyers,” he wrote in an August 8 letter to the city’s Office of Police Accountability released by the Seattle Police Officers Guild. “I was imitating what a lawyer tasked with negotiating the case would be saying and being sarcastic to express that they shouldn’t be coming up with crazy arguments to minimize the payment.”
    

            CNN has reached out to the Seattle Police Officers Guild for comment.
    

            “I believe the impact of his actions is so devastating that it cannot be mitigated by his intent to keep his conversation private,” Rahr wrote in her email to the police department. “The hurt his words have inflicted on Ms. Kandula’s family cannot be erased.”
    

            “The actions (of) this individual police officer have brought shame on the Seattle Police Department and our entire profession, making the job of every police officer more difficult,” she continued.
    

            The body-worn camera footage was provided to the King County Prosecutor’s Office as part of the fatality case, according to Rahr. The office announced in February it would not file criminal charges against Dave – whose patrol vehicle struck Kandula – saying it “lacks sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Officer Kevin Dave was impaired by drugs or alcohol, driving in a reckless manner, or driving with disregard for the safety of others.”
    

            The city’s Office of Police Accountability recommended in January that Auderer be terminated following an investigation that found the officer violated the department’s standards and duties policy and bias-free policing policy, a spokesperson told CNN.
    

            Kandula was from the Kurnool District in Andhra Pradesh and spoke Telugu, the president of the Telugu Association of North America, Niranjan Srungavarapu, previously told CNN. The group helped return her remains to India in January, he said.
    

            She had come to the United States in 2021 to pursue a master’s degree in information systems in the College of Engineering at Northeastern University’s Seattle campus, according to the school. She would have graduated in December.
    

            “Jaahnavi, a young soul full of dreams and hopes, came to the United States with the aspiration to pursue her master’s degree and be a beacon of support for her family,” the association said in a statement to its Seattle community and members. “Her future was a shining light, cruelly extinguished.”

66,NYT_1,Seattle Police Officer Fired Over ‘Cruel Comments’ About Pedestrian’s Death,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/us/seattle-police-jaahnavi-kandula-death.html,"A Seattle police officer was fired on Wednesday for his “cruel comments” and “callous laughter” about a pedestrian who was struck and killed by a police vehicle last year, the city’s interim police chief said.
The officer, Daniel Auderer, who is also a vice president of the city’s police union, unintentionally recorded himself laughing as he discussed the 2023 death of the woman, Jaahnavi Kandula, 23, soon after a speeding police S.U.V. driven by another Seattle officer hit her. She later died.
Mr. Auderer’s comments, which included saying that Ms. Kandula’s life had “limited value,” were recorded by his body camera.
The release of the video and his comments drew public outcry and protests in Seattle and India, where Ms. Kandula, who was a graduate student at Northeastern University’s Seattle campus, was born.Seattle’s interim police chief, Sue Rahr, explained her decision to terminate Officer Auderer in an email sent to the department on Wednesday evening. Chief Rahr said she took the unusual step of sharing the reasoning because the officer’s actions had far-reaching impact.
“Your comments here were so derogatory, hurtful and damaging to community trust that this case is unique, both in terms of the inhumanity of your comments and laughter and in the devastating impact they have had,” she said.

            An explosion near the US Embassy branch office in Tel Aviv that killed at least one person early Friday is being investigated as a possible drone attack, according to Israeli authorities.
    

            The blast, which occurred in a central district home to a number of diplomatic missions, killed a 50-year-old man and injured at least eight others, Israel’s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service said. Four people sustained shrapnel wounds, it added.
    

            The blast occurred about 100 meters (330 feet) from the compound of the US Embassy branch office, according to a CNN analysis of open-source satellite imagery of the scene.
    

            The United States is closely monitoring the situation, a government official told CNN, acknowledging that an explosion happened near the branch office. It does not appear that the building was damaged, another US official said.
    

            The Israel Defense Forces said it is looking into reports that it was an aerial attack, possibly from a drone. Police officers and bomb disposal experts are on the scene, according to Israeli police.
    

            Emergency crews responded to an “an object” that had exploded on Shalom Aleichem Street, the MDA said.
    

            “The dead man had suffered penetrating injuries,” MDA paramedic Roi Klein said.
    

            Police urged local residents “not to touch any rocket remnants that may contain explosives.”
    

            “Following the incident of an explosion in the Tel Aviv area, large police forces have arrived at the scene and are working to secure the area and conduct searches for suspicious objects and additional threats,” the Israeli Police spokesperson’s unit said.

            Yemen’s Houthi rebels on Friday claimed responsibility for a deadly drone blast in Tel Aviv, the Iranian proxy group’s latest attack in what it says is a response to Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza.
    

            The explosion in a central district home to a number of diplomatic missions, including a US Embassy branch office, killed a 50-year-old man and injured at least 10 others, according to Israeli emergency officials and police.
    

            Houthi spokesperson Yahya Sare’e said the “significant military operation” was successfully carried out with a new drone capable of “bypassing the enemy’s interception systems.”
    

            “We will continue to strike these targets in response to the enemy’s massacres and daily crimes against our brothers in the Gaza Strip,” Sare’e said. “Our operations will only cease when the aggression stops and the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted.”
    

            CNN cannot independently confirm the Houthi spokesperson’s claim.
    

            The drone that caused the explosion was detected by an Israeli aerial defense system, but not intercepted due to “human error,” an Israeli military official said.
    

            The drone was armed with a “warhead” and crashed into an apartment building, the official added, without providing further details of the device’s payload.
    

            The official did not confirm whether the drone was launched by the Houthis.
    

            The Israeli military is investigating the attack and does not believe further threats are imminent, the official said.
    

            According to an initial inquiry “no sirens were activated” during the incident, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said earlier, adding that the air force had increased air patrols in response to the incident.
    

            The blast occurred about 100 meters (330 feet) from the compound of the US Embassy branch office, according to a CNN analysis of open-source satellite imagery of the scene.
    

            There was no damage to the US diplomatic mission and no reports of injuries of US personnel or “locally engaged staff,” the US State Department said.
    

            “We are in close contact with Israeli authorities to fully investigate the source of the explosion and its intended target,” the spokesperson said, adding the embassy in Jerusalem and the branch in Tel Aviv are ready to provide consular assistance to US citizens.
    

            Emergency crews responded to an “an object” that had exploded on Shalom Aleichem Street, Israel’s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service said.
    

            “The dead man had suffered penetrating injuries,” MDA paramedic Roi Klein said.

            The Houthis have been attacking US targets and commercial shipping in the Red Sea since Israel launched its invasion of Gaza following Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel that killed more than 1,200 people and saw more than 250 others kidnapped.

The shipping industry is sounding the alarm as another vessel sinks in the Red Sea


            Israel’s air and ground offensive on Gaza has killed more than 38,000 people in the enclave, according to Palestinian authorities. The war has displaced almost all of the strip’s population of more than 2 million people, turned swaths of the territory into rubble and triggered a massive humanitarian crisis.
    

            The war has also raised fears of a wider regional conflict, with the potential consequences of further human suffering and shocks to the global economy. The Houthi attacks in the Red Sea for instance have forced some of the world’s biggest shipping and oil companies to suspend transit through one of the most important maritime trade routes.
    

            The drone attack in Tel Aviv Friday comes after the Houthis claimed earlier this month that they had targeted ships in the Israeli port of Haifa with a number of drones in joint military operations with Iran-backed militias based in Iraq.
    

            The IDF told CNN at the time that it was not aware of such an incident.

78,WaPo_49,Yemen’s Houthis claim drone strike near U.S. Embassy branch in Tel Aviv,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/18/us-embassy-tel-aviv-explosion/,"TEL AVIV — A surprise drone attack in the heart of Israel’s most populous city killed one and injured at least five people early Friday, shattering windows and setting off alarms just yards from the U.S. Embassy branch office. The Iranian-backed Houthi group in Yemen claimed responsibility for the strike, which evaded Israel’s expansive air defense network and spiked concerns of wider regional violence during the Gaza war.An Israel Defense Forces spokesman said the explosion was caused by an Iranian-made drone possibly launched from Yemen, according to early unconfirmed analysis. The IDF said it increased air patrols “to protect Israeli airspace.”No siren was activated, and the IDF said an initial inquiry pointed to “human error that caused the interception and defense systems not to be operated.” The error may have been related to “identification,” an IDF official said in an earlier briefing, saying that the matter was still being investigated.The spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, dismissed Houthi claims that the drone was a type of stealth aircraft and maintained it had been picked up by Israeli monitoring systems. A second drone targeting Israeli airspace was successfully intercepted early Friday, he said. Investigators were exploring whether the two attacks were related.The drone that reached Tel Aviv was an Iranian-made Samad-3 that had been modified to fly greater distances, he said.The Houthis, a Yemen-based group that has been attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea since last year, said Friday in a statement that it had carried out a “military operation” targeting Tel Aviv that “successfully achieved its objectives,” using what it said was a new drone capable of evading countermeasures. The attack, the statement said, was in response to Israeli “massacres” in Gaza.Witnesses said they heard and saw an aircraft appear from the direction of the Mediterranean Sea around 3 a.m. and slam into a building with a loud explosion. There were no warning alarms in a city where residents are used to air raid sirens and alerts on their phones sending them to shelters.Limor Sagiv, 58, was asleep with her partner in a fifth-floor apartment less than two blocks from the U.S. Embassy facility when the blast shattered their kitchen window and a balcony door.Stories to keep you informed

Two dead in listeria outbreak linked to deli meat. Here’s what to know.“There was an orange flash and a smell like a rubber fire,” said Sagiv, standing in a living room filled with glass shards. They had just returned to the apartment after being told by police to evacuate the area for a few hours in case of secondary attacks.Noa Yehoshua was up late with friends in a nearby apartment when one of them spotted a small aircraft with a round fuselage and wide wings.“My friend was sitting by the window and said, ‘Oh, wow, guys, what it that?’” Yehoshua said. “And then it just exploded.”Yehoshua, 23, an army reservist scheduled to deploy to Gaza next week, said the drone strike was part of the wider war with Iran-backed forces throughout the region that has raged since the Hamas raid on Israeli towns on Oct. 7.“It’s so surreal that we’re attacked over and over and over again in a war that we didn’t even start,” she said.During the war in Gaza, the Houthis and other Iran-backed groups in the region have carried out regular attacks they say are aimed at supporting Palestinian militant groups and ending Israel’s military offensive. The Yemeni group has previously claimed drone attacks on the southern Israeli city of Eilat — roughly 1,000 miles from northern Yemen — but the strike on Tel Aviv, if confirmed, appears to represent an increase in the Houthis’ capabilities and reach.The Yemeni group said it would continue to target Tel Aviv with future attacks.“The security system is working to immediately strengthen all defense systems, and will come to account with anyone who harms the State of Israel or sends terror against it,” Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said in a statement Friday.The fatality was a 50-year-old man who was found with severe shrapnel injuries in an apartment adjacent to the blast, said Roee Klein, a paramedic with Magen David Adom, Israel’s national emergency service. The nearby Ichilov Medical Center said Friday it had treated and released five people injured in the strike.Israeli media identified the fatality as Yevgeny Ferder, a Belarusian immigrant who arrived in Israel two years ago at the beginning of Russia’s war in Ukraine. He was killed in the hotel where he both lived in worked, according to the reports.Friday’s rare attack on Tel Aviv took place hours after the Israeli air force said it killed two commanders of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed group in Lebanon with which Israel has been exchanging fire. Hezbollah acknowledged the deaths of two of its members but did not identify them as senior operatives.Israel’s aerial defense system, outfitted primarily for rockets, has for months struggled to identify and eliminate Hezbollah drones — which fly lower and often in nonlinear paths — in attacks on Israel’s north.Fabian Hinz, a research fellow who studies drones and missiles at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, said that pictures of the debris from the drone that circulated Friday matched the Houthi Samad-3 drone, the group’s “standard long-range strike drone.”The Samad-3 drone, Houthi-produced with Iranian components

ÁLVARO VALIÑO/THE WASHINGTON POSTThe model had previously been used in strikes against Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates as well as the southern Israeli city of Eilat several times, in attacks that were intercepted, he said.While Houthi claims that the drone used Friday could evade radar were “certainly false,” it was also possible the group had upgraded the drone to increase its range, including by making the warhead lighter or increasing the size of the fuel tank. It was hard to pinpoint the exact range of the Samad-3, but Hinz said that estimates were between 1,100 to 1,500 miles.The pictures of the debris appeared to show a “slightly higher performance” Iranian-made engine than those normally seen on the Samad-3, he said. It was unclear, he added, “whether it’s a standard Samad-3 version that just got lucky and got through, or whether it’s a slightly upgraded or improved version.”While shorter-range versions of the Samad drones were piloted via a radio link and cameras, the longer-range models relied on satellite navigation. Such systems can be jammed, but antennas resistant to jamming had been observed on Iranian drones, he said.It was difficult to determine exactly where the drone was launched from, given that it appeared to have changed direction at least once, as it headed to Tel Aviv from the Mediterranean Sea, Hinz said.  Other Iranian-backed groups, in Iraq and Lebanon, had tended to use smaller Samad models than the one used Friday. If the Houthis had developed a longer-range drone, such a weapon would provide them with “new angles of attack” that could put additional strains on detection systems and Israel’s capabilities.If Yemen is determined to be the launch site, Israel would find it difficult to launch a counter strike, according to Harrison Mann, a former U.S. Army officer who worked at the Defense Intelligence Agency. Even the United States has struggled to locate Houthi targets, he said, and has already hit the most the most worthwhile ones.Hamas praised the drone attack in statement, and called on Yemeni militants to launch more of them in defense of the “innocents in Gaza.”Tel Aviv’s mayor, Ron Huldai, posted on X that the city was on “high alert” after the drone attack and that residents were required to follow emergency instructions. “The war is still here, and it is hard and painful,” he said.It was not immediately clear whether the drone was targeting the U.S. Embassy branch office.U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Friday in a post on social media that there were no reported injuries to or deaths of U.S. personnel. He also said he spoke with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and “reaffirmed that our commitment to Israel’s security and right to self-defense remains ironclad.”Fahim reported from Istanbul, Ables from Seoul, Hendrix from Jerusalem.

86,CNN_34,"What is CrowdStrike, the company linked to the global outage?",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/tech/crowdstrike-update-global-outage-explainer/index.html,"
            The global computer outage affecting airports, banks and other businesses on Friday appears to stem at least partly from a software update issued by major US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, experts told CNN.
    

            CrowdStrike told customers early Friday that the outages were caused by “a defect found in a single content update of its software on Microsoft Windows operating systems, according to a post on X from CEO George Kurtz.
    

            The company’s engineers took action to address the problem, according to an advisory viewed by CNN, which told customers to reboot their computers and perform other actions if they were still having technical issues. The issue is specific to Falcon, one of CrowdStrike’s main software products, and is not impacting Mac or Linux operating systems, according to the advisory. Crowdstrike says Falcon is designed to protect files saved in the cloud.
    

            CrowdStrike’s cybersecurity software — used by numerous Fortune 500 companies, including  major global banks, healthcare and energy companies — detects and blocks hacking threats. Like other cybersecurity products, the software requires deep-level access to a computer’s operating system to scan for those threats. In this case, computers running Microsoft Windows appear to be crashing because of the faulty way a software code update issued by CrowdStrike is interacting with the Windows system.
    

            The company said the outage was not caused by a security incident or a cyberattack. Kurtz, in his post, said the issue was identified and isolated, and engineers deployed an update to fix the problem.
    

            CrowdStrike’s (CRWD) stock fell 10% in premarket trading.
    

            The massive cybersecurity company does business around the world through software sales and investigations of major hacks.
    

            The company also helps run cybersecurity investigations for the US government. For example, CrowdStrike has tracked North Korean hackers for more than a decade, the company says. It also was tasked with tracking the hacking groups that carried out the 2014 hack on Sony Pictures.
    

            But CrowdStrike is perhaps best known for investigating the Russian hack of Democratic National Committee computers during the 2016 US election. It has been at the center of false conspiracy theories since 2016, most notably after a White House transcript revealed former President Donald Trump mentioned Crowdstrike in his July 2016 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that led to his first impeachment.
    

            CrowdStrike was the first to publicly sound the alarm about Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and CrowdStrike’s assessment was later confirmed by US intelligence agencies.

87,CNN_47,WSJ reporter Evan Gershkovich sentenced to 16 years for espionage by Russian court in case denounced by US as a sham,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/media/evan-gershkovich-espionage-trial-verdict-intl/index.html,"
Evan Gershkovich, the first American journalist to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since the Cold War, has been found guilty of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison by a Russian court, in a case that the US government, his newspaper and supporters have denounced as a sham.
    

            The court in Yekaterinburg announced the guilty verdict and sentencing on Friday shortly after 3 p.m. local time (8 a.m. ET).
    

            The court heard closing arguments and 32-year-old Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter, delivered his closing remarks behind closed doors on Friday morning.
    

            The case’s rapid conclusion comes just weeks after Gershkovich first appeared in a glass cage with his head recently shaved at the start of his trial on June 26. On that day, Gershkovich stood cross-armed, occasionally smiling and waving to the crowd of reporters.
    

            The speed of the trial has raised questions over whether the Kremlin is intending to use him as part of a prisoner swap deal with the United States, suggestions which spokesman Dmitry Peskov left without comment when asked about them on a Friday conference call ahead of the verdict announcement.
    

            In June, Moscow confirmed again that contacts are ongoing regarding a potential prisoner exchange deal for Gershkovich, but Peskov repeatedly insisted that those conversations were to be carried out in “absolute silence” to prevent complications.
    

            Gershkovich was arrested while reporting for the WSJ, during a trip to Yekaterinburg in March 2023, and later accused of spying for the CIA. Russian authorities have never offered any public evidence to support their claims.
    

            Within two weeks of his arrest in March 2023, the US State Department designated him as wrongfully detained and called for his immediate release.

            In a statement following Friday’s sentencing, Gershkovich’s employer said: “This disgraceful, sham conviction comes after Evan has spent 478 days in prison, wrongfully detained, away from his family and friends, prevented from reporting, all for doing his job as a journalist.
    

            “We will continue to do everything possible to press for Evan’s release and to support his family,” the statement from Dow Jones CEO and Wall Street Journal Publisher Almar Latour and Wall Street Journal Editor in Chief Emma Tucker continued.
    

            “Journalism is not a crime, and we will not rest until he’s released. This must end now,” it added.
    

            The verdict has yet to enter into force, and the defense can appeal the conviction within 15 days, judge Andrey Mineyev said while delivering his verdict. The court also ordered Gershkovich to pay procedural costs of 6,708 rubles ($77), and for some of his personal items, including an iPhone and a notepad, to be destroyed.
    

            According to the judge, the time Gershkovich has already spent in detention since last March will count towards his sentence.
    

            Following his arrest, Gershkovich was held in Moscow’s notorious Lefortovo prison, spending almost every hour of the day in a small cell, before being transferred to the city of Yekaterinburg in the Urals more than 1,100 miles east of the capital. He passed the time by writing letters to his friends and family, his parents said in an interview with the WSJ, adding that he was allowed just one hour of walking per day.
    

            Gershkovich, the US government, and the WSJ have vehemently denied the charges against him.
    

            US and Western officials have accused Russia of using Gershkovich and other jailed foreigners as bargaining chips for possible prisoner exchanges.
    

A high-profile swap in 2022 saw US basketball star Brittney Griner exchanged for arms dealer Viktor Bout. But Russia refused to release another jailed US citizen, Paul Whelan, as it was seeking a former colonel from Russia’s domestic spy organization in return.
    

            In an interview with right-wing US media personality Tucker Carlson in February, Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested “an agreement can be reached” with the United States to release Gershkovich and alluded to the case of a Russian national convicted of carrying out an assassination in Berlin in 2019.
    

            The trial of Gershkovich, the American-born son of Soviet-era emigres to the US, has highlighted the extent to which Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has harmed relations between Moscow and Washington.
    

            In their indictment, Russian prosecutors said that “under instructions from the CIA” and “using painstaking conspiratorial methods,” Gershkovich “was collecting secret information” about a Russian tank factory.

87,WaPo_39,Russian prosecutor seeks 18 years in prison for journalist Evan Gershkovich,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/19/evan-gershkovich-journalist-russia-espionage/,"After a closed trial with secret evidence, a Russian court on Friday convicted American journalist Evan Gershkovich of espionage — charges that the U.S. government said were wholly fabricated — and sentenced him to 16 years in a maximum security penal colony, according to Russian state media.Gershkovich was the first American journalist arrested in Russia since the Cold War, and his case has grave implications for press freedoms.The trial proceeded with unusual swiftness — suggesting potential developments in negotiations for a prisoner exchange. Trials for espionage in Russia typically take months.Gershkovich’s arrest in March 2023 seemed to mark a brazen new chapter in hostage diplomacy, by which the Kremlin detains foreigners on minor, or even baseless, charges to then use them to negotiate exchanges for Russians convicted and imprisoned for serious crimes in the West.Senior Russian and U.S. officials have said that talks about an exchange involving Gershkovich are underway but, according to Kremlin policy, would only proceed once the trial was over.The secrecy of the trial and arguments means that the evidence presented against Gershkovich faced no public scrutiny and may never be disclosed. The prosecution on Friday had requested an 18-year prison term on Friday, close to the 20-year maximum.Stories to keep you informed

‘Magical’ self-portrait was hidden for decades — until the canvas was flipped
How can I get healthier hair? Here’s what the science says. 
Two dead in listeria outbreak linked to deli meat. Here’s what to know.President Biden said in a statement that Gershkovich was targeted because he was an American and a journalist and sentenced to 16 years despite having committed no crime.“We are pushing hard for Evan’s release and will continue to do so,” Biden said, describing Gershkovich as a “hostage.”“As I have long said and as the U.N. also concluded, there is no question that Russia is wrongfully detaining Evan.”In Russia’s highly politicized legal system, where the courts routinely are used to jail journalists, democracy advocates, human rights activists and political opponents of the government, Gershkovich’s conviction had appeared inevitable since his arrest, but supporters and friends nonetheless expressed their shock.“Russia has just sentenced an innocent man to 16 years in a high security prison,” Pjotr Sauer, a correspondent for The Guardian and close friend of Gershkovich, posted on X, formerly Twitter. “I have no words to describe this farce. Let’s get Evan out of there.”In a joint statement, the Wall Street Journal’s publisher, Almar Latour, and editor in chief, Emma Tucker, called for an end to Gershkovich’s ordeal, which began with his arrest in March last year.“This disgraceful, sham conviction comes after Evan has spent 478 days in prison, wrongfully detained, away from his family and friends, prevented from reporting, all for doing his job as a journalist,” the statement said. “We will continue to do everything possible to press for Evan’s release and to support his family.”Video published by Russia news outlet Vedemosti showed the judge rapidly reading the judgment, conviction and sentence, as Gershkovich, clad in a black T-shirt, stood in a glass box in the courtroom, his head shaven.Journalists were admitted only at the beginning before evidence was presented, and at the end for the reading of the conviction and sentence. An armed security agent wearing a black face mask stood nearby.Gershkovich, his employer the Wall Street Journal and the State Department have all strongly denied the accusation that he was working for the CIA. His conviction was widely expected.The 32-year-old, who was accredited as a journalist by Russia’s Foreign Ministry, was detained while on a reporting trip to Yekaterinburg and accused of spying. He pleaded not guilty.The conviction at least opens the possibility that Gershkovich could be released if the United States can reach a deal with Russia.The second day of the trial, at the Sverdlovsk Regional Court in Yekaterinburg, was moved forward to Thursday from Aug. 13 at the request of Gershkovich’s defense team, according to the court.Russian prosecutors alleged that Gershkovich was operating on the orders of the CIA, gathering secret information about Uralvagonzavod, a state-owned machine-building factory in Nizhniy Tagil, about 87 miles southeast of Yekaterinburg, which manufactures tanks for Russia’s war on Ukraine.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that the hearing was closed because it was a sensitive case. Russian legal rights activists, however, have reported that the number of cases closed to the public has increased dramatically since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.“You know that the charges there concern espionage,” Peskov said. “Therefore this is a very, very sensitive domain, and therefore, the judge has chosen a closed-door format,” he said during a phone call with journalists. He declined to comment on the possibility of an exchange.The U.S. Embassy in Moscow said last month that the case against Gershkovich was “not about evidence, procedural norms, or the rule of law. It is about the Kremlin using American citizens to achieve its political objectives.”Fueling the sense that the result was a political inevitability, senior Russian officials immediately denounced the journalist after his arrest in March last year. Within hours, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova had proclaimed that his work in Yekaterinburg had “nothing to do with journalism,” and Kremlin spokesman Peskov insisted that Gershkovich had been “caught red-handed.” Neither offered evidence.Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Wednesday that Russia had “irrefutable evidence” that the reporter had spied and claimed that the use of journalists as spies “at least in the Anglo-Saxon world, is a tradition.” But Lavrov also confirmed that Russian and U.S. intelligence services were in contact on the possibility of an exchange.In February, President Vladimir Putin indicated he would be willing to exchange Gershkovich for a “patriot” who had “eliminated a Russian bandit” in a European capital, an apparent reference to Russian assassin Vadim Krasikov, associated with Russia’s Federal Security Service. Krasikov was convicted of murder in Germany for fatally shooting a former Chechen rebel commander, Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, in broad daylight in a Berlin park in 2019.Last month, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Russia was awaiting a response from Washington to its exchange offer. He said “the ball is in the United States’ court. We are waiting for their response to the ideas that were presented to them.”Gershkovich’s conviction is likely to have a further chilling effect on the work of foreign journalists in Russia. Many media organizations pulled their correspondents out after his arrest.Gershkovich is the first American journalist arrested in Russia for alleged spying since 1986, during the Cold War, when Nicholas Daniloff, a correspondent for U.S. News & World Report, was detained by the Soviet security service. Daniloff was held for 13 days before being freed without facing trial in exchange for Gennadi Zakharov, who had been arrested by the FBI in New York for spying in a sting operation.The United Nations’ Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions this month called on Russia to free Gershkovich without a trial and to pay him compensation. It concluded that, “There is a striking lack of any factual or legal substantiation provided by the authorities of the Russian Federation for the espionage charges” against him.His arrest was “designed to punish his reporting” on Russia’s war against Ukraine, “lacked a legal basis and is arbitrary,” the U.N. working group said.Associates of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in jail in Russia in February, said that there was nearly an agreement that month on a deal exchanging Krasikov for Navalny and two Americans.That exchange probably would have involved Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, an American serving a 16-year jail term in Russia after being convicted in 2020 of spying.Whelan, 54, has spent more than 5 1/2 years in prison in Russia, having been overlooked in two previous exchange deals.In his statement, President Biden said that since taking office his highest priority had been seeking the release of Gershkovich, Whelan “and all Americans wrongfully detained and held hostage abroad.”But some critics have faulted Biden for putting far more emphasis on the American WNBA star Brittney Griner, who was convicted in Moscow of drug smuggling in August 2022 and freed in an exchange that December for Viktor Bout — a convicted Russian arms trafficker.Former Marine Trevor Reed, convicted of assaulting a police officer, was freed in April 2022 in exchange for Russian pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko, who had been jailed in the United States for drug smuggling.According to his friends and family, Gershkovich, the son of Soviet-era émigrés, fell in love with Russia when he moved there in 2017 to work for The Moscow Times, a prominent local outlet that pulled out of Russia after Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. He later worked for Agence France-Presse and joined the Wall Street Journal’s Moscow bureau at the beginning of 2022.He grew up eating Russian comfort food prepared by his mother Ella Milman and watching classic Soviet-era cartoons. Friends and colleagues describe his open, friendly manner, his passion for reporting and his unerring ability to connect with the people that he meets.Since Gershkovich’s arrest, the Wall Street Journal has run a campaign to keep his story in the public eye, promoting the hashtag #FreeEvan and running events such as #CookForEvan, encouraging supporters to prepare his favorite dishes and tell his story as a food enthusiast and a great cook who loves to entertain friends."

93,CNN_54,"Recovering from the global tech outage could be a long, arduous process",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/business/recovery-global-crowdstrike-outage/index.html,"
            The company that caused a massive computer outage across the world says a flawed update has been rolled back – but that doesn’t necessarily help the thousands of businesses that have been affected by the glitch.
    

            The CrowdStrike software issue at the heart of the outage runs at such a deep level in affected computers and systems that getting them up and running just to be fixed will be, in many cases, an enormous challenge.
    

            That’s compounded by the fact that many of the servers that may contain information needed to get these systems working again are themselves caught in a cycle of crashing and rebooting.
    

            “I don’t think it’s too early to call it: this will be the largest IT outage in history,” said security expert Troy Hunt in a post on X.
    

The CrowdStrike software at fault operates at what’s called the kernel level of a computer, a much deeper level than what more ordinary applications such as browsers or video games do. This portion of a device has much greater visibility and control over a computer and its components, making it critical for the operation of all other systems — and far more sensitive.
    

            Running at the kernel level means CrowdStrike’s software can do more to detect cyberattacks, but it also means the current bug is causing Windows computers to crash to a Blue Screen of Death before users can take any actions to correct it.
    

            The issue appears to be recoverable, CrowdStrike has said, but in many cases it requires painstaking work: Each affected device must be accessed by an administrator and manually rebooted into safe mode. Then, the offending CrowdStrike file must be deleted by hand.
    

            For businesses with hundreds or thousands of laptops, desktops and servers running CrowdStrike’s security software, an individual human may have to perform that process over and over and over again.
    

            “You can’t automate that,” said Kevin Beaumont, a security researcher and former Microsoft threat analyst, in a post on X. “So this is going to be incredibly painful for CrowdStrike customers.”
    

            It gets worse.
    

            Organizations that take security seriously will have likely encrypted their computers’ hard drives, making it even more challenging to access the file that needs to be deleted.
    

            For those organizations, “you need to manually decrypt the disk with a BitLocker Recovery Key, which is probably — for most companies — stored digitally on one of the servers that is currently booting over and over,” said Ira Bailey, a security researcher, in a post on BlueSky.
    

            Every affected computer that is BitLocker-encrypted will need to be unlocked with a recovery key before organizations can begin the process of deleting the bad CrowdStrike file and restoring normal operation, said the cybersecurity expert who goes by the pseudonymous handle SwiftOnSecurity in a post on X.
    

            Recovery will be enormously expensive for Fortune 500 companies with large teams of IT staff and likely even more challenging for smaller firms, Kenn White, an independent security researcher who specializes in network security, told CNN.
    

            “If you don’t have physical staff that can actually touch it, this is going to take many, many days for much of corporate America to recover from,” White said. “It’s just a ton of labor-intensive manual work.”
    

            “It’s a fairly complicated procedure for non-technical people,” White added, “and even a lot of skilled IT professionals will find it difficult to do this at the scale that’s going to be required given the number of machines that are affected.”
    

            Because CrowdStrike’s security software is running on countless individual computers all around the globe, the update that got pushed to those devices caused them all to shut down, virtually simultaneously.
    

            And in today’s networked economy, an outage in one part of a supply chain can cause  domino effects up and down the line. When multiple parts of a supply chain go down, it touches off a cascade of problems.
    

            Imagine a person trying to buy a coffee, said Andrew Peck, a cybersecurity expert at Loughborough University in the UK. What may seem like a simple transaction relies on multiple computers working in tandem, from the coffee shop’s point of sale to the payment processor’s own back-end systems.
    

            “There are a lot of computers in this chain, and usually the larger the business, the larger the chain,” Peck said. “If any one of the computers are down in the chain, the transaction will not complete.”
    

            Now scale that up to something like the massive aviation industry, the critical financial services sector or the life-or-death operations of a health care provider, and the scope of the disaster becomes starkly clear.
    

            A separate issue earlier, on Thursday, did lead to significant impacts on many of Microsoft’s own cloud customers, but it was resolved overnight and was unrelated to the CrowdStrike issue, multiple cybersecurity experts said.
    

            The CrowdStrike bug may have initially been conflated with the Microsoft issue because CrowdStrike’s error affected only Windows machines.
    

            “Both are Microsoft-related, but Microsoft had nothing to do with the second incident,” White told CNN.
    

            That appears to be supported by Microsoft’s own status account on X, which on Thursday announced an issue affecting “Microsoft 365 apps and services” and a separate announcement Friday addressing the CrowdStrike outage. The two issues are being tracked using different reference numbers.
    

            As of Friday morning, Microsoft said the issue with Microsoft 365 had been resolved and that the situation was improving. Microsoft didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
    

            Since the update to CrowdStrike’s software was delivered by the company’s own systems, it appears unlikely that Microsoft bears direct responsibility for Friday’s outages, said Beaumont, who said he reviewed a copy of CrowdStrike’s flawed update.
    

            The problem with CrowdStrike’s update was that it wasn’t formatted correctly “and causes Windows to crash every time,” Beaumont posted on X.

Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport reported that a “global system failure at Microsoft” had disrupted flights there.“Our systems are currently impacted by a Microsoft outage, which is also affecting other companies,” Frontier said in an earlier post on X, adding hours later that the ground stop was lifted and operations were gradually normalizing.Businesses around the world, including The Washington Post, reported experiencing issues with Microsoft Windows overnight Thursday into Friday, with users reporting “blue screen of death” (BSOD) errors. At least some resumed functioning shortly afterward.The issues began at 5:56 p.m. Eastern on Thursday, according to Microsoft.It said the preliminary root cause appeared to be “a configuration change in a portion of our Azure backend workloads” that “caused interruption between storage and compute resources which resulted in connectivity failures that affected downstream Microsoft 365 services dependent on these connections.” Azure is a Microsoft cloud computing platform.In Australia, where the outage occurred in the middle of the day, services including banking, police systems and airports were impacted, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.This is a developing story and will be updated."

That was Friday.It was not quite a global catastrophe, since it was mostly just a lot of devices, gadgets, computers and machines failing to work right. But it was revelatory — and ominous.In today’s world, a single bad piece of software can wreak havoc on a global scale. And there’s more of this to come, according to experts who study and fret about our increasingly complex technological systems.“We have, as this shows, lots of infrastructure relying on single points of failure,” said Gary Marcus, a professor emeritus at New York University and author of the forthcoming book “Taming Silicon Valley,” on Friday. “Absolutely nothing guarantees that we won’t have an other similar incident either accidentally or maliciously.”As more information emerged about the cause of the outage, it seemed clear it was nothing more than an accident, one caused by faulty software in an automated update from an Austin-based company called CrowdStrike. The big headline was the vulnerability of major industries, such as aviation and banking. But it was a rough time for anyone with a computer that on Friday morning announced blandly and without further explanation that it was not working.Consumers of technology expect software to perform, and it usually does. But that invites complacency and digital illiteracy: We don’t remember anyone’s phone number because on a smartphone you just tap the name and the call goes through. We don’t carry cash because everyone takes plastic.Life in the 21st Century is pretty magical — until it’s not.Marcus fears that society will become even more vulnerable as we rely increasingly on artificial intelligence. On X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, he wrote: “The world needs to up its software game massively. We need to invest in improving software reliability and methodology, not rushing out half-baked chatbots. An unregulated AI industry is a recipe for disaster.”Stories to keep you informed

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.The AI revolution — which did not come up a single time during the June presidential debate between President Biden and former president Donald Trump — is poised to make these systems even more interdependent and opaque, making human society more vulnerable in ways no one can fully predict.Political leaders have been slow to react to these changes in part because few of them understand the technology. Even technologists can’t fully understand the complexities of our globally networked systems.""It’s becoming clear that the nerve center of the world’s IT systems is a giant black box of interconnected software fully intelligible to no one,” Edward Tenner, a scholar of technology and author of the book “Why Things Bite Back,” said in an email Friday.“You could even say that it’s a black box full of undocumented booby traps.”What happened Friday brought to mind a threat that never fully materialized: Y2K. Twenty-five years ago, as we approached the turn of the century, some computer experts feared that a software bug would cause airplanes to fall out of the sky — along with all sorts of other calamities — the moment 1999 turned into 2000. Governments and private industry spent billions of dollars trying to patch up the computer problems in advance, and the big moment arrived with minimal disruption.But the question of how vulnerable — or resilient — the global information networks of 2024 are cannot be easily answered. The systems are too numerous, too interconnected, for anyone to have full battlefield awareness.Friday’s tech outage served as a fleeting reminder of the fragility of that invisible world, especially for those trying to catch planes, book surgeries or power up personal computers that had gone into a mysterious failure mode. Trending online all day was “Blue Screen of Death,” the nickname for the error message that appears when Microsoft Windows ceases operating safely. The Blue Screen of Death, people discovered, has in recent times taken on a gentler, less alarming shade of blue, as if someone had consulted a color theorist.It did not go unnoticed that CrowdStrike, a company that provides software to ward off cyberattacks, was responsible for the outage. Tenner, the author, points out that in the history of disasters, technologies meant to improve safety have often introduced new risks.“Lifeboats and their deck reinforcements installed after the Titanic destabilized a Lake Michigan excursion ship, the SS Eastland, in 1915. Over 840 people died in Chicago harbor when it capsized during loading,” Tenner said.And then there’s the safety pin: It was swallowed, open, by so many children that a surgeon developed a special tool to extract it, Tenner said.Brian Klass, author of “Fluke: Chance, Chaos, and Why Everything We Do Matters,” wrote on X after the tech outage that “we’ve engineered social systems that are extremely prone to catastrophic risk because we have optimised to the limit, with no slack, in hyper-connected systems. A tiny failure is now an enormous one.”Technological disasters can also be triggered by natural causes. Prominent on the minds of many natural security experts is the risk of a powerful solar storm knocking out the electrical grid, or damaging satellites crucial to communication, navigation, weather prediction and military surveillance.Such satellites also could be targeted by a hostile adversary. U.S. officials have expressed concern about the possibility that Russia could be developing the capability to deploy a nuclear weapon in space that would pose a threat to our satellites — and potentially create an exponential increase in space debris with catastrophic consequences.But Friday’s tech outage emerged without any geopolitical machinations, or anything as dramatic as a thermonuclear explosion. It was just the result of some bad code, a bug — a glitch in the system."

Tiger Woods has made an early exit from the Open Championship, but the US golfer has vowed to be back for the 2025 major.
    

            A second round six-over 77 at Royal Troon in Scotland on Friday improved upon an opening 79, but left the 48-year-old well short of the projected cut line for the top-70 players at 14-over par overall.
    

            It ties the three-time Open champion’s highest ever 36-hole score of his major career, according to golf statistician Justin Ray, shot at the US Open in 2015 – the only previous season he had missed three consecutive cuts at the sport’s four flagship events.
    

            “Just was fighting it pretty much all day,” Woods, who finished 60th at the Masters in April before failing to make the weekend at both the PGA Championship and US Open, told reporters.
    

            “I never really hit it close enough to make birdies and consequently made a lot of bogeys.”
    

            Signing off with par, Woods was given a standing ovation as crowds swarmed behind the ropes to get a last glimpse of him at Royal Troon, yet the 15-time major winner insisted it would not be his final Open.
    

            Woods – who is automatically qualified for the tournament as a result of his victories in 2000, 2005 and 2006 – said he will “definitely” be returning for next year’s 153rd edition of the major at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland, in what would be his 24th outing at the event.
    

            The 82-time PGA Tour winner had arrived at Royal Troon adamant that he will play as long as he feels he can still win, shunning former world No. 2 Colin Montgomerie’s suggestion he should consider retiring.

            This season marks the first since his 2021 car crash that Woods has competed at all four majors. In February, he had expressed his desire to compete in one tournament a month but – despite “physically feeling a lot better” than at the beginning of the year – has only competed in five official events in 2024.
    

            “I loved it. I’ve always loved playing major championships. I just wish I was more physically sharp coming into the majors,” he said Friday.
    

            “Obviously it tests you mentally, physically, emotionally, and I just wasn’t as sharp as I needed to be. I was hoping that I would find it somehow, just never did.
    

            “Consequently, my results and scores were pretty high,” Woods, who shot just his sixth career major round of eight over or worse on Thursday, added.
    

            Playing partner and May’s PGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele, who followed up an opening two-under 69 with a 72, said Thursday he could empathize with Woods’ fight for sharpness.
    

            “He’s making it as hard on himself as possible, and I know he’s hard on himself too,” Schauffele told reporters.
    

            “He’s got to learn a little bit more about his body, what he can and can’t do. I’m sure he’d like to prep more at home if his body would allow it … I know what goes into it and what needs to be done to play at a high level. If your body is not letting you do it, it’s just frustrating.”

            At least 40 people have died after the boat they were traveling in caught fire off the coast of Haiti earlier this week, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported on Friday, citing local authorities.
    

            The vessel left Haiti on Wednesday carrying over 80 migrants, and was headed to Turks and Caicos, the IOM said. Forty-one survivors were rescued by Haiti’s Coast Guard, it also said.
    

            In a statement, Grégoire Goodstein, IOM’s chief of mission in the country, blamed the tragedy on Haiti’s spiraling security crisis and the lack of “safe and legal pathways for migration.”
    

            “Haiti’s socio-economic situation is in agony. The extreme violence over the past months has only brought Haitians to resort to desperate measures even more,” he said.
    
As more Kenyan troops are headed to the Caribbean nation, Haiti grapples with a hunger crisis.

Hunger in Haiti spreads amid ongoing gang violence


            Haiti is grappling with gang violence, a collapsing health system, and a lack of access to essential supplies, leading many Haitians to embark on dangerous journeys out of the country.
    

            The Caribbean nation’s crisis escalated earlier this year when gang warfare exploded, forcing the resignation of the then-government. The number of migration attempts by boat from Haiti have risen since then, according to IOM data.
    

            But chaos in the country has not stopped neighboring governments from repatriating Haitian migrants by the tens of thousands.
    

            “More than 86,000 migrants have been forcibly returned to Haiti by neighboring countries this year. In March, despite a surge in violence and the closure of airports throughout the country, forced returns increased by 46 per cent, reaching 13,000 forced returns in March alone,” the agency said in its statement.
    

            In recent weeks, the appointment of new Prime Minister Garry Conille and the arrival of several hundred foreign forces to bolster Haiti’s National Police have offered new hope for addressing the crisis. The United Nations Security Council-backed Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission, led by Kenya, is now beginning operations in Haitian capital Port-au-Prince.

It caught fire a short time later near Labadee. The Haitian coast guard rescued more than 40 survivors, the IOM said.“This devastating event highlights the risks faced by children, women and men migrating through irregular routes, demonstrating the crucial need for safe and legal pathways to migration,” Grégoire Goodstein, the IOM’s chief in Haiti, said in a statement.The fire came the same week that a second contingent of Kenyan police officers arrived in the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince as part of a U.N.-backed international security mission to beat back the heavily armed gangs that control at least 80 percent of the city and to allow new elections.Gangs killed at least 3,250 people in Haiti from January to May, the U.N. office in Haiti reported last month, up more than 30 percent from the previous five months. The violence has forced more than 570,000 people to flee their homes.The security challenges have exacerbated a humanitarian crisis in a country long saddled with endemic poverty and where roughly half of the people suffer from acute hunger.“Haiti’s socioeconomic situation is in agony,” Goodstein said. “The extreme violence over the past months has only brought Haitians to resort to desperate measures even more.”Stories to keep you informed

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.More than 86,000 migrants have been forcibly returned to Haiti this year by neighboring countries, the IOM said.In the weeks since several hundred Kenyan police officers arrived in Haiti, they have joined the Haitian National Police on street patrols, but they have not yet started operations to pacify gang-controlled neighborhoods.Dennis B. Hankins, the U.S. ambassador to Haiti, said he expects those operations to begin “within the next few weeks.”As the violence has worsened, Haitians have often taken to the sea to seek refuge elsewhere, many of them making risky trips on rickety boats or other makeshift vessels that are not fit for such voyages. The Turks and Caicos Islands, a British overseas territory, is a common destination. Others head for the Bahamas or the Florida coast.The U.S. Coast Guard and the Royal Bahamas Defense Force on Thursday announced that they were suspending the search for 60 Haitian migrants that may have left the Bahamas for Florida on July 4 on a boat that was experiencing engine issues.The IOM says that collecting figures on the number who die at sea is challenging because of “the remote nature of maritime routes, the secrecy in which boats set out and the lack of information on trajectories.”“Many, many boats leave [Haiti],” said Antoine Lemonnier, an IOM spokesman in the country. “Many are intercepted by foreign coast guards … and probably many are dying and we will never know about it.”"
127,CNN_83,Open Championship: ‘Hot headed’ Shane Lowry shrugs off cameraman clash to roar ahead but Rory McIlroy flames out,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/sport/shane-lowry-cameraman-open-championship-spt-intl/index.html,"
            Rivals and cameramen, make way – Shane Lowry is coming through at the Open Championship.


            The Irishman lifted the red mist that momentarily descended upon him at Royal Troon in Scotland to wrestle control of the major, as his second round two-under 69 on Friday sent him into the weekend with a two shot lead.
    

            After opening with a bogey-free 66 on Thursday, 2019 champion Lowry had been motoring along smoothly at the summit before his advantage was derailed by a disastrous 30-minute saga on the notorious par-four 11th “Railway” hole.
    

            Having narrowly survived sending his tee shot onto the train tracks that run alongside the 488-yard hole, the world No. 33 went from frying pan to fire as his subsequent effort from the rough went careening left into the thick gorse across the other side of the fairway.
    

            A visibly disgruntled Lowry then gesticulated and pointed animatedly at a nearby cameraman, later admitting that he had – no pun intended – “lost his train of thought” after becoming “a little distracted” while stood over his shot.
    

            “There was a cameraman there, and he was walking up. I asked him to stop or move back, and he just kind of stayed there,” Lowry told reporters on his return to the clubhouse.
    

            “As it was over, he put his camera up. I kind of saw it out of the corner of my eye, and I should stood off it, (it was) my own fault.”
    

            The drama continued when Lowry struck a “great” provisional shot – taken when a ball is presumed lost outside a penalty area or out of bounds – to within 12 feet of the hole, only for one eagle-eyed fan to subsequently find his original ball and void his provisional effort in the process.
    

            After a lengthy discussion with a rules official regarding where to take a drop from, the 37-year-old golfer eventually left with a double bogey – enough to erase his two-shot cushion, but “not a disaster”, he later reflected.
    

            If Lowry had lost his cool, he quickly found it in abundance. After rebounding with four steady pars, the Irishman signed off with his second birdie in three holes to restore the gap to English duo Justin Rose and Daniel Brown heading into the weekend.
    

            As he seeks to turn back the clock to his dominant triumph at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland five years ago, Lowry has no intention of throttling the passion that helped him clinch his sole major to date.
    

            “I can get a bit down on myself and a bit hot headed at times, but I really feel like that’s why I’ve had the career I’ve had,” Lowry, who has nine combined wins on the PGA Tour and European Tour, said.
    

            “If I go out there and try to be somebody I’m not, you’re just not going to be successful … [But] If I go out there and be myself, I feel like I can do very well. So allowing myself to do that, without getting in your own way.”
    

            It was an entirely contrasting day for Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy, as the world No. 2 capitulated to become the highest profile casualty of a host of big names that failed to make the cut.
    

            The 35-year-old star had been out to exorcise the demons of his latest heartbreaking major near-miss at the US Open last month but found only more woe at Royal Troon, finishing 11-over par overall to fall well short of the top-70 players and ties that progressed to the weekend.
    

            Needing a fast start after a grueling first round 78, McIlroy’s hopes of making the cut were effectively extinguished by the end of the sixth hole after a nightmarish stretch. Having bogeyed the third, McIlroy triple bogeyed the following par-five hole before back-to-back bogeys.
    

            A solid back nine saw him go two-under par down the stretch but the damage was done, his closing 75 ensuring his wait for a fifth major will continue into an 11th year.
    

            “Once I made the eight on the 4th hole, that was it. 22 holes into the event and I’m thinking about where I’m going to go on vacation next week,” McIlroy admitted to reporters.
    

            “It was a pretty meaningless 14 holes after that, but at least I played okay and at least feel like, when the wind dropped, my game felt a little more comfortable and I hit some good shots.”
    

Tiger Woods will also be absent from the weekend, resigning him to a third consecutive missed major cut for just the second time in his career.
    

            The 48-year-old shot 79 and 77 to finish on 14-over par, the joint-highest 36-hole score he has ever recorded at a major, but insisted he still enjoyed the challenge.

            “I’ve always loved playing major championships. I just wish I was more physically sharp coming into the majors,” Woods, who added he will “definitely” compete at next year’s Open at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland, told reporters Friday.
    

            “Obviously it tests you mentally, physically, emotionally, and I just wasn’t as sharp as I needed to be. I was hoping that I would find it somehow, just never did. Consequently, my results and scores were pretty high.”
    

            Other big names that failed to survive the cut included last month’s US Open winner Bryson DeChambeau, and last year’s US Open champion Wyndham Clark.
    

            With McIlroy, world No. 4 Ludvig Aberg and world No. 7 Viktor Hovland also missing out, only half of the world’s top-10 ranked players – Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele, Collin Morikawa, Patrick Cantlay and Jon Rahm – will tee up Saturday.

127,WaPo_150,"At British Open, a mighty wind shoos Rory McIlroy and kisses Shane Lowry",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/19/british-open-shane-lowry-rory-mcilroy-troon/,"TROON, Scotland — The way this British Open said cheerio to Rory McIlroy on Friday night felt either barbaric or puckish. It ushered him off with a dozen closing holes that verged on pristine, as if he should have brought along a dog and a leash and a small plastic bag of treats. It even found a place for his work of art from the bunker beside the No. 14 green, which plopped down and rolled in with a near-cruel obedience. By then and toward 8:25 p.m. when he finished, both the crowds and the wind had thinned. How absurd.Otherwise, this 152nd British Open kept acting like a classic British Open wind-wise, savaging many with scores that looked like many, and it nodded toward some wind veterans heading into the weekend: Irishman Shane Lowry leads at 7 under par, and Englishmen Justin Rose and major debutant Dan Brown are at 5 under after both came through the wilds of qualifying. Lowry, for one, won the 2019 British Open at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland as the wind sang, the skies brooded, the galleries boomed and the clouds wept heavily for joy. Scottie Scheffler, for another, lurks at 2 under with his six wins this year and his No. 1 ranking while hailing from a place prone to wind (Texas) and fielding a question about whether he thinks his name causes stress to other players by using his trademark level of bombast.“Not really,” he said.“I can’t wait to watch this weekend,” said McIlroy, whose triple-bogey 8 on No. 4 finished him off early, assured his major drought would reach 38 and made it the eighth time in that ludicrous span he has missed a major cut. Referring then to Lowry, he said: “He’s so creative. I think even just watching the coverage the last couple of days, that little sort of squeezy cut that he can hit, especially going out on that front nine, is going to be really helpful to him. Yeah, look, he relishes these conditions. The Open Championship is his favorite tournament in the world. He gets more up for this than anything else. I’m looking forward to cheering him on and hopefully him getting his second [claret] jug.”He won’t have to contend with any of the people who couldn’t contend with Troon’s earnest wind off the Firth of Clyde, which reached midafternoon levels ideal — for sailing. It kept pummeling people right off the bat or at least before the turn, sending them into vegetation and agitation. It often sent people looking through wilderness for golf balls as if on treasure hunts. It dispatched Tiger Woods pretty much by No. 2, when his tee shot veered through the gray sky way left to a botanical bonanza and the 77 he piled atop his 79 seemed booked. He double bogeyed there, missed his third straight major cut and made off for five months of looking forward to that father-son event in December he dubbed “our fifth major.”Justin Thomas, whose 68 on Thursday looked swell and contentious, slipped from third to 38th when his 78 featured this off-key chorus: bogeys on Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 6; double bogey on No. 5; triple bogey on No. 9. His cobbling of a back-nine 33 after his front-nine 45 qualified as herculean. Robert MacIntyre, the 27-year-old Scot who just won the Scottish Open with ample exhilaration and told of ample beverages thereafter, went through the first four holes at 7-5-5-8, meaning two triple bogeys and 8 over. “That was carnage,” he said. He, too, did well to hold together a 75 to make the carnage cut of 6 over by a stroke. Sahith Theegala made a triple-bogey 8 on No. 6, Elvis Smylie made a triple-bogey 8 on No. 4, David Puig made a triple-bogey 8 on No. 4, and Angel Hidalgo made a quadruple-bogey 9 on No. 4.The front and the middle parts kicked the rear parts of a player the caliber of Wyndham Clark, 2023 U.S. Open champion and 2024 Olympian. He shot an 80, free-fell to 16 over and left. Japanese hopeful Aguri Iwasaki, 26, peppered his 91 with some numerals seldom seen in such highbrow events: consecutive 9s, a quintuple bogey on No. 13 and that rarely witnessed sextuple bogey on the par-3 No. 14, during which he had three bunker shots of four yards or shorter.“I suppose the thing you’ve got here, you’ve got three different sixes,” the great Padraig Harrington said of the course sequences. “You’ve got six downward going out or, as we played them, into the wind. Then you have six in the middle that are really awkward. They’re really tricky. There’s blind shots. There’s gorse.”At the famed Railway hole, No. 11, Lowry wound up making a double bogey but saying, “To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a 6.”Also within that stage of the course, Joaquin Niemann’s quintuple-bogey 8 at the wee par-3 Postage Stamp, No. 8, deserves a review. He went into a green-side bunker. He went across to another green-side bunker. He went zero yards and stayed in that green-side bunker. Then he went 27 yards to another green-side bunker.Question: “Then what was kind of going through your mind as you were going from …”Niemann: “Bunker to bunker?”Reporter: “Bunker to bunker.”Niemann: “Just get it out of there.”(Laughter.)In a similar fate in a different place, McIlroy’s second shot from the native area somewhere near No. 4 moved two yards to portend that big-old 8 there. It left him finished in his own realistic mind, marking the second major occasion of the year when “the wind got the better of me,” as he put it of the Friday at the Masters and the Thursday and Friday here. “Yeah, I think once I made the 8 on the fourth hole, that was it,” he said. “Twenty-two holes into the event” — an event in which he figured to contend — “and I’m thinking about where I’m going to go on vacation next week.” He called it “a pretty meaningless 14 holes after that.”The meaningful holes are left to Rose, the 2013 U.S. Open champion hoping for a big career autumn at 43, and to Brown, who said that after his opening-round lead, “I was knackered,” yet still shot a non-collapse 72. And they’re left to Lowry, who proved a grand front-runner at Portrush such that one observer asked whether the chasers should fret. “I don’t know,” the good-natured Lowry said, soon adding, “Honestly, I’m not sure Scottie Scheffler is too worried about anyone with the form he’s in.”And the meaningful holes in a different way are left to Max Homa. His 28-foot attempt to make the cut rolled past McIlroy as it traveled, and when it plunked in, Homa, who called it “an out-of-body experience,” hollered. “I didn’t really expect to yell like I won a golf tournament,” he said. It led to a typically gracious hug thereafter from McIlroy, who walked off with that slight frown so familiar on an evening nicer than it had a right to be."

Some 911 call centers, as well as IT services of the Paris Olympics, were also affected. Microsoft said it was aware of an issue affecting Windows programs running cybersecurity technology from CrowdStrike. “The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed,” CrowdStrike’s CEO said early Friday, as some services appeared to be resuming and American Airlines said it was able to “safely re-establish” operations."
195,WaPo_96,How software errors melted down the world’s computer systems,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/19/bosd-outage-microsoft-crowdstrike/,"Widespread technology errors Thursday and Friday stranded airline passengers around the world, halted hospital surgeries and crippled office workers’ computers in one of the most disruptive computer outages in years, highlighting how much of the world relies on essential but inherently error-prone software from a handful of companies.Technology experts said the meltdowns stemmed at least partly from a software error at CrowdStrike, whose technology is widely used by businesses around the world to protect their computer systems from cyberattacks.Microsoft, which powers the computers and technology backbones for many companies, also reported outages with some of its popular web-connected software for corporate and government technology networks.CrowdStrike said in a statement that it had identified and issued a fix for a “defect” in its updated technology for Windows-based software, which is the foundation not only for hundreds of millions of personal PCs but also for many back-end computers that power airlines, digital payment systems, emergency services call centers and much more.The problem wasn’t a cyberattack or a security incident, CrowdStrike said.Marie Vasek, an assistant professor at University College London’s computer science department, said the widespread computer meltdowns showed how reliant technology systems are on a small number of companies’ software, including that of Microsoft and CrowdStrike.“The issue here is that Microsoft is a standard bit of software that everybody uses, and the bug in CrowdStrike is deployed to every single system,” she said.Stories to keep you informed

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.Vasek said technology networks are becoming more sprawling and complex, typically running on software from multiple companies. She said that increases the odds that one botched line of software code at one of those companies could bring down entire computer networks.She and another computer security expert also said that because CrowdStrike’s digital protections are considered so essential, its technology is given priority access on many computer systems. If something goes wrong with CrowdStrike software, that privileged access can grind computers to a halt.It’s ironic that CrowdStrike, whose software is intended to protect from catastrophic computer failures, was responsible for Friday’s widespread computer meltdowns, experts said.Vasek said both Microsoft and CrowdStrike deserve blame for a single software bug apparently causing so many disruptions to people and businesses.She said CrowdStrike needed to consider how to safely update its software to many millions of computer networks. And Microsoft, she said, needed to do more to ensure that updates to software from other companies don’t cripple Windows machines. “Microsoft needs to think about how to check that software is as it should be,” she said.Microsoft didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment from The Washington Post.In a statement and in an NBC News’s “Today” Show interview with CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz, the company said it is “actively working with customers” to resolve the problems and that many CrowdStrike systems are recovering and will be functional soon.A spokesperson for FS-ISAC, an information technology organization that works with large financial institutions, said many of its customers are implementing the software fix from CrowdStrike. The spokesperson said that essential functions, including banking and payment processing, “are largely functioning with some scattered effects.”It wasn’t immediately clear how many of Friday’s computer network collapses resulted from the defective CrowdStrike software update and which were the result of problems that started Thursday with Microsoft’s online services and cloud computing service Azure — or if the two issues were related.In his “Today” Show interview, Kurtz said that CrowdStrike is “deeply sorry for the impact that we’ve caused to customers, to travelers, to anyone affected by this.”This is a breaking news story and will be updated."
218,WaPo_130,Biden’s appearances since debate have not stopped calls to drop out,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/19/biden-events-after-debate-videos/,"In the three-plus weeks since his halting debate performance, President Biden has ramped up his public appearances to assure Americans, including members of his own party, that he is up to the task of a second term.Biden took to the campaign trail after the debate, holding rallies, sitting for interviews and making campaign stops. He’s made impassioned speeches and shown off policy knowledge, but he has also at times stumbled over words, mixed up names and meandered in speech.With his candidacy on the line as members of his party continue to call for him to step down, each appearance has been a high-stakes moment for Biden. Polls show that most Americans, including a majority of Democrats, would prefer another candidate at the top of the Democratic ticket.Here are six snapshots of Biden’s public appearances over the past three weeks — including times he’s parried concerns about his age successfully and times when his attempts have failed.The day Biden tested positive for covid, he returned to his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., to isolate. He was experiencing cold symptoms, including a cough and malaise, according to the White House.When he landed at Dover Air Force Base, Biden paused twice on the stairs as he disembarked the plane. He took two steps down before stopping, waving and smiling, then two more before pausing and gesturing again. He then descended the rest of the stairs. Reporters traveling with him noticed that he was moving slowly.During a visit to Nevada the day before, Biden flubbed his announcement of a new proposal to cap rental costs. The proposed policy would cap annual rent increases at 5 percent for tenants of landlords who own more than 50 units. Biden mistakenly announced that the policy would cap rent increases at $55.Biden was forceful in other parts of the speech, and the campaign stop reflected a major push from the White House to respond to voter anger over high housing prices. It was also an effort to reach Nevada voters, who have seen among the biggest jumps in housing costs nationwide and whose electoral votes Democrats have grown increasingly worried they could lose to Trump in November.A few days before his Nevada stop, Biden spoke forcefully at a campaign rally in Detroit on July 12, delivering an energetic vow to stay in the race. “There’s been a lot of speculation lately: ‘What’s Joe Biden going to do? Is he going to stay in the race? Is he going to drop out?’ Well, here’s my answer: I am running, and we’re going to win!” he shouted.He vowed to beat Trump again, insisting that he would stay in the race and making an impassioned case for his candidacy. He also spoke about what he would do in his first 100 days of a second term.“I’m the nominee,” he said to chants of support from the audience. “You the voters, you decided. No one else. And I’m not going anywhere.”Introducing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at an event during the mid-July NATO summit in Washington, Biden mistakenly called him “President Putin,” referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.Biden stepped away from the podium, then immediately caught himself. “President Putin! He’s going to beat President Putin. President Zelensky,” he corrected himself.That evening, Biden held a news conference seen as vitally important for rescuing his candidacy. Taking questions from reporters for almost an hour, the president showed his command of a range of topics but botched some words and names. Most notably, he referred to Vice President Harris as “Vice President Trump.”A little more than a week after the debate, Biden leaned on a familiar tactic: He joked about his age. Speaking at a church service in Philadelphia, he quipped, “I know I only look like I’m 40 years old, but I’ve been around a little bit.”“All kidding aside,” he continued, “I’ve been doing this a long time, and I honest-to-God have never been more optimistic about America’s future — if we stick together.”The church visit was part of a swing through Pennsylvania as Biden worked to drum up support in the key swing state while Democrats privately debated whether he should step aside.Among the many missteps Biden made at the debate was a moment when he appeared to lose his train of thought when responding to a question from CNN moderator Jake Tapper about tax cuts for the very wealthy.Biden suggested that raising taxes on the very wealthy — for whom Trump enacted tax cuts — would help wipe out the national debt incurred by Trump. Biden then began listing ways that additional tax influx could strengthen the health-care system. He appeared to lose his way, however, in describing the last item on his list, making a few false starts before ending with, “look — if — we finally beat Medicare—” He was cut off by the moderator, and the “We finally beat Medicare” line became one of his most notable gaffes of the night, with Trump quickly seizing on it.Toluse Olorunnipa, Yasmeen Abutaleb, Michael Birnbaum, Cleve R.

223,WaPo_131,"The hospitals, airlines and banks affected by the global IT outage",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/19/crowdstrike-outage-companies-impacted/,"Businesses around the globe scrambled to reboot their systems Friday after a widespread IT outage knocked out computer systems, causing chaos throughout the transportation, media and health-care industries.The outage, triggered by a faulty update pushed by cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, affected some Microsoft systems, stranding thousands of travelers and giving would-be workers a “blue screen of death” when they logged on in the morning.The software glitch caused massive disruption as it rippled across multiple sectors, grounding airplanes, forcing hospitals to cancel non-emergency procedures, causing issues with some banking systems and interrupting television broadcasts.Here are some of the major companies that have been affected by the massive outage.Travelers dealt with long delays and grounded flights Friday as airline workers hurried to check people in manually and restart their systems.More than 13,000 flights were canceled or delayed. By midday Friday, many airlines said flights were starting to resume. Dutch airline KLM said before 11 a.m. that its flight disruptions had been “almost completely resolved.” Delta said it had resumed some flights and issued travel waivers to would-be passengers, which they could use to rebook their flights within the next several days. But United Airlines warned that “schedule disruptions may continue.”Delta has resumed some flights after a vendor technology issue impacting airlines and businesses globally. We’ve issued a travel waiver and customers can monitor and manage their itineraries on https://t.co/oAYy2BBlGo or the Fly Delta app. For more info: https://t.co/GSbpUNpU9dSecretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg posted Friday on X that officials are continuing to monitor the impact of the IT outages on transportation systems across the country.“Many flights are impacted as systems recover — passengers should check with their airline for updates and visit our website for more on passenger protections,” he wrote.Several hospitals and health systems around the world reported technology issues Friday, forcing some to pause procedures or encourage patients to stay home if they could.“Just about every major health system in the world is using some level of Microsoft product, and they’re getting that blue screen of death,” said Carter Groome, CEO of First Health Advisory, a firm focused on digital risk to the health care sector. “I’ve not seen anything of this magnitude and impact in my career of 30 years.”Massachusetts General Hospital posted on X that “all previously scheduled non-urgent surgeries, procedures, and medical visits” were canceled Friday. Its emergency rooms remained open.In England, the National Health Service said the outage was causing issues with its patient record systems at general practitioner offices. “The NHS has long standing measures in place to manage the disruption, including using paper patient records and handwritten prescriptions, and the usual phone systems to contact your GP,” it wrote in a statement. Seattle Children’s Hospital closed its outpatient clinics Friday, and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center said it was pausing the start of procedures with anesthesia. Many health systems emphasized that their emergency services remained operational.Seattle Children’s information technology (IT) systems are down.

226,WaPo_139,"Biden wants government to stop buying soda bottles, other single-use plastics",https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/07/19/single-use-plastic-pollution-biden/,"The Biden administration Friday announced a commitment to phase out single-use plastics across the federal government, marking a significant step in tackling the growing plastic pollution crisis.As part of an expanded strategy to combat plastic pollution in the United States, the administration set a goal to phase out federal purchases of single-use plastics from food service operations, events and packaging by 2027, and from all federal operations by 2035.The federal government is the largest buyer of consumer goods in the world and this action could “significantly impact the supply” of these ubiquitous plastic products, according to an 83-page report detailing the administration’s plan. The administration also wants tougher regulations on plastics manufacturers, a source of greenhouse gas emissions. The report highlights that more than 90 percent of plastic is made from fossil fuels.By leveraging the federal government’s purchasing power, the administration hopes its latest effort will help reduce air pollution, protect public health and shift markets toward more sustainable plastic alternatives.“Tackling plastic pollution and its associated impacts will require unprecedented action at every stage of the plastic life cycle — from reining in the pollution from petrochemical production … to reorienting infrastructure to ensure dramatic increases in recycling and reuse,” wrote Brenda Mallory, chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, and Ali Zaidi, White House National Climate Adviser, in a letter attached to the report.The move to reduce plastic use domestically comes as the world is grappling with how to manage the staggering plastic waste problem.Upward of 460 million metric tons of plastic are produced every year, equivalent to the weight of more than 300,000 blue whales, according to the U.N. Environment Program. Much of the plastic that becomes waste are single-use products that can end up polluting land, waterways and oceans. As the hardy material breaks down in the environment, it creates microplastics — tiny particles smaller than five millimeters that have been found everywhere from Antarctic snow to inside human bodies.The Biden administration’s new report “so clearly lays out the severity and urgency of this crisis for our oceans, for our climate and for our communities,” said Anja Brandon, associate director of U.S. plastics policy at Ocean Conservancy, a nonprofit group.“The fact that it calls for comprehensive action throughout the full life cycle of plastics is a new recognition that we can’t solve this crisis without taking upstream action to reduce the amount of plastics we’re making and using in the first place,” Brandon said.She added that the federal government’s commitment to phase out single-use plastics is a “monumental” step.“When they throw their weight behind something, we know they can significantly shift the market,” she said.Biden’s commitments, however, come with a caveat. If former president Donald Trump returns to office following the election in November, it is widely anticipated that his administration would roll back a number of existing environmental and climate rules.Some environmental advocates emphasized the need for action and implementation following Friday’s announcement.“While commitments are important, the ‘how’ is essential,” Erin Simon, vice president and head of plastic waste and business at World Wildlife Fund, said in a statement. She noted that the new report “provides the strategic analysis needed to meet these goals.”“We’re heartened to see this report doesn’t shy away from the negative impacts that plastics have on human health and analyzes the problem through the full life cycle of plastic,” Simon said. “Cleaning up the global plastic mess must start at home. And today under President Biden and Vice President Harris’ leadership, the U.S. government is doing exactly that. The world is watching; now is the time for bold commitments and concrete action on plastic.”Representatives from oil and petrochemical industries did not immediately respond on Friday to the report."
236,WaPo_143,Nats’ Josiah Gray out for season after partial UCL tear that needs surgery,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/19/josiah-gray-injury-surgery/,"Washington Nationals right-hander Josiah Gray needs surgery to repair a partial tear of his ulnar collateral ligament, the 26-year-old said Friday, a procedure that will end his 2024 season. Gray, who was an all-star for Washington last year, probably will miss a significant portion of the 2025 season as well.Gray landed on the injured list in April with a strained right flexor muscle near his forearm and had been working toward a return, but his rehab start with Class AAA Rochester on June 30 prompted a closer look. His velocity dipped, and he allowed seven runs over three innings. Afterward, the Nationals shut him down and sought another opinion on his arm.“Obviously it will end the year and take away some of next year, but I’m going to fight tooth and nail to get back here as soon as possible and help these guys win some games,” Gray said.Gray is set to undergo surgery Wednesday, though he remained unsure whether he would have Tommy John, an internal brace procedure or a hybrid of the two — it depends on how significant the tear is. He plans to rehab in Washington so he can remain around the team.“Obviously I can’t go out there and suit up and get strikeouts,” Gray said. “But I’ll hopefully be an encourager as much as possible. I’m just grateful for that and grateful to be here.”Gray joined the Nationals in 2021 as part of the trade package for ace Max Scherzer and star shortstop Trea Turner. After a 2022 campaign in which he allowed an MLB-worst 38 home runs and walked a National League-leading 66 batters, Gray took a step forward in 2023.   He pitched to a 3.91 ERA and earned his first all-star appearance, though he struggled in the second half. Manager Dave Martinez showed his confidence in Gray this spring, naming him Washington’s Opening Day starter.Gray made two starts this season, posting a 14.04 ERA over 8⅓ innings. He hit the injured list in mid-April with a strained right flexor muscle near his forearm. Gray made five rehab starts in June, and after the fourth — an outing in which he allowed one run over six innings — Gray seemed poised to join the big league rotation again. Then came his fifth start, which didn’t go as expected.“I felt like I was oh, so close to getting back here in this clubhouse and contributing to wins,” Gray said. “Unfortunately, hit the hardest setback of all.”Gray already has talked with some of his fellow pitchers in the Nationals organization as well as Andre Jackson, who was previously part of the Los Angeles Dodgers organization with Gray and now plays in Japan. They helped give him a positive mind-set.“Honestly, I’m at peace with it,” Gray said. “I’ve understood that a lot of people have setbacks in their careers, and unfortunately mine is this year, 2024. I want to come back stronger and better for it.”"

0,NBC_1,"Kari Lake wins Arizona GOP Senate primary, setting up a key race against Democrat Ruben Gallego",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/kari-lake-wins-arizona-gop-senate-primary-ruben-gallego-rcna164043,"PHOENIX — Kari Lake won the Republican Senate primary in Arizona, NBC News projects, officially setting up a critical matchup against Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego. 
Lake, a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, was running ahead of Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb 54% to 40% with roughly 82% of the expected vote in. Former news anchor Elizabeth Reye placed a distant third. 
Lake advances to the general election for the seat being vacated by independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema against Gallego, a Phoenix-area House member and Marine veteran who ran unopposed in the Democratic primary. The race in battleground Arizona will be among a handful that determine partisan control of the Senate this fall. 
""This is not a battle between Democrats and Republicans. This is a battle between good and evil,"" Lake said at her election night event. ""This is a battle between the people who want to destroy this country and the people who want to save America.""
Lake, 54, a former newscaster, first emerged on the political scene during her unsuccessful run for governor in 2022 as a prominent promoter of Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. She later refused to accept her own loss to Democrat Katie Hobbs, who is now Arizona’s governor. 
Lake has heavily touted Trump’s endorsement again during her Senate campaign. She arrived at her polling location in Paradise Valley earlier Tuesday in a new tour bus that featured a giant decal of her with Trump and the words “Endorsed by President Trump.”
“Knowing that I’m Trump-endorsed is important to a lot of people here in Arizona,” Lake said.
Lake’s challenge will now take her MAGA-themed message to a broader electorate in a critical swing state for both the race for the White House and control of the Senate. Democrats hold a 51-49 majority in the Senate.
Gallego, 44, once a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, has played up his willingness to work across the aisle as he seeks statewide office. 
“In the 554 days since we launched this campaign, Arizonans in every corner of the state have made clear that they want a U.S. Senator who can bring people together to defend abortion rights, cut costs for families, protect our water future, and take care of our veterans — and that’s exactly what I intend to do,” Gallego said in a statement Tuesday night. 
Gallego enters the general election stage of the race with a cash advantage: He had $8.2 million in his campaign account compared to $2.1 million for Lake as of July 10. 
Arizona also hosted notable House primaries, several of which remained uncalled late Tuesday night. 
Freshman GOP Rep. Juan Ciscomani fended off a primary challenger in the swing 6th District, setting up a rematch with former state Sen. Kirsten Engel, a Democrat. 
Engel, who ran uncontested in Tuesday’s Democratic primary, lost to Ciscomani two years ago by less than 2 percentage points. The race for the seat — which covers a large chunk of the southeastern part of the state, including Tucson — is considered a toss-up by the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter. 
In another battleground, the 6th District, a crowded field of Democrats were vying to take on GOP Rep. David Schweikert. 
In the 8th District, former Maricopa County prosecutor Abe Hamadeh, financier Blake Masters and state House Speaker Ben Toma were locked in a tight race for the Republican primary. 
Hamadeh and Masters, 2020 election deniers who both ran unsuccessfully for statewide office two years ago, both had support from Trump. The winner of the primary will be a heavy favorite in the general election to replace retiring Rep. Debbie Lesko. 
And in the 3rd District, the seat Gallego is vacating to run for Senate, former Phoenix City Council member Yassamin Ansari and former state Democratic Party chair Raquel Terán were battling in the Democratic primary.
Further down the ballot, Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, a Republican who has forcefully pushed back against unfounded election fraud claims, was in a close race with state Rep. Justin Heap. The outcome could have a major impact on how elections are administered in the country's largest battleground county. Alex Tabet is a 2024 NBC News campaign embed.

0,CNN_36,Kari Lake wins GOP Senate primary in Arizona to take on Ruben Gallego in pivotal contest,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/politics/arizona-election-results-kari-lake-gallego/index.html,"
            Arizona Republican Kari Lake won her Senate primary Tuesday to face off against Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego in one of this fall’s most important races in the battle for control of the chamber.
    

            The two are competing for the seat of retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, an independent who caucuses with Democrats.
    

            Lake, who had the endorsement of the Senate Republican campaign arm, is projected to defeat Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb and neuroscientist Elizabeth Reye. Lamb had just over 40% of the Republican primary vote Tuesday night – a potential warning sign for Lake as she heads into the general election needing to consolidate the GOP base and reach out to independent voters. Gallego faced no opposition for the Democratic nomination Tuesday.
    

            Lake, a former local news anchor who lost the 2022 governor’s race in her first bid for political office, is a strident ally of former President Donald Trump. She is best known nationally for pushing lies about widespread election fraud – backing an audit of the 2020 presidential race and fighting in court to overturn her 2022 loss to Democrat Katie Hobbs.
    

            Gallego, a retired Marine who represents a deep-blue Phoenix-area seat, launched his campaign in early 2023, long before Sinema announced her retirement. Sinema was elected to the seat in 2018 as a Democrat – the first from the party to win a Senate contest in Arizona in 30 years.
    

            This year’s Senate race, like many others across the political map, has been shaken up by President Joe Biden’s late decision to forgo reelection and Vice President Kamala Harris’ emergence as the presumptive Democratic nominee. Republicans have focused their attacks on Harris over her handling of border security – an issue especially important in Arizona. However, polls have shown Harris with stronger appeal than Biden among young and non-White voters, which could help Gallego in the fast-growing Sun Belt state.
    

            Many GOP donors and strategists have expressed doubts over Lake’s chances of winning this fall, citing her feuds with fellow Republicans, including the family of the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, and her refusal to accept past election results. A recent Times (UK)/SAY24/YouGov poll found Gallego leading Lake 48% to 41% among registered Arizona voters. But if Trump does well enough in Arizona, he might be able to carry Lake to victory with him.
    

            Gallego, a onetime member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, has sought to define himself as a moderate through his early television ads, touting his military service and efforts to lower costs for families.
    

            Gallego enters the general election with a financial edge over Lake. He reported $8.2 million in his campaign coffers on July 10 compared with his opponent’s $2.1 million.

10,NBC_11,Far-right protesters clash with police near the site of U.K. stabbing attack that killed 3 girls,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/southport-stabbing-attack-far-right-clashes-uk-police-girls-killed-rcna164434,"Far-right protesters fueled by anger and false online rumors hurled bottles and stones at police, wounding more than 20 officers Tuesday outside a northwest England mosque near where three girls were fatally stabbed a day earlier.
Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the “thuggery” and said the crowd had hijacked what had earlier been a peaceful vigil attended by hundreds in the center of Southport to mourn the dead and 10 surviving stabbing victims, seven of whom were in critical condition.
Police said the violent crowd that torched a police van and several cars was believed to be supporters of the English Defence League, a far-right group, and the mayhem was inspired by rumors about the identity of the teenage suspect arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder.
“There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets,” Merseyside Police Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said.
Police previously said a suspect’s name circulating on social media was incorrect and the boy was born in Britain, contrary to online claims he was an asylum seeker.
The Liverpool Region Mosque Network posted a statement decrying the “heinous” stabbing as an attack against society that was unconnected to Islam.
“A minority of people are attempting to portray that this inhumane act is somehow related to the Muslim community,” the group said on the X social media platform. “Frankly it is not, and we must not let those who seek to divide us and spread hatred use this as an opportunity.”
Officers outside the Southport Mosque in riot gear were pelted with bricks torn from garden walls in the residential neighborhood by members of the crowd, some of whom wore masks, amid chants of “No surrender!” and “English till I die!” Firecrackers exploded, sirens wailed and a helicopter hovering overhead added to the chaos.
Twenty-two officers were hurt, with eight suffering from more serious injuries that included fractures, lacerations and a concussion. Two police dogs were wounded by bricks and a third suffered burns.
A day earlier, a short distance from the turmoil, the girls had taken part in a Taylor Swift-themed dance and yoga workshop on the first week of summer vacation when a teen armed with a knife entered the studio and began a vicious attack, police said.
“It’s difficult to comprehend or put into words the horror of what happened,” Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said while briefing members of Parliament. “What should have been a joyful start to the summer turned into an unspeakable tragedy.”Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6, died from their injuries, police said.
“Keep smiling and dancing like you love to do our princess,” Aguiar’s parents said in a statement released by police. “Like we said before to you, you’re always our princess and no one would change that.”
King’s family said no words could describe their devastation at the loss “of our little girl Bebe.”
Eight children and two adults remained hospitalized after the attack. Both adults and five of the children were in critical condition.
An emotional crowd that gathered in Southport outside The Atkinson theater and museum in the early evening held a minute of silence for the victims.
June Burns, the mayor of the Sefton region that contains Southport, called for calm and respect and urged people to be good to one another. She said she was overcome with emotion when she visited the scene of the tragedy earlier.
“It’s unbelievable that we find ourselves laying flowers for little girls who just wanted to dance,” she said.
Swift said earlier on Instagram that she was “completely in shock” and still taking in “the horror” of the event.
“These were just little kids at a dance class,” she wrote. “I am at a complete loss for how to ever convey my sympathies to these families.”
People left flowers and stuffed animals in tribute at a police cordon on the street lined with brick houses in the seaside resort near Liverpool where the beach and pier attract vacationers. They also posted online messages of support for teacher Leanne Lucas, the organizer of the event, who was one of those attacked.
The 17-year-old suspect was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder shortly after the attacks just before noon. Police said he was born in Cardiff, Wales, and had lived for years in a village about 3 miles from Southport. He has not yet been charged.
The rampage is the latest shocking attack in a country where a recent rise in knife crime has stoked anxieties and led to calls for the government to do more to clamp down on bladed weapons, which are by far the most commonly used instruments in U.K. homicides.
The prime minister was jeered by some as he visited the crime scene and lay a wreath of pink and white flowers with a handwritten note that said: “Our hearts are broken, there are no words for such profound loss. The nation’s thoughts are with you.”
“How many more children?” one person yelled as Starmer was getting in his car. “Our kids are dead and you’re leaving already?”
Starmer told reporters earlier that he is determined to get a grip on high levels of knife crime but said it was not a day for politics.
Witnesses described hearing screams and seeing children covered in blood in the mayhem outside the Hart Space, a community center that hosts everything from pregnancy workshops to women’s boot camps.
Joel Verite, a window cleaner riding in a van on his lunch break, said his colleague slammed on the brakes and reversed to where a woman was hanging on the side of a car covered in blood.
“She just screamed at me: ‘He’s killing kids over there. He’s killing kids over there,”‘ Verite told Sky News. (Sky News is owned by Comcast, the parent company of NBC News.)
The woman, who was on the phone with police, directed him to where the violence was unfolding and then collapsed. Verite said he ran in the direction she had pointed.
A woman honking the horn of her car caught his attention and he found her with five or six bloody children inside. The woman said she was trying to get the kids to safety.
“It was like a scene you’d see on a disaster film,” he said. “I can’t explain to you how horrific it is what I saw.”
He ran to the dance studio, where he was startled to lock eyes with a man in a hooded tracksuit holding a knife at the top of the stairs.
“All I saw was a knife and I thought: ‘There are more people in there,’ and I just wanted to hurt him so bad,” Verite said. “But I was scared for myself and I wanted to help people. So I came outside and I was screaming because I knew where he was.”
Britain’s worst attack on children occurred in 1996, when 43-year-old Thomas Hamilton shot 16 kindergartners and their teacher dead in a school gymnasium in Dunblane, Scotland. The U.K. subsequently banned the private ownership of almost all handguns.
Mass shootings and killings with firearms are exceptionally rare in Britain, where knives were used in about 40% of homicides in the year to March 2023.
Mass stabbings are also very rare, according to Iain Overton, executive director of Action on Armed Violence.
“Most knife attacks are one-on-one and personal — either domestic violence or gang related — so this tragedy is very unusual and, accordingly, garners lots of media interest,” Overton said. “This offers no comfort to the grieving families, of course.”The Associated Press"
10,CNN_19,Violent scenes as far-right protesters crash vigil for three girls killed in Southport knife attack,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/uk/southport-stabbing-vigil-violent-protests-intl-hnk/index.html,"
            Far-right protesters violently clashed with British police on Tuesday near a mosque in the northwest English town of Southport, a day after three young girls were stabbed to death in one of the worst assaults against children in the country in decades.
    

            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the group had “hijacked” a peaceful vigil held for those killed and injured in the attack “with violence and thuggery” and “insulted the community as it grieves.”
    

            Those involved “will feel the full force of the law,” Starmer added in the post on X.
    

            The violence followed a peaceful vigil in the seaside town attended by hundreds of mourners who laid wreaths, toys and candles in an emotional tribute to the three girls who were killed during the attack during a Taylor Swift-themed event at a dance school.
    

            Protesters, believed to be supporters of the far-right English Defence League, took to the streets in anger throwing bricks at a local mosque, setting cars and police vehicles alight and hurling bottles at police, Merseyside Police said in a statement.
    

            Police believe the crowd took to the streets over unconfirmed reports speculating on the identity of the teenage suspect, who was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder following Monday’s knife attack.
    

            Officers “sustained serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion,” Merseyside Police said. “Other officers have suffered varying degrees of injury including head injuries, serious facial injuries, and one was knocked unconscious.”
    

            Three police dogs were also injured, with two sustaining leg injuries from bricks thrown at them and one suffering burns, it added.
    

            “Yesterday, our officers and other members of the emergency services were faced with one of the most difficult situations they will ever face,” Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said in a police statement, referring to the horrific knife attack.
    

            “Tonight, they find themselves being attacked as they endeavour to prevent disorder,” he said.
    

            The North West Ambulance Service said it treated 39 police officers injured in the violence, 27 of whom were taken to hospital.
    

            Following the arrest in the stabbings case, an “incorrect” name linked to the suspect was spread on social media, police said.
    

            “There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody, and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets,” Goss said.
    

            “We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK, and speculation helps nobody at this time.”
    

            Police have said the suspect is from the village of Banks, near Southport, and was originally from Cardiff, Wales.
    

            Goss added that many of those involved in the violence were not local to the area, suggesting they traveled to Southport with the intention of causing unrest.
    

            The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) paid tribute to the girls killed in the attack and said in a statement that “Southport’s tragedy was shamelessly exploited to spark outrage, with Islamophobia fueling the fire and leading to tonight’s violence.”
    

            “This began with a false rumour on the internet, stoked by misinformation from a Russian news site, which wrongfully associated the crime with Muslims,” it said.
    

            The MCB said the government “must address the increasing rise of violent far-right extremism targeting Muslim communities. More must be done to tackle Islamophobia and offer reassurance at this time.”

15,NBC_16,Boar's Head recall expands to include 7 million pounds of deli meat over listeria concerns,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/boars-head-recall-expands-include-7-million-pounds-deli-meat-listeria-rcna164446,"A recall of Boar’s Head products has expanded to include a whopping 7 million additional pounds of deli and poultry items in a deadly multistate outbreak of listeria infections.
As of Tuesday, 34 people have gotten sick across 13 states in the outbreak — including 33 hospitalizations and two deaths. The fatalities were a patient in Illinois and another in New Jersey.
Last week, the deli meat company had recalled more than 207,000 pounds of deli meat, including liverwurst and ham products, because they may contain the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes.
Boar's Head has now expanded that recall, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced in a press release Tuesday. 
The expansion includes 71 products — including meat intended for slicing at delis, and some packaged meat and poultry products —produced from May 10 to July 29 under the Boar’s Head and Old Country Brand names.
The products have “sell by” dates ranging from July 29 through Oct. 17 this year (view the recalled product labels here), and were distributed to retail locations nationwide, and some to Cayman Islands, Dominican Republic, Mexico and Panama. 
Boar's Head said in a statement on its website that it had initiated the recall after a liverwurst sample collected by the Maryland Department of Health had tested positive for listeria. 
The Maryland Department of Heath and Baltimore City Health Department collected an unopened liverwurst product from a retail store for further testing that determined the product sample “tested positive for the outbreak strain,” the USDA release said.
Boar's Head said that the first voluntary recall was for its Strassburger Brand Liverwurst, and an additional nine products produced on the same production line at its Jarratt, Virginia, facility. 
On Monday, the company said it learned from the USDA “that our Strassburger Brand Liverwurst has been linked to the national deli meat Listeria monocytogenes outbreak” — and as a result the recall was expanded to include all items produced at the Jarratt facility.
“We have also decided to pause ready-to-eat operations at this facility until further notice. As a company that prioritizes safety and quality, we believe it is the right thing to do,” the company said.
“No words can fully express our sympathies and the sincere and deep hurt we feel for the families that have suffered losses and others who endured illness,” the statement added.
People who bought the recalled products should throw them away or return them to the store, and also clean out their refrigerators as the bacteria can grow in cold temperatures and spread to other foods.
An investigation is underway by the FSIS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state public health partners. 
Listeria infection is a food borne bacterial illness, most commonly caused by eating improperly processed deli meats and unpasteurized milk products, according to the Mayo Clinic. It’s the third-leading cause of death from food poisoning in the U.S.
Symptoms usually appear within two weeks of eating contaminated food, and include fever, muscle aches, tiredness, stiff neck and confusion. In severe cases, the bacteria may cause a blood infection or meningitis. The infection is dangerous for those who are older, with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women.
The CDC estimates that around 1,600 people get listeriosis each year, and about 260 die. Most cases aren’t linked to outbreaks, but there are usually a few outbreaks in a given year.Breaking News Reporter

For areas such as Cohasset, in Butte County, which has been ravaged by the enormous Park Fire, evacuation orders have been lifted but now the slow process of recovery has begun.
""This community's going to need a lot of support, a lot of aid. It’s a rural community, it’s not a city or a town, there’s no governmental structure here,"" Dan Collins, public information officer for Cal Fire said Tuesday.
""There are people that live here with little to no means and they just lost everything they own or everything they ever had,"" he said, adding that a local residents' association was asking for donations to help rebuild.The Park Fire, the fifth-largest in California’s history, has so far burned through more than 380,000 acres, or 600 square miles, across four counties and is just 18% contained, California’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said late Tuesday.
The fire's threat is far from over, as it continued to burn through inaccessible terrain full of dense vegetation. ""That’s going to be a continued challenge for us moving forward over the next couple of days,"" said Mark Brunton, an operations section chief with Cal Fire.The recently named Nixon Fire has burned through 4,500 acres or 7 square miles and was 0% contained on Tuesday night.
Dramatic video taken from a bodyworn camera shows a firefighter shooting water into the Park Fire along a roadside in California's Central Valley, with thick smoke filling the sky. The firefighter, who can be heard coughing, was part of a team that included 10 fire engines, bulldozers, a helicopter and 15 other personnel, Cal Fire's Sonoma-Lake Napa United said in a post on X.
Overall 5,500 firefighters are working just to stop the Park Fire, which has fed on dry grass and timber after a prolonged heat wave.
So far this year fires have burned through 750,000 acres, or 1,100 miles, across California, authorities say, a 2,800% increase on last year. Fire is causing devastation elsewhere, too.
More than 600 homes were evacuated after a new blaze ignited near Deer Creek Canyon, southwest of Denver, Colorado. A mandatory evacuation order is in place for Deer Creek Mesa, Sampson and Maxwell subdivisions southwest of Ken Caryl, Jefferson County Sheriff's Office said.
Named the Quarry Fire, the blaze grew to more than 100 acres overnight after it was spotted by a sheriff's deputy at 9 p.m. MST Tuesday.
One couple whose house is a quarter mile from the fire, were told to leave at 1:15 am. At first, they thought it was a prank.""The doorbell rang again. There was a flashlight in the window — it was the sheriff telling us we had to evacuate. There was a fire,"" Doug Ideker told NBC affiliate KUSA of Denver.
“I looked out the window and saw smoke and I could smell it so I felt a real sense of urgency we didn’t really have time to prep anything,"" his wife Terrie said.
The Alexander Mountain Fire and Stone Canyon Fires, both north of Boulder, are 80 miles apart but had overlapping evacuation orders Tuesday night.I cover early morning U.S. breaking news, everything from severe weather to crime.

California’s Park Fire is now the fifth-largest wildfire in the state’s history, and a man accused of starting the destructive flames appeared in court Monday. At the same time, dozens of other fires continue to rage in the Western United States and Canada and thousands have been forced to evacuate. Here’s the latest:


            • Park Fire climbs California’s record books: The fire, which began July 24, is now the fifth-largest wildfire in California history, having burned more than 386,000 acres, or 603 square miles, according to Cal Fire. “This region, both Butte and Tehama, over the course of time in California, has had four of the largest 10 fires known in history,” Cal Fire Incident Commander Billy See told a news conference Monday. As of Tuesday evening, it was 18% contained and had destroyed at least 192 structures and damaged 19 others across two of the affected counties. Cal Fire officials said more than 5,500 firefighters, including aerial and ground crews, had been working to quell the flames.
    

            • Man accused of igniting California’s Park Fire charged: Ronnie Dean Stout II has been charged with arson on suspicion of starting the Park Fire last week, a felony complaint filed Monday shows. A court document – similar to what authorities previously said – alleges in part that a witness saw him pushing a burning car down a 60-foot embankment. Stout is claiming he did not push the car, Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said at a news conference. Stout didn’t enter a plea during a court appearance Monday, but he was denied bail, and his arraignment was continued to Thursday, Ramsey said. More charges could be added, he said.

            • California resident once again loses home to fire: Standing in the charred remains of his house, Butte County resident Rick Pero told CNN affiliate KHSL the Park Fire was the second California wildfire to destroy his home. Pero and his wife moved to Forest Ranch after losing another property to 2018’s deadly Camp Fire. This time, Pero and his wife were away when they got an evacuation warning and told their house sitter to pack the car and leave, he told KHSL. “We said don’t wait for the order stage, go ahead and load up. And, unfortunately, he wasn’t able to get our shy cat out because it hides from people, so he got our other cat and loaded the car and was able to easily and successfully evacuate,” Pero said. He and his wife could still remain in Butte County, he said, but were also looking further afield. “It’s after two times, you know, live and learn,” he told KHSL. “This one was a harder one because of losing our little cat.”
    

            • Active wildfires in the US: Firefighters are dealing with 89 large active wildfires in the United States as of Tuesday– most of which were in the West, including 31 in Oregon and 10 in California and Idaho, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Together, the active fires cover more than 2 million acres.
    

            The agency stressed the need to have firefighters and firefighting resources available in areas where there was a high likelihood of fire breaking out due to the importance of an “initial attack” on new fires. “The vast majority of fire starts are contained at small sizes within 24 hours of their discovery,” it said.
    

            As the blazes continue, gusty winds could bring more fire concerns and the heat is expected to build across the West throughout this week, becoming more substantial by Friday and lingering into next week. Temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above normal are expected across parts of the Pacific Northwest and the Northern Rockies, and daily high temperature records could be tied or broken, especially across the Pacific Northwest, over the weekend.
    

            These fires have generated smoke that has drifted hundreds of miles and prompted air quality alerts across parts of California, Colorado, Idaho, Oregon and Washington. More alerts could be issued Tuesday.
    

            • Alberta’s Jasper Wildfire Complex remains ‘out of control’: In Canada, the Jasper Wildfire Complex is still burning in the largest national park in the Canadian Rockies. The Jasper National Park remained closed to the public and under an evacuation warning, officials in Alberta said Monday afternoon. Around 17,000 people have evacuated, officials noted. “While the wildfire remains classified as out of control, no significant growth has been reported as of this morning,” the municipality of Jasper said Monday afternoon, noting it is trying to plan bus tours for evacuated residents to see the damage once the area is deemed safe. The Jasper Wildfire Complex has scorched nearly 80,000 acres, Alberta Wildfire said.
    

            • Temperatures to rise this week amid Oregon wildfire: Oregon’s largest wildfire, the Durkee Fire, was 51% contained Tuesday morning after scorching more than 293,000 acres, according to InciWeb. It started July 17 near the Oregon-Idaho state line due to lightning, InciWeb states. Scattered showers from a cold front moved through the region Monday into early Tuesday, but no rainfall is expected the rest of the week and temperatures are expected to rise to triple digits by the weekend, which could impair firefighting efforts.
    

            • Evacuations ordered in Colorado: Thousands of evacuation orders have been issued after a wildfire broke out on Alexander Mountain near Loveland, Colorado, Monday, according to the Larimer County Sheriff’s Office. Smoke was reported west of Silverdale Ranch in the late morning and responders discovered a wildfire they have been fighting since, officials said at a news conference. Mandatory evacuation notices were sent to 2,635 devices registered to receive alerts in the area and voluntary notices were sent to another 1,491 devices. The sheriff’s office said it was unclear how many people the notices impacted and deputies were also going door-to-door to notify residents. As of Tuesday afternoon, the fire has burned through 1820 acres and is 0% contained, according to Inciweb.
    

            Stout, the suspect in California’s Park Fire, has been charged with arson of an inhabited structure or property, with the aggravating factors of multiple structures burning and an allegation Stout violated California’s three-strikes felony law, the complaint says. In California, each conviction for a violent or serious felony is counted as a “strike,” and people receive significantly longer prison sentences if convicted of a third felony.
    

            In a news conference Monday, Ramsey, the Butte County district attorney, detailed what he said were some of the events of July 24, the day the Park Fire began.
    

            That afternoon, Stout pulled his car over on the side of a dirt road and his vehicle got stuck in tall grass, Ramsey said. When Stout revved his engine to try to get out, a fire started, he said.
    

            A witness saw Stout next to the fire coming out of the front of his car, but said he did not try and stop it, according to a statement of facts arguing against bail for Stout. The witness saw Stout get in and out of the car, and then said he pushed the burning car down a 60-foot embankment, where the fire exploded, the statement of facts says.
    

            Stout is “admitting up to a point, but is saying he did not push his car,” Ramsey said.
    

            Shortly before the incident, Stout was seen drinking at a nearby swimming hole and witnesses said he “seemed to be highly intoxicated,” Ramsey said. Another witness said they saw him driving “extraordinarily recklessly” from the direction of the swimming hole to where the fire started, he continued.
    

            “This didn’t have to happen,” Ramsey said.
    

            When Stout was arrested early the next morning, almost 11 hours after the fire started, alcohol was found in his system above the legal limit, Ramsey said, but noted investigators had no evidence proving he was intoxicated at the time of the fire.
    

            CNN reached out to Stout’s attorney, Nicole Diamond, for comment on the allegation he was drunk at the time of the incident and to ask about Ramsey’s statement that he has partially admitted responsibility. She declined to comment.
    

            Triple-digit temperatures and high wind gusts have fueled the explosive growth of the Park Fire amid an active fire season in California. A staggering 751,327 acres have burned across the state so far in 2024, which is 29 times the amount of acres burnt in the state (25,763 acres) through the same portion of 2023, Cal Fire said.
    

            Wildfires burned more than 324,900 acres in California in all of 2023, Cal Fire said.
    

            “The numbers are a stark reminder: 95% of wildfires are caused by humans,” Cal Fire said.

24,NBC_25,"Tesla in fatal Seattle-area crash that killed motorcyclist was in self-driving mode, officials say",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tesla-fatal-seattle-area-crash-killed-motorcyclist-was-self-driving-mo-rcna164488,"The Tesla that hit and killed a motorcyclist near Seattle in April was running on the car’s self-driving system at the time of the crash, the state patrol confirmed to NBC News on Wednesday.
The crash unfolded on April 19 when the 56-year-old Tesla driver, of Snohomish County, was driving on autopilot behind the motorcycle on eastbound State Route 522 east of Maltby, according to Washington State Patrol, or WSP. 
The driver told authorities that he was looking down, distracted by his phone, when “the next thing he knew, there was a bang,” and the Tesla hit the motorcycle, a statement of probable cause said, NBC affiliate King 5 of Seattle reported.
Jeffrey Nissen, 28, of Stanwood, Washington, was ejected from the motorcycle and died at the scene, authorities said.
Chris Loftis of WSP told NBC News on Wednesday that the Criminal Investigative Division confirmed the vehicle was in ""Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) mode"" at the time of the collision.
The conclusion was made after downloading information from the event-data recorder on the car, Capt. Deion Glover of WSP told The Associated Press. 
It's illegal to drive in self driving mode without ""active control and attention of the driver,"" Loftis said. ""Bottom line — if you are behind the wheel, you are responsible and must be in full awareness.""
The car in the crash — a 2022 Tesla Model S — was not impaired at the time of the collision, according to WSP.
The driver, who was not named, was arrested on suspicion of vehicular homicide based on his admission of being distracted while using the autopilot feature. However, the driver was not officially charged. He posted bond before his initial hearing and the case was referred to the prosecutor for an out-of-custody charging decision, authorities said. 
The investigation is still ongoing, and the Snohomish County Prosecutor will ultimately determine if any charges will be filed in the case.

            A Tesla Model S car was in “Full Self-Driving” mode when it hit and killed a 28-year-old motorcyclist in the Seattle area in April, police said, making it at least the second fatal accident involving the technology on which Tesla CEO Elon Musk is pinning his hopes.
    

            The 56-year-old driver was arrested on suspicion of vehicular homicide based on his admission that he was looking at his cell phone while using the driver assistant feature, police said in a statement.
    

            Tesla says its “Full Self-Driving (Supervised)” software requires active driver supervision and does not make vehicles autonomous.
    

            Previously, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said there was one fatal accident involving a Tesla vehicle using FSD software between August 2022 and August 2023.
    

            The NHTSA said that it “is aware of this crash and is gathering information from local law enforcement and Tesla.”
    

            The police said the case remains under investigation, but experts say there are limitations to Tesla’s technology dependent on cameras and artificial intelligence. Tesla’s rivals such as Alphabet’s Waymo also uses expensive sensors like lidars to detect the driving environment.

Elon Musk said Tesla robotaxi skeptics should try ‘full self driving.’ A Wall Street analyst nearly crashed


            “There are so many things that can go wrong” with Tesla’s camera-only system, said Guidehouse Insights analyst Sam Abuelsamid. For instance, he said it can inaccurately measure how far away an object is.
    

            “It is extremely challenging to collect and curate data from all sorts of real-world elements such as motorcycles and bicycles in the broad range of possible weather, lightning, road and traffic conditions,” said Raj Rajkumar, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.
    

            This year, Musk shelved Tesla’s all-new affordable cars and increased his bets on self-driving vehicles, saying he will be shocked if Tesla cannot achieve full self-driving capability next year.
    

            Speaking in an interview with the Tesla Owners of Silicon Valley club last weekend, he said a future vehicle will be like a “tiny mobile lounge” where drivers will be able to watch movies, play video games, work and even drink and sleep.
    

            Musk has been aiming to achieve self-driving capability for several years, with the technology under growing regulatory and legal scrutiny.
    

            The NHTSA began a probe of Autopilot in August 2021 after identifying more than a dozen crashes in which Tesla vehicles had hit stationary emergency vehicles, and reviewed hundreds of crashes involving Autopilot.
    

            In December 2023, Tesla was forced to recall nearly all its vehicles on U.S. roads to add safeguards to the software.

26,NBC_27,Florida school staffer suspended for allowing trans daughter on girls volleyball team,https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/florida-school-staffer-suspended-allowing-trans-daughter-girls-volleyb-rcna164453,"A staffer at a Florida high school was suspended Tuesday after a county school board said she allowed her transgender daughter to play on a girls sports team in violation of state law. 
The School Board of Broward County voted 5-4 to suspend Jessica Norton from her job as a computer information specialist at Monarch High School in Coconut Creek — a city about 15 miles north of Fort Lauderdale — after she permitted her trans daughter to play on the school’s varsity volleyball team last year. 
Norton, who has worked for Broward County Public Schools for seven years, was suspended from her job without pay for 10 days. Norton avoided termination, which was recommended by the district’s superintendent, Howard Hepburn.
“I mean, obviously I don’t want to get fired from my job, I love my job, but I don’t think the decision for any suspension was correct,” Norton said after Tuesday’s board meeting, according to NBC South Florida. 
Broward County Public Schools did not immediately return a request for comment.
The school board found that Norton violated Florida’s Fairness in Women’s Sports Act, a 2021 law that forbids trans girls and women from competing on school sports teams that match their gender identities. 
“She knew what the law was, she made a decision not to follow the law, and that needs to have consequence to it,” school board member Debbie Hixon said during the meeting.
Norton’s suspension concludes a monthslong controversy over her daughter’s participation on her high school’s girls volleyball team.
In November, the district reassigned Norton and Monarch High School’s principal, assistant principal and athletic director to nonschool sites over the matter. Their reassignments prompted hundreds of students to stage walkouts and hold demonstrations in support of Norton’s daughter. 
Officials then fined Monarch High School $16,500 in December and placed the high school on probation for a full calendar year. The Florida High School Athletic Association also barred Norton’s daughter from participating in any of the state’s school sports teams for approximately one year.
The teenager, now 16, left Monarch High School in November and has since been enrolled in an online school. 
“Nobody can understand what we’ve been through. We’ve been through death threats, harassing phone calls, letters sent to our house, and this was all because something that they did, it wasn’t something that I did,” Norton said. “I was protecting my child. Again, I did nothing wrong.”
Florida is one of 26 states that have measures  limiting trans participation in school sports in some capacity, according to LGBTQ think tank Movement Advancement Project.
Norton and her daughter sued Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Broward County School Board and several other Florida officials over the law in 2021. The lawsuit remains pending.

            A South Florida school district on Tuesday voted to give a 10-day suspension to an employee accused of allowing her transgender daughter to play on a girls’ high school volleyball team in 2022 and 2023 in violation of state law.
    

            The suspension of Jessica Norton, an information management technician and a volunteer junior varsity volleyball coach at Monarch High School in Coconut Creek, was approved in a 5-4 vote by the Broward County school board.
    

            Norton will be moved to a different job after the suspension ends, the board said. Superintendent Howard Hepburn had recommended Norton be fired, citing the district’s investigation of the situation, though board members voting in the majority followed a district committee’s recommendation that Norton be suspended.
    

            After Tuesday’s meeting, Norton expressed mixed feelings about the vote.
    

            “Obviously, I don’t want to get fired from my job. I love my job,” she said. “But I don’t think that the decision for any suspension was correct.”

Florida principal reassigned during investigation into transgender student playing on girls’ volleyball team


            Norton and several other school staff members were reassigned to non-school sites in November, pending an investigation, after district officials learned her transgender daughter played on the school’s varsity volleyball team. Of the school staff members reassigned in November, only Norton was not cleared of wrongdoing.
    

            Under Florida’s Fairness in Women’s Sports Act, which was signed into law in 2021 by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, transgender girls are banned from playing on girls’ sports teams at public schools in Florida.
    

            In December, state athletic officials said Monarch High was placed on one-year administrative probation and fined $16,500 for allowing the transgender girl to play on the girls’ volleyball team.
    

            In a three-page letter to Monarch High School’s interim principal, the Florida High School Athletic Association accused the school of violating the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act and an association bylaw, both of which prohibit “biological males” from playing on women’s sports teams at public schools. The transgender student played 33 matches during the 2022-23 and 2023-24 volleyball seasons, the letter stated.
    

            Norton’s daughter, who now attends school virtually, was banned from playing sports for any member school” through November 2024, according to the letter.

            In a March response to the investigation, Norton’s lawyers stressed that Norton was a volunteer junior varsity volleyball coach – not a coach for the varsity team – and “had no role, responsibility, or authority in the try-out and selection process for either team, nor in running any practices or coaching in games.”
    

            At Tuesday’s meeting, Norton walked out at one point after a board member repeatedly referred to Norton’s daughter as “her son” while reading from a state Department of Education report and making her own observations.
    

            Norton said she has not decided whether she will return to Monarch High School.
    

            “I loved my job, and I loved my students. I loved everything about it. … We’ll see what happens,” she said, adding she would discuss her future at the school with her daughter.
    

            Under Florida’s law, public secondary school and college sports teams are required to be designated based on “biological sex.” The act defines a student’s “biological sex” as the one that was printed on the student’s official birth certificate at or near the time of birth.
    

            The Florida case came amid a nationwide spate of legal backlash against transgender students’ participation in school sports, particularly in Republican-led states.

37,NBC_38,Trump stuns at Black journalists' conference after suggesting Kamala Harris 'became Black',https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-focuses-harris-race-black-jobs-combative-panel-black-journalists-rcna164271,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ race took center stage in a combative back-and-forth exchange with former President Donald Trump during a panel discussion Wednesday at a gathering of Black journalists in Chicago. 
“I did not know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now wants to be known as Black,” Trump said.
“I respect either one,"" he added, ""but she obviously doesn't, because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden, she made a turn and she went she became Black. ... Somebody should look into that too.”
It was in response to a question about the appropriateness of some Republicans saying Harris is a “DEI hire,” a term referring to workplace policies promoting ""diversity, equity and inclusion."" It has increasingly been used by some on the right to discredit people of color with opposing political views. 
Harris, who is the Democratic Party's de-factor nominee after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, is Indian American and Black.
ABC News’ Rachel Scott, one of the three moderators at the event hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists, noted that Harris has always identified as Black, but Trump did not directly respond. 
Scott did quickly ask again if Trump thought Harris was a DEI hire, to which he said he was unsure.
“I really don’t know,” Trump said. “Could be.”
During the White House press briefing, which was happening at the same time, NBC News read Trump's comments to Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and asked her to respond. 
""As a person of color — as a Black woman who is in this position that is standing before you at this podium, behind this lectern — what he just said, what you just read out to me is repulsive. It's insulting. And you know, no one has any right to tell someone who they are, how they identify. That is no one's right,"" she said. 
A source close to Harris also said Trump's comments were ""painful.""
""It’s simply a lie and easily disproved,"" this person added. ""She went to Howard for Christ sake! She’s an AKA.” 
Harris attended Howard University, a historically Black college, and she was a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, which is a historically Black organization.
The overall panel discussion was combative throughout. Trump began the discussion by blasting Scott's question about why Black voters should trust him, calling it ""nasty"" and blaming NABJ for equipment errors that led to the event being delayed by more than 30 minutes.
""I don’t think I’ve ever been asked a question so in such a horrible manner,"" Trump said, saying ABC News was a ""fake"" and ""terrible"" network. 
Trump was also asked to clarify his comments during the June presidential debate, when he said immigrants were coming to the United States and taking ""Black jobs.""
""A Black job is anybody that has a job,"" he said. ""That’s what it is. Anybody that has — they’re taking the employment away from Black people. They’re coming in, and they’re coming in, they’re invading.""

37,CNN_71,Donald Trump falsely suggests Kamala Harris ‘happened to turn Black’,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/politics/donald-trump-kamala-harris-black-nabj/index.html,"
            Former President Donald Trump falsely claimed Wednesday that his 2024 Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, “happened to turn Black” a few years ago, saying that “all of a sudden, she made a turn” in her identity.
    

            Trump’s comments at a gathering of Black journalists in Chicago came when an interviewer asked him whether he agreed with Republicans on Capitol Hill who have characterized Harris as a “DEI hire.” Trump responded by questioning Harris’ heritage.
    

            “She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black. So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?” the former president said.
    

            “I respect either one, but she obviously doesn’t, because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she went – she became a Black person,” he said at the National Association of Black Journalists convention. “I think somebody should look into that too.”
    

            Trump’s comments are reminiscent of his similar attacks on Black political rivals in the past, including the years he spent pushing the false, racist “birther” conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States.
    

            Harris’ mother was Indian and her father is Jamaican; both immigrated to the United States. Harris was born in Oakland, California, and attended a historically Black university, Howard University, in Washington. She is the first female, first Black and first Asian American vice president.
    

            Trump on Wednesday was interviewed by a panel that included ABC News’ Rachel Scott, Semafor’s Kadia Goba and Fox News’ Harris Faulkner.
    

            Scott began the interview by asking Trump: “You have pushed false claims about some of your rivals, from Nikki Haley to former President Barack Obama, saying that they were not born in the United States, which is not true. You have told four congresswomen of color, who were American citizens, to go back to where they came from. You have used words like ‘animal’ and ‘rabid’ to describe Black district attorneys. You have attacked Black journalists, calling them a ‘loser,’ saying the questions they ask are, quote, ‘stupid’ and ‘racist.’ You’ve had dinner with a White supremacist at your Mar-a-Lago resort. So my question, sir – now that you are asking Black supporters to vote for you, why should Black voters trust you after you have used language like that?”
    

            A combative Trump responded: “Well, first of all, I don’t think I’ve ever been asked a question so – in such a horrible manner, first question. You don’t even say, ‘Hello. How are you?’”
    

            He asked Scott if she was with ABC, saying the network was “a fake news network” and “a terrible network.”
    

            “I think it’s disgraceful that I came here in good spirit. I love the Black population of this country. I’ve done so much for the Black population of this country, including employment, including opportunity zones with Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina,” the former president said. “I’ve done so much, and, you know, I say this: Historically Black colleges and universities were out of money, they were stone cold broke, and I saved them. I gave them long-term financing, and nobody else was doing it.”
    

            “It’s a very rude introduction. I don’t know exactly why you would do something like that,” Trump said.
    

            Scott asked if Trump found it acceptable that some Republicans on Capitol Hill have referred to Harris as a “DEI hire” – using the acronym for diversity, equity and inclusion.
    

            “I really don’t know. Could be. Could be,” he said.
    

            The former president also repeatedly criticized the organization for the event’s set-up, which he said made it difficult to hear other panelists and delayed the start of the event. A spokesperson for NABJ told CNN that technology issues had delayed the start.
    

            Trump in his remarks called himself “the best president for the Black population since Abraham Lincoln,” a comment that drew audible groans from the journalists in attendance. He ignored a follow-up question about whether he was better than Lyndon B. Johnson, who signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 into law.
    

            “I have been the best president for the Black population since Abraham Lincoln,” he said. “For you to start off a question-and-answer period, especially when you’re 35 minutes late because you couldn’t get your equipment to work, I think it’s a disgrace. I really do, I think it’s a disgrace.”

37,CNN_91,Fact check: Trump’s lie that Harris ‘all of a sudden’ embraced a Black identity,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/politics/fact-check-debunking-trumps-lie-that-harris-suddenly-embraced-a-black-identity/index.html,"
            Former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, drew gasps on Wednesday when he said at the National Association of Black Journalists convention that Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, had suddenly adopted a Black identity.
    

            Harris’ father is from Jamaica, her late mother from India. Trump claimed: “I’ve known her a long time, indirectly, not directly very much, and she was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black. So I don’t know, is she Indian, or is she Black?”
    

            As one of the journalists who was interviewing Trump on stage tried to tell him that Harris had always identified as Black and had attended a historically Black college, Trump continued, “I respect either one, but she obviously doesn’t. Because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden, she made a turn, and she went – she became a Black person. And I think somebody should look into that, too.”
    

            Trump’s comments prompted immediate bipartisan criticism. Leaving aside the issue of the appropriateness of the remarks, his claims are just not true.
    

Facts First: Trump’s claims are false. Harris did not “all of a sudden” begin identifying as Black. She has embraced and discussed her Black identity for decades, beginning long before she became a political candidate, while also honoring her South Asian heritage.


            Harris graduated in 1986 from Howard University, a historically Black institution where she was a member of a historically Black sorority. After that, she was elected president of the association of Black law students in her second year at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, she wrote in her 2019 memoir.
    

            Politico reported in 2021 that, as a third-year student at the law school in 1989, Harris rose to speak against anti-Black racism at a campus demonstration prompted by the discovery of racist vandalism. Politico reported: “For Black students, she said, according to archives of the Hastings Law News, the cartoon was an example of ‘what we deal with all the time.’”
    

            A profile of Harris in the publication AsianWeek in 2003, when she was running for San Francisco district attorney, was focused on her South Asian heritage. But it quoted Harris discussing her father as “a Black man” and saying, “I grew up with a strong Indian culture, and I was raised in a Black community. All my friends were Black and we got together and cooked Indian food and painted henna on our hands, and I never felt uncomfortable with my cultural background.”
    

            Harris’ official online biography in 2005 as San Francisco district attorney referred to her as “the first African American woman in California to hold the office” and noted that she had attended “America’s oldest black university.” She wrote in a 2009 book about her childhood trips to both India and Jamaica, where, she wrote, “my father and uncles would talk to us about the complicated struggles of the people of Jamaica - the history of slavery, colonialism, and immigration.”
    

            Her official online biography as California attorney general referred to her as “the first African American woman and South Asian American woman in California to hold the office” of San Francisco district attorney. In 2017, her first year as a US senator for California, she spoke about how she was “the second Black woman elected to the United States Senate.”
    

            Harris wrote in the 2019 memoir about how her mother’s family instilled her and her sister Maya with “pride in our South Asian roots,” but also that “my mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters. She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women.”
    

            Harris said in another 2017 speech: “Look at my own life, where a daughter of a South Asian mother and a Jamaican father concluded her own interfaith wedding with her husband breaking a glass and everyone yelling, ‘Mazel tov.’”
    

            Trump made numerous other false claims in his remarks at the Wednesday gathering.Among other claims we have fact-checked before, Trump:
    

            - Wrongly referred to Harris as President Joe Biden’s “border czar.” Her actual immigration-related assignment from Biden, to lead a diplomatic effort to tackle “root causes” of migration in three Central American countries, was much more limited.
    

            - Falsely claimed that the US has its worst inflation in “over 100 years.” Even at its 9.1% peak during the Biden presidency, inflation was at about a 41-year high, and it has since plummeted to 3%.
    

            - Falsely claimed he was “protected” under the Presidential Records Act for taking official documents after his presidency. That law actually requires presidents to return all documents to the federal government when they leave office.
    

            - Falsely claimed that “everybody,” including Democrats, wanted Roe v. Wade overturned and the issue of abortion policy returned to individual states. In fact, polls have consistently shown about two-thirds of the public as a whole and an even higher percentage of Democrats had wanted Roe to be preserved.
    

            - Repeated his never-substantiated claim about foreign countries opening up their prisons to allow criminals to migrate to the US.
    

            - Falsely claimed that Haris “didn’t pass” the bar exam. Harris failed on her first attempt, which is common in California, but then passed; she was admitted to the California bar in 1990, the year after she graduated from law school. (Trump, appearing to respond to an objection from someone in the crowd, conceded a bit later that Harris “maybe” had passed.)
    

            - Falsely claimed that “nobody died” on January 6, 2021. Four Trump supporters at the Capitol died that day, three from medical emergencies and one after she was shot by police while trying to break into a sensitive part of the building. (Trump mentioned the shooting right before he claimed nobody died.) In addition, Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who was attacked with pepper spray during the riot, died after suffering strokes the next day; the medical examiner found that Sicknick died of natural causes, but also told The Washington Post that “all that transpired played a role in his condition.”

57,NBC_58,"Gen x, millennials face higher risk of 17 cancers than older generations",https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-gen-x-millennials-17-types-reverse-trend-rcna164376,"Younger generations have a heightened risk of some cancers, new research found. 
A study published Wednesday in Lancet Public Health found that Gen X and millennials are more likely to be diagnosed with 17 types of cancer, including nine that had been declining in older adults. Researchers aren’t sure why, but say obesity is likely a leading cause.
“What is happening in these generations can be considered a bellwether for future cancer trends,” said Hyuna Sung, a cancer epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society, who led the research. 
Rates of colorectal cancer — one of the 17 types — have been rising among younger people for decades, a troubling trend that sparked investigation into other types of cancer. Sung and her colleagues used cancer diagnosis and mortality data from two databases –– the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics –– to analyze cancer trends in people born between 1920 and 1990, who were diagnosed with cancer between 2000 and 2019. 
The data included 34 types of cancer, nearly 24,000,000 diagnoses and more than 7 million deaths. To get a better view of how cancer diagnoses and mortality rates changed in groups of people born around the same year –– called a birth cohort –– the researchers grouped people by birth year in five-year intervals. For example, people born in 1920 through 1924 were all one birth cohort. 
Seventeen of the 34 cancers had increasing incidence in younger people. The risk was two-to-three times higher in people born in 1990, for pancreatic, kidney and small intestine cancers, compared to people born in 1955. Liver cancer diagnoses in women followed the same pattern. 
“The most important thing it tells us is there is something that changed for the group of individuals born after this period of time. They have been exposed to some environmental or lifestyle factor that is leading to this shift,” said Dr. Andrea Cercek, a gastrointestinal medical oncologist at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who was not involved with the research. 
After declining for decades, these types of cancers ​​have begun to climb again: 
While the study found that mortality declined or was stable in younger generations for most cancers, mortality rate increased among younger age groups for endometrial, intrahepatic bile duct, gallbladder, colorectal and testicular cancers, as well as liver cancer among women. 
Endometrial cancer was the fastest growing for both diagnoses and mortality.
“That was a sobering finding,” said Sung. “Although many cancer rates are rising, we don’t necessarily see this increase in mortality because we are treating them a lot better than before.”
Many of the cancers found to be on the rise are still rare in young people and, while rates have increased, the overall number of cases is comparatively low. 
“It is clearly happening. Almost all the oncologists I know of can say they see it,” Brawley said, adding that despite the alarming increases, it’s important to keep in mind that most cancer diagnoses still happen in people older than 50 years. 
“In the 1990s, 10% of people diagnosed with colon cancer were under age 50. Now it’s 20%, but we should not forget the 80% that are still over the age of 50,” he said. 
Looking at people born within a specific time period can give important clues into why certain types of cancer are rising among younger generations. 
“All of these cancers are linked to the obesity epidemic. We know that’s the second-leading cause of cancer right now, behind tobacco use,” said Dr. Otis Brawley, Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of Oncology and Epidemiology Johns Hopkins University, who was not involved with the new study. 
About 20% of cancer diagnoses in the U.S. are linked to excess body weight, according to the American Cancer Society. Obesity rates in the nation changed little in the 1960s and 1970s, but increased sharply after that. About 13% of adults had obesity in 1980, compared to 34% in 2008, according to data from the Surgeon General. 
Among children, obesity rates grew from 5% to 17% in the same period. Today, more than 40% of American adults and about 20% of children and adolescents are obese, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. 
If obesity is a culprit, it’s likely one of several lifestyle and environmental factors that is leading to the rise. Other factors could be more sedentary behavior or something in the food or the water, common medications or chemical exposures or chemical agents, the experts said.
The overuse of antibiotics is another possible link under scrutiny. Antibiotics are known to change the gut microbiome, which has been linked to colorectal cancer. While antibiotics are needed to treat many bacterial infections, they’re often misused and taken for issues that are not bacterial, or that do not require antibiotics.  
“The list of things we are potentially investigating is very long,” Cercek said. “Antibiotics are one of the top culprits on the list.”
Researchers still don’t understand what’s behind the rise in certain types of cancers among younger generations. Although obesity and antibiotics are primary suspects, “we can’t rule out other chemical exposures or chemical agents,” Brawley said.

57,WaPo_147,Gen X and millennials at higher cancer risk than older generations,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/07/31/cancer-rates-younger-generations/,"Generation X and millennials are at an increased risk of developing certain cancers compared with older generations, a shift that is probably due to generational changes in diet, lifestyle and environmental exposures, a large new study suggests.In a new study published Wednesday in the Lancet Public Health journal, researchers from the American Cancer Society reported that cancer rates for 17 of the 34 most common cancers are increasing in progressively younger generations. The findings included:“It is a concern,” said Ahmedin Jemal, senior vice president of the American Cancer Society’s surveillance and health equity science department, who was the senior author of the study.If the current trend continues, the increased cancer and mortality rates among younger people may “halt or even reverse the progress that we have made in reducing cancer mortality over the past several decades,” he added.While there is no clear explanation for the increased cancer rates among younger people, the researchers suggest that there may be several contributing factors, including rising obesity rates; altered microbiomes from unhealthy diets high in saturated fats, red meat and ultra-processed foods or antibiotic use; poor sleep; sedentary lifestyles; and environmental factors, including exposure to pollutants and carcinogenic chemicals.Researchers analyzed data from more than 23.5 million patients who had been diagnosed with 34 types of cancer from 2000 to 2019. They also studied mortality data that included 7 million deaths from 25 types of cancer among people ages 25 to 84 in the United States.Expanding on their previous research, which had identified eight types of cancer in which incidence rates increased among younger generations, the researchers have found an additional nine, including some that had previously declined among older birth cohorts before rising in younger populations.The study did not examine factors including household income, insurance status, race or ethnicity.Younger people, or those under 50, represent a minority of the overall population of those who develop cancer, “but the concern is that cancer is occurring at younger and younger ages, so this increased incidence raises very real concerns as that population continues to age,” said Ernest Hawk, vice president and head of the division of cancer prevention and population sciences at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.At the same time, the researchers also noted that there has been a drop in cervical cancer rates among younger women, which they attribute to vaccination against the human papillomavirus (HPV). Smoking-related cancers such as lung, larynx and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma also declined, though progress has slowed among the youngest age groups, the researchers said.Routine screening tests are recommended for only four cancers — colon, cervical, breast and, for some people, lung — and a number of younger people who are at average risk do not meet the age requirements or, for various reasons, are not getting screened. Some experts have pointed to potential harms from widespread screening, including false positives that may take a psychological toll and lead to unnecessary follow-up tests and procedures.“The problem becomes that patients are getting younger and younger, we don’t always have good screening to begin with, and then we can’t really screen such large populations,” said Andrea Cercek, a gastrointestinal oncologist and co-director of the Center for Young Onset Colorectal and Gastrointestinal Cancers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.In the new study, breast, gallbladder and other biliary cancers, and uterine cancer rates increased across almost all age groups, rising faster among younger generations. While breast cancer rates among women younger than 40 remain low, in a separate study, breast cancer still accounted for the highest number of early-onset cancer cases.Recent and growing evidence showing that more women in their 40s are getting breast cancer prompted the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force last year to change its previous guidance, lowering the age for routine screening mammograms from age 50 to 40.Routine mammograms are not as effective for women with dense breasts, however, which is more common among those who are younger, said Elizabeth Comen, a breast cancer oncologist and associate professor at New York University Langone Health’s Perlmutter Cancer Center.“Understanding how we can better screen and detect cancers in younger patients is a massive unmet need,” said Comen, who added that many of her younger patients find their own breast cancer.In recent years, the recommended age for colorectal cancer screening was also lowered, from age 50 to 45, as research has shown a trend toward  diagnoses at younger ages. The new study found that increases in stomach and colorectal cancer rates were confined to younger age groups, meaning that while colorectal cancer rates are declining overall, there is a rise in incidence in younger populations.But many people who are eligible are not getting colorectal cancer screenings. A 2021 study reported that fewer than 4 million of the eligible 19 million adults ages 45 to 49 years were up-to-date on screenings, which can include a newly approved blood test, a stool test or a visual test such as a colonoscopy or CT colonography.Even when symptoms arise, “I think many younger folks ignore them, thinking they cannot get cancer because they’re young,” said Rashmi Verma, an oncologist who specializes in gastrointestinal cancers at the Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of California at Davis, adding that she has treated patients as young as 20.Others may be uninsured or not aware that screening tests are recommended for them, experts said.When some younger patients seek care for gastrointestinal symptoms, they are misdiagnosed with other conditions such as hemorrhoids or irritable bowel syndrome, so it is important to consult a gastroenterologist, Verma said.But for most cancers, including pancreatic cancer, there are no screening tests — at any age — which can lead to late diagnoses and more limited treatment options, experts said.While there have been advances in diagnostics and treatment, oftentimes, malignant pancreatic tumors (and some others) are discovered incidentally during imaging for other issues, said Charles J. Yeo, a professor and chair of the department of surgery at Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University.The increasing cancer rates among younger generations highlights the need for further study to both pinpoint a cause for planning prevention as well as to develop better — and, in many cases, any — screening tests to help detect cancers in younger people earlier in the course of disease when treatment is often more effective, experts said.The rising rates also raise questions about what happens to younger patients in survivorship.“There are going to be young cancer survivors who are deeply impacted biologically, physically and psychologically from these diagnoses,” Comen said. “And that’s going to have a ripple effect in our society that our medical community needs to be equipped to address.”"

The States cruised to a 103-86 win, moving to 2-0 in group play. South Sudan fell to 1-1 with the loss.
The U.S. led for the vast majority of the contest. After a little bit of back-and-forth action early, USA took a lead with just under four minutes to go in the first quarter and would hold on to it for the rest of the night. 
Bam Adebayo was the star performer in the game. Coming off the bench, he scored 18 points on 8-for-10 shooting, draining two 3s and adding seven rebounds and two blocks for good measure. It was a balanced effort elsewhere, with five other players scoring in double digits. 
It was a little bit of a different look for the U.S. compared to its opener against Serbia. In that game, Joel Embiid started at center while Jayson Tatum infamously never made it on the court. Against South Sudan, coach Steve Kerr started Anthony Davis in place of Embiid, and Tatum in place of Jrue Holiday.
Embiid didn’t play at all, while Holiday was part of the bench group that included Adebayo, Kevin Durant, Derrick White and Anthony Edwards. Tyrese Haliburton also saw his first action of the Olympics, meaning 11 players earned minutes Wednesday.
Outside of a very brief injury scare to Davis in the second, and a South Sudan run that cut the lead from 21 points to 10 in the third, the U.S. didn’t run into any trouble. It was quite a reversal from the exhibition the two countries played on July 20. In that game, the States squeaked out a 101-100 win thanks to a LeBron James layup in the waning seconds.
South Sudan had the U.S.’s full focus on Wednesday, and it was overwhelming. The ball movement was popping offensively, while the defense was stifling, particularly the second unit led by Adebayo, Holiday and White. South Sudan turned the ball over 19 times, a big no-no as the U.S. thrives in the open floor. 
Coupled with a blowout win over Serbia to start group play, the U.S. has been taking care of business to start the Paris Games. It will wrap up group play versus Puerto Rico on Saturday. Rohan Nadkarni is a sports reporter for NBC News. "

Israel did not immediately comment, but it usually does not make public comments on assassinations carried out by their Mossad intelligence agency.
""The fact that such a high ranking Hamas leader was assassinated on Iranian soil was an added bonus for Israel particularly directly after he participated in the inauguration ceremony of the new Islamic Republic president,"" Lisa Daftari, Middle East analyst and editor-in-chief at The Foreign Desk, told Fox News.

""We have seen Israel conduct very targeted and strategic hits against key players in the Islamic Republic such as nuclear scientists,"" Daftari continued. ""We've also seen Israel conduct targeted hits on weapons depots and other critical infrastructures in Iran, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon. Given the numerous threats that surround Israel, it has been forced to use its military and intelligence capabilities to pinpoint direct threats and to strategically eliminate them. We assume at this point that the assassination of Haniyeh was made by the same calculations.""
Hamas said Haniyeh was killed ""in a Zionist airstrike on his residence in Tehran after he participated in the inauguration of Iran’s new president.""
""Hamas declares to the great Palestinian people and the people of the Arab and Islamic nations and all the free people of the world, brother leader Ismail Ismail Haniyeh a martyr,"" the statement said.

65,CNN_18,"Who was Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas political leader killed in Tehran?",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/middleeast/ismail-haniyeh-death-hamas-profile-intl-hnk/index.html,"
            Ismail Haniyeh has been part of Hamas for decades, in recent years running the militant group’s political operations from exile, and emerging as one of its most visible leaders during the war with Israel in Gaza.
    

            Hamas and Iranian state media said Wednesday that the 62-year-old had been killed in the Iranian capital Tehran. Hamas claimed Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli “raid” on his residence, while the Israeli military declined to comment when contacted by CNN.
    

            Haniyeh’s death strikes a significant blow to Hamas at a time when tensions are flaring across the Middle East over the devastating war in Gaza, and raises fraught questions about the future of negotiations between Israel and Hamas.
    

            As Hamas’s political leader, he was a key interlocutor with international mediators during stalled hostage and ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, following the group’s October 7 attack on Israel.
    

            Haniyeh was born in a refugee camp near Gaza City, and joined Hamas in the late 1980s during the First Intifada, or uprising.
    

            His parents were refugees expelled from Askalan, which later became known as the Israeli city Ashkelon.
    

            He was imprisoned several times in Israel for his participation in the uprising, before being deported and returning to Gaza – where he steadily climbed Hamas ranks in the following decade.
    

            Haniyeh was appointed part of a secret “collective leadership” in 2004 after the deaths of Hamas’ previous two leaders, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and Abdel Aziz Rantisi, who were killed in Israeli strikes just weeks apart.
    

            By 2017 he had become political chief of the group, and was named a “specially designated global terrorist” by the United States soon after.
    

            This decision came during a period of tension between Washington and the Palestinians due to the decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a decision made by the then-US President Donald Trump.
    

            Despite that designation – and unlike Hamas’ military leadership – Haniyeh travelled globally, meeting with world figures as the political head of the organization. He was photographed meeting Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in Tehran on Tuesday.
    

            Hamas’ surprise attack on October 7 saw at least 1,500 Hamas fighters pour across the border into Israel, in an assault that killed at least 1,200, and some 200 others taken hostage.
    

            Israeli strikes in Gaza have since killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, according to the Ministry of Health there, and sparked a humanitarian catastrophe in the densely crowded strip.
    

            In the months since, Haniyeh had been a key figure participating in international negotiations over the conflict, including the release of hostages still in Gaza.
    

            He had shown willingness to reach an agreement if Israel withdrew from Gaza – saying in May that the group was “still keen” to strike a deal with mediators, but that any proposal would have to cease fighting in the enclave permanently.
    

            At the time, he said their demands aimed to stop “the aggression against our people, which is a fundamental and logical position that lays the foundation for a more stable future.”
    

            In response, Israel has called those demands “unacceptable,” with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowing to keep fighting until Hamas was destroyed – leaving negotiations at a standstill as both sides traded blame.
    

            As recently as early July, Haniyeh was in touch with mediators in Qatar and Egypt to discuss ideas on ending the war, sparking some hope that the two sides could be on the brink of a framework agreement.
    

            Given his role in negotiations, Haniyeh’s death “will have significant influence on those negotiations,” said CNN Political and Foreign Policy Analyst Barak Ravid on Wednesday.

            Throughout the war, he has also continued meeting with other world leaders and officials – including Chinese diplomat Wang Kejian, who met Haniyeh in Qatar in March, during which they discussed the war in Gaza.
    

            Haniyeh has also felt the personal toll of the war in Gaza. In April, Israeli police arrested one of his sisters on charges of communicating with members of the movement. Nine days later, Israeli airstrikes killed three of his sons and four of his grandchildren.
    

            Afterward, Haniyeh insisted their deaths would not affect ongoing ceasefire and hostage talks.
    

            “Whoever thinks that by targeting my kids during the negotiation talks and before a deal is agreed upon that it will force Hamas to back down on its demands, is delusional,” he said.
    

            At the time, Haniyeh was based in Qatar, which is not a signatory of the Rome Statute allowing jurisdiction by the International Criminal Court.

But he stopped short of claiming responsibility for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’s political wing, was killed early Wednesday in what the group described as an assassination. Hamas and Iran both blamed Israel for the killing and vowed to retaliate; the Israel Defense Forces declined to comment. It was not immediately clear how Haniyeh was killed, but the attacks risk plunging the region further into crisis."

The White House could not confirm reports from Tehran that Hamas' top political leader was killed Wednesday by an airstrike. 
National Security Council (NSC) spokesman John Kirby told reporters he could neither confirm nor deny a statement by Hamas that accused Israel of assassinating Ismail Haniyeh. No one has claimed responsibility for the assassination, but Israel is suspected to be behind it after vowing to eradicate Hamas' senior leaders following the Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel, when terrorists slaughtered 1,200 people and took some 250 hostages. 
""I've seen the statement that Hamas put out. I can't confirm or verify. We have no independent confirmation,"" Kirby said during the White House press briefing Wednesday afternoon. 
Neither could Kirby say, when asked, what potential impact the killing could have as the U.S. continues to negotiate a potential ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. More than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 90,000 wounded in the war in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, although the count does not differentiate between civilians and terrorists.

""I think it's too soon to know what any of these reported events could mean for the ceasefire deal,"" Kirby said. He quickly added that the Biden-Harris administration continues to seek an agreement that would bring an end to the war in Gaza and provide humanitarian relief to the Palestinians who live there. 
""In fact, we have a team in the region right now as we speak, to try to continue to work with our counterparts to move this forward because it's that important,"" Kirby said. 
""It's always been complicated work. And it's not like the complications with every passing day get easier, and that includes today."" 
A U.S. military official earlier told Fox News the American military had ""no involvement"" in the assassination of Haniyeh, who led Hamas' political bureau and had lauded the Oct. 7 attacks as a humiliating blow to Israel.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel ""will exact a very heavy price from any aggression against us on any front"" but did not mention the killing. ""There are challenging days ahead,"" he added.
The alleged assassination has poured gasoline on the conflict in Gaza and threatens to fuel a wider regional conflict in the Middle East — precisely the outcome the Biden-Harris administration hopes to avoid. 
In a statement on his official website, Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said revenge was ""our duty"" and that Israel had ""prepared a harsh punishment for itself"" by killing ""a dear guest in our home.""
It remains to be seen if Hamas will withdraw from ceasefire negotiations pushed for by Biden.

92,CNN_72,White House says reports of Hamas leader’s assassination in Iran ‘don’t help with the temperature going down’,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/politics/biden-hamas-leader-killed-reax/index.html,"
            The White House on Wednesday said reports of the assassination of a Hamas political leader in Iran “don’t help with the temperature going down,” while repeating calls for a ceasefire deal that would see the release of hostages held by Hamas.
    

            “These reports over the last 24-48 hours certainly don’t help with the temperature going down. I’m not going to be Pollyannaish about it; we’re obviously concerned about escalation,” White House national security adviser John Kirby told reporters during the White House press briefing.
    

            While repeatedly declining to comment directly on the strike in Tehran, Kirby eventually acknowledged: “All of this adds to the complicated nature of what we’re trying to get done. And what we’re trying to get done is a ceasefire deal.”
    

            In the wake of the announcement of Ismail Haniyeh’s death, Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with counterparts from two key allies, Qatar and Jordan. In both conversations, according to the State Department, the officials emphasized the need for a ceasefire in Gaza.
    

            But Haniyeh’s killing removes perhaps the most significant Hamas negotiator from the table at a critical time when US officials have said that a long-sought ceasefire deal is as close as it’s ever been.
    

            “Political assassinations [and] continued targeting of civilians in Gaza while talks continue leads us to ask, how can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side?,” Qatar’s prime minister, a principal mediator, wrote on X after news of Haniyeh’s death.
    

            The Qatari post amounted to a direct accusation of Israel, while US officials have shied away from confirming the suspected Israeli operation against Haniyeh.
    

            No parties have declared an end to the ceasefire talks but Haniyeh’s death has significantly chilled the prospects of an imminent agreement.
    

            “It’s too soon to know what impact any of this is going to have on the ceasefire deal,” Kirby said at the briefing.
    

            As recently as earlier this month, Haniyeh was discussing ideas for ending the war with mediators in Qatar and Egypt — conversations that sparked some hope that a framework for a deal was coming into view after months of war, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and plunged Gaza into a humanitarian catastrophe.
    

            His assassination is the most recent escalation that has broadened the scope of the war outside of Gaza and threatens to further draw in Iran and the United States.
    

            It follows a rocket attack that killed 12 children in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday, which Israel blamed on Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, another Iran proxy. Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the attack — the deadliest inside Israel since October 7.
    

            Israel responded with a drone strike in southern Beirut that killed Hezbollah’s most senior military official, Fu’ad Shukr. His killing had been considered the most serious escalation in the war, until the assassination of Haniyeh on Wednesday.
    

            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said during a televised statement on Wednesday that Israel has delivered “crushing blows” to its enemies in the last few days.
    

            US officials had held out some optimism about a deal prior to the recent escalations. Late last month, Netanyahu signaled he was ready to make a “partial deal” with Hamas that would lead to the release of only some hostages, while still vowing that he would see the war out until the militant group is eliminated.
    

            While Netanyahu’s statement was at odds with a proposal outlined by President Joe Biden last month — a plan that would include the release of all hostages, Israeli troops withdrawing from Gaza and a permanent ceasefire — hopes that a deal could be reached carried over to Netanyahu’s visit to Washington last week. But during a fiery address to Congress, Netanyahu focused little attention on ongoing negotiations, instead vowing to “fight until we achieve victory” while falsely downplaying Israel’s role in the mounting civilian deaths in Gaza.
    

            The recent events could lead to further strain in Biden and Netanyahu’s decadeslong relationship. The president has said that Israel has already reached goals it had outlined after October 7, called the country’s actions in Gaza “over the top” and suggested that Netanyahu seeks to prolong the war only for the sake of his own political survival.
    

            Iran vowed to retaliate for the assassination on its soil.
    

            “You killed our dear guest in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment,” Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said, referring to Israel in a statement. “We consider it our duty to ask for the blood of our dear guest.”
    

            Iran’s foreign ministry blamed the United States directly “as a supporter and accomplice of the Zionist regime in the continuation of the occupation and genocide of the Palestinians, in committing this heinous act of terrorism.”
    

            Asked about the supreme leader’s response to the killing during Wednesday’s press briefing, Kirby responded: ”We have and will maintain a level of readiness to preserve our national security interest in the region.”

107,CNN_46,San Francisco will enforce penalties to clear homeless encampments as Los Angeles pushes back on governor’s order,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/us/san-francisco-homeless-encampments-penalties/index.html,"
            As the city of San Francisco prepares to fall in line with California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s executive order to clear homeless encampments, Los Angeles is pushing back, refusing to allow its jails to be used to hold those removed from encampments.
    

            Newsom, the Democratic governor of the state with the nation’s largest homeless population, issued a directive last week ordering state officials to begin dismantling encampments on state property and encouraging local governments to adopt policies consistent with the state’s. His order followed a US Supreme Court decision that upheld an Oregon city’s homeless policy.
    

            In San Francisco, Mayor London Breed will proceed with her administration’s plans to implement “progressive penalties,” or more aggressive enforcement, on homeless encampments, her office said in a news release – a move that had been put on hold by an appeals court awaiting the US Supreme Court decision.
    

            “Warnings will be followed by citations,” the release said. “In some cases, citations could be followed by escalating penalties, including arrest. The goal is not punishment, it is compliance.”
    

            But officials in Los Angeles have made clear they won’t be heeding the governor’s encouragement to follow suit.
    

            The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday in support of a motion affirming its jails won’t be used to hold homeless people arrested when encampments are broken up, The Los Angeles Times reported. County officials have said the approach is already in effect.
    

            “We’re not going to go to a race to the bottom,” County Supervisor Hilda Solis said, according to the Times. “We’re not going to turn our backs. We’re not going to use our jails to somehow incarcerate and criminalize people who are on the street.”
    

            Supervisor Lindsey Horvath noted someone who is endangering public safety or committing other crimes at an encampment could still be arrested and jailed, the Los Angeles Times reported.
    

            “We aren’t saying that if there’s violent crime happening at a homeless encampment that that is not an arrestable offense,” Horvath said. “We aren’t saying anything like that at all. In fact, what we’re being clear about is that we are not criminalizing poverty or homelessness.”
    

            Late last month, the results of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority’s point-in-time count – conducted in January – showed the homeless population in Los Angeles had dropped for the first time in six years. It showed overall homelessness and in particular unsheltered homelessness was down in both Los Angeles County and the city. According to the count, homelessness was down 2.2% in the Los Angeles and 0.27% in the county. There were still 45,253 homeless people counted in the city and 75,312 people unhoused in the county, the authority reported.
    

            Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass last week said that the city would focus on “a comprehensive approach that leads with housing and services, not criminalization.”
    

            “Strategies that just move people along from one neighborhood to the next or give citations instead of housing do not work,” she said.
    

            The differing approaches from two of California’s largest cities comes after the Supreme Court in June ruled in favor of the city of Grants Pass, Oregon, which ticketed homeless people for sleeping outside, rejecting arguments that doing so violated the Constitution’s ban on “cruel and unusual” punishment.

What we know about the governor’s order to clear homeless encampments in California


            “There are simply no more excuses. It’s time for everyone to do their part,” Newsom said last week, directing state agencies to “adopt humane and dignified policies” and “move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them.”
    

            Homeless advocates and some elected officials immediately voiced outrage, saying the crackdown – without providing adequate shelter and other services – would simply move people to other areas in a state where the cost of living is high and the number of shelter beds limited.
    

            “Governor Newsom, where do you expect people to go? This is a shameful moment in California history,” said Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the parent organization of the Housing is a Human Right initiative, accusing the governor of “criminalizing poverty” and “doubling down on failed policies.”
    

            The 9th Circuit of Appeals had issued an injunction against San Francisco’s “progressive penalties” plans amid a lawsuit filed by advocacy group Coalition on Homelessness, but a Tuesday news release from the San Francisco mayor’s office said the court has “officially modified” the injunction against the city “to be in line” with the US Supreme Court ruling.
    

            In laying out the new policy, the city said it would continue to conduct encampment operations by “offering shelter and services to those on the street.” The San Francisco Police Department will work with city officials to “address smaller encampments on a daily basis” to prevent re-encampments and to prevent smaller ones from growing, the release said.
    

            California has the largest homeless population in the nation, with more than 180,000 of the estimated 653,000 people experiencing homelessness nationwide residing in the Golden State, according to a 2023 report to Congress from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.
    

Newsom’s order directs, but does not mandate, state agencies and departments to adopt “policies and plans consistent” with the existing encampment policy of the state Department of Transportation.
    

            The department provides “advance notice of clearance and works with local service providers to support those experiencing homelessness at the encampment, and stores personal property collected at the site” for at least 60 days, Newsom’s office said.
    

            Breed, San Francisco’s mayor, is running for re-election and tackling homelessness has become a key issue. A shelter waiting list, operated by the city’s Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing, showed 138 people were in line for shelter Tuesday evening.
    

            The city government’s most recent count showed 4,354 homeless people were unsheltered in San Francisco on a night in January.
    

            Breed’s office said “a majority of the times” city staff encounter people in encampments and offer shelter, they refuse, and over the last year, refusals happened in 67% of encounters.
    

            Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness in San Francisco, said the organization disagrees with that claim and the data is unclear because there are not enough shelter beds for the state’s homeless population.
    

            While some may refuse, Friedenbach said, others are counted as refusals when there isn’t a place to house them.

What Gov. Gavin Newsom’s order to clear homeless encampments means for the people who live in them


            “It’s very convenient for politicians to say that homeless people are refusing services. That is a political trope that’s been tossed around for years,” Friedenbach said, adding that when people are cleared from encampments, they have “nowhere to go.”
    

            “What we see, day and day again, is that when there is an appropriate, accessible offer for folks, it is taken immediately – immediately. And we see people jumping through so many hoops to get services to no avail,” Friedenbach continued.
    

            Under the mayor’s new rules, teams from San Francisco’s Healthy Streets Operations Center will return to areas that have been cleared to prevent re-encampment, but they will not necessarily make a new offer of shelter.
    

            Researchers at Boston and Cornell universities, in a policy brief last year, said “punitive policing strategies” such as encampment removals “do not reduce or end homelessness.”
    

            “Such strategies often worsen homelessness. For example, fines and fees make it harder to access employment and social services; in some cases criminal charges impact people’s eligibility for existing social services and housing programs,” the researchers said.
    

            “Property confiscation during encampment clearance may come at the expense of documents that are essential for obtaining housing, employment, insurance, like birth certificates and identification,” they added, noting a link between criminal arrests and cycles of homelessness.

122,CNN_39,Olympic triathlon went ahead after officials give the green light over Seine water quality,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/sport/triathlon-seine-water-green-light-spt/index.html,"
            The triathlon competitions went ahead in Paris on Wednesday after concerns over water quality in the River Seine caused the men’s race to be postponed a day earlier.


            More rain came into Paris overnight but World Triathlon and Paris 2024 determined the water quality was sufficient to move ahead for both the women’s and men’s races.
    

            “Following a meeting on water quality held on 31 July at 3:30 a.m. attended by Paris 2024, representatives of World Triathlon and their Technical and Medical Delegates, Météo France, the City of Paris and the Prefecture of the Île-de-France Region involved in carrying out water quality tests, the stakeholders involved have confirmed that the women’s and the men’s triathlons will go ahead as planned on 31 July at 8 a.m. and 10:45 a.m. respectively,” Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said in a joint statement.
    

            The women’s race had been marked by bike crashes on the wet streets of Paris. In the cycling portion of the race, several athletes fell after slipping on the slippery roads. Vittoria Lopes of Brazil was among the leaders when she fell but fell out of contention.
    

            France’s Cassandre Beaugrand eventually was crowned women’s triathlon Olympic champion on home soil, roared across the finish line by a boisterous French crowd that broke out into a rendition ‘La Marseillaise.’
    

            Team GB’s Alex Yee produced a sensational finish to take the lead of the men’s triathlon on the final bend and snatch the gold medal away from New Zealand’s Hayden Wilde. Wilde had opened up a 15-second lead during the run, the third and final portion of the race, but Yee hunted him down spectacularly over the last 1.5 kilometers.
    

            Yee adds the gold to the triathlon silver and mixed relay gold he won three years ago in Tokyo.
    

            Heavy rains battered Paris over the weekend, drenching Friday’s opening ceremony and raising concerns about water quality in the river, which usually declines after rainfall.
    

            Training was canceled for a second straight day on Monday after water quality testing deemed the water unsafe for athletes, but organizers were confident at the time that Tuesday’s race would go ahead as planned.
    

            The decision to hold some swimming events in the famous river that splits Paris raised eyebrows when it was first announced. Swimming in the Seine has been illegal for a century but, in their desire to put the host city on full display, organizers worked up a plan to clean up the river so the world’s best athletes could use it during Paris 2024.
    

            About $1.5 billion (1.4 billion Euros) has been spent trying to clean up the river ahead of the Games and Paris officials have made a big show of displaying its suitability. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo swam in the river earlier this month to display her confidence in the river’s water quality and promised to put a swimming pool in the river after the Games. The French sports minister has also gone for a dip in the Seine.
    

One of the key infrastructure projects designed to help tackle pollution has been a new rainwater storage basin – called the Austerlitz basin – which can hold 20 Olympic swimming pools worth of water, according to a statement from Paris 2024.
    

            Following rainy weather on June 17 and 18, the basin filled to 80% capacity, successfully preventing 40,000 cubic meters (40 million liters) of wastewater and rainwater from being discharged into the Seine, according to the city of Paris.
    

            But the water quality can change fast. Official data shows one-off rainfall events can quickly cause E. coli levels to spike again, and as recently as June 30 – following rain the previous day – E. coli levels increased to around 2000 CFU/100mL at Alexandra III Bridge, where the race is set to begin.
    

            That’s double the level needed for “good” water quality, as per World Triathlon standards.
    

            For much of the month before the games, E. coli levels were above acceptable levels, which could expose athletes to serious health concerns. If E. Coli levels are above 1000 CFU/100mL, the swimming leg of the triathlon will have to be cancelled, according to World Triathlon competition rules, unless the organization’s medical committee decides the race can go ahead.
    

            The individual triathlon races begin with a 1.5-kilometer swim, followed by a 40K bike race – passing by the Le Grand Palais and the Champs-Élysées – before finishing with a 10K run through the heart of the city.
    

            A mixed team relay race involving four athletes – two men and two women – will start with each team member completing a 300-meter swim, followed by a 5.8K bike ride and 1.8K run.

127,CNN_41,Boeing names new CEO after losses more than triple,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/investing/boeings-losses-new-ceo/index.html,"
            Boeing named a new CEO after it reported a core operating loss of $1.4 billion in the second quarter – more than triple the loss from a year ago – as increased scrutiny of the safety and quality of its planes kept the troubled company from making enough aircraft to return to profitability.
    

            Boeing announced Robert K. “Kelly” Ortberg, the former CEO of supplier Rockwell Collins, will be its new CEO, effective August 8, replacing retiring Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun, who has been under fire for the company’s problems. Ortberg has a background as an engineer, not in finance, having earned his college degree in mechanical engineering.
    

            “I’m extremely honored and humbled to join this iconic company,” said Ortberg in a statement from the company. “Boeing has a tremendous and rich history as a leader and pioneer in our industry, and I’m committed to working together with the more than 170,000 dedicated employees of the company to continue that tradition, with safety and quality at the forefront.”
    

            Ortberg, who noted “there is much work to be done” at Boeing, has a background that could be encouraging to some staff who have criticized Boeing’s management for having too much of a emphasis on finance rather than the engineering quality.
    

            But Ortberg’s appointment doesn’t necessarily guarantee the right decisions will be made by the company’s new leadership. While Calhoun’s background is in finance, his predecessor, Dennis Muilenburg, the CEO of Boeing at the time of the development of the troubled 737 Max jet and the two fatal crashes of the plane that led to its 20-month grounding and five years of financial losses, also had an engineering background.

            The head coach and players of Team USA’s women’s basketball emphasized their endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential bid on Wednesday.
    

            It’s the first major political statement from a top American team at this year’s Olympics and comes as the presidential race is heating up back home.
    

            Harris took over the Democratic nomination earlier this month after President Joe Biden decided to end his reelection bid and endorse his No. 2. She’s now attempting to gain momentum in the race against former President Donald Trump, who is running to regain the office he lost to Biden in 2020.

            The players on Team USA – and the WNBA in general –have been far more willing to engage in political statements than some of their other professional sports peers.
    

            “We have been talking, especially with the social justice committee, finding a way to make sure that we can obviously back Kamala as much as we can. Because everything that we’ve been kind of working for this year … has been about voting rights, reproductive rights,” said Breanna Stewart, a power forward who plays her professional ball for the New York Liberty, on July 27.
    

            “The things she stands for, we also stand for. So making sure that we can definitely stay united and continue to push the message of registering to vote, knowing where to vote and all the resources behind it.”
    

            Women’s basketball players have had influential voices in key elections before.
    

            In 2020, the Atlanta Dream protested against their then co-owner – then Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who was running for reelection against Rev. Stephen Warnock – over her opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement. That race ended up going to a run-off and Warnock defeated Loeffler. He’s now serving as a senator from Georgia.
    

            “I think that’s a really important thing that our league has done through the years, using our voice as a vehicle for change, and I think no question that we would step to the plate in this scenario,” said Team USA head coach Cheryl Reeve, who also coaches the WNBA’s Minnesota Lynx, on Wednesday.
    

            “I think it’s really important that we don’t go backwards as we’ve seen, some of the threats to basic human rights, the things that we care about in our league, and so I’m proud to stand with the players in this in backing Kamala Harris.”
    

            WNBA legend Diana Taurasi added Wednesday that she was thrilled to see Harris taking over the Democratic presidential ticket. Ultimately, it comes down to policy, she said.

            “What are you going to do for the people of America that need you? And I think there’s a big portion of us that see a lot of us in her and what she wants to do with our country,” Taurasi said. “For me, that is one of the proudest and most amazing moments, so yeah, we’re going to back her and we’re going to do everything we can to make sure she wins and we go forward in this country in the right way.”
    

            The endorsement from the women’s Team USA comes a little less than a week after men’s star Stephen Curry said he was excited about Harris’ candidacy. Harris had visited the men’s basketball team during their training camp ahead of the Games.
    

            “If she’s on the ticket winning the election, like it’s, it’s a big, big deal to say the least and she represents the Bay Area,” Curry said last week. “She’s been a big supporter of us. And so I want to give that energy right back to her and just excited knowing, obviously, we’re representing our country here and this is a very monumental next couple of months for, for our country and the direction that we’re headed.”

134,CNN_65,Denver-area wildfire turns deadly as California’s Park Fire torches an area larger than Los Angeles,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/us/wildfires-california-park-colorado-quarry/index.html,"
While California battles the fifth-largest wildfire in state history, a trio of wildfires near Denver has forced hundreds of evacuations and claimed at least one life. Here’s the latest on a barrage of blazes burning in several western states: 


• Colorado’s Stone Canyon Fire turns deadly: The remains of a fire victim were found Wednesday inside a home in the path of the Stone Canyon Fire – one of three wildfires ravaging the Denver area, Boulder County Sheriff Curtis Johnson said Wednesday.

Wildfire safety tips from the experts


            The Stone Canyon Fire has scorched more than 1,300 acres and impacted at least five structures. As firefighting efforts continue, evacuation orders for parts of the town of Lyon were lifted. But some gas service in those neighborhoods was turned off as a precautionary measure, the sheriff said. “Getting people back in with utilities will take some time,” he said.
    

• Colorado’s Quarry Fire spreads rapidly: Emergency crews raced to evacuate homes southwest of Denver overnight as the Quarry Fire, previously known as the Wildland Fire, threatened several subdivisions, the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office said. On Wednesday morning, the blaze expanded from 50 acres to about “200 acres and growing,” the sheriff’s office posted on X. By midday Wednesday, the inferno was still 0% contained.
    

• Firefighters struggle with limited resources and “a rattlesnake problem”: The Quarry Fire will be tough to fight due to the terrain and the number of other wildfires searing parts of Colorado, local officials said. “We don’t know if we’re going to get any air support today or not,” Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Mark Techmeyer said Wednesday.
    

            In addition to the Quarry and Stone Canyon fires, Colorado is also grappling with the Alexander Mountain Fire, which has singed more than 5,000 acres north of Denver and was 0% contained as of Tuesday.
    

            While no injuries have been reported from the Quarry Fire, firefighters face new hazards with the blaze. The terrain is mountainous, steep and “really hard to navigate on foot,” Techmeyer said. On top of that, “We have a rattlesnake problem to deal with.”
    

• California’s Park Fire is bigger than the size of Los Angeles: The weeklong inferno, which started July 24 in Northern California, is now the fifth-largest wildfire in state history. It has swallowed more than 389,000 acres, or 607 square miles, according to Cal Fire.
    

            More than 5,700 personnel are battling the blaze, using more than 500 fire engines and 40 helicopters. “This region, both Butte and Tehama (counties) … has had four of the largest 10 fires known in history,” Cal Fire Incident Commander Billy See said. As of Wednesday morning, the Park Fire had destroyed at least 227 structures and was 18% contained.
    

            • Newsom declares state of emergency for another wildfire: In Southern California, the Borel Fire has ravaged Kern County and decimated a historic mining community. Gov. Gavin Newsom visited affected communities Tuesday and proclaimed a state of emergency. The governor previously declared a state of emergency for the Park and Gold Complex fires.

            • Suspect accused of starting the Park Fire could face more charges: Ronnie Dean Stout II, the man suspected of starting the Park Fire, has been charged with arson, according to a felony criminal complaint filed Monday. Authorities said a witness saw him pushing a burning car down a 60-foot embankment.
    

            Stout claims he did not push the car, Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey told reporters. The suspect didn’t enter a plea during a court appearance Monday and was denied bail. His arraignment was continued to Thursday, Ramsey said, and more charges could be added.
    

            • Resident loses two homes in separate wildfires: Standing in the charred remains of his house, Butte County resident Rick Pero told CNN affiliate KHSL the Park Fire was the second California inferno to destroy his home. After the deadly 2018 Camp Fire obliterated his house, Pero and his wife moved to the Forest Ranch community in Butte County. There, Pero educated his neighbors on defensible space – which he credits for helping save dozens of neighbors’ homes. But the precaution didn’t save his own home, Pero told KHSL: “It was just too much Mother Nature.”
    

            • Oregon firefighters battle mammoth blaze as temperatures soar: Oregon’s largest wildfire, the Durkee Fire, has charred more than 293,000 acres – with no rainfall in sight. The blaze, which was ignited by lightning near the Oregon-Idaho border on July 17, was 52% contained as of Wednesday morning, according to InciWeb. No rainfall is expected the rest of the week, and temperatures are expected to soar to triple digits by the weekend – potentially impairing firefighting efforts.

            • 95 large wildfires are raging in the US: Across the country, 95 major wildfires are burning – scorching a combined 2.1 million acres (and counting), the National Interagency Fire Center said Wednesday. Among them, 35 infernos were spreading in Oregon, 12 in California and 10 in Idaho.
    

            “So far in 2024, 28,154 wildfires have burned 4,449,282 acres,” the fire center said. The amount of land torched so far this year is more than the square mileage of Connecticut.
    

            The agency stressed the need to have firefighters and firefighting resources available for an “initial attack” in areas with a high likelihood of fire breaking out. “The vast majority of fire starts are contained at small sizes within 24 hours of their discovery,” the fire center said.
    

            Gusty winds could further fuel fires this week as the heat is expected to intensify across much of the West through Friday. Temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above normal are expected across parts of the Pacific Northwest and the Northern Rockies, and daily high temperature records could be tied or broken this weekend – especially in the Pacific Northwest.

147,CNN_67,"The Fed keeps interest rates at current levels, but signals a cut is coming",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/economy/july-fed-meeting-preview/index.html,"
            The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it will continue to hold its benchmark interest rate at current levels, marking a full year since the cost of borrowing first reached a 23-year high.
    

            As expected, central bank officials chose not to cut rates, which would have paved the way for lower borrowing costs for Americans on everything from mortgages and car loans to credit cards.
    

            However, the Fed gave an important clue Wednesday that it will likely cut its benchmark lending rate in the coming months: Fed officials are now wary of risks surrounding America’s labor market, which has long been a pillar of strength for the economy, according to their latest policy statement.

Fed opts to hold interest rates steady — but a cut could be coming in September


            Officials wrote that inflation is now “somewhat” elevated — the first time inflation has been described in such a way since the Fed began to lift rates in March 2022. At last month’s meeting, the Fed’s statement said, “Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated.” The latest statement implies that the central bank believes inflation is even less of a risk compared to its last meeting.
    

            This shift in how the Fed is viewing the economy means the central bank could begin paring back interest rates as soon as its next policy meeting, in September, easing pressure on US households and businesses burdened by tough borrowing costs.
    

            Central bankers have said in recent speeches that they’re pleased with the latest inflation data, and some have pointed to the risks of not cutting rates with inflation inching closer to the central bank’s 2% target.
    

            Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee recently cautioned of the effects of inflation-adjusted interest rates, which tighten their grip on the economy if inflation slows but rates remain unchanged. That could be a problem for the labor market, which seems to be at an inflection point. In addition to stabilizing prices, the Fed is also responsible for maximizing employment. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said that an unexpected deterioration in the job market would prompt officials to consider cutting rates sooner.
    

            But for now, the Fed has a solid chance at successfully taming inflation without a recession, an exceptionally rare achievement known as a “soft landing.”
    

            For now, the American economy remains on solid footing. Just look at the government’s latest report on gross domestic product, which showed that the US economy expanded at a robust 2.8% annualized rate from April through June, after adjusting for seasonal swings and inflation, which was double the rate seen in the first quarter and well above economists’ predictions. The report was surprising because it also showed that inflation slowed during that period, even as the economy strengthened.
    

            The Fed’s favorite inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, showed that consumer prices were up 2.5% in June from a year earlier, down from May’s 2.6% annual rate, inching closer to the Fed’s 2% target.
    

            It’s not clear if the duo of slower inflation and stronger growth will persist. The Fed tries to wrangle inflation by deliberately cooling the economy through higher interest rates, so the latest GDP report went against that conventional wisdom. Last year, an expanding workforce and a burst in productivity growth helped corral inflation while the broader economy remained intact.

It’s not the end of the world if the Fed doesn’t cut rates


            But it’s already been a year that interest rates have been perched at a 23-year high, and there have been some signs of weakness in the broader economy. For starters, the US consumer is no longer splurging, and shoppers have instead become much more careful with their dollars, according to major retailers such as Target and Walmart. Americans are still very much spending, but they’re now hunting for bargains and prioritizing in-person experiences.
    

            The one weak spot that could become worrisome for the Fed is today’s US job market, which is now less robust than it has been in recent years. Demand for labor has tumbled dramatically over the past two years, wage growth is running at a cooler pace, and the unemployment rate is now at its highest point in more than two years, at 4.1%. It could just be a normalization from the gangbuster times of recent years, or it could be the beginning of a steeper slowdown.
    

            The Labor Department releases July data gauging the state of the US labor market, including monthly payroll growth and the unemployment rate, on Friday.

147,WaPo_103,Fed keeps interest rates steady. But cuts aren’t far off.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/31/fed-rate-cuts-inflation/,"The Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady on Wednesday — with officials inching closer to a long-awaited rate cut that might come as soon as September.Households and businesses are eager for central bankers to bring borrowing costs down from the highest level in 23 years. Rates have held steady since last July. So far, the Fed has been wary of taking even a little bit of pressure off the economy before officials are confident inflation is heading back to normal levels. But the past few months of encouraging data have Wall Street and financial analysts betting the Fed is as close as it could get — and some worry the central bank could even be waiting too long to ease up.At the end of their two-day policy meeting, Fed leaders said the economy was still growing at a “solid pace"" and that the unemployment rate had ticked up slightly but remains low. Even though inflation has eased, the path ahead is still uncertain.“The committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent,” central bankers wrote in a statement, offering no specific timeline.At 2:30 p.m. Eastern, Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell will take questions at a news conference, where he’ll probably be asked about the Fed’s fight against inflation, the health of the job market and timing for future cuts.The last time officials convened, in June, they penciled in just one rate cut before the end of the year, down from three a few months before that. The Fed won’t issue official projections again until September. But in the meantime, Powell could shed some light on where he and his colleagues think policy is headed — and if they even have time to cut rates during the handful of meetings left in the year.The practiced and staid Fed chief generally holds back from forecasting too far into the future. Instead, he and his colleagues have been focused on building confidence that inflation is falling reliably down on its way to a more normal 2 percent. That’s clearly what the data show; using the Fed’s preferred gauge, inflation clocked in at 2.5 percent in June.If anything, some economists are puzzled over why the Fed isn’t cutting rates already.“We want to have greater confidence inflation was moving sustainably down toward our 2 percent target, and what increases our confidence in that is more good inflation data,” Powell said at the Economic Club of D.C. this month. “And lately here, we have been getting some of that.”Fed officials are taking their time because they’ve been thwarted by the economy’s unexpected turns before. At the start of the year, a slew of hot inflation reports suggested the Fed was losing ground on its push to slow the economy, after things looked like they were cruising late in 2023. Well before that, the Fed was slow to react when prices surged in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic — a mistake that forced the central bank to hoist borrowing costs in a rush to catch up. They ultimately brought the federal funds rate to between 5.25 and 5.5 percent.Through it all, though, the Fed has managed a rare feat: bringing inflation down without causing a recession or blow to the job market. The economy grew at a surprisingly strong 2.8 percent in the second quarter, capping two years of solid expansion. The extreme labor shortages from the pandemic have also faded away, but employers are still hiring.In the backdrop is the presidential election, where Republicans and Democrats are campaigning on vastly different plans for the economy. While the Fed is loath to get involved in politics, it doesn’t operate in a vacuum. Many economists, for example, warn that former president Donald Trump’s policies on higher tariffs and mass deportations would worsen inflation. If he wins in November and his agenda becomes law, the Fed’s inflation fight could be upended.In the meantime, some Fed watchers are antsy for the first cut. They argue rates that stay too high for too long can backfire, causing cracks in the labor market if employers pull back or even lay people off. Those signs haven’t emerged yet. But officials have acknowledged that they have to balance their inflation goals with protecting the labor market more evenly than they have over the past few years.The official statement will get plenty of attention ahead of Powell’s news conference. That’s because the central bank moves in subtle but consequential ways; slight word changes from one statement to the next have the power to move markets. And they shed light on what officials think is important.When Fed leaders wrapped up their June meeting, they wrote that they were still “highly attentive to inflation risks.” That sentence got a notable revision on Wednesday, with the Fed saying it was “attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.”For the economy as a whole, it might not matter much if the Fed cuts in July versus September. Rather, it’s about the signal. Speaking to The Washington Post this month, Boston Fed President Susan Collins noted how bumpy the inflation fight has been. That makes it especially important that “we really stay the course” while keeping a close eye on any other emerging risks.“From my perspective, I have gained some confidence with the last three months,” Collins said on inflation. She added: “I think we’re not quite there yet.”Eric Rosengren, who ran the Boston Fed from 2007 to 2021, said it was too soon to know if the Fed will cut more than once — largely because of the presidential election. After September, the Fed’s remaining meetings for 2024 are the week of the election in November and then again in December. To avoid political backlash, the Fed would probably steer clear of a rate cut in November. But by December, the economy may be headed in different directions depending on who wins.“We have two candidates who have very different fiscal policies, and at least some of those fiscal policies could start changing the forecast,” Rosengren said. “So I think the committee probably is going to want to be pretty neutral on what they do after September.”"

The fund’s target was lowered to $2 billion this week, and a key investor recently backed out.In a statement, Ackman conceded that he faced questions about whether this was the right way forward while on a roadshow to whip up excitement for the IPO.“One principal question has remained: Would investors be better served waiting to invest in the aftermarket than in the IPO?” Ackman said in a statement Wednesday, referring to the market for stock and bonds after they are originally issued.For now, the fund’s IPO will be put on ice, despite “enormous investor interest,” Ackman said. “We will report back once we are ready to launch a revised transaction.”Ackman made a name for himself on Wall Street as an activist investor, taking significant positions in companies and then overseeing lucrative turnarounds, including with fast food giant Wendy’s, mall operator General Growth Properties and rail operator Canadian Pacific.With Pershing Square USA, Ackman was looking to leverage the influence he wields on social media to build a publicly traded fund for everyday investors. He made his way into the limelight in recent months as an outspoken critic of DEI efforts in schools and corporate America, helping to lead the campaign to oust Claudine Gay, Harvard’s first Black president.A former Democratic donor, Ackman endorsed Donald Trump for president this month.I am going to formally endorse @realDonaldTrump. I came to this decision some time ago as many @X followers have already understood from my supportive posts of Trump and my criticisms of @POTUS Biden.

It was underwritten by Citigroup Global Markets, UBS Securities and BofA Securities, according to a prospectus filed with Securities and Exchange Commission.In a note to investors in his management company last week, Ackman acknowledged that his outsize presence at Pershing Square Capital Management was among investor concerns for the fund, Barron’s reported.

            The US women’s soccer team qualified for the quarterfinals of the 2024 Paris Olympic Games with an unbeaten record after its 2-1 victory over Australia on Wednesday.
    

            Trinity Rodman opened the scoring on the stroke of half-time, prodding home as she latched onto a header from her teammate, Sophia Smith.
    

            Korbin Albert’s emphatic goal from long range doubled the US’ lead midway through the second half and, although Alanna Kennedy’s late goal did give Australia some hope, it was too little, too late as the Americans were able to hold onto the victory.
    

            The US was victorious in all three of its group games, allowing it to book its spot in the next round as Group B winner with nine points from nine available.
    

            The US women’s national team will face Japan in the next round.
    

            The USWNT has historically been one of the most dominant soccer teams at the Olympics ever since it made its debut back in 1996.
    

            Four gold medals in five Games – including a three-peat from 2004 to 2012 – cemented the US at the top of the pecking order in the women’s competition.
    

            But it has been unable to reach those lofty heights of late with no gold medal since 2012, losing in the quarterfinals to Sweden in 2016 and winning the bronze medal in Tokyo three years ago. It also lost in the round of 16 of last year’s World Cup after having won back-to-back titles in 2015 and 2019.
    

            At the 2024 Paris Olympics, though, it is a case of hope renewed under head coach Emma Hayes who is taking charge of the team for the first time at a major tournament at the Summer Games.
    

            Hayes’ side won its opening two games of the group stages, scoring seven goals and conceding just once as it booked its spot in the next round with a match to spare.
    

            A big part of the team’s success has been the team’s attacking line comprised of Smith, Mallory Swanson and Rodman who had scored or assisted on all seven of the USWNT’s goals this Olympics heading into Wednesday night.
    

            And Smith and Rodman once again combined for the US’s opening goal on Wednesday, with Smith heading down to allow Rodman to poke home.
    

            The US was the more dominant of the two sides, with Horan coming close with a close-range header that was tipped onto the bar.
    

            But for all the possession It had, the US couldn’t find a way to extend its lead. That was until substitute Albert picked up the ball a few yards from the edge of the box and smashed the ball into the top corner.
    

            The victory looked all but assured until a 91st minute goal from Alanna Kennedy halved the deficit and sparked life into the match – particularly given what the Matildas accomplished against Zambia, turning around a massive deficit to win a 6-5 thriller in the 90th minute.
    

            But the US was able to hold on and maintain its 100% winning record and its spot as Group B winner.
    

            The only downside of the evening came in the fourth minute when midfielder metronome Sam Coffey picked up an early yellow card which will rule her out of her team’s game in the quarterfinals.

222,WaPo_65,"For select group of Commanders fans, ‘Tunnel Club’ offers intimate access",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/31/commanders-tunnel-club/,"The Washington Commanders will unveil an array of upgrades to their stadium in Landover this season, including a premium space that will let fans interact with players on game days.The aptly named Tunnel Club, a 2,100-square-foot space in the tunnel of the stadium, will give 150 season ticket holders access to an area where players travel to and from the field and locker room. Membership includes exclusive stadium entry, parking, field access before the game and all-inclusive food and beverage. It also comes with admission to select events with team executives, among other perks.The team worked with the architectural design firm Populous on the concept of the club and turned to Clark Construction for the build out, which it teased in renderings Wednesday.The chance to high-five Terry McLaurin pregame doesn’t come cheap. Membership starts at $15,000 and includes two passes to the Tunnel Club.Washington’s ownership group, led by Josh Harris, has put more than $75 million into the stadium since it purchased the team in July 2023. The group began to make incremental improvements before its inaugural season and has continued to make alterations ahead of Year 2. Its goal: Create a more attractive game-day experience in Landover while continuing to search for a new stadium location in D.C., Maryland or Virginia.“We’re going to improve the existing stadium as much as we can while we look for a new home because it’s not the bones, necessarily,” Harris said of the Landover stadium in November. “The bones obviously can be repaired; they can be fixed. It’s more the way modern stadiums are set up; they’re very different than stadiums that are older. And so whether it’s the premium areas being really close to the game itself, how the suites are situated, how much premium there is, the WiFi, I mean, a lot of that stuff just can’t be done in an older stadium. So we’re going to be looking at ultimately how do we move to a new stadium.”The team announced most of the changes in February, including the 1932 Club, a 22,000-square-foot premium space for season-ticket holders. It includes 28 private suites for up to 12 people apiece (all are sold out), and 108 theater box seats. Like the Tunnel Club, membership to the 1932 Club comes with catering and access to select membership events (1932 is the year the franchise was established).In 2022, under the ownership of Daniel Snyder, the team added terrace tables to the club level for season ticket holders. The private seating, located in the east and west end zones, includes a “half-moon” table, mesh seating, complimentary beer and cocktails and, in certain areas, complimentary food service. This offseason the team added 72 more terrace tables.Washington also added touchless security at all of the stadium’s entry gates, upgraded the sound system and lighting, added touchless food and beverage markets on the main concourse, resurfaced parking lots and updated furnishings and carpet on the club level.To help with the upfront costs, NFL owners approved $86.5 million in funding for the Commanders for stadium improvements, which would amount to a loan from the visiting teams’ shares of ticket revenue.Still on the to-do list for the Commanders is finding a naming rights partner. The shipping giant FedEx severed its agreement with the team two years early, sapping the Commanders of roughly $15 million in remaining revenue from the deal."
281,WaPo_156,The anti-doping fight isn’t about whom to believe. It’s about transparency.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/31/wada-usada-chinese-swimmers-doping-allegations/,"PARIS — A year ago, a Czech cyclist training in the United States tested positive for a banned substance that entered her system because she was handling a prescription medicine for her dying dog. Anti-doping authorities announced the results of the test — just as they announced there would be no penalty.Also last year, an American sprinter borrowed training sleeves from a friend to wear over an injured hamstring. The sleeves contained a banned substance. After an investigation concluded the sprinter shouldn’t be penalized, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency announced the positive test anyway.In 2020, an American boxer tested positive for two banned substances that her partner was taking. An investigation determined the drugs entered her system through sex. She was exonerated in time to compete in the Tokyo Olympics the following summer. The positive tests still were disclosed.“As it stands, the WADA rules dictate that even if a positive test is proven to be caused by contamination, national anti-doping agencies must find a violation, disqualify results, and make a public announcement,” USADA CEO Travis Tygart said in a statement issued Tuesday night.Which gets us to the Paris Olympics. And the Chinese swimmers who tested positive for banned substances three years ago. And the results that weren’t announced.There is all-out war between two agencies that are supposed to pull on the same end of the rope. It’s not going away. If anything, it’s escalating.“The politicization of Chinese swimming continues with this latest attempt by the media in the United States to imply wrongdoing on the part of WADA and the broader anti-doping community,” WADA said in a lengthy statement Tuesday. “As we have seen over recent months, WADA has been unfairly caught in the middle of geopolitical tensions between superpowers but has no mandate to participate in that.”You gotta feel sorry for them, don’t you?The story has not stopped the Olympic swim meet in its tracks, not hardly. That’s because the Chinese swimmers have been held largely at bay. After winning 10 golds in Tokyo — second behind the United States’ 12 — and 20 medals overall, China has one gold, delivered Wednesday night with a world record in the men’s 100-meter freestyle from Pan Zhanle, to go with two silvers and two bronzes here as the meet reaches its midpoint. Zhanle’s performance led to the Chinese anthem filling Paris La Défense Arena for the first time.On Tuesday night, Qin Haiyang — the reigning world champion in the men’s 100- and 200-meter breaststrokes — failed to reach the final of the latter event, in which he holds the world record. This after he finished seventh in the 100 earlier in the meet. Wednesday morning, Xu Jiayu, who won one of China’s silvers in the 100 backstroke, failed to even show up for his heat in the 200 back. No immediate reason was given.It’s dangerous to consider those results and actions and conclude, “The Chinese must be missing something they relied on in Tokyo.” But WADA’s combination of inaction and secrecy has only bolstered such speculation.Forget the “politicization of Chinese swimming.” This is a mess of WADA’s own making. And it’s important to clean it up — not just for the Paris Games but for faith in the global system to ensure clean international competition going forward.The American media WADA refers to is the New York Times, which reported earlier Tuesday that two more Chinese swimmers had tested positive for banned substances — in this case, a hardcore steroid — but blamed it on contaminated meat. (One of those swimmers is on the Olympic team here.) But it also could and should include German outlet ARD, which with the Times reported in April that 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for the banned heart medication trimetazidine leading up to the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and that Chinese anti-doping authorities blamed on contamination in a hotel kitchen, an explanation that WADA accepted but didn’t announce. Last week, ARD further reported that those swimmers didn’t all stay at the same hotel.“A fundamental question at the heart of any claimed contamination case, which WADA refuses to answer in these cases, is what was the source of the positives?” Tygart’s latest statement said. “The fact that WADA accepted these excuses and declined to enforce its own rules is a failure of the system.”All this led to saber-rattling across the Atlantic. On Tuesday, a bipartisan congressional delegation announced legislation that would withhold the United States’ contribution to WADA’s budget — a $3.4 million contribution to a roughly $50 million annual budget.The swept-under-the-rug Chinese positives could make WADA seem toothless. And to the athletes who swam in Tokyo and are competing here against 11 of those swimmers, it is — regardless of China’s poor performance in the pool thus far.But tell that to the scores of athletes WADA has suspended over the years, even those who have claimed inadvertent ingestion. There’s Shelby Houlihan, the American record-holder in the women’s 1,500 meters who is missing her second Olympics after a positive test for the steroid nandrolone — that she blamed on a tainted burrito. There’s Issam Asinga, the Surinamese sprinter who set American high school records but is serving a four-year ban after testing positive for the banned substance GW1516, which alters how the body metabolizes fat. Asinga is suing Gatorade, which he says supplied him tainted gummies that were supposed to help with recovery.Whether you believe Houlihan or Asinga, they’re not here because WADA said they can’t be.“I just think this idea that somehow they’re soft on doping is unfair,” said Paul Greene, an American attorney who has represented athletes in doping cases for two decades. “I know from my years and years of dealing with them, if anything, they’re rigid.”What they are is inconsistent, and the reaction — particularly in the United States or from American athletes and observers — risks being horribly xenophobic. You can’t say, “Poor kid from Suriname; he should be here,” and follow it reflexively with, “We’re not going to fund you unless you suspend the Chinese.”But WADA also needs to admit that it didn’t handle the China cases properly. Beyond that, WADA and the International Olympic Committee need to understand that the timing of the unpublicized positives — less than a year in advance of the Beijing Winter Games — makes the optics awful, quietly clearing athletes from one of the few countries eager to host future Olympics.Beyond that, the IOC must understand the threats it is making to yank the 2034 Winter Games from Salt Lake City unless Americans bow to WADA as the “supreme authority” on all things doping are laughable. Where else would they turn? Beyond that, WADA must come to the conclusion that its blended relationship with the IOC — half of the budget comes from countries around the world, the other half from the IOC — cripples its ability to police doping as an independent agency.American outcry is not the reason WADA’s structure is flawed and its actions open to suspicion. Both problems are solvable, but only if both the IOC and WADA understand that public perception matters when it comes to faith. And without faith in the system, who can be confident the competition is clean?"

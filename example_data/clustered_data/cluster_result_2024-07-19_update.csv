5,NBC_6,Alabama set to execute man for fatal shooting of a delivery driver during a 1998 robbery attempt,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/alabama-set-execute-man-fatal-shooting-delivery-driver-1998-robbery-at-rcna162458,"A man convicted of killing a delivery driver who stopped for cash at an ATM to take his wife to dinner is facing scheduled execution Thursday night in Alabama.
Keith Edmund Gavin, 64, is set to receive a lethal injection at a prison in southwest Alabama. He was convicted of capital murder in the shooting death of William Clayton Jr. in Cherokee County.
Alabama last week agreed in Gavin’s case to forgo a post-execution autopsy, which is typically performed on executed inmates in the state. Gavin, who is Muslim, said the procedure would violate his religious beliefs. Gavin had filed a lawsuit seeking to stop plans for an autopsy, and the state settled the complaint.
Clayton, a courier service driver, had driven to an ATM in downtown Centre on the evening of March 6, 1998. He had just finished work and was getting money to take his wife to dinner, according to a court summary of trial testimony. Prosecutors said Gavin shot Clayton during an attempted robbery, pushed him in to the passenger’s seat of the van Clayton was driving and drove off in the vehicle. A law enforcement officer testified that he began pursuing the van and the driver — a man he later identified as Gavin — shot at him before fleeing on foot into the woods.
At the time, Gavin was on parole in Illinois after serving 17 years of a 34-year sentence for murder, according to court records.
“There is no doubt about Gavin’s guilt or the seriousness of his crime,” the Alabama attorney general’s office wrote in requesting an execution date for Gavin.
A jury convicted Gavin of capital murder and voted 10-2 to recommend a death sentence, which a judge imposed. Most states now require a jury to be in unanimous agreement to impose a death sentence.
A federal judge in 2020 ruled that Gavin had ineffective counsel at his sentencing hearing because his original lawyers failed to present more mitigating evidence of Gavin’s violent and abusive childhood.
Gavin grew up in a “gang-infested housing project in Chicago, living in overcrowded houses that were in poor condition, where he was surrounded by drug activity, crime, violence, and riots,” U.S. District Judge Karon O Bowdre wrote.
A federal appeals court overturned the decision which allowed the death sentence to stand.
Gavin had been largely handling his own appeals in the days ahead of his scheduled execution. He filed a handwritten request for a stay of execution, asking that “for the sake of life and limb” that the lethal injection be stopped. A circuit judge and the Alabama Supreme Court rejected that request.
Death penalty opponents delivered a petition Wednesday to Gov. Kay Ivey asking her to grant clemency to Gavin. They argued that there are questions about the fairness of Gavin’s trial and that Alabama is going against the “downward trend of executions” in most states.
“There’s no room for the death penalty with our advancements in society,” said Gary Drinkard, who spent five years on Alabama’s death row. Drinkard had been convicted of the 1993 murder of a junkyard dealer but the Alabama Supreme Court in 2000 overturned his conviction. He was acquitted at his second trial after his defense attorneys presented evidence that he was at home at the time of the killing.
If carried out, it would be the state’s third execution this year and the 10th in the nation, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma and Missouri also have conducted executions this year. The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday halted the planned execution of a Texas inmate 20 minutes before he was to receive a lethal injection.The Associated Press"

10,NBC_11,"Trump rally shooter was reported as a suspicious person an hour before opening fire, sources say",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-rally-shooter-was-reported-suspicious-person-hour-opening-fire-s-rcna162434,"The gunman who opened fire at former President Donald Trump’s Pennsylvania rally was reported as a suspicious person — and photographed — one hour before he began shooting, according to three sources familiar with a briefing for senators Wednesday.
Secret Service and FBI officials shared a timeline of events that revealed troubling new details about the assassination attempt and raised questions about why Secret Service officials allowed Trump to take the stage.
Thomas Matthew Crooks — who had a range finder and a backpack with him — was reported as a suspicious person one hour before he began shooting, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said in a statement after the briefing.
“This was a 100% cover-your-ass briefing,” Barrasso said. “He had a range finder and a backpack. The Secret Service lost sight of him.”
Roughly 30 minutes after the initial suspicious person report, Pennsylvania State Police notified the Secret Service of a suspicious person at 5:51 p.m. The Secret Service notified its snipers at 5:53 p.m., the sources said.
At 6:02 p.m., Trump took the stage. At 6:09 p.m., members of the crowd notified police that Crooks, 20, was on a rooftop. Two minutes later, Crooks opened fire on Trump at 6:11 p.m.
Senators were also told that Crooks visited the site of the assassination attempt last week, the sources said.
Barrasso said Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle should be removed.
“No one has taken responsibility,” Barrasso said. “Someone has died. The [former] President was almost killed. The head of the Secret Service needs to go.”
The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In an interview Tuesday with ABC News, Cheatle said that she did not yet have all the details about the incident but that there was a “very short” period of time between when Crooks was identified as suspicious and when he began shooting.
A local police sniper team was inside the building from which Crooks fired at Trump, Cheatle said, and a decision was made not to deploy officers on the roof because it was sloped.
“That building in particular has a sloped roof at its highest point,” Cheatle said Tuesday. “And so, you know, there’s a safety factor that would be considered there that we would want to put somebody up on a sloped roof.”
Local law enforcement officials denied that local snipers were in the same building as Crooks. On Wednesday, a Secret Service official told NBC News that the local sniper team was not actually in the building, as Cheatle said. Instead, it was in another building in the same complex.
During Wednesday’s briefing, FBI Director Christopher Wray said investigators had not established a motive in the shooting, according to the three sources.
Wray told lawmakers that the FBI has interviewed 200 people and reviewed 14,000 images, including photos and livestreamed video of the rally, according to the sources.
Crooks had little to no social media presence, Wray said, and he used encrypted communication.
Wray also said investigators had not found a foreign connection to the attack, the sources said. The Biden administration recently obtained intelligence about an Iranian assassination plot against Trump, but U.S. officials said the threat had no connection to last week’s shooting.
Crooks, who worked as a dietary aide at a nursing home, requested the day off Saturday but told his employer he planned to return to work Sunday, a senior U.S. law enforcement official told NBC News.
After the shooting, Trump said on his social media platform that the bullet pierced the upper part of his ear. During an appearance Monday at the Republican National Convention, he had a bandage covering most of his ear. 
Corey Comperatore, a former chief of the Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Company, was killed in the shooting. Two other people — David Dutch, 57, and James Copenhaver, 74 — were injured. Their conditions were changed from critical to serious Wednesday, according to the hospital where they are being treated.
The House Oversight Committee on Wednesday subpoenaed Cheatle to appear for a public hearing this month, calling the assassination attempt “a total failure of the agency’s core mission.”
An official with the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Secret Service, responded with a letter, which was obtained by NBC News, saying Cheatle is available to testify later this month or early next month.
“The Department and USSS share your concern over the appalling events that occurred in Butler, Pennsylvania, last weekend,” the official wrote, using the initialism for the Secret Service. “And are committed to doing all we can to get to the bottom of what happened.”Julie Tsirkin is a correspondent covering Capitol Hill.

10,CNN_59,"Trump’s team wasn’t told about reports of suspicious person before rally shooting, sources say",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/18/politics/trump-shooting-rally-security-invs/index.html,"
            When former President Donald Trump ascended the stage at last weekend’s Pennsylvania rally to thunderous cheers, the campaign staffers present expected to hear a typical stump speech.
    

            What they didn’t know: Law enforcement had spotted a suspicious person at the rally nearly an hour earlier and had been trying to find him.
    

            Just minutes after Trump started speaking, that same suspicious person – 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks – opened fire at the former president, coming inches away from assassinating him.
    

            Members of Trump’s team weren’t told that law enforcement was trying to locate Crooks in the minutes before he took the stage, and there was no conversation over whether Trump should have delayed his entrance, sources who were at the rally with the former president told CNN.
    

            That’s despite the fact that local police had spotted Crooks multiple times with a rangefinder, a hunting device similar to a pair of binoculars that calculates distance, and had circulated a photo of him they had taken.
    

            “We would have never let him go out there if we thought there was a threat to him,” one source present with Trump told CNN.
    

            Beyond the looming question of why Crooks tried to kill Trump, the Secret Service is facing growing scrutiny over its security preparations and response at the rally – including why Trump was allowed to go onstage in the first place, and whether it was communicated to agents around him that people in the crowd had spotted the gunman on a nearby roof at least two minutes before the shooting.
    

            Secret Service and FBI briefers told members of Congress on Wednesday that law enforcement was trying to locate Crooks for at least 19 minutes before he fired but did not find him again until he was seen climbing on the roof outside the security perimeter, according to members who were in the briefing.

            Trump, who was running roughly an hour behind schedule when he arrived at the rally, went through his normal routine of taking photos backstage and mingling with a VIP crowd before walking through the tented command center that led to the stage, a second source present with Trump said. They added there was no delay between “the photo clicks,” as the campaign calls it, to him walking to the podium at 6:02 p.m.
    

            A Secret Service source familiar with the incident told CNN that Crooks had been “deemed a suspicious person, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that there was any indication that he was an immediate threat” or had a weapon until just before the shooting.
    

            Suspicious people aren’t uncommon at events like Trump rallies – even on Saturday, “a guy tried to come in with a goat” and a woman showed up “riding a horse with a giant Trump flag,” and both were also deemed suspicious, the Secret Service source said.
    

            Four former Secret Service agents who spoke to CNN said that a report of a suspicious person by itself wouldn’t necessarily have prompted a call to stop Trump from getting onstage. But they said communication failures between the various law enforcement agencies present at the rally likely contributed to the security breakdown that resulted in Trump’s near-assassination.
    

            Joe Funk, a former Secret Service agent who served for more than 20 years, said that suspicious people showing up at presidential events is a “very common occurrence,” and “we really hardly ever held the president back.”
    

            But he questioned why the roof that Crooks ascended was not secured before the rally, and why reports that he was there did not lead to more immediate action to protect Trump. Videos show that spectators noticed Crooks on the roof and tried to point him out to police at least two minutes before he fired, but law enforcement did not respond in time.
    

            Tom Knights, the manager of the local Butler Township, said in a statement Wednesday that an officer had hoisted himself to the roof and saw Crooks, but dropped to the ground after the gunman aimed at him. The township police “immediately communicated the individual’s location and that he was in possession of a weapon,” Knights said, but Crooks started firing “moments” later.
    

            “If you see a guy with a gun, somebody has to get word to the Secret Service and the Secret Service has to react immediately,” Funk said. If a report had been radioed out that police were investigating a report of a man with a gun, “that might have given that Secret Service detail a couple seconds, 10, 15, 20 seconds, to remove the president. It’s happened before.”
    

            Jonathan Wackrow, a former Secret Service agent and CNN law enforcement analyst, agreed that the security of the rally was marked by “multiple points of failure” in communications and coordination.
    

            When Crooks initially approached a security checkpoint with a rangefinder – which law enforcement sources have told CNN happened about an hour before the shooting – it should have been “a big, big red flag,” Wackrow said. “The Secret Service should have engaged with the suspect right then and there with one of their protective intelligence teams to conduct a field interview.”
    

            Later, Wackrow said, there should have been more security at the building who could have spotted Crooks as he ascended the nearby building and perched on the roof.
    

            “Why didn’t that message get back to the Secret Service or additional resources to basically flood the field?” Wackrow asked. “All it would take is for one person to have distracted that shooter to potentially prevent this attack from happening.”

19 lost minutes: Law enforcement failed to keep sight of Trump shooter, whose motive is still unclear to investigators


            Trump’s advisers and family have praised his personal Secret Service detail, some of whom have been with the former president since he was in the White House, while still criticizing the agency and its response.
    

            At an event hosted by CNN and Politico at the GOP convention in Milwaukee on Thursday, top Trump adviser Chris LaCivita accused Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle of dodging lawmakers’ questions. Asked if she should resign, he said, “yeah, yeah, a hundred percent.”
    

            Eric Trump, the former president’s son, told CNN on Tuesday that the Secret Service agents “on that stage love him. They would take a bullet for him and they demonstrated that.”
    

            But more broadly, he said, the Secret Service “let somebody with a gun within 130 yards of the former president of the United States and very likely the future president of the United States, and there’s got to be accountability for that.”
    

            That’s an assessment that multiple former personnel for the agency agree with.
    

            Former Secret Service agent Robert McDonald, who questioned how law enforcement surveillance could have “allowed him to now get on top of that roof,” said that the incident could lead to changes in the agency’s operating procedures.
    

            “The Secret Service needs to have looked inside itself to develop the answers to the questions of what happened here, why it happened, how it happened, and, more importantly, how we prevent this from happening again,” he said.
    

            The Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general has opened an investigation into the shooting, and Secret Service leadership are expected to testify before Congress next week.

Biden appeared to slip-up during an interview with BET this week, seemingly forgetting the name of former President Herbert Hoover and apparently mistaking JD Vance's name.
When discussing abortion rights, Biden seemed to fumble Vance’s name, referring to “Mance.” Vance has been targeted by Biden’s campaign for his opposition to Democratic-led legislation to codify abortion rights after the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling in 2022.
“Look, one of the things that’s happening is, you know, the majority of the states, even conservative states, where it’s been left to the public to determine whether or not they want to have no exceptions, they want to have a hard call, like, like, Mance wants on no abortion or circumstance — that there — you have states say, no, no, that’s not what we want to do, we want exceptions,” Biden said, appearing to refer to Vance.
“You know, there’s only two presidents in American history who have come to office and left with fewer jobs than they came to office. And the other was a guy we all know very well,” Biden said, referring to Hoover. “So, I call ... anyway, Trump is one of them.”
The White House did not immediately respond to NBC News’ request for comment on the president’s apparent stumbles during the BET interview.

Vance made an interesting choice as he closed his remarks this morning at the Faith & Freedom Coalition’s God & Country breakfast in Milwaukee.
The newly minted Republican nominee for vice president quoted from Quentin Tarantino’s violent and profane 1994 film “Pulp Fiction.”
“So, I’m going to get out of here, but I’ll leave you with one more final thought, and it comes from one of my favorite theologians, the character Jules in the movie ‘Pulp Fiction,’” Vance said. 
Several in the hotel ballroom laughed in recognition, unsure of where, exactly, this was going.
“Sorry, this will make sense in a second,” Vance promised. 
“If you’ve ever seen this movie, there’s a scene where Jules is sort of a violent gangster, and a guy unloads on him at point-blank range, and he sort of looks at himself and expects to be, you know, riddled with bullets, and then he’s totally fine,” he continued. “And he gets into an argument with his fellow violent gangster about whether this was a miracle, whether God had come down from heaven and stopped these mother-effing bullets. That was the exact phrase from that movie.”
Vance then explained the point that he — and Jules, who was played by Samuel L. Jackson — was trying to make: “It’s not about whether God changed Coke to Pepsi or found my car keys. What matters is that I felt the touch of God.”

Facing calls to bow out of the presidential race, Biden was primed yesterday to speak to a usually supportive audience of Latino leaders and community organizers, but minutes before his speech, it was announced that he had tested positive for Covid.
Biden’s appearance at the UnidosUS conference in Las Vegas was already delayed when Janet Murguía, the group’s president, looking a little teary-eyed, appeared onstage and announced that Biden had called her to say that he could not make it.

MILWAUKEE — Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, a right-wing populist known for his unbending opinions, introduced himself yesterday as a vice presidential candidate open to compromise and eager for unity but unapologetically drawn to hot-button debates.
“We have a big tent in this party, on everything from national security to economic policy,” Vance told delegates as he accepted their nomination to be Trump’s running mate. “But my message to you, my fellow Republicans, is: We love this country, and we are united to win. And our disagreements actually make us stronger.”

The Supreme Court said it ruled that the state health insurance agency’s refusal to provide spousal insurance coverage for gay couples was an act of discrimination that violates the constitutional principle of equality.
Thursday’s ruling is final and cannot be appealed.

36,NBC_37,Federal appeals court dismisses lawsuit over Tennessee’s anti-drag show ban,https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-lawsuit-tennessees-anti-drag-show-ban-rcna162620,"A federal appeals court on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit challenging a first-in-the-nation law designed to place strict limits on drag shows, reversing a lower court ruling that deemed the statute unconstitutional and blocked its enforcement in part of the state.
The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Memphis-based LGBTQ+ theater company that filed the complaint last year lacked the legal right to sue over the law.
Friends of George’s had alleged that the law would negatively affect them because they produce “drag-centric performances, comedy sketches, and plays” with no age restrictions.
However, the federal appeals court found that Friends of George’s was not at risk of violating the 2023 law because its performances were not “harmful to minors.”
Tennessee’s Republican-dominated Legislature advanced the anti-drag law last year with the support of Republican Gov. Bill Lee. Several GOP members pointed to drag performances in their hometowns as reasons why it was necessary to restrict such performances from taking place in public or where children could view them.
The law banned adult cabaret performances on public property or anywhere minors might be present. Performers who break the law risk being charged with a misdemeanor or a felony for a repeat offense.
In Thursday’s ruling, the justices stressed that the term “harmful to minors” has a specific definition under Tennessee law — which has three components that must be met in order to prosecute. The ruling also pointed out that the Tennessee Supreme Court limited the definition of “harmful to a minor” to materials lacking “serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for a reasonable 17-year-old minor.”
“FOG has not alleged that its performances lack serious value for a 17-year-old. In fact, it insists the exact opposite. Its own witness, a member of FOG’s board, conceded that its shows ‘are definitely appropriate’ for a 15- year-old and would ‘absolutely’ have artistic value for a 17-year-old,” the ruling stated.
Friends of George’s did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the ruling.
“As a state overflowing with world-class artists and musicians, Tennessee respects the right to free expression,” said Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti in a statement. “But as the court noted, Tennessee’s ‘harmful to minors’ standard is constitutionally sound and Tennessee can absolutely prohibit the exhibition of obscene material to children.”
Questions over how Tennessee’s anti-drag ban should be enforced have constantly been debated since the law’s inception. Democrats, who hold only a sliver of power in Tennessee, were quick to argue that the law was too vague and could be used by a prosecutor to target the LGBTQ+ community.
While a federal judge last June sided with Friends of George’s that the law was “substantially overbroad” and encouraged “discriminatory enforcement,” the ruling only applied to Shelby County, where Memphis lies.
Shortly after, a district attorney warned Pride organizers in eastern Tennessee that he planned on enforcing the anti-drag ban during their annual festival, prompting organizers in Blount County to sue. A federal judge eventually granted a temporary restraining order preventing law enforcement and the district attorney from enforcing the state law.
Similar to other Republican-led states, Tennessee’s Republican supermajority has repeatedly passed laws over the years targeting transgender people and the LGBTQ community.
Earlier this year, the Human Rights Campaign announced that Tennessee has enacted more anti-LGBTQ laws more than any other state since 2015, identifying more than 20 bills that advanced out of the Legislature this year alone.
That included sending Gov. Lee a bill banning the spending of state money on hormone therapy or gender confirmation procedures for prisoners — though it would not apply to state inmates currently receiving hormone therapy — and requiring public school employees to out transgender students to their parents.‎ "
36,CNN_54,Federal appeals court dismisses challenge to Tennessee’s anti-drag law,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/18/politics/tennessee-anti-drag-law-challenge-dismissed/index.html,"
            A federal appeals court on Thursday dismissed a challenge to a Tennessee law that restricts public drag show performances in the state.
    

The appeals court ruled 2-1 that Friends of George’s, a Memphis-based nonprofit that produces drag performances and comedy sketches, lacked the legal standing challenge the law, with the dissenting judge saying that he thought the plaintiffs had standing to challenge the measure, which he called an “unconstitutional content-based restriction on speech.”
    

            Passed in 2023, Tennessee’s Adult Entertainment Act sought to limit “adult cabaret performances” on public property to shield children from viewing them. Violators could be charged with a misdemeanor and repeat offenders with a felony.
    

            The Tennessee law was the first of its kind to be enacted in the US. State officials have argued that the measure is not a full ban and is only intended to stop overtly sexual performances in front of minors.
    

            In June 2023, a federal judge barred enforcement of the law in Shelby County, Tennessee, which is home to Memphis, saying the law was an “unconstitutional restriction on the freedom of speech.” But the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision on Thursday and threw out the case in its entirety.
    

            The appellate court said Friends of George’s failed to show how it would be harmed by the law.
    

            Circuit Judge John Nalbandian wrote that the group “faces no certainly impeding threat of prosecution.” Nalbandian, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, was joined by Circuit Judge Eugene Siler, an appointee of former President George H.W. Bush.

            Circuit Judge Andre Mathis, an appointee of President Joe Biden, said in his dissent that he would have upheld the lower-court’s ruling that blocked enforcement of the law in Shelby County.
    

            Friends of George’s “did not have to wait” for state prosecutors to enforce the Adult Entertainment Act “before challenging the constitutionality of the law,” Mathis wrote.
    

            “Given the nature of its shows, along with the general admissions policy followed by the Evergreen Theater, there is a substantial probability that (Friends of George’s) will engage in conduct that is arguably affected by the (Adult Entertainment Act) because it performs adult cabaret entertainment in a location where it could be viewed by a minor. And if it does, (Friends of George’s) faces a certain threat of prosecution,” the judge wrote.
    

            Though the ban remains in effect in much of the state, officials are blocked from enforcing it in Blount County as part of a separate lawsuit against it.
    

            “I feel quite confident that that case is going to survive standing review and we’re still considering whether to appeal the standing decision here,” said Brice Timmons, an attorney representing the plaintiffs in the Friends of George’s lawsuit.
    

            Republicans say the performances – which often feature men dressing as women in exaggerated makeup while singing or entertaining a crowd, though some shows feature bawdier content – expose children to sexual themes and imagery that are inappropriate.
    

            LGBTQ advocates, however, argue that not all drag shows are sexual in nature and laws such as the one in Tennessee stigmatize the community and could violate the First Amendment.

54,FOX_15,European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes final bid for second term before vote,https://www.foxnews.com/world/european-commission-president-ursula-von-der-leyen-makes-final-bid-second-term-before-vote,"President Biden answers a question about concerns former President Trump will 'weaken NATO' and stop supporting Ukraine.
Ursula von der Leyen pledged to be a strong leader for Europe in a time of crisis and polarization as she made her final leadership pitch in a speech to lawmakers at the European Parliament ahead of a vote Thursday afternoon on whether to grant her a second five-year term as president of the European Union's executive commission.
The secret ballot at the 720-seat parliament comes hot on the heels of strong gains by the far right in last month's election for the European Parliament. Voting gets underway at 1 p.m. and results are expected by 3 p.m.
""I will never let the extreme polarization of our societies become accepted. I will never accept that demagogues and extremists destroy our European way of life. And I stand here today ready to lead the fight with all the Democratic forces in this house,"" von der Leyen said.
EUROPEAN LEADERS DOWNPLAY ORBAN'S PRAISE OF TRUMP AS THEY DEFEND BIDEN'S GAFFES: 'SLIPS OF THE TONGUE'
If a majority of the lawmakers reject her candidacy, it would leave leaders of the 27-nation bloc scrambling to find a replacement as Europe grapples with crises ranging from the war in Ukraine to climate change.
In a speech that sought to shore up support from across the political spectrum, von der Leyen pledged to strengthen the EU economy, its police and border agencies, tackle migration and pursue policies tackling climate change while also helping farmers who have staged protests against what they call stifling EU bureaucracy and environmental rules.
She also took a swipe at Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and his recent visit to Russia shortly after his country took over the rotating six-month EU presidency.

""This so-called peace mission was nothing but an appeasement mission,"" von der Leyen said as she vowed that Europe would remain shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine.
One radical right lawmaker, Diana Iovanovici-Sosoaca of Romania, was escorted out of the parliament's chamber for heckling a speaker during the debate following von der Leyen's speech. Iovanovici-Sosoaca briefly wore what appeared to be a muzzle and held up religious icons before being led out of the room.
Over the past five years, von der Leyen has steered the bloc through a series of crises, including Britain’s exit from the EU, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. She has also pushed a Green Deal aiming to make the EU climate-neutral by 2050.
As the debate ended, she told lawmakers: ""I hope to have your trust and confidence for the next years. Long live Europe.""
Von der Leyen's election came as newly elected U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer was welcoming some 45 heads of government to discuss migration, energy security and the threat from Russia as he seeks to restore relations between the U.K. and its European neighbors.
The leaders signed off on the conservative German von der Leyen at a summit meeting late last month. The 65-year-old von der Leyen’s bid was boosted when the European People's Party, which includes von der Leyen’s Christian Democratic Union, remained the largest group at the EU Parliament after the elections.
But her re-election is not a foregone conclusion as some lawmakers within her own center-right European People’s Party could still vote against her. She needs a straight majority of 361 votes to secure a second term.
The German politician has been praised for her leading role during the coronavirus crisis, when the EU bought vaccines collectively for its citizens. But she also found herself receiving sharp criticism for the opacity of the negotiations with vaccine makers.

The EU general court ruled Wednesday that the commission did not allow the public enough access to information about COVID-19 vaccine purchase agreements it secured with pharmaceutical companies during the pandemic.
Following the elections for EU Parliament, European Union leaders agreed on the officials who will hold the key positions in the world’s biggest trading bloc in the coming years for issues ranging from antitrust investigations to foreign policy. At the side of von der Leyen will be two new faces: Antonio Costa of Portugal as European Council president and Estonia’s Kaja Kallas as the top diplomat of the world’s largest trading bloc.
While Costa’s nomination only needed the leaders’ approval, Kallas will also need to be approved by European lawmakers later this year. The Estonian prime minister is a staunch supporter of Ukraine and a fierce critic of Russia within the European Union and NATO."

            Ursula von der Leyen has been reelected to a second five-year term as president of the European Commission after a vote by EU lawmakers, as the continent’s mainstream seeks to reassert itself in the face of a resurgent far right.
    

            In an earlier pitch to the European parliament in Strasbourg, France, von der Leyen on Thursday pledged to invest in infrastructure and industry, create a new “European Defense Union” and stay the course on the continent’s green transition.
    

            After a secret ballot, von der Leyen was reelected with 401 votes in favor and 284 against. She needed more than 360 ballots to secure a majority in the 720-seat parliament.
    

            Von der Leyen, who led the commission through the Covid-19 pandemic and the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, will now preside over a bloc that shifted rightward after last month’s European elections, when far-right parties won a record number of seats.
    

            Addressing the parliament before the lunchtime vote, von der Leyen said the next five years of her term “will define Europe’s place in the world for the next five decades. It will decide whether we shape our own future or let it be shaped by events or by others.”
    

            Von der Leyen, a 65-year-old German national, was parachuted into the presidential candidacy process as a compromise candidate in 2019, but has since become one of Europe’s most solid pillars. Several of the continent’s other leaders – from Germany’s former Chancellor Angela Merkel to French President Emmanuel Macron – have retired or been weakened by domestic politics.
    

            Von der Leyen’s own position was somewhat diminished by last month’s election, which saw a surge in support for the far right and saw Brussels’ center ground shrink.
    

            Her reelection was not certain but widely expected, after she was proposed by EU leaders and could rely on the support of her center-right European People’s Party (EPP), as well as the center-left Socialist and Democrats (S&D) and liberal Renew blocs. Shortly before Thursday’s vote, the Green bloc also announced it would support her.
    

            After the vote, von der Leyen said her reelection was “a very emotional and special moment” and that she was grateful for the trust the parliament had placed in her.
    

            “We have spared no effort. We have navigated the most troubled waters that our union has ever faced. And we have kept the course on our long-term European goals,” she said, praising the work done under her first term.
    

            Earlier Thursday, von der Leyen published a 31-page policy proposal, setting out her priorities if she won a second term.
    

            Echoing remarks she made after last month’s vote, she stressed “it is essential that the democratic center in Europe holds” in the face of resurgent extremes, calling on mainstream parties to “live up to the scale of the concerns and the challenges that people face in their lives.”
    

            Von der Leyen pledged to “turbo charge investment” needed by cash-strapped EU governments for their “green, digital and social transition.”
    

            She also vowed to create a European Defense Union and appoint a commissioner for defense, a new role for the bloc that was forged in peacetime but has since had to respond to Russia’s brutal war in Ukraine, and the prospect of a Donald Trump-led United States retreating from the world stage.
    

            Under the proposed new defense union, member states will retain responsibility for their own troops, but will work more closely with others to “coordinate efforts to strengthen the defense industrial base.” She also proposed a Europe-wide air defense system and cyber protection measures.
    

            Speaking in Strasbourg before her reelection, von der Leyen said Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s recent trip to Moscow to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin was “an appeasement mission,” and pledged to maintain EU support for Ukraine.
    

            Von der Leyen’s reelection comes a day after the EU’s second-highest court delivered an unusual rebuke to the commission, ruling it was not transparent enough about the contracts it signed for Covid-19 vaccines during the pandemic.

The walls appear to be closing in on President Biden's re-election campaign.
Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., reportedly told President Biden in a phone call that polls are showing he cannot defeat former President Trump in November and that him staying in the race could destroy Democrats’ chances of taking the House in November.
The phone call marked the second time Pelosi and Biden spoke since the president's disastrous debate performance against Trump on June 27, according to a CNN report Thursday citing four sources briefed on the call. The sources also told CNN that the former speaker did not tell Biden to drop out of the race. 
The report came just hours before the Washington Post reported that former President Barack Obama told his allies in recent days that he believes Biden needs to reconsider his candidacy.

In terms of the Pelosi call, Biden responded by pushing back, telling her he has seen polls that indicate he can win, one source told the outlet. 
Another one of the sources described Biden as getting defensive about the polls and that at one point, Pelosi asked Mike Donilon, Biden’s longtime adviser, to get on the line to talk over the data.
It is unclear when exactly the call took place, but one CNN source says it was held within the last week. Pelosi and Biden also spoke in early July.
A spokesperson for Pelosi tells Fox News Digital that the congresswoman would not comment on private conversations with the president. 
""Speaker Pelosi respects the confidentiality of her meetings and conversations with the President of the United States. Sadly, the feeding frenzy from the press based on anonymous sources misrepresents any conversations the Speaker may have had with the President,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. 
Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment but did not immediately receive a response.
Pelosi is a longtime Biden ally. She led House Democrats for the entirety of Biden's two terms as vice president and served as House speaker for the first two years of his presidency, ushering major pieces of Biden's agenda through Congress, including the American Rescue Plan and the bipartisan infrastructure law.
In the wake of the debate, Pelosi said she would support whatever the president decided to do, although several reports indicate that she was encouraging lawmakers to continue to put pressure on Biden to reconsider his decision to run for re-election.

Biden has faced mounting calls to step aside since his disastrous debate performance and his campaign has been in disarray ever since. The campaign had believed that the attempted assassination of Trump, in which he sustained a wound to the right ear, had tamped down calls for Biden to step aside.
But on Wednesday, influential Democratic California Rep. Adam Schiff called on Biden to drop out, telling Fox News Digital in a statement that he has ""serious concerns about whether the President can defeat Donald Trump in November.""
Reuters, citing a top White House source with direct knowledge of the matter, reported earlier Thursday that Pelosi backed Schiff’s call for Biden to drop out of the race, although her office did not address the report when asked by Fox News Digital. Schiff and Pelosi both represent California districts in the House.

""Nancy is all over this. She doesn't miss. Schiff wouldn't move without her approval,"" the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.
Last week, a number of House Democrats told The Hill that Pelosi was advising members in their conference against rallying to Biden before there is a broader discussion over whether he is the best candidate to defeat Trump. 
""I did have a conversation with her, she is very concerned,"" one House Democratic lawmaker told The Hill. ""It’s not like she’s like, ‘We’re sticking with this guy.'""

            Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi privately told President Joe Biden in a recent conversation that polling shows that the president cannot defeat Donald Trump and that Biden could destroy Democrats’ chances of winning the House in November if he continues seeking a second term, according to four sources briefed on the call.
    

            The president responded by pushing back, telling Pelosi he has seen polls that indicate he can win, one source said. Another one of the sources described Biden as getting defensive about the polls. At one point, Pelosi asked Mike Donilon, Biden’s longtime adviser, to get on the line to talk over the data.
    

            This phone call would mark the second known conversation between the California lawmaker and Biden since the president’s disastrous debate on June 27. While the exact date of the conversation was not clear, one source described it as being within the last week. Pelosi and Biden also spoke in early July.
    

            None of the sources indicated whether Pelosi told Biden in this conversation that she believes the president should drop out of the 2024 race.
    

            Pelosi has spent the weeks following the debate listening to concerns from her colleagues. Pelosi made waves when she said in an interview last week: “It’s up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We’re all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.”
    

            When asked for comment, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates did not respond to the details of CNN’s reporting on the recent Pelosi-Biden call. “President Biden is the nominee of the party. He plans to win and looks forward to working with congressional Democrats to pass his 100 days agenda to help working families,” Bates said.
    

            A Pelosi spokesperson told CNN that the former House speaker has been in California since Friday and she has not spoken to Biden since.

85,CNN_5,Takeaways from the third night of the Republican National Convention,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/18/politics/takeaways-rnc-day-3/index.html,"
            Two days after being tapped as Donald Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance introduced himself to voters in a speech that highlighted the populist direction the two aim to take the Republican Party — and the nation.
    

            Vance’s Republican National Convention speech capped a night Republicans spent prosecuting what they see as President Joe Biden’s biggest foreign policy failures and their consequences.
    

            Gold Star families hammered Biden’s handling of the 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal. The parents of a Hamas kidnapping victim led chants of “Bring them home.” A Jewish Harvard University graduate who is suing the school over claims of antisemitism, said that “the far left-wing tide of antisemitism is rising.”
    

            “America is still worth fighting for,” said Sgt. William Pekrul, a World War II veteran nearing the age of 100 and recipient of two Bronze Stars and a Silver Star. “With President Trump as the commander-in-chief, I would go back and re-enlist today.”
    

            Republicans also spent much of their prime-time lineup attempting to show Trump’s human side — including remarks by his 17-year-old granddaughter Kai Trump, who described the former president bragging that she had made the honor roll and peppering her with questions about her golf game.
    

            Here are seven takeaways from the Republican National Convention’s third night:
    

            Vance, perhaps best-known for his memoir “Hillbilly Ellegy,” is a freshman senator with a relatively little following outside Trump’s MAGA-verse prior to his selection this week.
    

            Republicans used Wednesday night to introduce Vance and his life story to the nation.
    

            Raised in a rural Ohio town that he said is “a place that had been cast aside and forgotten by America’s ruling class in Washington,” Vance said he watched factories close and addictions rip through families, including his own. He joined the Marines and ultimately attended Yale Law School, where he met his wife, Usha.
    

            “There is still so much talent and grit in the American heartland. But for these places to thrive, we need a leader who fights for the people who built this country,” Vance said.
    

            Vance’s political leanings — populist and isolationist — more closely match Trump than the Republican Party of years past.
    

            Vance connected those beliefs to his upbringing, and turned them into an attack on Biden’s record.
    

            He said when he was in fourth grade, then-Sen. Biden backed the North American Free Trade Agreement — a deal passed with Republican support at the time. He called it “a bad trade deal that sent countless good American manufacturing jobs to Mexico.”
    

            When he was in high school, Vance said, Biden backed a China trade deal and the US invasion of Iraq.
    

            “And at each step of the way, in small towns like mine in Ohio, or next door in Pennsylvania, or in Michigan and other states across our country, jobs were sent overseas and children were sent to war,” he said.
    

            What’s been clear since Vance became the GOP vice presidential pick is that the Trump campaign wants to make sure the Ohio senator did not come onto the national stage as a hard right Republican with conservative positions on abortion, social issues and isolationism.
    

            Vance’s speech on Wednesday night followed that. Even before he took the stage, Vance’s wife Usha described him as a puppy loving, down-to-earth, self-made family man with degrees from a popular public university and posh Ivy league law school.
    

            Later throughout his speech, the senator kept hitting on softer topics – like saying the Ohio State University chant before noting, “Gotta chill with that Ohio love. We gotta win Michigan, too.”
    

            To be sure, there were bits of Vance’s speech that were Trumpian, such as attacking Biden for giving China “a sweetheart trade deal that destroyed even more good middle class jobs” and saying that Trump “didn’t need politics but the country needed him.”
    

            Still, for every line similar to Trump’s 2016 argument that he alone could save the country, there were everyman lines that fall in line with his “Hillbilly Elegy” bio, from giving a shoutout to his mom being in the audience for being “10 years clean and sober” to talking about his family’s cemetery plot.
    

            What he didn’t mention: His past critical comments about Trump or his stances on abortion and Ukraine. The speech overall was less a new version of the Trumpian braggadocio of hardline immigration politics and more an attempt to win over poor and middle-class voters across the political spectrum.
    

            Wednesday wasn’t just JD Vance’s introduction to the American public. It was Usha Vance’s, too.
    

            For years, JD has described his wife – whom he met while they attended Yale Law School – as a key part of his success. During his 2022 Senate campaign, she used her media appearances to help humanize him and defend him for criticisms that he’d changed his views for political expediency.
    

            On stage in Milwaukee, Usha Vance laid out her husband’s biography and compared it to her own. Unlike her husband, she shared that she was raised in a middle class home in suburban San Diego by two loving parents who are Indian immigrants.
    

            But, as she noted in a humanizing moment, JD adapted to the differences between them.
    

            “When JD met me, he approached our differences with curiosity and enthusiasm,” she shared. “That JD and I could meet at all, let alone fall in love and marry, is a testament to this great country.”
    

            But the nation’s full introduction to the Vance family will have to come later. At a convention dedicated to Trump, there wasn’t room for Usha to delve deeply into her own background, including the fact that she graduated summa cum laude from Yale University; attended Yale Law School; and clerked for both Brett Kavanaugh when he served on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and Chief Justice John Roberts.
    

            She also didn’t touch on her own reservations about stepping into the spotlight. Just last month, she told Fox News that she wasn’t “raring” to completely upend their lives, but she believed in her husband.
    

            Former Trump White House official Peter Navarro began his day in the Florida prison where he’s spent the last four months, jailed for refusing to cooperate with the House investigation into the January 6, 2021, insurrection.
    

            Navarro ended it onstage at the RNC in Milwaukee, where he received a standing ovation – and cheers of “Welcome home!” – from Republicans who, just a night earlier, promised to restore “law and order” to America.
    

            “What these lawfare jackals don’t understand,” a defiant Navarro said, “when they put people like me in prison and fire figurative and now literal bullets at Donald Trump, they also assault our families.”
    

            The motives of the alleged gunman in Pennsylvania are not yet clear. He was a registered Republican who also gave a small donation years ago to a liberal cause.
    

            The tone of Navarro’s rhetoric, including a declaration that he “went to prison so you won’t have to” and a warning that Democrats will put “a whole army of illiterate illegal aliens” on “your front doorstep,” was a notable departure to the unusually reserved language used by many speakers on the first two nights of the convention.
    

            Navarro was not the only controversial figure on the convention floor in Milwaukee. Trump’s 2016 campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was convicted and pleaded guilty to a variety of crimes and spent nearly two years in prison, was also present. After losing the 2020 election, Trump pardoned Manafort “from convictions prosecuted in the course of Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation, which was premised on the Russian collusion hoax.”
    

            Trump himself, of course, was found guilty on all 34 charges of falsifying business records earlier this year, making him the first former president in US history to be convicted of a felony.
    

            Perhaps the most poignant moment of the convention so far came when the families of some of the 13 service members who were killed in a suicide bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul during the United States’ August 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan sharply criticized Biden’s actions, then and now.
    

            “Look at our faces. Look at our pain and heartbreak,” said Cheryl Juels, the aunt of Marine Sgt. Nicole Gee.
    

            “That was not an ‘extraordinary success,’” she added, using the same words Biden did weeks after the withdrawal to describe it.
    

            “Joe Biden owes the men and women who served in Afghanistan a debt of gratitude and an apology,” Juels said.
    

            Herman Lopez, the father of Marine Col. Hunter Lopez, said that when Biden met the families of the 13 service members killed, the president “made the occasion more about his son, lost to cancer, than our sons and daughters.”
    

            He then said Biden had lied in the June CNN debate with Trump that on his watch, there haven’t been “any troops dying anywhere in the world.”
    

            Col. Lopez’s mother, Alicia Lopez, said in the three years since those 13 service members were killed, “there has been a deafening silence from the Biden and Harris administration. Despite our pleas for answers and accountability, they have pushed us away and tried to silence us.”
    

            Herman Lopez then said the names of all 13 service members who were killed in the suicide bombing.
    

            It was an emotional moment, and one reminiscent of Gold Star parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. “You have sacrificed nothing — and no one,” Khizr Khan said.
    

            A stunning scene played out far from television screens in Milwaukee, as Republican senators confronted Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle and chased her through Fiserv Forum, demanding answers to questions about Saturday’s assassination attempt.
    

            “This was an assassination attempt! You owe the people answers. You owe President Trump answers!” Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn shouted at Cheatle, who continued to walk with her head down and ignore the senators’ criticism.
    

            “It’s stonewalling!” Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 3 Senate Republican, said.
    

            Blackburn later posted a video of the encounter to X, writing: “The American people deserve answers from the Secret Service.”
    

            In another video posted by Blackburn, she is joined by Sens. James Lankford and Kevin Cramer, as well as Barrasso, as the group confronted Cheatle.
    

            In the full video, Barrasso demanded Cheatle’s “resignation or full explanation to us, right now.”
    

            When pressed by Blackburn why Trump was still able to go on stage when they had already been made aware of a threat, Cheatle replied, “I don’t think that this is the forum to have this discussion.”
    

            Cheatle indicated she’ll address their questions at another time and moved to leave. At that point, the senators said, “We’re going with you,” and began following her.
    

            As they walked, Barrasso accused her of having “no shame, no concern.”
    

            “You’re supposed to protect the president of the United States!” he said.
    

            “You answer to us!” added Cramer.
    

            North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum’s speech was notable not only for its awkwardness – he stumbled through a joke referencing his torn Achilles tendon shortly before his first presidential primary debate performance in the same arena where the convention is now taking place – but also for its emphasis on energy policy.
    

            That’s by design. When Burgum ran a longshot bid for president this cycle, rumors surfaced that he was really positioning himself to be energy secretary for a future Republican administration. Energy security and energy policy are in the governor’s comfort zone and that was on full display Wednesday night.
    

            In his speech, Burgum argued the Biden administration’s “war on energy hurts every American” and a new Trump administration would unleash “American energy dominance” that would be a “path to prosperity and peace through strength.” At another point, Burgum said innovation “has always been the source of American greatness and President Trump champions innovation over regulation.”
    

            The speech will further fuel speculation that Burgum is headed for some future post in Washington, should Trump return to the White House. Burgum was a finalist to be Trump’s vice presidential running mate and found himself just a few days ago waiting in a hotel near the site of the Republican National Convention for final word. When Trump finally did call Burgum, the former president told Burgum he would not be his running mate. But, in a possible allusion to the future, Trump started the call by saying, “Hey, Mr. Secretary.”

85,NYT_4,Takeaways From Day 3 of the Republican Convention,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/us/politics/takeaways-rnc-day-3.html,"The penultimate night of the Republican National Convention belonged to the vice-presidential nominee, J.D. Vance.
Welcomed to the stage by his friend Donald Trump Jr. and introduced by his wife, Usha Vance, he was given nearly an hour to introduce himself to America and articulate his vision of blue-collar conservatism.
It was a relatively low-key address from the 39-year-old Ohio senator, who laid out his remarkable biography and economic vision without much passion. Viewers heard a diagnosis of America’s ills that often blamed policies that Republicans have embraced for decades, and many prescriptions that would break from the party’s orthodoxy.Here are five highlights from Night 3:Listeners might have been forgiven for thinking that President Biden was the architect of economic and foreign policies dating to George H.W. Bush, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, the opening of China to international trade and the war in Iraq.
But between partisan jabs and misplaced responsibility, Mr. Vance laid out an economic vision that in fact blamed his own party and its Wall Street and corporate patrons for the struggles of working Americans. He mentioned policies that might hearten blue-collar voters but would give Republican donors heartburn.

95,CNN_18,Russian trial of US journalist Evan Gershkovich resumes after being brought forward,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/18/media/evan-gershkovich-trial-resumes-russia-intl/index.html,"
            The espionage trial of American journalist Evan Gershkovich resumed in a Russian court on Thursday after being brought forward at the request of his defense.
    

            Gershkovich attended the court hearing in person, according to the court’s press service, with the hearing being held behind closed doors. The hearing has adjourned for today and will start again Friday.
    

            The court did not give an indication of when they would expect to deliver the verdict.
    

            Gershkovich, the first American journalist to be arrested on spying charges in Russia since the Cold War, first went on trial on June 26 at the Sverdlovsky Regional Court in the city of Yekaterinburg, where he appeared in a courtroom’s glass cage with his head shaved.
    

            He was arrested while reporting for the Wall Street Journal, during a reporting trip in Yekaterinburg in March 2023, and later accused of spying for the CIA. Gershkovich, the US government, and the WSJ have vehemently denied the charges against him.
    

            The WSJ’s publisher Dow Jones in a statement Thursday reiterated its call for the release of Gershkovich, saying his detention “must end now.”
    

            “Even as Russia orchestrates its shameful sham trial, we continue to do everything we can to push for Evan’s immediate release and to state unequivocally: Evan was doing his job as a journalist, and journalism is not a crime. Bring him home now,” the statement said.
    

            US and Western officials have accused Russia of using Gershkovich and other jailed foreigners as bargaining chips for possible prisoner exchanges.
    

A high-profile swap in 2022 saw US basketball star Brittney Griner exchanged for arms dealer Viktor Bout. But Russia refused to release another jailed US citizen, Paul Whelan, as it was seeking a former colonel from Russia’s domestic spy organization in return.
    

            If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison.
    

            The British Consul General in Ekaterinburg, Ameer Kotecha, attended the hearing as a listener — but like other listeners, he won’t be able to get into the courtroom, according to Russian state media TASS.
    

            Roger Carstens, US special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, said the US Embassy in Russia planned to seek permission to attend the Thursday hearing, TASS reported.
    

            CNN has reached out to the US Embassy in Russia.
    

            Before his transfer to Yekaterinburg, the 32-year-old journalist was imprisoned in Moscow’s notorious Lefortovo Prison, spending almost every hour of the day in a small cell.
    

            He passed the time by writing letters to his friends and family, his parents said in an interview with the WSJ, adding that he has been allowed just one hour of walking per day.

95,WaPo_42,Russian court moves quickly in trial of journalist Evan Gershkovich,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/18/evan-gershkovich-reporter-russia-trial/,"A Russian court on Thursday completed its examination of evidence in the case of alleged spying against American journalist Evan Gershkovich on only the second day of hearings, with arguments from the defense and prosecution due on Friday, Russian media reported.As Gershkovich’s trial resumed this week, the country’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, all but declared the Wall Street Journalist correspondent guilty — echoing earlier Kremlin remarks although authorities have not made public any evidence to support their allegations.A court spokesperson said that the court’s examination of the evidence in the case had concluded on the second day of the trial, with arguments from the defense and prosecution due on Friday, Interfax reported.The process was remarkably swift for an espionage trial, which often run to many months in Russia. Local Yekaterinburg outlet It’s My City reported that the prosecution would make its sentencing request on Friday.“We have got irrefutable evidence corroborating that Gershkovich was involved in some espionage activities,” Lavrov said Wednesday at a news conference at the United Nations in New York, where Russia is currently chairing the Security Council.Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal, and the Biden administration have vehemently denied that there is any basis to Russia’s allegations and that he has essentially been taken hostage. Russia previously has arrested Americans, such as WNBA star Brittney Griner, on what appear to be minor charges, and then used them as bargaining chips to win the release of Russians imprisoned for serious crimes in the West.The trial this week at the Sverdlovsk Regional Court in Yekaterinburg was  moved up from Aug. 13 at the request of Gershkovich’s defense team, according to the court. The first hearing was held late last month.An swift completion of the trial could open the way for movement on a prisoner exchange. Lavrov on Wednesday confirmed that negotiations over an exchange for Gershkovich were underway, after Russian officials previously have said no trade would be possible until after his trial is complete. More than 99 percent of Russian criminal prosecutions result in convictions.“The intelligence services of the two countries ... have been involved in contacts looking into the possibility of an exchange,” Lavrov said. “Everyone knows that this topic needs to be discussed calmly, confidentially even though it is constantly introduced into the public space by American journalists, which is not helping. But the contacts are ongoing.”Lavrov’s assertion of “irrefutable evidence” — while not providing any — echoed the remarks of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov who claimed after Gershkovich’s arrest last year that he had been “caught red-handed.”Gershkovich, 32, who was accredited by Russia’s Foreign Ministry, was detained in March 2023 on a reporting trip to Yekaterinburg and accused of espionage. He has pleaded not guilty.Russian prosecutors allege that the journalist was operating on the orders of the CIA, gathering secret information about Uralvagonzavod, a state-owned machine-building factory in Nizhny Tagil, about 87 miles southeast of Yekaterinburg. The factory manufactures tanks for Russia’s war on Ukraine.The hearing was closed, as is customary in Russian trials in cases of espionage or treason, meaning that the nature of the evidence presented by prosecutors against Gershkovich probably will never be publicly known. Gershkovich faces a prison term of up to 20 years if convicted.Vyacheslav Vegner, a member of the Sverdlovsk region’s Legislative Assembly, appeared as a witness in the case on Thursday and was questioned by both sides, he told Interfax news agency, which offered no details on what he said or whether he was a prosecution or defense witness. He said he had spoken to Gershkovich during the journalist’s reporting trip to Yekaterinburg.Russian media outlet SOTAvision quoted Vegner saying that Gershkovich asked him if the profile of the military-industrial plants in Yekaterinburg was changing, how many shifts they worked and whether there was sufficient personnel.The U.S. Embassy in Moscow said last month that the case against Gershkovich was “not about evidence, procedural norms, or the rule of law. It is about the Kremlin using American citizens to achieve its political objectives.”At the U.N., Lavrov said: “The use of journalists for intelligence-gathering purposes, at least in the Anglo-Saxon world, is a tradition.”Before Gershkovich’s trial opened in Yekaterinburg on June 26, Wall Street Journal editor in chief Emma Tucker described the charges as baseless, saying they would “inevitably lead to a bogus conviction for an innocent man.”Former president Donald Trump has stated that he would use his personal relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin to have Gershkovich freed shortly after the November U.S. election, in which he expects to be elected president.Gershkovich’s arrest, as well as those of several other Americans, has raised the specter of a renewal of “hostage diplomacy,” when nations arrest innocent citizens for use in exchanges or to send pointed political messages.Another American jailed for spying, former U.S. Marine and corporate security executive Paul Whelan, 54, has spent more than  5½ years behind bars in Russia, having been passed over in two previous prisoner exchange deals with Russia.These occurred when Griner, convicted in Moscow of drug possession in August 2022, was freed in an exchange that December for the Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, and former U.S. Marine Trevor Reed, convicted of assaulting a police officer, was freed in April 2022 in exchange for Russian pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko, who was jailed in the United States for drug smuggling.The State Department has declared both Gershkovich and Whelan to be unlawfully detained by Russia, elevating the efforts to free them. When the trial started, Peskov said that the charges against Gershkovich resonated in the United States, “but it is not so resonant in our country.”Russia has also arrested a Russian American journalist, Alsu Kurmasheva, an editor at U.S. government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty based in Prague and charged her with failing to register as a foreign agent and spreading fake news about the Russia-Ukraine war. Kurmasheva and RFE/RL reject the charges as false.In February, a court in Russia’s Jewish Autonomous Region, in the Far East, convicted German journalist Björn Blaschke from radio broadcaster Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR), on charges of discrediting the Russian military, over a social media post in 2022. Blaschke left the country after being fined and released from custody.Russia’s Center for Combating Extremism for the Jewish Autonomous Region mounted the charges over a post by Blaschke on X on Aug. 2, 2022, in German, which stated:  “Russia’s attack on Ukraine exacerbates the situation: rising world prices for wheat and fuel also affected Kenya, Ethiopia, and South Sudan.”Blaschke pleaded not guilty and testified that the post was a quote from a Kenyan man, posted during a reporting trip to the east African nation.Russian Federal Security Service agents routinely search the phones of foreign journalists traveling to Russia.A Moscow court on Thursday sentenced American musician Michael Travis Leake to 13 years in a strict regime penal colony after convicting him of attempted drug trafficking. Leake was the lead vocalist for a Moscow-based band, Lovi Noch, and produced music for Russian bands.He was arrested in June 2023 and accused of organizing the sales of drugs to young people; he has denied the charges."
124,CNN_48,"Lou Dobbs, veteran cable news anchor and Trump booster, dies at 78",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/18/media/lou-dobbs-dead/index.html,"
            Lou Dobbs, the longtime business news anchor who became one of Donald Trump’s most vocal supporters in media, died on Thursday. He was 78.
    

            “It’s with a heavy heart that we announce the passing of ‘the great Lou Dobbs,’” a statement posted on his official social media account said, calling him a “fighter till the very end.”
    

            Dobbs had a lengthy career in broadcast journalism, spending more than two decades at CNN, which he joined at its inception in 1980 and anchoring the program “Moneyline.” Dobbs left CNN in 2009 to help media mogul Rupert Murdoch launch the Fox Business Network.
    

            “Lou was one of the CNN originals, who helped launch and shape the network. We are saddened to hear about his passing and extend our sincerest condolences to his wife Debi, children and his family,” a CNN spokesperson said.
    

            As Donald Trump ascended in Republican Party politics, Dobbs became one of his most ardent supporters, using his program to promote anti-immigrant rhetoric and lash out at the so-called “deep state.”
    

            As one of Trump’s biggest boosters on television, the veteran anchor spent the latter part of his career promoting streams of misinformation and conspiracy theories on behalf of the then-president.
    

            Trump regularly praised Dobbs in return, often posting clips of his show on his social media channels. Trump on Thursday praised Dobbs as a friend and “truly incredible journalist, reporter, and talent.”
    

            “He understood the World, and what was ‘happening,’ better than others,” Trump wrote on his social media platform. “Lou was unique in so many ways, and loved our Country. Our warmest condolences to his wonderful wife, Debi, and family. He will be greatly missed!”
    

            After the 2020 election, Dobbs used his Fox Business program to repeatedly promote false conspiracy theories that the vote had been rigged by shadowy companies that flipped millions of votes from Trump to Joe Biden.
    

            These on-air comments helped spur voting technology companies Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic to sue Fox News for defamation. Fox News settled with Dominion last year for more than $787 million. But Smartmatic’s lawsuit — which also personally named Dobbs as a defendant — is still ongoing.
    

            After the lawsuits were filed, Fox Business canceled Dobbs’ show, taking him off the air in an abrupt move announced on a Friday in February 2021.
    

            Lawyers representing Dobbs previously said in the Smartmatic case that he “denies the allegation of a disinformation campaign” and that he “engages in opinion commentary on issues of public interest, which is his right under the U.S. Constitution.”
    

            Fox News on Thursday praised the veteran anchor and offered condolences to his family.
    

            “We are deeply saddened by the passing of Lou Dobbs. An incredible business mind with a gift for broadcasting, Lou helped pioneer cable news into a successful and influential industry,” a Fox News Media spokesperson said. “We are immensely grateful for his many contributions and send our heartfelt condolences to his family.”

            Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, privately encouraged President Joe Biden to reconsider his reelection campaign in a letter earlier this month.

129,CNN_55,Top Democrat Raskin privately encouraged Biden to reconsider reelection campaign,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/18/politics/raskin-letter-biden-reconsider-reelection-campaign/index.html,"
            Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, penned a deeply personal letter to President Joe Biden earlier this month privately encouraging the president that there is “no shame in taking a well-deserved bow” out of the 2024 presidential election – and making his argument with comparisons to George Washington and Red Sox pitching great Pedro Martinez.
    

Raskin’s July 6 letter, first reported by the New York Times and obtained Thursday by CNN, offers rare insight into the delicate situation some of the president’s top allies are navigating as an isolated Biden weighs his political future. Biden has repeatedly vowed to stay in the race.

READ: Raskin’s letter encouraging Biden to reconsider reelection campaign


            “I am not writing to presume to tell you what to do, Mr. President, because that is up to you and Jill and your family entirely. You will be the best judge of that. But I am writing to remind you of who you are,” Raskin said in the three-and-a-half-page letter, which he said he wrote as an admirer, supporter, fellow politician, friend, and “above, all, as a fellow citizen.”
    

            Raskin confirmed the letter’s authenticity in a statement shared with CNN, saying, “I wrote that letter to the president over the Fourth of July weekend. My point was that we needed a strategic internal discussion about how to move forward to decisively win the election, which is of immeasurable importance to the future of America. The letter expressed my profound affection for the president, my great concern for the future of the country and my confidence in the judgment he would make. None of those things has changed.”
    

            In the letter, the Maryland congressman extensively quotes Biden’s own words from a January 2024 speech on democracy near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, including what he described as a “remarkable passage” where the president referenced a painting of Gen. George Washington resigning his commission as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army – going on to implicitly compare Biden to Washington.
    

            “George Washington was at the height of his power. Having just defeated the most powerful empire on Earth, he could have held onto the power as long as he wanted. He could have made himself not a future president but a future monarch, in effect,” Raskin wrote.

            Raskin continued, quoting Biden, “’In America,’ you say, ‘genuine leaders — democratic leaders, with a small ‘d’? don’t hold on to power relentlessly. Our leaders return power to the people. And they do it willingly, because that’s the deal. You do your duty. You serve your country.’”
    

            Raskin said that in the coming months, “We have an overriding obligation to defeat the forces of resurgent monarchy and oppression. Everything else pales in comparison to this struggle, even your magnificent policy achievements.”
    

            He framed Biden’s choice about the future of his reelection campaign as a political one.
    

            Questions about Biden’s mental and physical stamina “are not just medical and scientific questions now. They are also political questions because both political leaders and tens of millions of voting citizens have formed judgments based on the events of the last few weeks. The judgment you must make in turn, therefore, is not only a private medical judgment about how you feel but a public political one about how others feel because, in the end, the people will decide the fate of this election and of our democracy itself,” Raskin wrote.
    

            The congressman closed his letter with a sweeping metaphor comparing this moment in history to a 2003 American League Championship Series baseball game between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox.
    

            The Red Sox’s pitcher, Pedro Martinez, Raskin wrote, “began to tire badly after 118 pitches” but “Martinez vigorously protested that he was fine and he could continue and give it his all despite all the statistics about what happens when pitchers play after throwing for so long.”
    

            Martinez stayed in the game, and the Yankees went on to win.
    

            Raskin connected Martinez’s choice to Biden’s.
    

            “There is no shame in taking a well-deserved bow to the overflowing appreciation of the crowd when your arm is tired out, and there is real danger for the team in ignoring the statistics,” he wrote.
    

            Raskin added, ”Your situation is tricky because you are both our star pitcher and our Manager. But in democracy, as you have shown us more than any prior president, you are not a Manager acting all alone; you are the co-Manager along with our great team and our great people. Caucus with the team, Mr. President. Hear them out. You will make the right decision.”

200,WaPo_80,"At the not-so-secret RNC parties: Cigars, wagyu and absolute euphoria",https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/power/2024/07/18/rnc-parties-milwaukee-warehouse-trump-vance/,"MILWAUKEE — Which song coaxes Republicans onto the dance floor of a warehouse? Van Morrison’s “Brown Eyed Girl,” it turns out.The hundred or so partygoers in the warehouse’s cavernous space were mostly ignoring the band. Boca Raton, Fla., mayor Scott Singer twirled among the clusters of wallflowers, trying to inspire some collective dance action.Then, an electric guitar strummed out the telltale opening riff of the boomer anthem. Suddenly, the dance floor was flooded with men dressed like Tucker Carlson and women in that Tuckernuck dress, sha-la-tee-da-ing under the muted shimmer of fog machines and a disco ball. They stayed for covers of Jackson 5’s “I Want You Back” and Justin Timberlake’s “Can’t Stop the Feeling!” mirroring the lead singer’s crisp choreography with booze-soaked shuffles.The lead singer pointed his microphone toward the crowd, asking what they were feeling good about on this Monday night.A young woman in a pink shift dress moaned into his microphone: “I love Donald Truuuuummmmp!”What else would you expect at 1 a.m. after the first night of the Republican National Convention?This party was the Warehouse Party, an RNC tradition dating back to 1996. It is the convention’s secret party — as much as any party with required lanyards and official merchandise can be a secret. You know about it because you are a Republican with actual Republican business at the Republican National Convention. The scant number of journalists who attend do so with the promise that what they witness is off the record, unless they obtain permission to share certain things. Nothing witnessed was major news, though. These parties aren’t technically “fun.”“By the time the parties come in the evening, people are already thinking about the work left to do the next day,” said Libby Emmons, the editor of the Post Millennial. “It’s the work, not the trappings, that are the point of the enterprise.”At this year’s RNC, the Warehouse Party is happening in the husk of a former die-cutting factory. The decorations matched the space’s industrial aura: chandeliers fashioned from Edison bulbs, chains and sprockets; industrial metal shelves stacked with bottles of Captain Morgan and Grey Goose behind the bar. In one wing of the warehouse, tucked behind thick velvet curtains, was “Kitty’s Jazz Lounge,” where a singer was doing a bluesy cover of Guns N’ Roses’ “Sweet Child O’ Mine.” A wall of soft pretzels anchored a buffet of wagyu burgers and bratwurst, under the watchful eye of the portrait of some futuristic industrial elephant, staring at the revelers through a gear-rimmed monocle.The last time it happened, in 2016, the Warehouse Party was colloquially known as “the Boehner Party,” since it was technically thrown by the speaker of the House. (Paul D. Ryan was the speaker at that point, actually, but the ghost of John A. Boehner reigned supreme.) Boehner’s GOP is now a distant memory, especially here, where a red MAGA hat goes with any outfit and the vibes were high — on Donald Trump’s miraculous survival, and the Democrats’ slo-mo implosion.On Tuesday night, each convention subculture retreated to their corners. Journalists and PR flacks headed to the CNN-Politico Grill at Turner Hall, half a block from the convention, for fried cheese curds and dangerously strong skinny margaritas. They’re briefly visited by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who haunts their tables seeking attention. The better party was probably the Texas delegation’s Lone Star Social, at the Grain Exchange, which was closed to media.About a mile south, guests of the New York State Young Republicans soiree climbed an obscene number of stairs to get to the party at Shaker’s Cigar Bar. Some 70 attendees — mostly young, mostly men — mingled on the roof. They stood in a circle taking long drags of cigars in the darkness, like a benign initiation ceremony for a bizarre secret society.Paul Stephen, a delegate from New York, puffed a cigar by the bar with his tall adult son, Paul Jr., who tagged along to Milwaukee. “The mood is mellow,” Paul Jr. said of the convention so far. “Usually we’re worried about losing. But now it’s like ‘No, we’re doing good!’”“For once,” he added, “the Democrats are disorganized.”J.D. Vance was still onstage Wednesday night when doors opened at the New Fashioned, a beer emporium across the street from the convention center. Turning Point Action, the electoral arm of Charlie Kirk’s youth-focused right-wing empire, had taken over the top floor for its “Right Wing Revolution” after-party. Early partygoers huddled under the big-screen TV by the bar to catch the end of Vance’s remarks.Jayne Zirkle, a reporter for Stephen K. Bannon’s “War Room” podcast, was chatting with Emmons by the VIP entrance when Maureen Bannon, Steve’s daughter, walked by sipping a Celsius. She’s holding up all right, Maureen said, gesturing to her caffeinated seltzer. She didn’t elaborate on whether she was talking about convention fatigue or her father’s recent check-in to a Connecticut prison.Later that night, revelry at the Warehouse Party reached a new level. At 2 a.m. people were still just arriving. A queue of black cars and Ubers stretched around the block. The main hall was packed, and it was hot — bodies pressed against one another as they funneled toward the bar or dance floor. The men had traded in Monday’s golf shirts and khakis for suits; women had traded their heels for white sneakers or no footwear at all. A pile of abandoned stilettos lined the warehouse wall. A throng by the VIP lounge craned their necks to catch Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) speed by in a crimson bodycon dress. “You were in Trump’s box!” one guest squealed at the congresswoman.The band finished its set and a DJ took over, blasting the Pointer Sisters at a deafening decibel: I’m so excited, and I just can’t hide it! The crowd was beaming, as if expecting great news — as if it were already election night and their main man was toppling the blue wall and snatching back Arizona and Georgia, and maybe carrying the House and Senate with him.By the bar, a young man in a blazer staggered over to another, slapping his back with fraternal enthusiasm.“We’re gonna win,” he slurred. “We’re gonna win.”"
213,WaPo_71,"Bob Newhart, who went from standup comedy to sitcom star, dies at 94",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/07/18/bob-newhart-dead/,"Bob Newhart was still living with his parents when he was 30. He was a balding, slouch-eyed former accountant who talked in a calculated, halting stammer. He was no one’s idea of a superstar.Yet, within a year, his understated comedy routines that emphasized the absurdities of ordinary life made him a national sensation. Mr. Newhart, who died July 18 at 94, became the first comedian with a No. 1 record and the star of two long-running sitcoms. Regarded as one of the most influential figures in modern comedy, he helped shape the humor of Bill Cosby and Jerry Seinfeld, among others.His debut album, “The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart,” soared past the pop and rock recordings of Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley to stand at No. 1 on the Billboard charts for 14 weeks in 1960. It was first comedy album to sell more than 1 million copies, and Mr. Newhart remains the only comedian to win Grammy Awards for best new artist and album of the year.He didn’t emerge from the traditional proving ground of nightclubs but relied on recordings to propel his popularity. In fact, the first time he performed in a nightclub was when he recorded “The Button-Down Mind,” which went on to sell more than 100 million copies.Mr. Newhart’s best-selling records helped him become one of the first comedians to develop a following on college campuses. With his suit and tie and his subdued manner, he looked like a junior executive who wandered across the hall from a business meeting to describe a world wobbling off its axis.“Comedy is a way to bring logic to an illogical situation, of which there are many in everyday life,” Mr. Newhart wrote in a 2006 memoir, “I Shouldn’t Even Be Doing This!” “I’ve always likened what I do to the man who is convinced that he is the last sane man on Earth.”His deadpan, profanity-free “clean” approach stood out from a growing trend of confrontational, political and overcaffeinated comedians of the time, including Lenny Bruce, Mort Sahl and Don Rickles — who became Mr. Newhart’s closest friend.Mr. Newhart’s staid “button-down” style was largely dependent on his uninflected delivery, carefully placed pauses and stutters. He often introduced his sketches as observations about the business world, workplace conventions and the frustrations of quotidian life.“The comedy was intelligent,” comedian Tommy Smothers told the Chicago Tribune in 2002, the year Mr. Newhart was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor at the Kennedy Center. “And Bob had that wonderful sense of space — that timing that was so essential to the comedy. He never really told hard jokes. It was attitude and inflection — and the space when you picked those words up. That was his great gift.”By looking at familiar situations from fresh angles, Mr. Newhart uncovered an original brand of humor: He portrayed a driving instructor with a clueless student; the beleaguered commander of a nuclear submarine, the USS Codfish, with an mutinous crew; and a bus-driving teacher who schools his students on the proper way to leave passengers at the curb: “What you want to do is just kind of gradually ease out. You’re kind of always holding out the hope they can catch up with the bus, you know what I mean? … Did you see how he slammed the door right in her face that time? That’s called your perfect pullout.”One of Mr. Newhart’s major contributions to comedy was to deliver essentially a “straight-man” routine, with the audience hearing only one side of an increasingly desperate side of a conversation, often in the form of a phone call.“Listen, Abe,” he imagined a press agent telling President Abraham Lincoln, “what’s the problem? You’re thinking of shaving it off? Uh, Abe, don’t you see, that’s part of the image?”In one of his most popular skits, built around the idea of introducing new products that don’t have an obvious market niche, Mr. Newhart imagined a telephone call to the London home office of the East India Company from Sir Walter Raleigh, reporting on a new purchase in the American colonies.“What’s tobacco, Walt? … Let me get this straight now, Walt, you bought 80 tons of leaves? This, uh, may come as kind of a surprise to you, Walt, but come fall in England here, we’re kind of up to our — It isn’t that kind of leaf, huh?”Another routine was built on the idea of workplace emergencies not covered during employee orientation. In this case, a security guard in his first night on the job at the Empire State Building isn’t sure what to do when King Kong begins to climb the outside of the building.“See, something’s come up, sir,” the guard hesitantly tells his boss on the telephone, “and it’s not covered in the guards’ manual. I looked in the index, yes, sir. I looked under unauthorized personnel and people without passes and apes and apes’ toes. Apes and apes’ toes, yes, sir … See, this isn’t your standard ape, sir. He’s between 18 and 19 stories high, depending on whether there is a 13th floor or not.”After years as a stand-up star and frequent appearances on TV variety shows, Mr. Newhart found that his unassuming stage persona as a slightly bewildered everyman translated comfortably to the television situation comedy.“The Bob Newhart Show,” which ran on CBS from 1972 to 1978, was part of a formidable CBS Saturday comedy lineup, along with “The Mary Tyler Moore Show,” “All in the Family” and “The Carol Burnett Show.” Mr. Newhart played a Chicago psychologist coping with the comic foibles of his clients.His wife on the show was played by throaty-voiced actress Suzanne Pleshette. Mr. Newhart insisted that the couple be childless.“I didn’t want to do a certain kind of show, which was the dumb father who keeps getting in these pickles and these precocious children and mother get him out of it,” he told the Newark Star-Ledger in 2001. “That was one of the few conditions that I insisted on, and I think it was one of the factors that made the show work.”On “Newhart,” which ran on CBS from 1982 to 1990, he portrayed a guidebook-writer-turned-Vermont-innkeeper dealing with a cast of eccentric locals. The final episode, suggested by Mr. Newhart’s wife, became one of the most memorable in television history.After being knocked unconscious by an errant golf ball, Mr. Newhart awakes alongside Pleshette in the bed of their Chicago bedroom, last seen 12 years earlier on “The Bob Newhart Show.”“Honey, wake up,” Mr. Newhart says, “you won’t believe the dream I just had.”“All right, Bob,” says Pleshette, as the live audience gasps and applauds in recognition. “What is it?”“I was an innkeeper,” Mr. Newhart explains, “in this crazy little town in Vermont.”George Robert Newhart was born Sept. 5, 1929, in Oak Park, Ill., and grew up in nearby Chicago. His father had a plumbing and heating business.Mr. Newhart graduated from Chicago’s Loyola University in 1952, then spent two years in the Army. He enrolled in law school but flunked out, in part because he was devoting his evenings to amateur theater productions and early efforts at comedy. He held jobs in accounting and advertising as well as a stint with the Illinois state unemployment agency.“I was being paid $60 a week while the people I was giving money to were getting $55,” he later said. “And they only had to come into the office once a week.”He admired the dry, low-key comedy of such earlier stars as Jack Benny, Fred Allen and the team of Bob and Ray (Bob Elliott and Ray Goulding). While working office jobs, Mr. Newhart improvised comic telephone conversations with a friend, Ed Gallagher, then began to write and record formal comedy skits.Some were played on a Chicago radio station, and after Gallagher moved away, Mr. Newhart continued as a solo performer. (Comedian Shelley Berman later accused Mr. Newhart of stealing his act, but the phone call has been a comedy staple almost since the time of Alexander Graham Bell.)Mr. Newhart found a short-lived spot on a morning TV show, but he was still living with his parents and holding a series of short-term jobs when a Chicago radio DJ recommended him to Warner Bros. Records.The label signed him to a contract and wanted to record him at a nightclub performance.“And I said, well, see that’s going to be a problem,” Mr. Newhart told NPR in 2006, “because I’ve never played a nightclub before.”Those first appearances, at a club in Houston, became “The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart.” The title was a wry nod toward Mr. Newhart’s clean-cut, businesslike image.The album’s unexpected success transformed Mr. Newhart into a major star. He appeared on TV variety shows and at New York’s Carnegie Hall.In 1961, he was named host of first network TV show, which won critical praise but was canceled after one season. “It got an Emmy, a Peabody, and a pink slip from NBC — all in the same year,” Mr. Newhart quipped.In addition to the success of his two major sitcoms, Mr. Newhart occasionally appeared as a character actor in films, including the Steve McQueen war movie “Hell Is for Heroes,” in 1962. He played the eccentric Maj. Major Major, in the 1970 film “Catch-22,” based on Joseph Heller’s classic antiwar novel.He starred in two short-lived TV comedies in the 1990s, “Bob” and “George & Leo,” and played Papa Elf opposite Will Ferrell in the 2003 holiday hit “Elf.” He had recurring roles on the TV dramas “Desperate Housewives” and “ER” and won his first Emmy Award in 2013 for a guest appearance as Professor Proton, an aging TV science host, on the CBS hit comedy “The Big Bang Theory.”Mr. Newhart’s death, at his home in Los Angeles, was confirmed by his publicist Jerry Digney, who did not cite a cause. Information on survivors was not immediately available. His wife, the former Virginia Quinn, died in 2023 after 60 years of marriage. They had four children.Mr. Newhart, who continued to make appearances as a stand-up comedian well into his 80s, made dozens of appearances on “The Tonight Show,” including as a frequent guest host for Johnny Carson. In 1992, Mr. Newhart was inducted into the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame. “The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart” was named to the Library of Congress’s National Recording Registry of historically significant recordings in 2006.Among all his honors, Mr. Newhart said he was especially proud to receive the Mark Twain Prize for humor because the first person to win the award was Richard Pryor, a fellow Illinoisan. Several years earlier, an ailing Pryor told Mr. Newhart he had stolen a copy of “The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart.”Mr. Newhart thought Pryor meant he had stolen part of a routine. No, Mr. Pryor said: “I stole your record — from a record store in Peoria, Illinois.”“Richard, I used to get a quarter an album” in royalties, Mr. Newhart told him. “He turned and said, ‘Somebody, give me a quarter!’ ”Pryor handed Mr. Newhart the quarter, as if repaying a debt."

Vance’s wife Usha’s Indian heritage,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/18/rnc-convention-usha-vance-maga-attacks/,"Extremist supporters of former president Donald Trump are lashing out online against Usha Vance, the wife of Trump’s running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), launching anti-immigrant attacks because of her Indian heritage.Usha Vance, an attorney, is the daughter of Indian immigrants and a San Diego native. She met her husband, who is currently serving as the junior senator from Ohio, at Yale Law School. The two married in 2014 and have three children. On Wednesday, she introduced him to the world as the Republican nominee for vice president onstage at the Republican National Convention.“When J.D. met me, he approached our differences with curiosity and enthusiasm,” Usha Vance said about her relationship with the Ohio senator. “He wanted to know everything about me, where I came from, what my life had been like.”Usha Vance said that even though her husband is a “meat-and-potatoes kind of guy,” he “adapted to my vegetarian diet” — a line that appeared to draw some gasps from the convention floor. Her husband, she added, had even learned to cook Indian food from her mother. In his own remarks, J.D. Vance nodded to his wife’s heritage as he spoke about the United States’ tradition of allowing “newcomers into our American family.”“We allow them on our terms. That’s the way we preserve the continuity of this project from 250 years past to hopefully 250 years in the future. And let me illustrate this with a story, if I may,” he said. “I am, of course, married to the daughter of South Asian immigrants to this country. Incredible people. People who genuinely have enriched this country in so many ways.”But while J.D. Vance made clear that he is proud of his wife and her heritage, online, some  far-right agitators and rushed to denigrate the couple, their mixed-race family and Usha Vance’s immigrant background.The attacks highlight the tensions the vice-presidential nominee will have to navigate in a campaign where Trump has called for harsh anti-immigration measures and used violent rhetoric to describe migrants, including suggesting they be pitted in fights for entertainment.After Vance was named Trump’s running mate, far-right activist Jaden McNeil on X shared an undated picture of the Vances and their newborn child on a post captioned: “I’m sure this guy is going to be great on immigration.”In a podcast in which he attacked the Vances, Nick Fuentes, an avowed white supremacist, repeated rhetoric often associated with the racist “great replacement theory” — a line of argument popular among the right-wing, white nationalist fringe that falsely claims that there is a plan to “replace” native-born White Americans with immigrants. Fuentes — who is also known for making antisemitic remarks and who attended the deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville in 2017 — said he doesn’t expect “the guy who has an Indian wife” to “support White identity.”“What exactly are we getting here? And that’s not a dig at him just because I’m a racist or something,” Fuentes said. “White people are being systematically replaced in America and in Europe through immigration and — to a much-lesser extent — due to intermarrying. This guy has a non-White wife.”Fuentes — who visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago in November 2022 alongside rapper Ye — also made similarly inflammatory comments about the Vances on X.A spokesman for J.D. Vance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In his best-selling memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy,” J.D. Vance wrote that he fell for his wife in their first year of law school and that she “seemed some sort of genetic anomaly, a combination of every positive quality a human should have: bright, hard-working, tall, and beautiful.”Usha Vance, he said, was his “Yale spirit guide” who “instinctively understood the questions I didn’t even know to ask and she always encouraged me to seek opportunities that I didn’t know existed.” Usha Vance was on his side as he ran for Senate in 2022 — and as he espoused more right-wing, inflammatory rhetoric on the campaign trail, like Trump.As a Senate nominee, Vance appeared to echo some of the rhetoric behind the “great replacement theory” when he claimed in an interview with Tucker Carlson that Democrats were hoping to win the 2022 election by replacing American voters and bringing in “a large number of new voters to replace the voters that are already here.”He didn’t acknowledge that becoming a citizen — which is necessary to vote — is a lengthy process and that any new immigrant who was allowed to vote in the 2022 election had likely spent years working on their citizenship process.American University professor Brian Hughes, who studies extremism and radicalization, said these extremists’ attacks on the Vances show that “anti-immigrant rhetoric and very standard White supremacist ideology frequently overlap.” Hughes said McNeil’s post questioning J.D. Vance’s views on immigration because of the makeup of his family is “a dog whistle towards White nationalism” and the “idea that the United States is and should be an exclusively White country.”Still, he noted that views like those espoused by these extremists “are marginal voices within the broader far right.”“That’s where these attacks will continue to come from,” he said. “I think that the vast majority of people in the American conservative movement don’t feel this way. And I think that’s to their credit.”Ohio state Sen. Niraj Antani (R), the first Indian American state senator in Ohio history, pushed back on the notion that Fuentes, McNeil and other far-right agitators who have attacked the Vances represent any faction of the GOP. The two, he said, are “attention-seeking hate mongers,” and Fuentes, Antani noted, is a known antisemite who is “extremely racist and bigoted.”“Being racist is not partisan, it’s not on the partisan spectrum,” Antani said. “I don’t think, you know, [Fuentes’s] comments are a reflection of any mainstream position. I think this is an extremely small, loudmouth racist.”Antani, who is serving as a delegate at the Republican National Convention and who has been supportive of Vance’s vice-presidential nomination, also noted that Trump’s wife, Melania, is an immigrant. He added that the fact that the country could have an immigrant as first lady and the daughter of immigrants as a second lady is a “testament to the greatness of America.” If Republicans win in November, Usha Vance would be the first non-White second lady.But some Republicans celebrated Usha Vance after her husband was named Trump’s running mate. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), a hard-line conservative, praised her in a post on X as “extremely impressive.”“Mom of 3, met JD at Yale Law School, degrees from Yale and Cambridge, corporate litigator, clerked for Supreme Court justices,” Luna wrote."
218,WaPo_90,New U.K. prime minister seeks reset with Europe after years of squabbling,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/18/keir-starmer-reset-europe-uk/,"WOODSTOCK, England — The setting was a super-posh country estate, the birthplace of Winston Churchill, just outside Oxford. Forty-six leaders from Europe showed up. The word of the day was “reset” — as in Britain seeks to reset its relationship with the continent.New British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosted this, the fourth meeting of the European Political Community, which includes the 27 members of the European Union and an outer circle of like-minded democracies — like the United Kingdom.Starmer, who was against Brexit, has emphatically stated that Britain won’t be rejoining the E.U. in his lifetime. But he used Thursday’s already scheduled summit to begin patching things up after years of squabbling over the terms of the U.K. exit.In his opening speech at Blenheim Palace, Starmer told the gathering, “We want to work with all of you to reset relationships, rediscover our common interest and renew the bonds of trust and friendship that brighten the fabric of European life.”At his closing news conference, Starmer said, “I’m proud to leave this summit with stronger relationships across Europe.”That may be overstating what was accomplished in a day of photo ops, breakout sessions and bilateral meetings that resembled speed dating. But Starmer got some points for trying.After Prime Minister Boris Johnson had threatened to renege on Brexit agreements and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had threatened to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights, Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, received nods of approval for pledging “a profound respect for international law.”European leaders offered warm words about rapprochement. French President Emmanuel Macron told broadcasters, “This is a great opportunity for a reset.”Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said, “We have the highest expectations” for a “new relationship” with Britain under Starmer.The Irish leader, Simon Harris, said he was “delighted” to see Britain wanting a closer relationship with Europe, calling Starmer “a game changer.”Some of the moments at Blenheim Palace presented an alternate universe in which Brexit never happened. Except the scars are still there.Illegal immigration, especially, remains a point of tension.At the summit, Starmer said Britain would be “resetting our approach” and would work with European partners to put people-smugglers “out of business.” He also announced 84 million pounds ($109 million) for Africa and the Middle East to address the root causes of illegal migration.Not mentioned: what to do about people who manage to cross the English Channel from France in small boats. The previous British governments wanted to send asylum seekers who enter the country illegally to Rwanda. Starmer has scrapped the idea. But that puts the focus back on the need for a better agreement with France.When asked at the summit whether he would agree to a migration deal with Starmer, Macron said, somewhat dismissively, “There is no silver bullet.”The French leader said, “We do know the situation, we do our best, we did improve the situation during the past few years, and we will follow up.”The European Political Community gatherings were conceived by Macron, an advocate of multilateralism, as a way to bring the E.U. closer to its neighbors — without going as far as admitting new members.The summits allow leaders to talk to one another, but are not designed to produce any “deliverables” or joint statements. In that sense, attendance is low-risk.But Macron’s ability to steer Europe toward greater cooperation — and to assert himself as the de facto leader of the continent — has been constrained by back-to-back defeats for his movement, in the European Parliament elections and in the snap elections for the French National Assembly.Meanwhile, European leaders have been rattled, and angered, by Hungary’s Viktor Orban, who has been using the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union as a pretext to jet to Moscow, Beijing and Mar-a-Lago on a self-proclaimed “peace mission.”The Hungarian leader wrote in a letter this week that he believed that former president Donald Trump would win the November election and that Europe should rethink its approach to the war accordingly.Trump’s selection of Sen. J.D. Vance (Ohio) as his running mate has deepened concern in some European capitals that the political winds are shifting and it may get harder to rally allies around Ukraine. Vance, like Trump, seems to believe that the West has exaggerated the threat posed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and warns against additional U.S. military aid.“I do not think that Vladimir Putin is an existential threat to Europe,” Vance said at the Munich Security Conference in February. “And to the extent that he is,” he continued, it shows that “Europe has to take a more aggressive role in its own security.”In the hallways at Thursday’s summit, briefers said their bosses would probably discuss privately what a second Trump administration might mean for Europe.Wary of antagonizing the former U.S. president, Europe’s leaders have generally been careful not to call him out publicly. Last week, Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky made a point of saying he is “not afraid” of a second Trump presidency.At the summit, sitting to Starmer’s right, Zelensky warned his European counterparts to remain wary of Putin. “He may try to approach you, or go to some of your partners individually, trying to tempt or pressure you to blackmail you so that one of you betrays the rest.”Whatever the challenges in Europe, the summit seemed a perfect opportunity for Starmer to turn the page from the ousted Conservative governments of the past 14 years that often fought and belittled the E.U.“We are already seeing a much better tone,” said Catherine Barnard, a European politics expert at Cambridge University. She said that from the U.K. side, there was “if not humility, at least not arrogance, and I think that’s probably appreciated.”Just days after David Lammy became foreign secretary, the U.K.’s top diplomat visited Germany, Poland and Sweden to meet with counterparts.Analysts said Britain would start to repair bridges with the E.U. by prioritizing discussions on security. Labour may want to broaden the definition of security to include areas like energy, climate, artificial intelligence and migration.“One of the great things about security is that nobody really knows what security actually means,” Barnard said. It is a “broad umbrella.”Anand Menon, a politics professor at King’s College London, noted that the summit gave Starmer a chance to knock out a slew of first-time bilateral meetings.There were pool photographs of Starmer walking with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in the palace gardens and sharing a grip-and-grin with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk — who as European Council president in 2019 said there was a “special place in hell” for “those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan of how to carry it out safely.”Menon doubted that Starmer is “massively personally committed to a closer substantive relationship with the E.U.”“They want to be on friendly terms, absolutely. They think the competition that characterized the relationship under the Conservatives was silly and counterproductive. Absolutely.”But Starmer is not about to repeat the side-by-side relations with Europe of his 1990s predecessor, Tony Blair.“Tone change is very important, very significant and very noticeable. On the substance, I think we will see far, far less,” he said.Rauhala reported from Brussels and Adam from London."

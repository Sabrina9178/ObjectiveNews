0,NBC_1,FBI confirms that a bullet struck Trump's ear during assassination attempt,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fbi-confirms-bullet-struck-trumps-ear-assassination-attempt-rcna163896,"The FBI said Friday that a bullet or fragments of it struck Donald Trump's ear during an assassination attempt on the former president this month at a campaign rally.
“What struck former President Trump in the ear was a bullet, whether whole or fragmented into smaller pieces, fired from the deceased subject’s rifle,"" the FBI said in a statement.
The statement comes two days after FBI Director Christopher Wray, whom Trump nominated to his post in 2017, told House lawmakers that ""there’s some question about whether or not it’s a bullet or shrapnel that, you know, hit his ear.""
Wray had testified about the FBI's ongoing probe into the assassination attempt. A gunman identified as Thomas Crooks, 20, was shot and killed after opening fire from an elevated post not far from Trump's July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, that left one spectator dead and two others critically injured.
The director's remarks before a House committee sparked widespread backlash among Republican lawmakers, as well as Trump.
Trump referred to the new FBI statement in a social media post Friday night.
""I assume that’s the best apology that we’ll get from Director Wray, but it is fully accepted!,"" he wrote on Truth Social.
House Speaker Mike Johnson had also criticized Wray's testimony.
“We’ve all seen the video, we’ve seen the analysis, we’ve heard it from multiple sources in different angles that a bullet went through his ear. I’m not sure it matters that much,” Johnson said on Thursday.
Wray’s testimony came the same day the House approved a resolution to create a bipartisan task force to examine the assassination attempt.
Before the FBI put out its statement Friday night, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., had written a letter to Wray urging him to revise his testimony, saying, ""the attempted assassin’s bullet ripped the upper part"" of Trump's ear, and that it ""should not be a point of contention.""
Graham said Friday night, after the FBI's statement, that Wray should never have suggested otherwise.
""Glad the FBI confirmed what everyone else knew. It was a bullet that struck President Trump. The statement by the FBI Director should’ve never been made,"" Graham wrote on X.Ken Dilanian is the justice and intelligence correspondent for NBC News, based in Washington.

            The FBI said Friday that Donald Trump was hit by a bullet, or a fragment from it, fired by the would-be assassin at his Pennsylvania rally earlier this month.
    

            “What struck former President Trump in the ear was a bullet, whether whole or fragmented into smaller pieces, fired from the deceased subject’s rifle,” the bureau said in a statement.
    

            The department’s confirmation Friday that the former president was struck in the ear by a bullet marks its latest attempt to quell a political uproar. The new statement is the most direct yet from federal law enforcement about Trump’s injury, though it changes little in practical terms.
    

            Some law enforcement officials – including FBI Director Christopher Wray – have previously said publicly that it was unclear whether Trump was hit by a bullet or by shrapnel, which is a fragmented piece of ammunition. Other officials questioned whether Trump had been struck by a bullet at all, or whether he was hit by a piece of glass or even injured while falling down.
    

            “As I said, I think with respect to former President Trump, there’s some question about whether or not it’s bullet or shrapnel that hit his ear,” Wray testified before Congress earlier this week.
    

            Questions about Trump’s wound have stoked political backlash, as the former president has said he “took a bullet for democracy” and attacked Wray on his social media platform over his testimony.
    

            For his part, Trump has repeatedly asserted that he was hit by an in-tact bullet, writing on his Truth Social platform that “it was, unfortunately, a bullet that hit my ear, and hit it hard.”
    

            “There was no glass, there was no shrapnel. The hospital called it a ‘bullet wound to the ear,’ and that is what it was. No wonder the once storied FBI has lost the confidence of America!” Trump posted.
    

            The campaign also has pushed back on any implication otherwise, with Trump adviser Steven Cheung telling CNN that “anyone who believes this conspiracy bullsh*t is either mentally deficient or willfully peddling falsehoods for political reasons.”
    

            The agency is seeking to interview Trump in its investigation of the assassination attempt to obtain a victim statement — a standard part of the investigation because he is a crime victim, according to a US official.
    

            Investigators, the FBI said Thursday, continue to examine bullet fragments and other evidence in the attack, but the agency made clear it has always considered the shooting an attempted assassination of the former president.
    

            “Since the day of the attack, the FBI has been consistent and clear that the shooting was an attempted assassination of former President Trump which resulted in his injury, as well as the death of a heroic father and the injuries of several other victims,” the agency said in its initial statement released in response to questions about Wray’s testimony on Capitol Hill Wednesday.
    

            The agency said it was “devoting enormous resources” to its ongoing investigation of the “heinous attack.”
    

            During Wednesday’s wide-ranging House Judiciary hearing, Wray shared new details with lawmakers about Trump’s would-be assassin, including that he searched for details of the John F. Kennedy shooting from his laptop and flew a drone in the area near the rally just two hours before the former president took the stage.
    

            Despite later criticism from Republicans about the FBI’s pending conclusions about the nature of the projectile, Wray was commended by representatives on both sides of the aisle for offering new insight into details about the investigation into the gunman. Those bipartisan expressions of appreciation stood in stark contrast to earlier testimony by then-Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned Tuesday after Democrats and Republicans accused her of stonewalling them and demanded her ouster.
    

            When asked Wednesday about how close the “assassin’s bullet” came to killing Trump, Wray said, “My understanding is that either it or some shrapnel is what, you know, grazed his ear.” He then agreed that it came very close to killing the former president.

0,WaPo_2,"A bullet — or bullet fragment — hit Trump during assassination attempt, FBI says",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/26/trump-bullet-shot-assassination-attempt/,"Former president Donald Trump was shot in the ear by a bullet or a bullet fragment during the assassination attempt at one of his campaign rallies, the FBI said Friday, responding to an outcry sparked when FBI Director Christopher A. Wray testified Wednesday that the former president and Republican nominee was wounded by either a bullet or shrapnel.For nearly two weeks, there had been speculation about whether Trump had been grazed by a bullet (or fragments of one) or nicked by other debris during his July 13 campaign rally in which 20-year-old gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire at Trump and into the crowd in Butler, Pa. Wray maintained in congressional testimony Wednesday that investigators hadn’t reached a definitive conclusion while Trump and his Republican allies insisted he had been shot.The FBI on Friday said the Republican presidential nominee was hit with a bullet.“What struck former President Trump in the ear was a bullet, whether whole or fragmented into smaller pieces, fired from the deceased subject’s rifle,” the agency said in a statement.A Washington Post analysis of photos and videos of the shooting found that former president Trump’s injury appears to be consistent with the attributes of a graze wound from a bullet and not that of bullet fragments, according to two trauma surgeons, Babak Sarani, director of trauma and acute care surgery at George Washington University Hospital, and Joseph Sakran, director of emergency general surgery at Johns Hopkins. The physicians reviewed the Post’s analysis.“Usually shrapnel flies in random patterns. Because it’s shrapnel, right? It doesn’t go in a straight line. This really looks like a linear laceration is how I would describe,” Sarani told The Post. “So it’s something, it’s going in a straight line which makes you think it’s more the projectile itself, not shrapnel.”High-velocity rounds, such as those likely fired by Crooks, impart energy, or a blast effect when striking a body. A graze wound like that of the former president would not, Sarani said.“The bullet literally just grazes you and so very little energy is imparted into you. The rest of it is just dissipated into the air.” he added. “That’s how you, if you are, quote unquote, lucky. The bullet just grazed you.”Just hours after the assassination attempt, Trump started insisting he had been hit with a bullet.“I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear,” he wrote in a Truth Social post that published at 8:42 p.m. on July 13, less than three hours after the shooting. “I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening.”Wray testified to the House Judiciary Committee that the exact nature of Trump’s injury remained uncertain. “I think with respect to former president Trump, there’s some question about whether or not it’s a bullet or shrapnel that, you know, hit his ear,” he told lawmakers Wednesday.Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Tex.), the former White House doctor who has been monitoring Trump’s health since the assassination attempt, criticized Wray’s comments.“There is absolutely no evidence that it was anything other than a bullet,” Jackson wrote in an update on Trump’s health. “Congress should correct the record as confirmed by both the hospital and myself. Director Wray is wrong and inappropriate to suggest anything else.”On Friday, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) sent a letter to Wray, urging him to “correct your testimony before Congress on Wednesday when you indicated it is uncertain whether President Donald J. Trump was hit by a bullet, glass, or shrapnel.”“It is clear to everyone that President Trump survived an assassination attempt by millimeters, as the attempted assassin’s bullet ripped the upper part of his ear,” Graham wrote in a letter that Trump published Friday in a Truth Social post.It was one of several posts Trump wrote criticizing Wray’s testimony over the past two days.He posted another late Friday after the release of the FBI statement confirming he had been shot.“I assume that’s the best apology that we’ll get from Director Wray,” he said of the FBI’s conclusion, “but it is fully accepted!”"
2,NBC_3,Packers sign Jordan Love to richest QB contract in NFL history,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/packers-sign-qb-jordan-love-richest-qb-contract-nfl-history-rcna163353,"The Packers have signed Jordan Love to the richest contract for a quarterback in NFL history, per multiple reports. The four-year deal is for $220 million. 
Love, 25, was the No. 26 overall pick of the 2020 NFL Draft. Last season, in his first full year as a starter, he started all 17 games for Green Bay, throwing for 4,159 yards with 32 touchdowns, 11 interceptions and a 96.1 passer rating. Love led the Packers to the playoffs for the first time since 2021 and threw five touchdowns and two picks across two games.
The new contract also includes a record $75 million signing bonus, plus $155 million in new full guarantees, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported.
The new contract pays Love more than his contemporaries, including Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes, Cincinnati’s Joe Burrow and Baltimore’s Lamar Jackson. His deal seemingly resets the quarterback market after extensions signed by Jared Goff and Trevor Lawrence earlier this summer. Love’s new agreement will pay him an average of $55 million annually, equaling the amount shared by Burrow and Lawrence, ESPN reported. 
Before Love’s new deal, he was entering the final year of a contract set to pay him $11 million in 2024. 
The Packers drafted Love in 2020 despite still having former NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers under contract at the time. Rodgers would continue to be the team’s starter for three more seasons through 2022. During that period, however, Green Bay only won one playoff game — the same number Love won last season. 
For his career, Love has appeared in 27 games, throwing for 35 touchdowns and 14 interceptions. In 18 total starts he has a 9-9 record. He is 1-1 in the postseason, upsetting the Dallas Cowboys before losing to the San Francisco 49ers last January. 
After finishing last season 9-8 before losing in the Divisional Round of the playoffs, the Packers will open their 2024 season against the Philadelphia Eagles on Sept. 6 in a game that will be streamed on Peacock. Rohan Nadkarni is a sports reporter for NBC News. "
2,WaPo_14,"After 18 starts, Packers make Jordan Love one of NFL’s richest QBs",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/26/jordan-love-contract-packers/,"On a day of more megadeals for prominent NFL quarterbacks, Jordan Love landed a hefty contract extension that puts him among the league’s highest-paid players after only 18 career regular season starts.Love, after taking the Green Bay Packers to the divisional round of the NFC playoffs in his first full season as the starter, agreed to a four-year, $220 million extension, two people familiar with the negotiations confirmed Friday night. The production company for Love’s agents also confirmed the agreement on social media.The $55 million average annual value of Love’s extension matches the $55 million-per-year extensions previously signed by Joe Burrow with the Cincinnati Bengals and Trevor Lawrence with the Jacksonville Jaguars. They are, by that measure, the highest-paid players in NFL history.Love’s deal includes a record $75 million signing bonus, according to the people with knowledge of the contract terms, and $155 million in fully guaranteed money. He reported to the Packers’ training camp but would not practice until the extension was completed.Love threw for 4,159 yards and 32 touchdowns during the 2023 regular season. The Packers went 9-8 and reached the playoffs as a wild card, then upset the Dallas Cowboys in an opening-round NFC game before losing to the San Francisco 49ers in a conference semifinal. Love spent his first three seasons backing up Aaron Rodgers after being chosen, controversially, by the Packers in the first round of the 2020 draft.Earlier Friday, quarterback Tua Tagovailoa agreed to a four-year, $212.4 million extension with the Miami Dolphins. The $53.1 million average annual value of Tagovailoa’s extension puts him behind only Love, Burrow and Lawrence."
8,NBC_9,Trump hails crypto at largest bitcoin conference,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-hails-crypto-largest-bitcoin-conference-rcna163925,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump promised to make America the world leader in bitcoin and other digital currencies if elected, likening the crypto-verse to “the steel industry of 100 years ago.”
Speaking at the annual Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, Tennessee, to a standing-room-only crowd, Trump promised to ensure America becomes “the crypto capital of the planet and bitcoin superpower of the world.”
Trump painted himself as a crypto advocate in contrast to the Biden administration and other Democrats, who he said had proven unfriendly to their cause.
Trump said — to rapturous applause from the Nashville crowd — that if elected, he would fire current Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, whom the crypto world has come to view as its chief opponent in government due to his agency’s rulings on digital tokens and lawsuits against bitcoin exchanges.
“I will appoint an SEC chair who will build the future, not block the future,” Trump said.
His embrace of crypto comes amid high-profile endorsements from bitcoin advocates including Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twin brothers best known for suing Mark Zuckerberg over the creation of Facebook and who founded the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange.
Trump’s remarks stand to further cement his growing alliance with other right-leaning figures in the tech world, though the novelty of his appearance at the conference was not lost on him. As he praised the audience as “geniuses,” he acknowledged he was still learning about crypto.
“Most people have no idea what the hell it is,” he quipped. “So what happens when everyone figures it out? That’ll be something.”
Trump offered up a proposal to create a national bitcoin “stockpile” that he said would serve as a “permanent national asset,” though stopped short of offering many details.
The idea of creating a strategic crypto reserve has caught on quickly among bitcoin supporters. On Friday, independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also proposed creating a bitcoin reserve, saying he would direct the Treasury to purchase 4 million bitcoins, which in today’s prices would equate to approximately $272 billion.
Immediately following Trump’s remarks, Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., said she would introduce a bill to create the reserve.
However, the price of bitcoin fell slightly in the wake of Trump’s remarks Saturday, perhaps reflecting crypto traders’ unmet expectations for a more definitive commitment on the reserve idea from the presidential candidate.
While the Bitcoin Conference is officially apolitical, Trump’s speech punctuated an event whose politico panelists leaned Republican, including four sitting GOP senators and three GOP Senate candidates.
The sole elected Democrat, California Rep. Ro Khanna, spoke early Saturday and criticized the tendency within his own party to further entrench traditional centers of finance.
“I thought the Democrats were opposed to monopoly power. … We don’t want the banks and the Fed to have a monopoly on fast payments,” Khanna said at a panel Saturday.
Shortly after his morning remarks, Bitcoin Magazine reported that a group of Democratic representatives and candidates had sent a letter to the Democratic National Committee urging party leaders to be more supportive of crypto.
In addition to Khanna, the letter’s signatories included representatives in purple districts in critical swing states like North Carolina and Arizona.
The current administration’s “hostility,” the signees said, does not reflect “our Party’s progressive, forward-looking, and inclusive values.”
“A refreshed leader of the ticket represents an opportunity to change that perception,” they wrote.
In a follow-up interview with NBC News at the conference, Khanna said that positively engaging with the crypto community would be in keeping with Democrats’ desire to be “the party of the future.”
“They’re passionate, they’re active on social media, and they’re mobilized,” Khanna said. “And it’s a community that’s going to vote.”
Conference organizers say Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris declined an invitation to appear at the conference. The organizers declined to comment further on the matter, though conference head David Bailey criticized Harris’ absence on X. Harris’ campaign has not commented.
In an interview with NBC News on Friday, Bailey said that despite Harris not appearing at the conference, the window had not closed on Democrats’ ability to win support from the crypto community.
“There’s a whole progressive case for bitcoin,” he said. While that rationale may not have received as much notice, Bailey said, “my intuition is, over the next four years, it will.”
On Saturday, the Financial Times reported Harris had approached top crypto companies seeking a “reset” of relations, citing unnamed sources.
Bailey said it would ultimately become a political necessity for all political parties to engage with bitcoin supporters as a political bloc.
“It’s not too late — in fact, everyone will have to come to terms with it,” he said. “They won’t be viable otherwise.”
Outside the conference early Saturday, pro-Trump bitcoin supporters made their presence known.
Chad Kozman, an Ohio resident, sported a “Free Ross/Vote Trump” shirt, referring to the community’s desire to see Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht’s life sentence on drug and money-laundering charges commuted, something Trump has promised he would do.
Kozman told NBC News that while Trump’s overtures to the crypto community were opportunistic, it was also a sign that the community had matured beyond its individualistic roots into a voting group that had to be reckoned with.
“For the bitcoin community, it’s been a really hard road to get people to see the benefits of collectivization and pulling together,” he said.Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com."
21,FOX_13,DOJ settles with former FBI officials over release of anti-Trump texts,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-settles-former-fbi-officials-over-release-anti-trump-texts,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The Department of Justice has settled with two former FBI officials over violation of privacy rights.
Former counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page filed suit against the Justice Department over the release of their text message conversations expressing contempt for former President Donald Trump.
According to court documents reviewed by the Associated Press, Strzok settled his case for $1.2 million, while Page received $800,000.
DOJ REACHES SETTLEMENT WITH EX-FBI 'LOVEBIRDS' CAUGHT IN ANTI-TRUMP TEXT SCANDAL

In 2019, Strzok argued in a court filing in Washington, D.C., federal district court that his politically charged anti-Trump messages were protected by the First Amendment even though he sent them on bureau-issued phones while playing leading roles in the probes into both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.
Strzok, once the FBI's head of counterintelligence, said he was entitled to ""develop a full factual record through discovery,"" and that it would be premature to dismiss the case at this early stage. He went on to argue that the DOJ's position would ""leave thousands of career federal government employees without protections from discipline over the content of their political speech.""
""This outcome is a critical step forward in addressing the government’s unfair and highly politicized treatment of Pete,"" said lawyer Aitan Goelam, who is representing Strzok.

Goelam continued, ""As important as it is for him, it also vindicates the privacy interests of all government employees. We will continue to litigate Pete’s constitutional claims to ensure that, in the future, public servants are protected from adverse employment actions motivated by partisan politics.""
Page also filed suit against the FBI and Department of Justice, alleging the government's publication of her salacious text messages with Strzok constituted a breach of the Federal Privacy Act.

""While I have been vindicated by this result, my fervent hope remains that our institutions of justice will never again play politics with the lives of their employees,"" Page said in a statement.
Page's complaint also sought reimbursement for ""the cost of childcare during and transportation to multiple investigative reviews and appearances before Congress,"" the ""cost of paying a data-privacy service to protect her personal information"" and attorney's fees.

21,WaPo_9,Justice Dept. settles with ex-FBI officials over leak of anti-Trump texts,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/26/strzok-page-fbi-settlement-trump-text-leak/,"The Justice Department has agreed to settle claims by former senior FBI special agent Peter P. Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who had filed lawsuits accusing the government of violating their privacy rights by leaking their politically charged text messages criticizing Donald Trump.Strzok will receive a $1.2 million settlement and Page $800,000, according to their attorneys and settlement agreements released by the department.Strzok and Page said they were illegally targeted for retribution by the Trump administration after the FBI investigated Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election.Strzok, a former top counterintelligence expert, was fired by the FBI in 2018 after news reports surfaced of his politically charged text messages with Page, in which the pair criticized Trump while having an affair.“This outcome is a critical step forward in addressing the government’s unfair and highly politicized treatment of Pete,” lead Strzok attorney Aitan D. Goelman said in a statement. Goelman said Strzok will continue to seek reinstatement and back pay in ongoing litigation over claims that removing him from the FBI violated his free speech and due process rights.“We will continue to litigate Pete’s constitutional claims to ensure that, in the future, public servants are protected from adverse employment actions motivated by partisan politics,” Goelman said.In a statement released by her attorneys, Page said, “While I have been vindicated by this result, my fervent hope remains that our institutions of justice will never again play politics with the lives of their employees.”Page’s Arnold & Porter law firm team, led by Amy Jeffress, added, “As Attorney General [Merrick] Garland recently testified in response to questions about this settlement, the Department settles cases based on the litigators’ assessment of the chances of success and the potential costs of losing the case. Here, the evidence was overwhelming that the release of text messages to the press in December 2017 was for partisan political purposes and was against the law. As the Attorney General explained: ‘It’s a question of the government paying for violating the law.’”A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment outside of court filings.Separate agreements signed by the respective plaintiffs and senior trial counsel Bradley P. Humphreys with the Justice Department’s federal programs branch stated that they were entered “solely for the purposes of compromising disputed claims without further legal proceedings and avoiding the expense and risk of litigation,” and were not an admission by either party. The text exchanges between Strzok and Page, which came to light in December 2017, fueled Republican allegations that FBI bias against Trump drove the Russia investigation, and became fodder for scores of angry tweets and public statements by the then-president and his supporters.Page left the FBI in 2018, and Strzok was fired that August. Both were assigned before the 2016 election to investigate Russian interference into Trump’s campaign and whether former secretary of state Hillary Clinton broke the law by using a private email server.An inspector general’s investigation found no evidence that their opinions affected their work; a special counsel appointed by Trump was more critical of the FBI but agreed that investigating Russian interference was warranted.Strzok filed suit in August 2019, claiming he was unfairly terminated for criticizing the president. Page filed suit that December, accusing the FBI and the Justice Department of violating the Privacy Act by showing reporters a document containing nearly 400 texts between her and Strzok, in which the pair discussed their intense dislike of Trump and their fear that he might win the presidency.The settlement came after attorneys for the two former employees won court approval to question Trump and FBI Director Christopher A. Wray separately under oath.Trump was deposed in October 2023, after publicly bragging about firing FBI officials.On “The Hugh Hewitt Show” in February 2023, Trump stood by pushing out former FBI director James B. Comey, former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, and Strzok and Page, calling them “scum” who were “trying to do an overthrow.”Trump added, “They spied on my campaign, and I got rid of them all. … But … it was more than them, and you know that.”Strzok and Page used work phones to exchange messages critical of numerous politicians, especially Trump, whom Strzok derided as “abysmal” and a “disaster.”In August 2016, after Page wrote that Trump was “not ever going to become president, right? Right?!” Strzok responded: “No. No he’s not. We’ll stop it.”Trump has vowed to seek revenge if he wins election again and regains control of the Justice Department, according to people who have talked to him, The Washington Post has reported. He has privately discussed using the government to punish critics and opponents, including prosecuting officials at the FBI and the Justice Department, and mused publicly about weaponizing the department.House Republicans challenged Garland at a June 4 hearing over reports that a tentative deal with Strzok and Page had been reached. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) quoted from text messages the pair sent criticizing Trump.“They are getting money from the taxpayers because you decided that is the right thing to do?” Jordan said. “You go after the president and you are rewarded?”"
34,CNN_7,"California’s Park Fire now among state’s top 13 largest ever as it consumes 239,000 acres",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/us/california-park-fire-oregon-durkee-jasper/index.html,"
Hot and dry weather is fueling wildfire activity in the Western United States and Canada, with fires damaging homes, causing injuries and forcing evacuations. The largest active wildfire in the US has scorched more than 280,000 acres in eastern Oregon and another blaze has exploded to more than 239,000 acres in California. Here’s the latest:


            • Park Fire roars across parts of Butte and Tehama counties, north of Sacramento, California: As of Friday evening, the Park Fire has burned more than 239,000 acres, or about 373 square miles, about the size of San Diego, which makes it the 13th largest in state history. More than 1,600 firefighters are working to slow its progress. Cal Fire reported the blaze was 0% contained Friday, with 134 structures destroyed and another 4,200 threatened. Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for both counties Friday. The state also secured a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to ensure there are enough resources to fight the fire.
    

            Billy See, incident commander for Cal Fire, said the fire is advancing at 4,000 to 5,000 acres per hour but with winds forecast to die down overnight and higher humidity moving into the area, See believes it will give firefighters a better chance to slow the fire down. He noted fire crews are working to hold the fire south of California Highway 36.
    

            The fire has forced road closures and mandatory evacuations in Butte County, where the state’s deadliest wildfire, the Camp Fire, killed more than 85 people and destroyed thousands of homes in 2018. Local officials cautioned it would take some time before people would be allowed back in their homes and urged residents to visit county websites for the most up-to-date information on evacuations and road closures.
    

            • Three firefighters injured and structures damaged: Three firefighters had minor heat-related injuries on Wednesday while fighting the Park Fire, Cal Fire Captain Dan Collins told CNN Thursday. They were treated and released, he said. Officials know structures have been damaged or destroyed by the fire, but there is no official count yet, Collins said.
    

• Man accused of starting California wildfire is arrested: A suspect has been arrested on suspicion of pushing a burning car 60 feet into a gully, “spreading flames” that caused what’s now become California’s largest wildfire of the year, authorities said. The Park Fire in the Butte County area has quickly burned an area larger than the city of Atlanta.
    

            • Firefighters battle massive Oregon fire: The Durkee Fire, which has burned more than 288,000 acres and is 20% contained as of Friday afternoon, started on July 17 near the Oregon-Idaho state line. The lightning-sparked fire is the largest of 34 large wildfires currently burning across Oregon, which has been the hardest hit by fires in recent days. More than 500 firefighters and resources from 22 states are working to fight the fire, according to InciWeb. Over the weekend and earlier this week, the Durkee Fire exhibited extreme fire behavior, even creating its own weather in the form of pyrocumulus clouds.
    

            • Oregon wildfire destroys buildings: Three people were injured and two homes and 12 other structures were destroyed as the fire spread, according to the Oregon Department of Emergency Management. Evacuations are still in effect in Baker County for areas around the Durkee Fire. Some communities do not have power, according to Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, who has deployed resources from the National Guard to assist. Dense smoke from the flames has also impeded traffic on Interstate 84, leading to periodic closure of the freeway. Wildfire smoke was spreading into Boise and beyond. Air quality alerts have been issued for parts of Colorado, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.
    

            • Wildfire engulfs tourist town in Canada: A fast-moving wildfire sent thousands of visitors and residents fleeing the town of Jasper in Alberta, where flames devastated up to half of the town’s structures. Officials say the losses are significant, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has deployed federal support to help battle the blaze. Cool temperatures and rain are expected to keep fire behavior low for the next 72 hours, which will help crews fight the blaze, Jasper National Park said on Facebook Thursday night.
    

            • Fire-conducive weather continues in Western US: Triple-digit heat and dry conditions across the West this week have made conditions poor for firefighters actively fighting to contain the 89 large wildfires burning nationwide. “Many wildfires in the Northwest area continue to exhibit active to extreme fire behavior, with evacuation orders in effect on 17 wildfires. Several teams are managing multiple fire starts as complexes. Evacuation orders are also in effect for several fires in California, the Northern Rockies and the Great Basin,” the National Interagency Fire Center said. Conditions will begin to improve for much of the West over the weekend as cooler temperatures and higher humidity levels arrive in the area.
    

            Some families have found themselves displaced as the Park Fire raged near Chico, a city in northern California, burning homes and forcing evacuations.
    

            A former news anchor told CNN affiliate KOVR she watched her Butte County house burn down live through security camera footage.
    

            “There is no rhyme or reason. Our house is gone, their house is okay. The house next to it, you can see it’s gone,” Julia Yarbough said.
    

            Looking at the remnants of her home, Yarbough said she felt numb.
    

            “It’s surreal,” she said. “It probably won’t hit me till later, I’m pretty sure.”
    

            Triple-digit temperatures and high wind gusts have fueled the explosive growth of the Park Fire amid an active fire season in California. An estimated 343,253 acres have burned across the state so far in 2024, compared to 22,439 acres burned by this time last year, according to Cal Fire.
    

            A 42-year-old man, identified as Ronnie Dean Stout II, has been arrested after being accused of igniting the inferno.
    

            Witnesses reported seeing someone “pushing a car that was on fire into a gully near the Alligator Hole in upper Bidwell Park shortly before 3:00 p.m. yesterday,” Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said Thursday. “The car went down an embankment approximately 60 feet and burned completely, spreading flames that caused the Park Fire.”
    

            The DA says the man was seen “calmly leaving the area by blending in with the other citizens who were in the area and fleeing the rapidly evolving fire.” Stout was later arrested at a mobile home park in Chico, Ramsey said.
    

            Stout will likely face an arson charge, though it is unclear what count, or whether any enhancements will be added, Ramsey said. The DA’s office told CNN Stout has not retained an attorney and will be assigned a public defender at his arraignment.
    

            He was previously convicted of second degree robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and drug paraphernalia possession in Kern County, according to criminal records. He was sentenced to 21 years in prison. He was released on parole in 2018, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation confirmed to CNN.
    

            He was also convicted of lewd or lascivious acts on a child under 14 in Butte County, records show.
    

            In Jasper, a popular tourist town in Alberta, 25,000 residents and visitors were forced to evacuate from a fast-moving blaze that has damaged 30 to 50% of the town’s structures, officials said during a news conference Thursday.
    

            “Homes and businesses have been lost to a wildfire that people are calling a ‘wall of flames,’” Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said.
    

            An “enormous wind gust” moved the wildfire roughly about 3 miles in “probably less than 30 minutes,” Alberta Minister of Public Safety & Emergency Services Mike Ellis said during the press conference. This created “a wall of fire that was about 100 meters high.”
    

            “Any firefighter will tell you there is little to nothing you can do when you have a wall of flames coming at you like that. Nobody anticipated that fire to come so fast, so large,” Ellis said.
    

            Two wildfires converged in the Jasper National Park area, becoming what authorities are referring to as the Jasper Wildfire Complex. It remains difficult to measure exactly how big the complex – which also includes a third nearby fire – is due to extreme fire behavior and thick smoke cover. Together, the fires have swallowed an estimated 89,000 acres, the Jasper National Park said.
    

            Damage wrought by the flames will result in “a significant rebuild and significant displacement,” Smith said. The most significant structural damage lies on the west side of town, according to a Facebook post from Jasper National Park.

            “We will recover from this,” Smith said while holding back tears. “To those in Alberta and around the world who have experienced the magic of Jasper, the magic is not lost, and it never will be.”
    

            The vast majority of evacuees were “visitors with other places to return to,” Ellis said. Along with about 5,000 residents who live in the town, 2.48 million people visited Jasper National Park last year.
    

            Jasper Mayor Richard Ireland said residents will work together to rebuild after the wildfire “ravaged our beloved community.”
    

            “Your resilience and strength have always been the backbone of our community. In the coming days and weeks, we will rally together, support one another, and begin the daunting process of recovery,” Ireland said in a statement on Thursday.
    

            Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said all federal agencies are working together to provide resources to Jasper, support evacuations and strengthen response efforts on the ground.
    

            “Our governments are working together to keep Albertans safe and supported through this,” he said on Facebook.

34,WaPo_24,Park Fire’s rapid growth puts it among largest in California history,https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/27/park-fire-chico-california/,"The Park Fire in Northern California grew rapidly to more than 307,000 acres late Friday, fueled by winds and steep terrain, officials said, making what was already California’s largest wildfire this year among the largest in state history.The fire, which officials suspect was the result of arson, started near Chico and then rapidly exploded, stoked by extreme heat and dense, dry brush. So far it has continued to grow unabated, burning at a rate of 4,000 to 5,000 acres per hour and scorching rugged, difficult terrain filled with grass, brush, timber and dead vegetation, officials said Friday.The fire is currently 0 percent contained, according to Cal Fire, and has prompted evacuation orders in Butte, Tehama and Shasta counties as it moves rapidly on its northern and eastern flanks. The blaze has been progressing north toward the city of Redding, crossing Highway 36 and threatening small towns such as Shingletown and Manton, according to fire mapping and experts.California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) on Friday declared a state of emergency in Butte and Tehama counties in response to the fire, saying in a statement that “we are using every available tool to protect lives and property as our fire and emergency response teams work around the clock to combat these challenging fires.”Due to erratic winds and high temperatures, firefighters have been struggling to mount any sort of offense, using most of their resources to try to defend communities in the wildfire’s path. Crews had containment at 3 percent earlier Friday but that then fell back to zero.“This fire has fingers that are growing in different directions depending on which way the wind is blowing,” Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said at a news conference Friday afternoon.Thousands of people in Butte County, where the fire started, Tehama and Shasta counties have had to evacuate. CalFire said in an update Friday that 4,200 structures are threatened and 134 have been destroyed.On Friday evening, the town of Paradise, which was devastated by the Camp Fire in 2018, issued an evacuation warning due to “fire behavior and predicted winds” and urged residents to prepare to evacuate and await further information.Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA, described the wildfire’s spread as “astonishing” in a post on social media and said it is “re-writing the record books.”“This is California in the Pyrocene,” Swain wrote, referring to an era characterized by human-caused fire activity, “and a couple of mild fire years (2022/3) don’t alter that long-term trajectory.”"
39,CNN_39,California’s Park Fire destroys buildings and forces thousands to flee while in Canada a fast-moving blaze ravages tourist town,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/us/california-chico-park-fire-canada-jasper-fire/index.html,"
California’s largest wildfire of the year has burned an area larger than the size of the city of Los Angeles, destroyed dozens of buildings and forced thousands of residents to flee their homes as wildfires wreak havoc in the Western United States. Meanwhile, homes and businesses in a popular Canadian resort town were incinerated as a wildfire continued to roar through the area. Here’s the latest:


            • California’s Park Fire now state’s 8th largest: As the Park Fire exploded across parts of Butte and Tehama counties, north of Sacramento, California, it scorched 134 buildings and threatened another 4,200. The fast moving blaze has burned more than 307,000 acres, or about 480 square miles, making it the eighth largest wildfire in recorded state history. More than 2,400 firefighters are working to slow the fire’s progress as it remains 0% contained, according to Cal Fire.
    

            • California governor declares state of emergency: Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for both counties Friday. The state also secured a federal grant to ensure there are enough resources to fight the blaze. The fire is advancing at 4,000 to 5,000 acres per hour, Billy See, incident commander for Cal Fire, said Friday. With winds forecast to die down overnight and higher humidity moving into the area, See believes firefighters will have a better chance to slow the fire down.
    

            • A man is accused of igniting Park Fire: A 42-year-old man, identified as Ronnie Dean Stout II, was arrested on suspicion of pushing a burning car 60 feet into a gully, “spreading flames that caused the Park Fire,” authorities said. The DA says the man was seen “calmly leaving the area by blending in with the other citizens who were in the area and fleeing the rapidly evolving fire.” Stout, who has not retained an attorney, will likely face an arson charge, the DA’s office told CNN.
    

            • Pilot dies while fighting Oregon fire: A firefighting pilot was found dead in a single-engine air tanker on Friday after going missing the night before while working in the vicinity of the 219-square-mile Falls Fire burning in the Malheur National Forest, according to officials. The fire, which was 55% contained as of Saturday morning, is among a number of large wildfires burning across Oregon. The largest active wildfire in the state is the Durkee Fire, which has scorched about 451 square miles and was 27% contained as of Saturday morning.
    

            • Fire wipes out many of a Canadian town’s buildings: A fast-moving wildfire sent thousands of visitors and residents fleeing the town of Jasper in Alberta, where flames devastated an estimated 30% of the town’s structures. Officials say the losses are significant, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has deployed federal support to help battle the blaze. Cool temperatures are expected to calm fire behavior, which will help the 154 firefighters in Jasper fight the blaze, Jasper National Park said on Facebook Friday night. High winds, however, could increase fire activity.
    

            • 96 large wildfires burning nationwide: Triple-digit heat and dry conditions across the West this week have made conditions poor for firefighters actively fighting to contain the dozens of wildfires burning nationwide, including 37 in Oregon and 14 in California. “Elevated to critical fire weather conditions will persist through the weekend across the Western U.S. Isolated dry thunderstorms could lead to new fire starts over portions of the northern Rockies,” the National Weather Service said. Smoke from wildfires will also result in continued unhealthy air quality.
    

            The Park Fire, which began Wednesday in the Chico area, has forced about 4,000 people to evacuate in Butte County, where the state’s deadliest wildfire, the Camp Fire, killed more than 85 people and destroyed thousands of homes in 2018.
    

            A heavy plume of smoke once again looms over the county as crews battle thick flames that are torching everything in their path. The Park Fire has left graveyards of burned cars and charred, hallowed out structures, video from the Chico area shows.
    

            For Butte County residents, the advancing flames bring with them painful memories of the losses they endured from the Camp Fire six years ago.
    

            One evacuee, Tim Ferguson, told CNN affiliate KOVR he had lost his father in the Camp Fire, and it’s painful thinking about having to experience more loss this time around.
    

            “We’ve got our home, and we’ve been working on it a lot lately, fixing it up, and it’s just we’re at the verge of maybe losing all that,” Ferguson said.
    

            Lauri Schwein, who lost her home in the Camp Fire, told CNN affiliate KCRA she’s on high alert. “I’m packing up, my dog, my cat,” she said. “All I can do is wait and watch.”
    

            In the town of Paradise, the smoke is enough to bring back the horrors the Camp Fire unleashed when it incinerated much of the town.
    

            “It was very impactful, every once in a while we smell smoke or see smoke like that, it does trigger us. It triggers the people here in Paradise. When you go through trauma, that’s what happens,” Ron Lassonde, the mayor of Paradise, told KCRA.
    

            Paradise is under an evacuation warning, according to the town web site. “An EVACUATION WARNING means prepare to evacuate and await additional instructions, under a warning those who need additional time to evacuate should begin evacuating now,” officials cautioned.
    

            The Park Fire is burning just three weeks after the Thomspon Fire in Butte County burned more than 3,700 acres, forced people from their homes, and destroyed more than two dozen structures, including houses.
    

            Local officials cautioned it would take some time before people would be allowed back in their homes.
    

            “We are no strangers to evacuations in Butte County,” said Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea at a news conference Friday. “We are constantly looking for the earliest opportunity to get people back in.”
    

            The North Valley Animal Disaster Group has rescued 88 animals from the blaze as its members dealt with losses of their own. In 2018, the group managed to shelter over 4,000 animals during the Camp Fire.
    

            “When you’ve been through a big fire and you’ve lost everything, sometimes the only thing you have left to give is to go help the animals,” Vice President Norm Rosene told CNN.
    

            Triple-digit temperatures and high wind gusts have fueled the explosive growth of the Park Fire amid an active fire season in California. An estimated 626,600 acres have burned across the state so far in 2024, compared to 25,254 acres burned by this time last year, according to Cal Fire.
    

            “It’s been nothing but challenging,” Cal Fire Captain Dan Collins told CNN. “If we see fires behave like this in July, they may behave even more radically come the fall when the fields are even drier.”
    

            In Jasper, a popular tourist town in Alberta, 25,000 residents and visitors were forced to evacuate from a fast-moving blaze that has destroyed 30% of the town’s structures, officials said.
    

            Two wildfires converged in the Jasper National Park area, becoming what authorities are referring to as the Jasper Wildfire Complex. It remains difficult to measure exactly how big the complex – which also includes a third nearby fire – is due to extreme fire behavior and thick smoke cover. Together, the fires have swallowed an estimated 89,000 acres, the Jasper National Park said.
    

            An evacuation order remains in effect for Jasper and Jasper National Park, with the vast majority of evacuees being visitors, officials said. Along with about 4,100 residents – and thousands of seasonal workers – who live in the town, 2.48 million people visited Jasper National Park last year.
    

            Out of a total of 1,113 structures in the town, 358 have been destroyed, according to a Facebook post from Jasper National Park.
    

            The owner of Maligne Lodge in Jasper told CNN news partner CTV News that she was shocked when she saw a photo of the 98-room hotel up in flames. It had been in the family since 1961 after her father purchased the property, and she had been working there since she was a child.
    

            “As soon as we’re given the go-ahead, we’ll be in there rebuilding our hotel,” Karyn Decore said.
    

            Jasper Mayor Richard Ireland lost the home that his family had moved into around his second birthday, according to CTV News.
    

            On a tour of the wreckage in Jasper, Ireland said that the loss of his home of 67 years “is shattering.”
    

            “Now it’s memories of family and fire,” Ireland told CNN news partner CBC. “So many others are going to go through this same thing.”
    

            But he said “when I stood back and looked, and saw what remains, I know that the community is still there.”

40,CNN_16,Israel issues fresh evacuation order in Gaza’s Khan Younis after renewed offensive displaces tens of thousands,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/israel-evacuation-order-gaza-khan-younis-intl-hnk/index.html,"
            Israel’s military issued new evacuation orders for residents in Gaza’s southern city of Khan Younis, warning it would “forcefully operate” in southern neighborhoods as it presses on with an operation that has already displaced tens of thousands.
    

            Khan Younis has faced intensifying bombardment recently, and a fresh Israeli ground assault launched earlier this week has killed dozens of Palestinians. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) warned on Monday it would reduce its so-called humanitarian zone in the eastern part of the city, due to intelligence that militant group Hamas had embedded in the area.
    

            Fighting has been ongoing on Gaza for months, and the renewed offensive shows Israel’s challenges in achieving its goal of eliminating Hamas. Israel said that about 100 militants had been killed during recent fighting.
    

            The United Nations estimated that about 150,000 people fled Khan Younis on Monday alone, intensifying pressure on meager supplies of food and water, and places to seek shelter.

            Signaling another campaign was imminent, the IDF wrote on Telegram it was “about to forcefully operate against the terrorist organizations and therefore calls on the remaining population left in the southern neighborhoods of Khan Yunis to temporarily evacuate to the adjusted Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi.”
    

            An eyewitness in Khan Younis told CNN that she was “woken up by the screams” of people as they fled the area following the evacuation order.
    

            The eyewitness told CNN that she could hear clearly hear the sound of clashes and explosions in Khan Yunis and saw flares in the sky overnight. According to her, people are now fleeing the area.
    

            The designated humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi has come under repeated Israeli attacks, including a strike on July 14 which reportedly killed 90 people and injured 300 more.
    

            The statement said the move was in retaliation to “significant terrorist activity and rocket fire” emanating from southern Khan Younis. It added that the location previously defined as a humanitarian area “will be adjusted.”
    

            Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza on October 7 after Hamas attacked southern Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted, according to Israeli authorities.
    

            Israeli military action in Gaza has since killed 39,090 Palestinians and injured another 90,147, according to the Ministry of Health there. As of early July, nearly 2 million people had been displaced in Gaza – almost the entire population, according to figures from the UN.
    

            The military said on Saturday that “the calls for the temporary evacuation are being communicated to residents through SMS messages, recorded voice messages, phone calls, media broadcasts in Arabic and flyers,” adding that the early warning to civilians was “being made in order to mitigate harm to the civilian population.”
    

            Aid agencies working in Gaza have warned previously that new rounds of evacuation orders are making the delivery of emergency rations even more difficult.
    

            “People in Gaza are exhausted, living in inhumane conditions, with no safety at all,” the UN Relief and Works Agency posted on X on Monday.
    

            On Thursday, the IDF said it had recovered the bodies of five Israeli hostages the previous day from a tunnel in an area of Khan Younis which it had previously designated as a “humanitarian area.”
    

            Despite the fighting, US and Israeli officials expressed optimism this week over the possibility of a ceasefire and hostage deal being reached.
    

            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that the different parties are “inside the 10-yard line and driving toward the goal line.”
    

            Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he would likely dispatch a negotiation team to talks in Rome next week.
    

            Netanyahu was in Washington this week and met with the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, who urged him to seal an agreement.
    

            “As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done,” said Harris. “So to everyone who has been calling for a ceasefire, and to everyone who yearns for peace, I see you and I hear you.”

            At least 30 people have been killed and over 100 injured in an Israeli airstrike on a school in Deir-al Balah, central Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.
    

            The Israeli military it had launched the strike in order to destroy a Hamas command and control center inside the compound.
    

            Most of the victims from the school arriving to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the aftermath of the attack were women and children, according to Dr. Khalil Al-Daqran, a spokesperson for the hospital. More than 4,000 displaced people were housed in the school, the Palestinian Civil Defense said.
    

            The strike came soon after Israeli’s military issued fresh evacuation orders further south, in the city of Khan Younis, where Israel launched a fresh offensive earlier in the week which has killed dozens of Palestinians.
    

            Residents in southern neighborhoods were told to leave after being warned that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would “forcefully operate” in the area.

            At least 12 people, including children, were killed when multiple rockets hit a village in the Golan Heights Saturday in an attack described by Israel as the deadliest against it since October 7.
    

            Israel said it had identified “approximately 30 projectiles” crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory and blamed the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah for the barrage. The incident has raised fears of a major escalation in the long-running conflict along the Israel-Lebanon border, even though Hezbollah has said it “firmly denies” firing the rockets.
    

            At least 29 people were injured in the attack in Majdal Shams, a village in the Israeli-controlled northern Golan Heights that is home to a large Druze community.
    

            Some 20,000 Druze Arabs live in the Golan Heights, an area Israel seized from Syria in 1967 during the Six-Day War and annexed in 1981. Considered occupied territory under international law and UN Security Council resolutions, the area is home to about 50,000 Israeli Jewish settlers and Druze. Most Druze there identify as Syrian and have rejected offers of Israeli citizenship.

            Among the sites hit in the attack was a soccer field where children and teenagers had been playing, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari said. He described the attack as “the deadliest attack on Israeli civilians since October 7.”
    

            “This is a very serious incident and we will act accordingly,” he said.
    

            Hagari said the rocket that hit the soccer field was a “Falaq 1 Iranian rocket carrying a 50kg warhead.” “This is a model that is owned exclusively by Hezbollah, and tonight it caused the deaths of 12 young boys and girls,” he added.
    

            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he was cutting short by several hours his visit to the United States and returning to Israel because of the attack and said he would convene a security cabinet meeting immediately upon his return.
    

            The prime minister said he was “shocked” by the attack. “I can say that the State of Israel will not go be silent about this. We will not put this off the agenda,” he said.
    

            In a separate statement earlier, Netanyahu’s office said the prime minister “made it clear” that “Hezbollah will pay a heavy price for (the attack) that it has not paid so far.”
    

            Israeli President Isaac Herzog decried the attack as a “terrible and shocking disaster” and vowed Israel would “defend” its citizens.
    

            “Hezbollah terrorists brutally attacked and murdered children today, whose only crime was going out to play soccer. They did not return,” he said in a post on X.
    

            “The world cannot continue to sit in silence in the face of (Hezbollah leader Hassan) Nasrallah’s terror attacks, which come at the behest of the empire of evil in Iran. The State of Israel will firmly defend its citizens and its sovereignty.”
    

            The attack on Saturday is a major escalation in what has been an extremely volatile period in the border area. Israel and Hezbollah have been trading fire across the demarcation line for almost 10 months and regional leaders have been warning the conflict is reaching a boiling point.
    

            Officially, Lebanon and Israel are – and have been for decades – in a state of war, but the recent tensions have so far not escalated into a full-blown conflict.

            The strikes have become more frequent in recent weeks and both Hezbollah and Israel are targeting sites deeper and deeper into each other’s territory.
    

            The tensions increased further in the past few weeks when Israel killed two high-ranking Hezbollah commanders – Sami Taleb Abdullah in May and Muhammed Neamah Naser in June – blaming them for directing terror attacks both before and after Hamas’ October 7 attacks from Gaza. Hezbollah retaliated by firing hundreds of missiles into Israel.
    

            It is unclear how Israel will respond to Saturday’s deadly attack. The Government Press Office said Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant was conducting a situation assessment together with the IDF Chief of the General Staff and senior defense officials.
    

            Speaking later on Saturday, Gallant said Israel will hit back at the enemy harshly.”
    

            Meanwhile, Netanyahu held a security consultation with his military secretary General Roman Gofman, and will hold a security situation assessment with all the heads of the defense establishment later on Saturday, his office said.
    

            Israeli opposition leader Benny Gantz traveled to Majdal Shams on Saturday, calling on Netanyahu to increase IDF presence in the area.
    

            Some IDF units previously stationed along the country’s northern border have been redeployed to southern Israel following the October 7 terror attack by Hamas and the subsequent Israeli ground invasion of Gaza.
    

            “We have a moral obligation in the south to return the hostages home, and we have a strategic obligation to return security to the north and the people to their homes. This has gone on for too long. I told the prime minister that he must turn the resources to the north at the same time as the work in the south for the return of the hostages – this is the main task.”
    

            The Lebanese government said after the attack that it condemned “all acts of violence and attacks against all civilians,” Lebanese state news agency NNA reported.
    

            The government also called for “an immediate cessation of hostilities on all fronts” and said that “targeting civilians constitutes a blatant violation of international law and is contrary to the principles of humanity,” NNA reported.
    

            Adeeb Safadi, a resident of Majdal Shams, told CNN that those killed in the rocket attack on the soccer field were all Druze children from local villages, boys between the ages of eight and 15.
    

            “They were attending a football training class with a coach whose fate is still unknown. Ten of the killed have been identified, but there are more who were torn apart and are still unidentified,” said Safadi, who lives some 600 meters from the site of the attack.
    

            He said he saw black smoke and heard an explosion. About four seconds after the explosion, he heard sirens warning people about an imminent attack.
    

            Evacuation helicopters, ambulances and intensive care vehicles have been dispatched to the scene.
    

            Israel’s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service reported that the fatalities included “teenagers and young adults” whose ages ranged from 10 to 20 years old. It said a further 29 people were injured, six of whom were in a serious condition.

            Idan Avshalom, a senior medic from MDA, said the team saw destruction and fire when arriving at the scene.
    

            “Injured people were lying on the grass and the sights were dire. We immediately began triaging the injured, some of the injured were sent to local clinics and our teams were also directed to the clinics,” he said, adding that there were additional alerts as they worked to save the injured.
    

            Ziv Medical Center in the northern Israeli city of Safed said it had received 26 injured people, five of whom were admitted to the trauma center. Rambam Hospital in Haifa has also opened an information center to help people get information about their loved ones.
    

            Israeli police said that munitions have fallen in “multiple sites in the northern Golan.”
    

            Police are “securing the area and searching for additional remnants to eliminate any further risk to the public,” the Police Spokesperson’s Unit said.
    

            While the IDF has blamed the attack on Hezbollah, the militant group denied involvement in a statement on Telegram Saturday.
    

            “The Islamic Resistance in Lebanon firmly denies the allegations made by some enemy media outlets and various media platforms regarding the targeting of Majdal Shams,” it said.
    

            “We confirm that the Islamic Resistance has no connection to the incident whatsoever and firmly denies all false claims in this regard,” the statement continued.
    

            Earlier on Saturday, Hezbollah had said it targeted an Israeli military site in a different part of the occupied Golan Heights.
    

            But the IDF said its analysis showed the rocket launched at Majdal Shams was “carried out from an area located north of the village of Chebaa in southern Lebanon.”
    

            Hagari, the IDF spokesperson, said Hezbollah was lying when denying it was behind the attack. “Our intelligence is clear – Hezbollah is responsible for killing innocent children. Ten-year-old children and once again, the brutality of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization was exposed,” he said.
    

            The White House on Saturday condemned the attack and reiterated its “iron-clad” support fro Israel.
    

            “Israel continues to face severe threats to its security, as the world saw today, and the United States will continue to support efforts to end these terrible attacks along the Blue Line, which must be a top priority,” a National Security Council Spokesperson said in a written statement to CNN, referring to the demarcation line between Israel and Lebanon.
    

            “Our support for Israel’s security is iron-clad and unwavering against all Iranian backed terrorist groups, including Lebanese Hezbollah,” the spokesperson added.
    

            Meanwhile, the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called for an independent international investigation into the attacks and urged restraint.
    

            “Shocking images from the soccer field in the Druze town of Majdal Shams. I strongly condemn this bloodbath. We urge all parties to exercise utmost restraint and avoid further escalation,” he said in a statement posted on X.

76,WaPo_12,D.C.’s Friday weather seemed special for being ordinary,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/26/washington-weather-warm-summer-heat/,"D.C. may take pride in its reputation for sultry summertime swelter, but Friday seemed the sort of day for wondering what all the fuss was about and whether the reputation was deserved.It was true that Friday seemed obviously a summer day. Its high temperature of 85 degrees seemed clearly consistent with general expectations of summertime.But Friday failed to inflict on the District the harsh meteorological extremism of many days earlier this month — including the four with temperatures above 100 degrees.However, if averages mean much, they may suggest that days such as Friday cannot readily be relied on to appear here always or often in July.The average temperature in Washington on Friday’s date now stands at 90 degrees. So it would seem that part of Friday’s allure lay in the five-degree gap between its temperature and the District’s average July 26 temperature.Possibly Friday’s sense that summer had a benign side, might have been earned physiologically. The many days of extreme and above average temperatures this summer have likely caused acclimatization and a process of adjustment.But cloudy skies also played an obvious part in moderating Friday’s conditions.For much of the day, clouds shielded the city from the wilting effects of the summertime sun. It is just a little more than five weeks since the sun was at its absolute annual acme.Feeling its full late-July strength for protracted periods in the glare of streets without shade, with solar rays reflected from concrete and marble would have made Friday seem far less comfortable than it did.A major contributor to Friday’s welcome as a well-behaved emissary of summer was the humidity. Or the relative absence thereof.When summer seems to be at its most intolerable it is ascribed to the joint effect of severe heat and oppressive humidity. Friday was neither too hot nor too humid.To know the absolute temperature was to know the “feels-like” temperature. Through the day, they were close to identical, meaning that humidity declined to make an 85-degree day seem worse than it was.This was reflected in the day’s dew points, which were confined to the 50s, a location regarded as comfortable."

140,WaPo_91,"After ‘big show’ in U.S., Netanyahu returns to turmoil at home",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/27/netanyahu-united-states-harris-trump-hostages/,"JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s first trip outside Israel since the attacks of Oct. 7 featured a packed and dramatic itinerary: meetings with President Biden and  each of his most likely successors, a globally broadcast address to Congress, and the kinds of confrontations with protesters and the families of Israeli hostages he often tries to avoid at home.Now he will return to see what effect — if any — his headline-grabbing swing will have on his many battles back home, including with angry voters, rebellious governing partners and frustrated military leaders.It will take time, and polling, to tell. But political, diplomatic and security experts here say the results are likely to be mixed, boosting Netanyahu with his base while not significantly shifting his overall public standing.The trip also ramped up pressure on Netanyahu to reach a cease-fire deal with Hamas in the Gaza Strip as talks reach a critical point, something he was pushed on by everyone from hostage parents to Biden to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.On Saturday, a rocket attack in northern Israel killed 11 people on a soccer pitch in Majdal Shams. The Israeli military blamed Hezbollah for the attack and Netanyahu, preparing to leave the United States, said the Lebanese militant group, which denied involvement, “will pay a heavy price.”The events in Washington and Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Palm Beach resort, probably achieved what may have been Netanyahu’s main priority: reminding his core supporters that he can command the attention of presidents and the world.“He got exactly what he wanted out of the trip,” said Anshel Pfeffer, a Netanyahu biographer and the Economist’s Israel correspondent. “He got a big show, the spectacle of being a statesman that he thrives on.”The trip came as Israel’s standing has been battered for months by its military campaign in Gaza. More than 39,000 people have been killed there since the war started, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children.Netanyahu could face war crimes charges, after the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced in May that he was seeking an arrest warrant for the prime minister for alleged atrocities in Gaza.His appearances in Washington and Florida, while massive protests dogged his motorcades, were potent counter programming. He was welcomed at the White House, an honor that Biden, who has made no secret of his frustrations with Netanyahu, had denied him for more than a year and a half.And his address to Congress, which aired in prime time in Israel and featured more than 50 standing ovations, may also stem some of the bleeding from his base, aiding his fight against brewing rebellions within his government and party.“This was Netanyahu returning to his well-known role of making the Israeli case in a prestigious setting in articulate English,” said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute. “It’s going to be well-received by those people inclined to support him.”But shoring up the base will not patch up Netanyahu’s cratering popularity among the broader electorate, Plesner said. Around two-thirds of Israelis consistently say they want the prime minister to step down over the failures that led to the Hamas attacks and for not negotiating a hostage release deal.“Forty-five minutes of speech and applause won’t erase the one sad fact: the words ‘Deal Now!’ were absent from the prime minister’s address,” the Hostage and Missing Families Forum, an umbrella group, said after the event.But in Israel’s fragmented parliamentary system, Netanyahu might be able to cling to power just by restoring his edge among the right-wing voters that give him a tiny, four-seat majority in the Knesset.“He doesn’t need a groundswell of support to remain prime minister,” Pfeffer said. “He just needs to move various needles slightly rightward.”An official close to the prime minister’s office, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues, said his inner circle was largely satisfied with a trip that forced Netanyahu to confront a presidential race in turmoil.Netanyahu had a meeting with Biden that was civil, at least publicly. He began mending his years-long rupture with Trump, who greeted the prime minister and his wife warmly and denied — contrary to several previous, sometimes profane, statements to the contrary — that the two had ever fallen out.But the team was taken aback by Vice President Harris, who has solidified her position as the likely Democratic nominee, the Israeli official familiar with the discussions said. Her behavior and rhetoric signaled that a President Harris would be tougher on Netanyahu than her boss has been.“Harris was a surprise,” said the official. “She was harsher than expected.”Harris skipped Netanyahu’s congressional speech for a campaign trip. After a meeting with the prime minister Thursday, she gave public remarks that echoed Biden’s usual statements of support for Israel’s right to defend itself but also emphasized her “serious concern about the scale of human suffering in Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians,” and “images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety.”“We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering, and I will not be silent,” she said.The remarks put Israelis on notice that a Harris victory might or might not bring a shift in U.S. relations, but it would probably change the tone.“It was mostly the same message but the music was very, very different,” said Chuck Freilich, a former deputy head of Israel’s National Security Council and a senior fellow at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. “She used this meeting to stake out her differences.”Talks for a deal to end the fighting and release the hostages still held in Gaza were a constant backdrop to Netanyahu’s trip. Negotiations are scheduled to resume next week in Rome, and U.S. and Arab brokers say the chances of an agreement are as high as they’ve ever been.The prime minister was beseeched to conclude an accord at every turn. Israeli protesters traveled overseas to chant “Seal the Deal!” sometimes standing not far from pro-Palestinian demonstrators shouting “Cease-fire Now!”Biden brought eight American hostage families to the White House to plead with Netanyahu, as did rescued hostage Noa Argamani, who traveled on the prime minister’s plane. Trump, too, said the time was right.“It was made very clear that everyone is pushing for a hostage deal,” the Israeli official said.Netanyahu said he thought Israel’s recent military attacks have brought Hamas closer to accepting agreeable terms, although there are key differences that need to be ironed out.But his political dilemma remains: If he allows for a cease-fire deal that ends the fighting in Gaza before “total victory” against Hamas, his most extremist coalition partners have threatened to bring down his government.Hostage families hope Netanyahu’s Washington trip, and the possible boost it gives him with right-wing voters, will give him more maneuvering room. Or at least give him more confidence that he could survive new elections.The prime minister’s travels also helped him run out the clock on the parliamentary session — lawmakers begin a three-month recess Monday — freezing any political machinations until closer to the end of the year.Whether all those factors combine to finally bring about an end to the fighting won’t be known for days, or even weeks, when the process in Rome concludes."
147,WaPo_99,"Attacks in Gaza and Golan Heights kill more than 40, many of them children",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/27/israel-gaza-hamas-evacuation-mawasi/,"JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hezbollah would “pay a heavy price” for a rocket strike that killed 11 people on a soccer field in the occupied Golan Heights on Saturday, sparking vehement denials of responsibility from the Lebanese militant group as the fallout tipped the two sides closer to all-out war.“Israel will not move on after this murderous attack,” he said, as he prepared to return to Israel from the United States, according to a statement from his office. “Hezbollah will pay a heavy price for this that it has not paid so far.”Israeli military leaders were meeting Saturday night to “prepare for a response against Hezbollah,” Israel Defense Forces spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a news briefing. “We will finish our assessments and we will act.”The IDF said the blast in Majdal Shams, which Israel annexed from Syria in 1981, was caused by an Iranian-made Falaq-1 rocket fired from across the border in southern Lebanon. At least 20 more people were wounded, the IDF said, adding that many of the casualties were children or young adults.Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, swiftly denied any connection to the attack, saying in a statement that it “categorically denies all false claims in this regard.”The Falaq-1, which Hezbollah began using against Israel in January, is an unguided, short-range surface-to-surface rocket “ideal for … fighting in dense urban areas,” according to Armament Research Services, a global weapons consultancy.The strike drew sharp condemnations from Israeli officials amid fears that it would accelerate the now-daily exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah into a full-blown conflict. Warnings of such an eruption have grown more urgent in recent months, as fighting along the Lebanon-Israel border has intensified.“For more than nine months, Hezbollah has been attacking our citizens in the north, firing thousands of rockets and missiles and UAVs … targeting families, homes and communities,” Hagari said.The two heavily armed adversaries fought a bruising war in 2006 but left the border largely quiet for about 17 years after that. Hezbollah began its recent strikes on Israel soon after the Hamas-led attack on Israeli communities Oct. 7, which killed around 1,200 people. During this conflict, Palestinian factions, including Hamas, have occasionally claimed attacks against Israel from Lebanon.This month, Hezbollah’s leader, Hasan Nasrallah, vowed to retaliate against Israel for strikes that have killed Lebanese civilians, saying his group would hit new areas not previously targeted. About 100 civilians have been killed in Lebanon since October. In Israel, more than 20 civilians — including those killed Saturday — have died.The group has launched rockets at Israel and recently sent surveillance drones over the port city of Haifa, evading Israeli air defenses. Nasrallah has also said Hezbollah would end its attacks if there was a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip.More than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed there since the war began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children.Hezbollah announced earlier Saturday that Israel had killed four of its members, adding that it had also struck several military targets inside Israel. The targets included what Hezbollah called the Golani barracks, shown on a map that the group distributed as being just north of Majdal Shams.The flare-up at the border set off a diplomatic scramble to prevent a wider conflagration. The Lebanese government said in a statement that it “condemns all acts of violence and aggression” and called for “an immediate cessation of hostilities on all fronts.”The United States, which has been leading negotiations between Israel and Hezbollah, via intermediaries, also condemned what it said was a “horrific attack.”“Our support for Israel’s security is iron-clad and unwavering against all Iranian backed terrorist groups, including Lebanese Hezbollah,” a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said in a statement.The incident in Majdal Shams also followed a deadly strike in central Gaza, where local health authorities said at least 30 Palestinians were killed when Israel bombed a school that was sheltering displaced people. The IDF said it targeted a Hamas position with “precision,” but the bombing left a massive crater and video and eyewitness testimonies from the nearby Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital suggested that most of the dead were civilians.Around 4,000 people were staying in the Khadija School in Deir al-Balah, according to Gaza’s civil defense force. Video from the immediate aftermath of the attack showed bodies on the ground and bloodied children carried by adults. At the hospital, doctors said they had received patients with full-body burns or their limbs shorn off.The IDF described the strike as targeting “terrorists operating a Hamas command and control center embedded inside the Khadija School in central Gaza” and said precautions were taken to “mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of appropriate munitions, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence.”Military experts caution that precision munitions still have the capacity to kill large numbers of people when they are used in densely populated areas. It was not clear which munitions were used in the strikes. A video from the scene, confirmed by the local civil defense force, appeared to show an unexploded U.S.-made small diameter bomb in the wreckage, according to Trevor Ball, a former U.S. Army bomb technician who reviewed the footage.Yazan Ahmed, 33, whose tent is near the school, said the school was targeted with what appeared to be four missiles at around noon local time. He said he went to help rescue people from the school and “the scene cannot be described. The limbs were torn everywhere. They were all women and children whose bodies were torn apart.”His description was echoed by other eyewitnesses. “There were victims everywhere,” said Fayez al-Toum, 21, who said he had been standing on the roof of another school building across the road when the attack began.Most of Gaza’s roughly 2.2 million population has been displaced by the conflict, as fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas militants has shunted much of the civilian population from north to south, and now back toward the enclave’s center.The United Nations said this week that more than 190,000 Palestinians had been displaced from Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, to the south, in just four days, as the Israeli army issued evacuation orders ahead of military operations there. On Saturday, the military extended those instructions to southern neighborhoods of Khan Younis.“Due to significant terrorist activity and rocket fire toward the State of Israel from the southern area of Khan Younis, remaining in this area has become dangerous,” the Israel Defense Forces said on X, warning that it was “about to forcefully operate” there and was adjusting the boundaries of an area that it has designated as a safe zone.It was the second time in less than a week that Israel has ordered the evacuation of a former safe area. On Monday, the IDF ordered the evacuation of an eastern sector of the city of Khan Younis, including an area in the Mawasi neighborhood that was previously within the boundaries of a designated safe zone for displaced people. Israel said it was targeting Hamas militants who had been firing rockets from the area.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been sheltering in the safe zone area, having been displaced multiple times since the war began.At a news briefing Friday, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres described Gaza’s humanitarian crisis as a “disaster.” The displaced were now being told to move, he said, “in search of a safety that doesn’t exist.”El-Chamaa and Fahim reported from Beirut and Harb and Cheung from London. Alon Rom and Lior Soroka in Tel Aviv, Sarah Dadouch in Beirut and Tyler Pager from Washington contributed to this report."

0,NBC_1,"Elon Musk’s transgender daughter, in first interview, says he berated her for being queer as a child",https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/elon-musk-transgender-daughter-vivian-wilson-interview-rcna163665,"Vivian Jenna Wilson, the transgender daughter of Elon Musk, said Thursday in her first interview that he was an absent father who was cruel to her as a child for being queer and feminine.
Wilson, 20, in an exclusive interview with NBC News, responded to comments Musk made Monday about her and her transgender identity. On social media and in an interview posted online, Musk said she was “not a girl” and was figuratively “dead,” and he alleged that he had been “tricked” into authorizing trans-related medical treatment for her when she was 16. 
Wilson said that Musk hadn’t been tricked and that, after initially having hesitated, he knew what he was doing when he agreed to her treatment, which required consent from her parents.
Musk’s recent statements crossed a line, she said. 
“I think he was under the assumption that I wasn’t going to say anything and I would just let this go unchallenged,” Wilson said in a phone interview. “Which I’m not going to do, because if you’re going to lie about me, like, blatantly to an audience of millions, I’m not just gonna let that slide.” 
Wilson said that, for as long as she could remember, Musk hasn’t been a supportive father. She said he was rarely present in her life, leaving her and her siblings to be cared for by their mother or by nannies even though Musk had joint custody, and she said Musk berated her when he was present. 
“He was cold,” she said. “He’s very quick to anger. He is uncaring and narcissistic.” 
Wilson said that, when she was a child, Musk would harass her for exhibiting feminine traits and pressure her to appear more masculine, including by pushing her to deepen her voice as early as elementary school. 
“I was in fourth grade. We went on this road trip that I didn’t know was actually just an advertisement for one of the cars — I don’t remember which one — and he was constantly yelling at me viciously because my voice was too high,” she said. “It was cruel.” 
Musk didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Wilson and her twin brother were born to Musk’s first wife, author Justine Musk. The couple divorced in 2008, and Wilson said her parents shared custody between their homes in the Los Angeles area. 
Musk, 53, is among the wealthiest people in the world through his stakes in Tesla, where he’s CEO, and in SpaceX, which he founded. He has also become a significant political figure, having endorsed former President Donald Trump this month for another term in the White House. Musk has 12 children, including Wilson. 
Now a college student studying languages, Wilson has never granted an interview before and has largely stayed out of public view. She did, however, attract attention in 2022 when she sought court approval in California to change her name and, in the process, denounced her father. 
“I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form,” she said in the court filing. 
She told NBC News that at the time, she was surprised by the media attention to the court filing, which she submitted when she was 18. She said in the interview that she stands by what she wrote, though she said she might have tried to be more eloquent had she known the coverage it would get. 
Wilson said that she hadn’t spoken to Musk in about four years and that she refused to be defined by him. 
“I would like to emphasize one thing: I am an adult. I am 20 years old. I am not a child,” she said. “My life should be defined by my own choices.” 
Musk threw a spotlight on Wilson on Monday by speaking about their relationship in a video interview with psychologist and conservative commentator Jordan Peterson streamed live on X, saying he didn’t support Wilson’s gender identity. 
“I lost my son, essentially,” Musk said. He used Wilson’s birth name, also known as a deadname for transgender people, and said she was “dead, killed by the woke mind virus.” 
And in a post on X, Musk said Monday that Wilson was “born gay and slightly autistic” and that, at age 4, she fit certain gay stereotypes, such as loving musicals and using the exclamation “fabulous!” to describe certain clothing. Wilson told NBC News that the anecdotes aren’t true, though she said she did act stereotypically feminine in other ways as a child. 
Wilson also addressed Musk’s recent comments in a series of posts Thursday on the social media app Threads. 
“He doesn’t know what I was like as a child because he quite simply wasn’t there,” she wrote. “And in the little time that he was I was relentlessly harassed for my femininity and queerness.”
“I’ve been reduced to a happy little stereotype,” she continued. “I think that says alot about how he views queer people and children in general.” 
In recent years, Musk has taken a hard-right turn into conservative politics and has been waging a campaign against transgender people and policies designed to support them. This month, he said he was pulling his businesses out of California to protest a new state law that bars schools from requiring that trans kids be outed to their parents.
On X, Musk has for years criticized transgender rights, including medical treatments for trans-identifying minors, and the use of pronouns if they are different from what would be used at birth. He has promoted anti-trans content and called for arresting people who provide trans care to minors. 
After Musk bought X, then known as Twitter, in 2022, he rolled back the app’s protections for trans people, including a ban on using deadnames. 
Musk told Peterson that Wilson’s gender transition has been the motivation for his push into conservative politics. 
“I vowed to destroy the woke mind virus after that, and we’re making some progress,” he said. 
Wilson was also mentioned in a biography of Musk by author Walter Isaacson — a book that she told NBC News was inaccurate and unfair to her. The book refers to her politics as “radical Marxism,” quoting Musk’s sister-in-law Christiana Musk, but Wilson said she’s not a Marxist, though she said she does oppose wealth inequality. The book also calls her by her middle name, Jenna. 
Wilson said Isaacson never reached out to her directly ahead of publication. In a phone interview Thursday, Isaacson said he had reached out to Wilson through family members. 
Christiana Musk didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday.
Wilson told NBC News that for years she had considered speaking out about Musk’s behavior as a parent and as a person but that she could no longer remain silent after his comments Monday. 
She said she had never received an explanation for why her father spent so little time with her and her siblings — behavior that she now views as strange. 
“He was there, I want to say, maybe 10% of the time. That’s generous,” she said. “He had half custody, and he fully was not there.” 
“It was just a fact of life at the time, so I don’t think I realized just how abnormal of an experience it was,” she added.
Wilson said she came out twice in life: once as gay in eighth grade and a second time as transgender when she was 16. She said that she doesn’t recall Musk’s response the first time and that she wasn’t present when Musk heard from others that she was transgender, because by then the pandemic had started and she was living full-time with her mother. 
“She’s very supportive. I love her a lot,” Wilson said of her mom.
The pandemic was a chance to escape Musk’s cruelty, she said. 
“When Covid hit, I was like, ‘I’m not going over there,’” she said. “It was basically very lucky timing.” 
Musk told Peterson in the interview that he had been “tricked” into signing documents authorizing transgender-related medical treatment for Wilson — an allegation Wilson said isn’t true. 
“I was essentially tricked into signing documents for one of my older boys,” Musk said, using her birth name.
“This was before I had really any understanding of what was going on, and we had Covid going on,” he said, adding that he was told she might commit suicide.
Wilson said that, in 2020, when she was still a minor at 16, she wanted to start treatment for severe gender dysphoria but needed the consent of both parents under California law. She said that her mother was supportive but that Musk initially wasn’t. She said she texted him about it for a while. 
“I was trying to do this for months, but he said I had to go meet with him in person,” she said. “At that point, it was very clear that we both had a very distinct disdain for each other.” 
When she eventually went and gave him the medical forms, she said, he read them at least twice, once with her and then again on his own, before he signed them. 
“He was not by any means tricked. He knew the full side effects,” she said. 
She said she took puberty blockers before she switched to hormone-replacement therapy — treatments that she said were lifesaving for her and other transgender people. 
“They save lives. Let’s not get that twisted,” she said. “They definitely allowed me to thrive.” 
She said she believed the requirements to obtain such treatments remain onerous, with teenagers pressured to say they’re at extreme risk of self-harm before they’ll be approved. She said she felt judged by Musk and Peterson, in the Monday interview, for not being at a high enough risk in their eyes. 
“I have been basically put into a point where, to a group of people, I have to basically prove whether or not I was suicidal or not to warrant medically transitioning,” she said. “It’s absolutely mind-boggling.” David Ingram is a tech reporter for NBC News."
0,WaPo_107,Elon Musk said his trans child was ‘dead.’ She’s calling him out.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/26/musk-transgender-vivian-grimes/,"Tension between billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk and his estranged, transgender daughter Vivian Wilson spilled into public view this week after she spoke out to counter her father’s claims that she was “killed by the woke mind virus.”In an interview with Jordan Peterson, Musk alleged he had been “tricked” into approving gender-affirming care for Wilson at 16 and had subsequently “lost” his son. The experience, he said, made him an ardent opponent of gender-affirming care and fueled his quest to “destroy the woke mind virus.”On X after the interview, Musk said that his child was born “gay and slightly autistic” and claimed these traits “contribute to gender dysphoria.” Wilson shot back soon after on Threads, dismissing her father’s characterization of her childhood as “entirely fake.” She criticized him for peddling harmful stereotypes about trans and queer people in “an attempt to garner sympathy points.”“He doesn’t know what I was like as a child because he quite simply wasn’t there,” the 20-year-old said in one post. And when her father was present, Wilson said, he “relentlessly harassed” her for her “femininity and queerness.”Washington Post reporters called and texted a phone number for Wilson but did not get a response. Musk did not respond to emailed requests for comment from The Post.The dispute marks a rare public spat between Wilson and Musk, whose frustrations over her transition have been central to his well documented rightward political shift. In recent years, Musk has been embraced by prominent conservatives such as Tucker Carlson, spoken out against corporate diversity initiatives and amplified right-wing commentators on social media.That political shift apparently cemented this month, when Musk endorsed former President Donald Trump in the 2024 election.On X, the social media platform he owns, he has decried gender pronouns with statements that have drawn backlash, even from those close to him.“I absolutely support trans, but all these pronouns are an esthetic nightmare,” Musk wrote in late 2020. In response to a tweet earlier that year where he wrote “Pronouns suck,” he was admonished by his then-partner Grimes, who asked him to stop and said she could not “support hate,” news outlets reported.In the Peterson interview, Musk characterized the gender-affirming treatments that Wilson received, including puberty blockers, as “child mutilation and sterilization.”Musk also told Peterson that permitting children to change their gender identity is “incredibly evil” and that those who advocate for gender-affirming care for young people “should go to prison.”Vivian is one of six children that the billionaire has had with Justine Wilson, a writer. He also has three children with the musician Grimes and three children with Shivon Zilis, an executive at Musk’s Neuralink company.Many states have banned gender-affirming care for transgender minors. A majority of Americans oppose puberty-blocking medications and hormonal treatments for trans children, according to a Washington Post-KFF poll, although the American Psychological Association has said the ability to access such treatments improves the overall well-being of those youths.Puberty blockers prevent the release of sex hormones. Once a patient stops taking blockers, their body immediately returns to producing its natal hormones.Although Musk used the term “sterilization,” doctors who treat trans patients say puberty blockers alone do not cause infertility. Puberty blockers have been used for years on children who experience precocious puberty, and they are “reversible no matter what,” said Marci Bowers, one of the nation’s preeminent gender transition surgeons and the president of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health.But a patient’s outcomes will vary based on when they start on the blockers, whether they take cross-sex hormones and how long they remain on the medication.After the Peterson interview, Musk was criticized for “deadnaming” his child — referring to her by her birth name and gender. Others’ refusal to use pronouns that trans- and gender-expansive youths use is a common, devastating problem for them, according to the Human Rights Campaign, which says that half of those youths say their family “never” refers to them with accurate pronouns.Musk was criticized by LGBTQ+ advocates this year after he said that “cis” and “cisgender” would be treated as slurs on X. Last year, he defended a policy that allowed users to misgender people on the platform as a matter of “free speech.”LBGTQ+ youth are being negatively affected by “hostile political rhetoric that often targets them, including from high-profile figures like Elon Musk,” said Jared Todd, senior press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign.“In a world where Musk could use his public status for good, he chooses to use trans youth as a scapegoat,” Todd said Friday in an emailed statement to The Post. “It’s both sad and unsurprising given his history.”In recent years, Todd said, the HRC has called out Musk for policies that have made X “a place where harmful rhetoric and bullying can spread unchecked.” He cited Musk’s recent decision to move the headquarters of SpaceX and X away from California in protest of a new state law barring school districts from requiring parents to be notified of a child’s change in gender identity.“Musk’s ignorant and inflammatory views on the trans community — even his own daughter — are out-of-step with those of a majority of Americans, and a permanent stain on his character and reputation,” Todd said.Wilson and Musk have been distant for some time, Wilson told NBC on Thursday in her first public interview. She formally severed ties with the billionaire more than two years ago.“I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form,” Wilson stated in a petition filed with California Superior Court in April 2022, when she sought to officially change her name.Wilson’s pushback against her father has garnered support online, including from Grimes, the musician who has children with the Tesla CEO.“I love and am forever endlessly proud of Vivian,” Grimes said Thursday in an X post."
2,NBC_3,Son of 'El Chapo' and Sinaloa Cartel co-founder 'El Mayo' arrested in Texas,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/son-el-chapo-another-sinaloa-cartel-leader-arrested-texas-rcna163757,"The son of jailed Sinaloa Cartel boss Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera and a cartel co-founder who helped lead it for three decades were arrested Thursday in El Paso, Texas, Attorney General Merrick Garland said.
Joaquín Guzmán López and Sinaloa Cartel co-founder Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada García have both been indicted in the U.S., and they face “multiple charges” in connection with the Mexico-based criminal organization, “including its deadly fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking networks,” Garland said in a statement.
The crime kingpin known as ""El Chapo"" was arrested in Mexico and extradited to the U.S. and is serving a sentence of life plus 30 years that was handed down in New York in 2019.
The Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels ""are at the heart"" of the synthetic drug crisis in the U.S., which includes fentanyl and methamphetamine, the Drug Enforcement Administration said in its 2024 National Drug Threat Assessment.
""Fentanyl is the deadliest drug threat our country has ever faced, and the Justice Department will not rest until every single cartel leader, member, and associate responsible for poisoning our communities is held accountable,"" Garland said in the statement.
Another son of ""El Chapo,"" Ovidio Guzmán López, who was also alleged to be a cartel leader, was arrested in Mexico in January 2023 and has been extradited to the U.S. to face drug and money laundering charges. He pleaded not guilty in September.
A federal grand jury indicted Joaquín Guzmán López and Ovidio Guzmán López in 2018 on charges that alleged a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana into the U.S. 
A federal grand jury also indicted Joaquín Guzmán López, Ovidio Guzmán López and two other sons of ""El Chapo"" last year, the Justice Department said at the time.
The two other sons, Iván Guzmán Salazar and Alfredo Guzmán Salazar, have not been apprehended. The four sons are known as the ""Chapitos,"" federal officials said, and they took over their father's drug trafficking networks and his faction of the cartel.
Four criminal organizations make up the Sinaloa Cartel, the DEA says, including ""Los Chapitos,” which was run by the four ""El Chapo"" sons.
The brothers promoted making fentanyl a larger part of the cartel's business, the DEA said in the 2024 report.
""The Sinaloa Cartel has been producing bulk quantities of fentanyl since at least 2012, but the Chapitos faction is responsible for pushing the importance of fentanyl to the cartel’s 'bottom line,'"" the report says. 
Zambada García, known as ""El Mayo,"" co-founded the cartel and was a co-head of the criminal organization for three decades, according to the DEA. He controls one of the four factions making up the cartel.
Zambada García was a partner of ""El Chapo,"" but more recently he has been involved in an internal battle with the ""Chapitos,"" the agency said.
Zambada García has also been charged in the U.S. He was most recently charged in a superseding indictment in February that accuses him of a conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, the Justice Department announced at the time.
There were an estimated 107,543 drug overdose deaths in the U.S. last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most of which — an estimated 74,702 — were from synthetic opioids, which include fentanyl. The second most were from psychostimulants like methamphetamine, with an estimated 36,251 deaths, it said.
The Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels make fentanyl in labs in Mexico and then ship it into the U.S., the DEA said in this year's report.
Both cartels are alleged to have ordered subordinates last year to stop trafficking in fentanyl, and the ""Chapitos"" made a public show about it, but the DEA concluded that ""the ban is probably a public relations stunt.""
""Throughout 2023, fentanyl was seized at the border in equal or higher quantities as in previous years, and no DEA field office reported that fentanyl is less available or more expensive, either of which would point to a decrease in the supply,"" it said.Phil Helsel is a reporter for NBC News."
2,CNN_25,US arrests alleged Sinaloa cartel leader and son of ‘El Chapo’ in Texas sting operation,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/us/sinoloa-cartel-ismael-zambada-custody-report/index.html,"
            An alleged Mexican drug kingpin suspected of flooding the United States with deadly fentanyl and who evaded authorities for decades is in US custody after he was apparently lured across the border by federal agents.
    

            Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, 76, the alleged co-founder and leader of the powerful Sinaloa cartel, was arrested in El Paso, Texas on Thursday, Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.
    

            Another alleged cartel leader, Joaquin Guzman Lopez, 38, was also arrested, he said. Guzman is a son of the cartel’s infamous co-founder and former boss Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, 69, who is serving a life sentence in a US prison after he was convicted five years ago on multiple charges.
    

            Both Zambada and Guzman Lopez face several charges for allegedly leading the cartel’s criminal operations, including its “deadly fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking networks,” Garland said.
    

            “Fentanyl is the deadliest drug threat our country has ever faced, and the Justice Department will not rest until every single cartel leader, member, and associate responsible for poisoning our communities is held accountable,” Garland said.
    

            The sting operation to catch Zambada duped the alleged drug lord into flying to the US under false pretenses, two law enforcement officials familiar with the plot told CNN.
    

            Zambada and Guzman Lopez boarded a plane purportedly en route to inspect a property in Mexico, the sources said, adding that at least one of the men was unaware they were headed to the US.
    

            FBI agents arrested the two alleged drug kingpins after they landed in El Paso.
    

            US authorities had sought Zambada’s capture for years and in 2021 raised the reward for information leading to his arrest to $15 million.
    

            “Ismael Mario Zambada Garcia is the long-time leader of the Zambada Garcia faction of the Sinaloa Cartel.  Zambada Garcia is unique in that he has spent his entire adult life as a major international drug trafficker, yet he has never spent a day in jail,” according to the US State Department.
    

            FBI Director Christopher Wray said Zambada and Guzman Lopez had “eluded law enforcement for decades” and “will now face justice in the United States.”
    

            The pair allegedly oversaw the trafficking of “tens of thousands of pounds of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and fentanyl into the US along with related violence,” Wray added.
    

            Drug Enforcement Administration chief Anne Milgram said the pair’s arrests strike “at the heart of the cartel that is responsible for the majority of drugs, including fentanyl and methamphetamine, killing Americans from coast to coast.”
    

            The Sinaloa Cartel, named after the Mexican state where the gang was formed in the late 1980s, is one of the most powerful criminal groups in the world, raking in billions of dollars annually by trafficking drugs into the US and around the globe.
    

            Notorious cartel boss Guzman, better known as “El Chapo,” was arrested in Guatemala in 1993 on homicide and drug charges and extradited to Mexico. But he escaped Mexican prison in 2001, reportedly by bribing prison guards to smuggle him out in a laundry truck. He was arrested again in 2014, but escaped again, this time through a tunnel.
    

            Guzman was arrested for a third time in 2016 and then extradited to the United States.

            In a major trial, he was convicted by a federal jury in Brooklyn in 2018 and sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years, according to the Justice Department.
    

            Guzman was found guilty on 10 federal criminal counts, which included engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiracy to launder narcotics proceeds, international distribution of cocaine, heroin, and marijuana, and use of firearms.
    

            During the trial, Guzman’s lawyers argued Zambada was the real kingpin of the cartel who bribed the Mexican government to frame Guzman and remain free to run the criminal organization.
    

            In the latest in a string of US indictments against him, Zambada was charged in February with conspiring to manufacture and distribute fentanyl, an extremely potent synthetic opioid that has killed tens of thousands of Americans in an epidemic of overdoses.
    

            Fentanyl “was largely unheard of when [Zambada] founded the Sinaloa Cartel more than three decades ago and today is responsible for immeasurable harm,” said Breon Peace, US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, in the indictment.
    

            Since 1989, Zambada has imported and distributed “massive amounts of narcotics,” generating billions of dollars in profits, according to the indictment.

            Federal prosecutors said he employed people to obtain “transportation routes and warehouses” to import and store narcotics, along with hit men, or sicarios, to carry out kidnappings and murders in Mexico “to retaliate against rivals who threatened the cartel.”
    

            Zambada’s son, Vicente Zambada Niebla, admitted during testimony at Guzman’s 2018 trial to passing along orders for murders and kidnappings and was sentenced to 15 years in 2019 by a federal judge in Chicago.
    

            He began cooperating with the US government in 2011, prosecutors said in a May 2019 filing. They said he aided authorities in helping target members of the Sinaloa Cartel and a rival gang, which lead to the “charging of dozens of high-level targets and hundreds of their associates in indictments throughout the country,” CNN previously reported.
    

            The younger Zambada had known “El Chapo” since he was 15 years old, he testified at the kingpin’s trial in 2018. The younger Zambada frequently referred to “El Chapo” as “mi compadre,” or “my buddy,” during his testimony and said the drug lord was godfather to his youngest son.
    

            “El Mayo” Zambada was also indicted by a US federal grand jury in April 2012, in Texas, along with other suspected top Sinaloa leaders and 22 people allegedly connected with the cartel, including Guzman. They were charged with murder and conspiracy connected with drug trafficking, money laundering and organized crime.
    

            At that point, Guzman and Zambada had already been indicted on drug trafficking and organized crime charges in several US federal courts.
    

            The 2012 indictment in western Texas detailed two acts of violence federal prosecutors said were committed by members of the cartel; one took place during a 2010 wedding ceremony in Ciudad Juarez, when an American citizen and two members of his family were kidnapped because of their ties with the rival Juarez cartel.
    

            The target was the groom and a resident of Columbus, New Mexico, whose body was found to be beaten, strangled and whose hands had been “severed above the wrists and placed on his chest,” according to the indictment.
    

            Police found the bodies of the groom, his brother and his uncle three days after the wedding in the bed of a pickup truck, the indictment stated.
    

            Another incident detailed in the indictment related to the kidnapping, killing and mutilation of a Texas resident in 2009 “to answer for the loss of a 670-pound load of marijuana seized by the Border Patrol,” prosecutors said.

            An alleged Mexican drug kingpin suspected of flooding the United States with deadly fentanyl and who evaded authorities for decades is in US custody after he was apparently lured across the border by federal agents with another alleged leader of his cartel, according to a US law enforcement official briefed on the investigation.
    

            Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, 76, the alleged co-founder and leader of the powerful Sinaloa cartel, was arrested in El Paso, Texas on Thursday, Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.
    

            Another alleged cartel leader, Joaquin Guzman Lopez, 38, was also arrested, he said. Guzman is a son of the cartel’s infamous co-founder and former boss Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, 69, who is serving a life sentence in a US prison after he was convicted five years ago on multiple charges.
    

            Zambada boarded a plane with Guzman Lopez, believing they were inspecting property in Mexico near the US border, the law enforcement official said.
    

            But Zambada didn’t know US investigators had exploited a rift in the Sinaloa cartel and Guzman Lopez was helping with Zambada’s capture, the official said.
    

            The plane instead landed near El Paso and FBI agents arrested both men, in one of the biggest victories for US law enforcement against the cartels.
    

            “Two individuals got off the plane … and were calmly taken into custody,” by federal agents who were waiting, a worker at the Santa Teresa airport near El Paso told Reuters. “It seemed like a pretty calm, arranged thing,” the man, who declined to share his name out of concern for his safety, said.
    

            Both Zambada and Guzman Lopez face several charges for allegedly leading the cartel’s criminal operations, including its “deadly fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking networks,” Garland said.
    

            “Fentanyl is the deadliest drug threat our country has ever faced, and the Justice Department will not rest until every single cartel leader, member, and associate responsible for poisoning our communities is held accountable,” Garland said.

            Notorious cartel boss Guzman, better known as “El Chapo,” was arrested in Guatemala in 1993 on homicide and drug charges and extradited to Mexico. But he escaped Mexican prison in 2001, reportedly by bribing prison guards to smuggle him out in a laundry truck. He was arrested again in 2014, but escaped again, this time through a tunnel.
    

            Guzman was arrested for a third time in 2016 and then extradited to the United States.

            In a major trial, he was convicted by a federal jury in Brooklyn in 2018 and sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years, according to the Justice Department.
    

            Guzman was found guilty on 10 federal criminal counts, which included engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiracy to launder narcotics proceeds, international distribution of cocaine, heroin, and marijuana, and use of firearms.
    

            During the trial, Guzman’s lawyers argued Zambada was the real kingpin of the cartel who bribed the Mexican government to frame Guzman and remain free to run the criminal organization.
    

            In the latest in a string of US indictments against him, Zambada was charged in February with conspiring to manufacture and distribute fentanyl, an extremely potent synthetic opioid that has killed tens of thousands of Americans in an epidemic of overdoses.
    

            Fentanyl “was largely unheard of when [Zambada] founded the Sinaloa Cartel more than three decades ago and today is responsible for immeasurable harm,” said Breon Peace, US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, in the indictment.
    

            Since 1989, Zambada has imported and distributed “massive amounts of narcotics,” generating billions of dollars in profits, according to the indictment.

            Federal prosecutors said he employed people to obtain “transportation routes and warehouses” to import and store narcotics, along with hit men, or sicarios, to carry out kidnappings and murders in Mexico “to retaliate against rivals who threatened the cartel.”
    

            Zambada’s son, Vicente Zambada Niebla, admitted during testimony at Guzman’s 2018 trial to passing along orders for murders and kidnappings and was sentenced to 15 years in 2019 by a federal judge in Chicago.
    

            He began cooperating with the US government in 2011, prosecutors said in a May 2019 filing. They said he aided authorities in helping target members of the Sinaloa Cartel and a rival gang, which lead to the “charging of dozens of high-level targets and hundreds of their associates in indictments throughout the country,” CNN previously reported.
    

            The younger Zambada had known “El Chapo” since he was 15 years old, he testified at the kingpin’s trial in 2018. The younger Zambada frequently referred to “El Chapo” as “mi compadre,” or “my buddy,” during his testimony and said the drug lord was godfather to his youngest son.
    

            “El Mayo” Zambada was also indicted by a US federal grand jury in April 2012, in Texas, along with other suspected top Sinaloa leaders and 22 people allegedly connected with the cartel, including Guzman. They were charged with murder and conspiracy connected with drug trafficking, money laundering and organized crime.
    

            At that point, Guzman and Zambada had already been indicted on drug trafficking and organized crime charges in several US federal courts.
    

            The 2012 indictment in western Texas detailed two acts of violence federal prosecutors said were committed by members of the cartel; one took place during a 2010 wedding ceremony in Ciudad Juarez, when an American citizen and two members of his family were kidnapped because of their ties with the rival Juarez cartel.
    

            The target was the groom and a resident of Columbus, New Mexico, whose body was found to be beaten, strangled and whose hands had been “severed above the wrists and placed on his chest,” according to the indictment.
    

            Police found the bodies of the groom, his brother and his uncle three days after the wedding in the bed of a pickup truck, the indictment stated.
    

            Another incident detailed in the indictment related to the kidnapping, killing and mutilation of a Texas resident in 2009 “to answer for the loss of a 670-pound load of marijuana seized by the Border Patrol,” prosecutors said.

2,WaPo_1,Top Sinaloa cartel leader taken into U.S. custody alongside son of ‘El Chapo’,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/25/mayo-zambada-sinaloa-cartel-arrested/,"MEXICO CITY — A longtime senior leader of the Sinaloa cartel, Ismael Zambada Garcia, or “El Mayo,” and a son of famed drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman were taken into custody Thursday by U.S. authorities in Texas, according to senior Mexican and U.S. officials. It was a major blow to the Sinaloa federation, a global drug-trafficking syndicate that has sent tons of cocaine, heroin, fentanyl and other drugs to the United States.Zambada and the former drug lord’s son, also named Joaquin Guzman, turned themselves in, according to a former U.S. official with knowledge of the detentions.The two men are among the U.S. government’s most-wanted drug traffickers, and the State Department had offered $15 million for information leading to Zambada’s capture.The news of Zambada’s arrest was first reported by the Reuters news agency.Zambada and the senior Guzman were considered co-founders of the Sinaloa cartel. The elder Guzman was arrested in 2016 and convicted of multiple drug charges in the United States. He is serving a life sentence in a Colorado maximum-security prison.Unlike “El Chapo,” known for his girlfriends and flashy lifestyle, Zambada had kept a low profile. He is believed to be in his 70s.The Justice Department confirmed it had “taken into custody” both Zambada and the younger Guzman on Thursday in El Paso.The department said the men “are facing multiple charges in the United States for leading the Cartel’s criminal operations, including its deadly fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking networks.”It did not provide details of how the pair were detained. But U.S. authorities have aggressively targeted the Sinaloa cartel because of its critical role in the production of fentanyl, responsible for tens of thousands of American deaths over the past few years.El Chapo’s son had been under pressure from his family to turn himself in to U.S. authorities, according to a former U.S. official with knowledge of the joint investigation by the DEA and Homeland Security Investigations agents. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the operation.Miroff reported from Washington. Lorena Rios in Monterrey, Mexico, contributed to this report."

Trump is going on offense by painting new presidential campaign rival Harris as the face of a chaotic U.S. border, seizing on an assignment President Joe Biden gave her in 2021 to work with Central American countries to tackle the “root causes” of migration.
Trump labeled the vice president the “border czar” no fewer than six times in a fiery rally speech Thursday in North Carolina, centering his criticism of her on the overwhelmed asylum system. “Under border czar Harris, illegal aliens are pouring in by the millions and millions and millions,” Trump said, drawing jeers from the crowd as he called Harris “crazy.”
The term, which Republicans has used widely to criticize Harris, traces back to March 2021, when Harris was charged with addressing the surge of Central American migrants, who came mostly from the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, where violence and organized crime have driven millions to flee the region. The terms “czar” and “border czar” did not appear in White House materials, but they caught on among critics.
But Harris’ assignment was misunderstood: It was a diplomatic task to devise a regional strategy to mitigate the need for migration, not a security task to oversee domestic border enforcement.
The White House immediately sought to clarify that Harris’ mandate was not “the border” and that it was narrowly focused on the forces driving migrants out of the Northern Triangle. But with a crisis unfolding that was fueled by those migrants, the title stuck.

Rep. Emilia Sykes, a vulnerable Democrat from Ohio and former competitive gymnast, has re-released an ad featuring her beam routine to coincide with the start of the Paris Olympics.
“In elections, you know the routine: The other side will make up lies about me, and they’ll put them on air,” Sykes says in the 30-second spot, which first aired in 2022 and is being backed this time by a five-figure digital advertising buy. “They’re hoping you’ll forget that I worked with both parties to raise pay, keep us safe and cut taxes. And they definitely don’t want you to know that I have a plan to lower costs and keep more money in your pocket.”
“They’ll twist everything to scare you. But the only thing that’ll stick,” Sykes adds, as the camera shows her completing a perfect spin off the beam, “is my landing.”
Sykes, a former state champion gymnast who competed in the Junior Olympics, represents Ohio’s 13th Congressional District, which includes Akron and Canton. In a recent House floor speech, she noted that the district also is the birthplace of three Team USA members: basketball stars LeBron James and Steph Curry and BMX freestyle cyclist Marcus Christopher.
“Her record speaks for itself, and in the Birthplace of Champions voters know she will always put working families first,” Sykes spokesperson Maddie Summers said in a statement. “The Olympics is an opportunity to put politics aside and come together to root for American excellence and this ad is an opportunity to showcase another champion for Northeast Ohio.”
Sykes, who is seeking a second term, faces Republican Kevin Coughlin, a former state lawmaker, in November. She is part of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's Frontline program for members in tough races.

5,FOX_3,Netanyahu to meet Trump as Israeli leader looks to rekindle relationship,https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-to-meet-trump-as-israeli-leader-looks-rekindle-relationship,"Fox News senior strategic analyst Ret. Gen. Jack Keane reacts to Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to joint meeting of Congress on 'Your World.'
JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is slated to meet former President Trump on Friday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in an effort to repair a fractured relationship.
After President Biden defeated Trump in the 2020 presidential election, Netanyahu congratulated President-elect Biden, prompting Trump to call out the Israeli leader and was quoted as saying ""I haven’t spoken to him since,"" according to comments released from an interview with Israeli journalist Barak Ravid. ""F--k him,"" Trump added.
In his tweet, Netanyahu said, ""Congratulations Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Joe, we’ve had a long and warm personal relationship for nearly 40 years, and I know you as a great friend of Israel,"" Netanyahu wrote on Twitter. ""I look forward to working with both of you to further strengthen the special alliance between the US and Israel.""

Netanyahu is now working to repair his relationship with Trump. During his Thursday speech to Congress, the prime minister paid tribute to Trump’s accomplishments in the Middle East.
""I want to thank President Trump for his leadership in brokering the historic Abraham Accords. Like Americans, Israelis were relieved that President Trump emerged safe and sound from that dastardly attack on him, dastardly attack on American democracy. There is no room for political violence in democracies,"" said the Israeli leader.
Trump and his Mideast team brokered the Abraham Accords, a series of diplomatic normalization agreements between Israel and the Sunni Arab countries of the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco.
Netanyahu continued in his speech ""I also want to thank President Trump for all the things he did for Israel, from recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, to confronting Iran’s aggression, to recognizing Jerusalem as our capital and moving the American Embassy there. That’s Jerusalem, our eternal capital never to be divided again.""
Michael Makovsky, president and CEO of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America, told Fox News Digital, ""It’s very important for both men and both the U.S. and Israel that Netanyahu and Trump have a very positive meeting tomorrow, and I’m sure that will be the case. They had a close relationship when Trump was president, but then Trump expressed dissatisfaction with Netanyahu a couple of times. Still, Trump knows the Republican base is very pro-Israel, with the latest example being all the Republican-led standing ovations yesterday during Netanyahu’s speech to Congress.""

""Trump can also pick up some independent or Democratic voters upset about Biden’s shift on Israel this year and the concern over [Vice President] Kamala Harris’ views toward Israel,"" Makovsky said. ""Anyway, Trump is fundamentally pro-Israel. And Netanyahu keenly understands that strong U.S. backing, both in public and private, is pivotal to Israel addressing its many post-10/7 threats in Gaza, Lebanon, Iran, Yemen, etc., and the chances of normalization with Saudi Arabia; and if Trump is re-elected, they need to have close personal ties, which is critical for Trump. In any case, it’s critical for U.S. national security interests for the U.S. to have close ties with Israel.""

The new chapter in Trump-Netanyahu relations looks to already be unfolding, with Trump welcoming the Israeli leader’s recognition of his Mideast diplomatic breakthroughs.
Trump told ""Fox & Friends"" on Thursday that Netanyahu was ""very nice to me yesterday. He mentioned me in the speech very nicely, and I appreciated that he's coming to see me.""
The former president, however, warned the Israeli leader that he needs to put the prosecution of the war against the U.S.-designated terrorist movement Hamas on the fast track: ""I want him to finish up and get it done quickly. You got to get it done quickly because they are getting decimated with this publicity. And, you know, Israel is not very good at public relations.""

Trump also said that Hamas’ mass slaughter of nearly 1,200 people, including more than 30 Americans, on Oct. 7 in southern Israel would not have happened if he had been re-elected in 2020: ""Oct. 7th would have never happened if I was president. There was no chance. Iran was broke, they had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah. It just wouldn't have happened, zero chance.""
Trump said the nine-month war in Gaza to root out Hamas terrorists has lasted too long: ""I'd make sure that it gets over with fast. You have to end this fast. It can't continue to go on like this. It's too long, it's too much. You got to get your hostages back.""
Hamas continues to hold more than 100 hostages in Gaza, including eight Americans.

""This is a very tricky moment for a foreign leader to come to the United States. Asking for meetings with Biden, Harris and Trump was the appropriate way to handle it,"" Richard Goldberg, who served on the National Security Council during the Trump administration, told Fox News Digital.
Goldberg, who is now a senior adviser for the Washington, D.C.-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, continued, ""I think you’d probably see a return to a formula that best promotes security, stability and peace: maximum pressure on Iran and maximum support to Israel.""

15,NBC_16,Sonya Massey autopsy report confirms she died from a gunshot wound to head,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sonya-massey-autopsy-report-released-confirms-died-gunshot-wound-head-rcna163803,"An autopsy report released Friday confirmed that 36-year-old Sonya Massey died from a gunshot wound to the head after being shot by a Sangamon County deputy.
In a six-page document, the Sangamon County Coroner's Office says that Massey was shot beneath her left eye. 
""Based on the information available to me, and on the autopsy findings, it is my opinion that Sonya Massey ... died as a result of a gunshot wound to the head,"" the report states. 
Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Massey's family, said the findings confirm that ""this was just a senseless, unnecessary, excessive use of force."" 
""Completely unnecessary,"" he added. ""Certainly not justified. I mean, how can you justify this?"" 
Massey was shot inside of her Springfield, Illinois, home on July 6 after Sangamon County deputies responded to her 911 call about a possible prowler. 
Body camera video released Monday shows Deputy Sean Grayson and his partner speaking with Massey outside her home. The footage then shows the deputies inside.
Massey is seen in the video walking to her kitchen and taking a pot of boiling water off the stove. Grayson curses at Massey, telling her ""you better f---ing not. I swear to God I will f---ing shoot you right in your f---ing face."" Both deputies then scream at Massey to drop the pot before Grayson opens fire. 
Court records state that Grayson did not render aid after the shooting and discouraged his partner from doing so.
Grayson was fired by the department and indicted on charges of first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct. He pleaded not guilty at his arrangement last week and a judge ordered he remain in custody without bail. 
Sheriff Jack Campbell called Grayson's actions ""unjustifiable"" and ""reckless."" 
""Grayson had other options available that he should have used,"" Campbell said in a statement Monday after the body camera footage was released. ""His actions were inexcusable and do not reflect the values or training of our office. He will now face judgment by the criminal justice system and will never again work in law enforcement.""
Crump had said news of Grayson's firing and arrest was ""a step toward justice for Sonya's loved ones, especially her children, who have endured unimaginable pain and suffering since they were notified of this tragedy.""
An Illinois State Police summary of the shooting says that a car found at Massey's home appeared to have been broken into. The deputies found Massey to be ""distraught and not thinking clearly,"" according to the summary. 
Once inside her home, Grayson motioned to a container on the stove, the summary says. It says that Massey turned off the burner, picked up the pot, carried it to the sink and turned on the faucet. 
Massey asked the deputies what they were doing, according to the summary, and Grayson responded that he was moving away from the boiling water. 
""I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,"" Massey said twice, according to the summary. Grayson then threatened to shoot Massey in the face, it says. 
According to the summary, after Grayson drew his firearm and ordered Massey to drop the pot, she let go of it and ducked below a line of cabinets in the kitchen. 
Court documents state that she put her hands in the air and apologized before ducking. According to the summary, as Grayson approached her, she quickly stood, grabbed the pot and threw steaming hot water on a chair next to the cabinets. Grayson fired three times, striking her once in the face, it says.
Crump said Friday that Massey had struggled with her mental health. Weeks before her death, it was determined that her two children would live with their fathers while she sought help, he said. 
""She needed a helping hand, not a bullet to the face,"" Crump said. ""She just needed those officers to extend an ounce of humanity, not to kill her.""
Her son, Malachi Massey, told reporters that deputies had been to his mother's home on July 5, a day before the shooting. She drove herself to a hospital that day following an incident, he said. Massey said he did not know why deputies responded to the home or what happened before he arrived at his mother's home. 
""The whole week, before all of this happened, I had been trying to get her into a mental health [facility],"" he said.  
Raymond Massey, Sonya's uncle, remembered her as someone who was rarely angered.
""She was a beautiful Black queen,"" he said. ""She was the only family member, me and my wife were talking last night about, I’ve never once seen her angry or mad. She was always full of love and she loved her kids and God.""Minyvonne Burke is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News."
15,WaPo_73,"Sonya Massey killed by gunshot wound to the head, autopsy finds",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/26/sonya-massey-autopsy-killing/,"Sonya Massey, the Black woman who was fatally shot by an Illinois sheriff’s deputy in her home this month, died of a gunshot wound after a bullet went through her head, an autopsy report released Friday found.The Sangamon County Coroner’s Office said the bullet entered under her left eye, perforated a carotid artery and exited out the back of her neck. In addition to the fatal gunshot wound, Massey also had minor blunt force injuries on her right leg, the autopsy found. The results were made public Friday morning, three weeks after Massey’s July 6 killing.The White sheriff’s deputy who shot her in the face, Sean Grayson, 30, was charged with first-degree murder last week. A use-of-force expert with the Illinois State Police, which investigated the shooting, determined that it was not justified, prosecutor Mary Rodgers said in court documents.Massey, 36, was the mother of two teenagers, a son and a daughter. She loved cooking, doing hair and being with her children, according to a GoFundMe page created by her family. She was a slight 112 pounds and was in her nightgown and pajama pants when she was killed, the autopsy report showed.The killing has drawn widespread condemnation, including a large protest Thursday in Manhattan, and grief among Black Americans. More than 1,170 people have been killed by police in the past 12 months, according to a Washington Post database, and Black Americans are killed at more than twice the rate of White Americans.This week, President Biden called on Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a set of reforms named after the 46-year-old Black man killed by Minneapolis police in 2020. It was approved by the Democratic-controlled House in March 2021, but negotiations fizzled out in the Senate. A renewed push to pass it in 2023, after Memphis police killed Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, also failed because of opposition from Republicans.“Sonya’s death at the hands of a responding officer reminds us that all too often Black Americans face fears for their safety in ways many of the rest of us do not,” Biden said in a statement.Massey called 911 from her Springfield, Ill., home on July 6 to report a prowler. When Grayson and another deputy showed up around 12:50 a.m., they inspected the property and interacted with her for nearly 20 minutes.Then, when Grayson saw a pot on the stove, he told her to take it off the burner, body-camera footage released Monday showed. Massey did, taking it to the sink. When Grayson said he was moving into the living room to get away from “hot, steaming water,” she said, “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.”Grayson then drew his gun and pointed it at Massey, threatening to shoot her in the face. She ducked and said “Okay, I’m sorry.” Grayson came toward her, allegedly firing three times.This developing story will be updated."

            Former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential bid in a video released Friday.
    

            “Michelle and I couldn’t be prouder to endorse you and to do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office,” the former president told Harris on a phone call joined by his wife, according to the video.
    

            Harris thanked the Obamas for their support and expressed gratitude for their decadeslong friendship.
    

            “Oh my goodness. Michelle, Barack, this means so much to me. I’m looking forward to doing this with the two of you, Doug and I both. And getting out there, being on the road,” the vice president said.
    

            “But most of all, I just want to tell you the words you have spoken and the friendship that you have given over all these years mean more than I can express, so thank you both. It means so much. And we’re gonna have some fun with this too, aren’t we?” she added.
    

            The former first lady said she is proud of Harris and expects the upcoming election to be historic.
    

            “I can’t have this phone call without saying to my girl, Kamala, I am proud of you. This is going to be historic,” she told Harris.
    

            In a joint statement announcing the endorsement, the Obamas praised Harris and listed her accomplishments.
    

            “But Kamala has more than a resume,” the statement said. “She has the vision, the character, and the strength that this critical moment demands. There is no doubt in our mind that Kamala Harris has exactly what it takes to win this election and deliver for the American people.”
    

            The statement added, “At a time when the stakes have never been higher, she gives us all reason to hope.”
    

            Obama and Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, have been in touch regularly, and he has been serving as a sounding board for her as he has over the 20 years they’ve known each other, a source told CNN earlier this week.
    

            Obama didn’t immediately endorse Harris following President Joe Biden’s announcement on Sunday that he was not seeking reelection.
    

            “I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,” the former president said in a statement at the time.
    

            According to the source, Obama believed it was important for the Democratic Party to have a legitimate process by which delegates would select their new nominee. An Obama adviser told CNN that the former president was taking the same approach as he did during the 2020 Democratic primary, watching closely with the intent of being able to unify the party when a nominee is chosen – whether it was Harris or someone else. Obama’s statement was intended to keep the focus on Biden – his former vice president – on the day he announced he was no longer seeking a second term, the adviser said.
    

            Obama had previously been supportive of Biden’s reelection efforts, attending a handful of fundraisers that raised millions of dollars, along with participating in moderated conversations with Biden and sending messages encouraging supporters to chip in as part of fundraising efforts.
    

            Democrats have been moving quickly in their process to nominate Harris with the party adopting rules Wednesday to choose their presidential nominee. Voting to officially nominate Harris is likely to begin on August 1.
    

            The rules call for ceremonial votes for president and vice president, as well as a vote on the party platform, during the Democratic convention, which is scheduled to take place in Chicago from August 19 to 22. While the ceremonial presidential vote will be conducted as a roll call, the vote for vice president is likely to be a voice vote.
    

            Harris has not yet selected a running mate. As CNN previously reported, a team of lawyers and advisers are conducting one of the most accelerated vice presidential searches in modern American history, with a goal of announcing a nominee before August 7.

34,WaPo_26,Barack and Michelle Obama endorse Kamala Harris for president,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/26/barack-michelle-obama-kamala-harris-endorse/,"Former president Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama endorsed Vice President Harris for president on Friday, becoming the final key leaders in the Democratic Party to unite behind Harris after President Biden abandoned his bid for a second term.A video posted on social media shows the Obamas calling Harris to inform her of their endorsement.“We called to say Michelle and I couldn’t be prouder to endorse you and to do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office,” the former president says to Harris.Michelle Obama adds, “I can’t have this phone call without saying to my girl Kamala: I am proud of you. This is going to be historic.”In a separate statement, the Obamas pledged to “do everything we can” to elect Harris and called on their legions of supporters to join the effort.They praised Harris’s record of accomplishments, listing each of her previous roles in what could be interpreted as a rejoinder to Republicans who have labeled her a “DEI hire” — a reference to “diversity, equity and inclusion” initiatives often used derisively to suggest that Harris only reached the upper echelon of American politics because of her race and gender.“But Kamala has more than a résumé. She has the vision, the character, and the strength that this critical moment demands,” they wrote. “There is no doubt in our mind that Kamala Harris has exactly what it takes to win this election and deliver for the American people. At a time when the stakes have never been higher, she gives us all reason to hope.”Their call with Harris took place on Wednesday. Barack Obama said the Democrats would be “underdogs” but pledged to work hard for her election.“Bottom line is, we are ready to get to work,” he said during the call, according to a transcript. “We are telling everybody to kick off those bedroom slippers and get off the couch and start knocking on doors and making phone calls.”Many Republicans seized on the fact that Obama did not mention or endorse Harris in his initial statement responding to Biden’s abrupt exit from the race Sunday.“We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead,” he said in that statement. “But I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges.”On Thursday, Donald Trump’s campaign seized on Obama’s lack of an endorsement to make the case that Harris’s path to the nomination was not a done deal. Steven Cheung, a campaign spokesman, said Trump would not agree to debate Harris until she was officially the Democratic nominee, suggesting without evidence that Obama and other top Democrats were considering backing a different candidate.“There is a strong sense by many in the Democrat Party — namely Barack Hussein Obama — that Kamala Harris is a Marxist fraud who cannot beat President Trump, and they are still holding out for someone ‘better,’” Cheung said in a statement Thursday evening. “Therefore, it would be inappropriate to schedule things with Harris because Democrats very well could still change their minds.”The Obamas’ endorsement comes after Harris already secured enough pledges from delegates to become the likely nominee. Biden exited the race on Sunday and immediately endorsed Harris, who quickly coalesced much of the Democratic Party behind her bid.Just before Biden dropped out of the race, Obama told allies that the president’s path to victory had greatly diminished and he thought the president needed to seriously consider the viability of his candidacy, according to multiple people briefed on his thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential conversations. In those conversations, Obama emphasized he felt protective over Biden as a friend and was concerned about his legacy."
40,FOX_16,Netanyahu reportedly upset with Harris over VP’s Israel remarks as White House pushes back,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/netanyahu-reportedly-upset-harris-over-vps-israel-remarks-white-house-pushes-back,"Former Trump national security aide John Ullyot joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss VP Kamala Harris' meeting with Israeli PM Netanyahu and why he requested a meeting with former President Trump. 
The White House on Friday is pushing back against reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is upset with Vice President Kamala Harris over her remarks on the war that he believes could jeopardize a hostage and ceasefire deal – with one aide telling Fox News, ""I don’t know what they’re talking about."" 
The reported diplomatic flare-up comes after Netanyahu both met with President Biden and Harris in Washington on Thursday, ahead of his meeting today with former President Trump at Mar-a-Lago. An Israeli official told Axios that Netanyahu was unhappy with Harris mentioning civilian deaths in Gaza and the ""dire humanitarian situation there.""  
The official added that, in their view, Netanyahu was irked with Harris speaking about a hostage and ceasefire deal as a way to end the war outright, when Israel wants to be able to resume fighting after one is implemented. 
""When our enemies see the U.S. and Israel are aligned it increases the chances for a hostage deal and decreases the chances for a regional escalation,"" the Israeli official told Axios. ""When there is such daylight it pushes the deal further away and brings a regional escalation closer. We hope that Harris' public criticism of Israel won't give Hamas the impression that there is daylight between the U.S. and Israel and as a result make it harder to get a deal.""

One Israeli official also said to Axios that ""Harris' statement after the meeting was much more critical than what she told Netanyahu in the meeting."" 
But an aide for Harris told Fox News this morning that ""I don’t know what they’re talking about. 
""President Biden and Vice President Harris delivered the same message in their private meetings to Prime Minister Netanyahu: it’s time to get the ceasefire and hostage deal done. And this is what the Vice President said publicly as well,"" the aide said.

""The public comments tracked with her previous comments on the conflict. She started with underscoring rock-solid support for Israel and then expressed concern about civilian causalities and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, as she always does,"" the aide added. ""The meeting between Prime Minister Netanyahu and Vice President Harris was serious and collegial.""

In her remarks Thursday, Harris said she told Netanyahu that she ""will always ensure that Israel is able to defend itself, including from Iran and Iran-backed militias such as Hamas and Hezbollah."" 
""I also expressed with the Prime Minister my serious concern about the scale of human suffering in Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians. And I made clear my serious concern about the dire humanitarian situation there,"" she continued. 
""It is time for this war to end, and end in a way where Israel is secure, all the hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can exercise their right to freedom, dignity and self-determination,"" Harris also said, adding that ""thanks to the leadership of our president, Joe Biden, there is a deal on the table for a ceasefire and a hostage deal"" and ""as I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done.""

Vice President Kamala Harris publicly pressed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to ""get this deal done"" and agree to a cease-fire to end Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza, but Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, won't say whether she's also pushing terror group Hamas to relent at the negotiating table.
Harris' remarks urging Israel to make a deal, which came after her ""frank and constructive"" meeting with Netanyahu on Thursday, were lambasted by former President Donald Trump in public and, reportedly, by Netanyahu in private.
""I think her remarks were disrespectful,"" Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, told reporters while standing alongside Netanyahu on Friday afternoon. ""They weren't very nice pertaining to Israel. I actually don't know how a person who's Jewish can vote for her, but that's up to them. But she was certainly disrespectful to Israel, in my opinion.""
The current iteration of the proposed deal has two phases, Harris revealed. Phase one calls for a full cease-fire, ""including a withdrawal of the Israeli military from population centers in Gaza."" The second phase would see the Israeli military withdraw from Gaza ""entirely.""
Harris said that there was ""hopeful movement in the talks to secure an agreement on this deal,"" but when asked several times by Fox News Digital whether she is applying the same pressure to Hamas leaders to accept the terms as she is to Netanyahu and Israel, her office did not respond.

            “Israel has a right to defend itself and how it does so matters. What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating,” Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, told reporters in remarks after her meeting with Netanyahu in Washington.
    

            “The images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time. We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and I will not be silent,” she continued.
    

            Harris’ comments provided the clearest explanation yet of her views on the conflict as she works to balance the issue that has not only divided the country but caused friction within the Democratic Party. Harris echoed Biden’s repeated comments about America’s “ironclad support” and “unwavering commitment” to Israel, but she conveyed a forcefulness on ending the war.
    

            Recalling the details of the proposed US-backed ceasefire and hostage deal, Harris said that “it is time for this war to end and end in a way where Israel is secure, all the hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can exercise their right to freedom, dignity and self-determination.”

60,FOX_37,"Fox News Poll: Trump hits 50% in Wisconsin, edges Harris by just 1 point",https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-trump-hits-50-wisconsin-edges-harris-just-1-point,"Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., joins 'America Reports' to discuss Kamala Harris' position on Israel, arguing she hasn't demonstrated 'clear moral authority' to deal with the unrest in the Middle East.
At this same point in the election cycle four years ago, Joe Biden was ahead of Donald Trump by 9 percentage points among Wisconsin voters in a two-way presidential matchup. Now, just days after the Republican National Convention ended in Milwaukee, a new Fox News survey shows Wisconsinites give the advantage to Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris -- by 1 point. 
Harris receives 49% support to Trump’s 50%. In April, it was 48% each for Biden and Trump, and it was also tied in January (47% apiece).  In June 2020, Biden was at 49% to Trump’s 40%.
Trump’s edge is mainly due to an expanded 14-point lead among men, up from an 8-point lead over Biden in April. He is also favored over Harris among White men without a college degree (by 20 points), rural voters (+15), and White voters (+2).
Harris receives a bit more support among Democrats (96%) than Trump gets among Republicans (93%), but he makes up the difference by having a 4-point advantage among Independents. 
HARRIS' SHIFT FROM TOUGH-ON-CRIME PROSECUTOR TO SOCIAL JUSTICE ADVOCATE FACES SCRUTINY FROM CONSERVATIVE GROUP
Some of Harris’ best groups include urban voters (+19 over Trump), Whites with a college degree (+18), and suburban women (+13). Her numbers roughly match or are a bit higher than Biden’s were in April among Whites without a college degree (+5), Independents (+5), voters under 35 (+4), women (+3), Democrats (+1), Whites (+1), and those ages 65 and over (-1).
The biggest shift is among ""double haters"" (voters with unfavorable views of both Trump and Biden). Trump was ahead by 1 point in April, but they now favor Harris by 25 points. There are too few Harris-Trump double haters to breakout by vote preference.

Trump is favored by 3 points among new voters (haven’t voted in four most recent general elections), and union households go for him by 2 points, which is different from what we see in a couple of other northern industrial states. Union voters prefer Harris by 6 points in Michigan and by 15 points in Minnesota. 
Biden’s personal favorable rating was negative by 10 points in April and now he’s underwater by 12.  It’s the reverse for Trump, who went from being underwater by 10 points to negative 5 in the new survey. Harris is more popular than both at 49% favorable and 49% unfavorable. JD Vance’s favorability is negative by 7 points, while 15% are unable to rate him. 
TRUMP TO RETURN TO PENNSYLVANIA FOR FIRST TIME SINCE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT
Fifteen percent of Wisconsin voters say they are getting ahead financially, up from 11% six months ago. Still, most continue to feel they are holding steady (41%) or falling behind (43%). 
By far, the economy will be the deciding issue this fall.  It’s the top priority for 37%, trailed by abortion and immigration at 15% each. All other issues are in the single digits.
Majorities of those prioritizing the economy and immigration back Trump (by 38 and 81 points respectively), while those putting abortion as their top issue prefer Harris by 78 points.
""This poll shows Harris in a slightly stronger position in Wisconsin than Biden based on personal favorability,"" says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, whose company Beacon Research conducts Fox News surveys along with Republican Daron Shaw.  ""However, with many voters feeling strained financially and union households breaking for Trump, she has work to do convincing voters they’ll be better off continuing with a Democrat in the White House.""
In a potential 5-way race, Harris and Trump tie at 46% each, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. receiving 5%, and Jill Stein and Cornel West at 1% each.  Support for Kennedy was 9% in April.
Kennedy takes more support from Trump (6%) than Harris (2%), but it evens out because the other candidates also take from her (3%).
The large 75% approval of Biden withdrawing from the presidential race is widespread, as it includes 88% of Democrats and two-thirds of Republicans (65%) and Independents (69%).

That consensus disappears on the issue of Biden finishing his term: 92% of Democrats and 58% Independents think he should, while 57% of Republicans think he should resign.  Overall, two-thirds think he should stick around. 
In 2020, Biden won Wisconsin by 20,682 votes, less than one percentage point. Trump’s 2016 victory was also by less than a point (22,748 votes). 
Poll-pourri
In the senate race, Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin leads likely Republican challenger Eric Hovde by a 54-43% margin, running 5 points ahead of Harris’ support in the presidential race. (The Wisconsin primary is August 13.)
More Trump supporters are ticket splitters, as 83% of his backers favor Hovde, while 96% of Harris supporters go for Baldwin.

Overall, three-quarters of Wisconsin voters say they are extremely motivated to vote in the presidential election, and they split 50% Harris vs. 49% Trump. That’s because slightly more Harris supporters (76%) than Trump supporters (73%) say they are extremely motivated.

A Democrat has won the presidential race in Minnesota every cycle since 1976 and Vice President Kamala Harris is favorably positioned to extend this streak in 2024, as she currently has a 6-point advantage over former President Donald Trump in a Fox News survey released Friday.
A majority of voters support Harris in a head-to-head matchup against Trump, 52% to 46%, nearly matching the 2020 vote (52.40% Biden, 45.28% Trump). These results sit right at the margin of sampling error.
The survey was completed after the July 13 assassination attempt on Trump and Biden’s July 21 withdrawal announcement and endorsement of Harris.
Harris is bolstered by strong support from urban voters (65%), suburban women (63%), White voters with a college degree (60%), women (58%), voters ages 65 and over (58%), union households (57%), and Independents (53%).
JOE BIDEN'S HEALTH: LEADERSHIP ABILITY QUESTIONS MOUNT AS OVAL OFFICE SPEECH GAVE NO REASON FOR EXITING RACE
Trump’s coalition consists of White evangelical Christians (69%), White men with no college degree (59%), rural voters (56%), men under age 45 (54%), and voters under age 30 (52%).
Harris has stronger ideological (93% of liberal voters back her) and party support (95% of Democrats) than Trump (81% of conservatives and 93% of Republicans).
Nearly 7 in 10 Minnesotans are extremely motivated to vote this November and they go for Harris by 7 points.
The vice president also does better than other potential Biden replacements in hypothetical matchups against Trump:  Gretchen Whitmer 49% vs. Trump 46%, and Josh Shapiro 49% vs. Trump 45%.
In the expanded ballot, Harris drops below 50% support, but Trump suffers more:  Harris 47%, Trump 41%, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 7%, and Jill Stein and Cornel West at 1% each. Slightly more two-way Trump supporters defect to third parties (10%) than Harris supporters (7%).
Kennedy is currently the only third-party candidate on the ballot in Minnesota. 
Harris’ personal favorable rating is higher than Biden’s by 9 points. She also receives a net positive rating of 4 points (51% favorable vs. 47% unfavorable) versus a negative rating by 14 points for Biden (42-56%). 
Still, neither is as high as Amy Klobuchar, the senior U.S. Democratic Senator from Minnesota, who checks in at 57% favorable vs. 38% unfavorable. Other possible replacements for Biden are in positive territory but are much less well known in Minnesota:  Whitmer (39% favorable, 33% unfavorable, 28% can’t rate) and Shapiro (33% favorable, 27% unfavorable, 40% can’t rate).  
The president’s job performance rating is higher than his personal favorability rating:  46% approve while 53% disapprove.

Biden’s decision to withdraw from the presidential race is met with high approval (83%). More Democrats (90%) approve than Independents (83%) or Republicans (76%). 
While majorities approve of the decision to withdraw, by more than 2 to 1 voters still think he should finish his term: 68% finish vs. 30% resign.
Trump’s favorable rating is underwater by 13 points (43% favorable, 56% unfavorable) while his vice-presidential running mate JD Vance is underwater by 8 points and lesser known (37% favorable, 45% unfavorable, 18% can’t rate).
TAKE IT FROM ME, REPUBLICANS: KAMALA HARRIS IS A STRONG CANDIDATE. DON'T UNDERESTIMATE HER
""Minnesota is a tough nut for the Republicans, and Harris is a better fit in Minnesota than Biden,"" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Democrat Chris Anderson. ""But the contest is clearly competitive there and that’s indicative of a race in which Trump still has more pathways to victory than Harris.""
Trump and Vance are set to campaign in St. Cloud, Minnesota, on Saturday.
The top issue for Minnesota voters when it comes to their vote this fall is the economy at 33%, with more than twice as many saying they are falling behind financially (43%) as say they are getting ahead (17%). Four in 10 say they are holding steady (39%).
Immigration (16%) and abortion (15%) follow the economy as the second and third most important issues. All other issues tested are in the single digits. The top issue for Democrats is abortion (24%) while for Republicans (44%) and Independents (39%) it is the economy.
Overall, those who point to the economy as the most important issue back Trump by 33 points, while immigration voters support him by an even greater 83 points. Those who say abortion is their top issue favor Harris by 63 points.
""The prospect of Republicans bringing Minnesota into play this fall appears less likely with Harris at the top of the ticket,"" says Anderson. ""She is viewed favorably by a narrow majority, while larger majorities are unfavorable toward both Trump and Biden. The choice is no longer between a lesser of two evils for some voters.""
Although Harris’ nomination is not official, she’s the top choice among Minnesota registered voters to replace Biden, with 48% supporting her as the nominee, including 76% of Democrats and 40% of Independents. The second choice of both Democrats (8%) and Independents (16%) is Klobuchar.

78,CNN_87,"California’s Park Fire 0% contained as more than a thousand battle 178,000 acre blaze",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/us/california-park-fire-oregon-durkee-jasper/index.html,"
Hot and dry weather is fueling wildfire activity in the Western United States and Canada, with fires damaging homes, causing injuries and forcing evacuations. The largest active wildfire in the US has scorched more than 280,000 acres in eastern Oregon and another blaze has exploded to more than 178,000 acres in California. Here’s the latest:


            • Park Fire roars across Butte County, California: As of Friday afternoon, the Park Fire has burned more than 178,000 acres, as more than 1,600 firefighters work to slow its progress. Cal Fire reported the blaze was 0% contained Friday, with 134 structures destroyed and another 4,200 threatened. The fires has forced road closures and mandatory evacuations in Butte County, where the state’s deadliest wildfire, the Camp Fire, killed more than 85 people and destroyed thousands of homes in 2018. Conditions around the Park Fire continue to be difficult for the firefighters battling the flames as dry air, warm temperatures and gusty winds linger over the area Thursday. The area remains under a red flag warning until Friday evening.
    

            • Three firefighters injured and structures damaged: Three firefighters had minor heat-related injuries on Wednesday while fighting the Park Fire, Cal Fire Captain Dan Collins told CNN Thursday. They were treated and released, he said. Officials know structures have been damaged or destroyed by the fire, but there is no official count yet, Collins said.
    

• Man accused of starting California wildfire is arrested: A suspect has been arrested on suspicion of pushing a burning car 60 feet into a gully, “spreading flames” that caused what’s now become California’s largest wildfire of the year, authorities said. The Park Fire in the Butte County area has quickly burned an area larger than the city of Atlanta.
    

            • Firefighters battle massive Oregon fire: The Durkee Fire, which has burned more than 288,000 acres and is 20% contained as of Friday afternoon, started on July 17 near the Oregon-Idaho state line. The lightning-sparked fire is the largest of 34 large wildfires currently burning across Oregon, which has been the hardest hit by fires in recent days. More than 500 firefighters and resources from 22 states are working to fight the fire, according to InciWeb. Over the weekend and earlier this week, the Durkee Fire exhibited extreme fire behavior, even creating its own weather in the form of pyrocumulus clouds.
    

            • Oregon wildfire destroys buildings: Three people were injured and two homes and 12 other structures were destroyed as the fire spread, according to the Oregon Department of Emergency Management. Evacuations are still in effect in Baker County for areas around the Durkee Fire. Some communities do not have power, according to Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, who has deployed resources from the National Guard to assist. Dense smoke from the flames has also impeded traffic on Interstate 84, leading to periodic closure of the freeway. Wildfire smoke was spreading into Boise and beyond. Air quality alerts have been issued for parts of Colorado, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.
    

            • Wildfire engulfs tourist town in Canada: A fast-moving wildfire sent thousands of visitors and residents fleeing the town of Jasper in Alberta, where flames devastated up to half of the town’s structures. Officials say the losses are significant, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has deployed federal support to help battle the blaze. Cool temperatures and rain are expected to keep fire behavior low for the next 72 hours, which will help crews fight the blaze, Jasper National Park said on Facebook Thursday night.
    

            • Fire-conducive weather continues in Western US: Triple-digit heat and dry conditions across the West this week have made conditions poor for firefighters actively fighting to contain the 89 large wildfires burning nationwide. “Many wildfires in the Northwest area continue to exhibit active to extreme fire behavior, with evacuation orders in effect on 17 wildfires. Several teams are managing multiple fire starts as complexes. Evacuation orders are also in effect for several fires in California, the Northern Rockies and the Great Basin,” the National Interagency Fire Center said. Conditions will begin to improve for much of the West over the weekend as cooler temperatures and higher humidity levels arrive in the area.
    

            Some families have found themselves displaced as the Park Fire raged near Chico, a city in northern California, burning homes and forcing evacuations.
    

            A former news anchor told CNN affiliate KOVR she watched her Butte County house burn down live through security camera footage.
    

            “There is no rhyme or reason. Our house is gone, their house is okay. The house next to it, you can see it’s gone,” Julia Yarbough said.
    

            Looking at the remnants of her home, Yarbough said she felt numb.
    

            “It’s surreal,” she said. “It probably won’t hit me till later, I’m pretty sure.”
    

            Triple-digit temperatures and high wind gusts have fueled the explosive growth of the Park Fire amid an active fire season in California. An estimated 343,253 acres have burned across the state so far in 2024, compared to 22,439 acres burned by this time last year, according to Cal Fire.
    

            A 42-year-old man, identified as Ronnie Dean Stout II, has been arrested after being accused of igniting the inferno.
    

            Witnesses reported seeing someone “pushing a car that was on fire into a gully near the Alligator Hole in upper Bidwell Park shortly before 3:00 p.m. yesterday,” Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said Thursday. “The car went down an embankment approximately 60 feet and burned completely, spreading flames that caused the Park Fire.”
    

            The DA says the man was seen “calmly leaving the area by blending in with the other citizens who were in the area and fleeing the rapidly evolving fire.” Stout was later arrested at a mobile home park in Chico, Ramsey said.
    

            Stout will likely face an arson charge, though it is unclear what count, or whether any enhancements will be added, Ramsey said. The DA’s office told CNN Stout has not retained an attorney and will be assigned a public defender at his arraignment.
    

            He was previously convicted of second degree robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and drug paraphernalia possession in Kern County, according to criminal records. He was sentenced to 21 years in prison. He was released on parole in 2018, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation confirmed to CNN.
    

            He was also convicted of lewd or lascivious acts on a child under 14 in Butte County, records show.
    

            In Jasper, a popular tourist town in Alberta, 25,000 residents and visitors were forced to evacuate from a fast-moving blaze that has damaged 30 to 50% of the town’s structures, officials said during a news conference Thursday.
    

            “Homes and businesses have been lost to a wildfire that people are calling a ‘wall of flames,’” Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said.
    

            An “enormous wind gust” moved the wildfire roughly about 3 miles in “probably less than 30 minutes,” Alberta Minister of Public Safety & Emergency Services Mike Ellis said during the press conference. This created “a wall of fire that was about 100 meters high.”
    

            “Any firefighter will tell you there is little to nothing you can do when you have a wall of flames coming at you like that. Nobody anticipated that fire to come so fast, so large,” Ellis said.
    

            Two wildfires converged in the Jasper National Park area, becoming what authorities are referring to as the Jasper Wildfire Complex. It remains difficult to measure exactly how big the complex – which also includes a third nearby fire – is due to extreme fire behavior and thick smoke cover. Together, the fires have swallowed an estimated 89,000 acres, the Jasper National Park said.
    

            Damage wrought by the flames will result in “a significant rebuild and significant displacement,” Smith said. The most significant structural damage lies on the west side of town, according to a Facebook post from Jasper National Park.

            “We will recover from this,” Smith said while holding back tears. “To those in Alberta and around the world who have experienced the magic of Jasper, the magic is not lost, and it never will be.”
    

            The vast majority of evacuees were “visitors with other places to return to,” Ellis said. Along with about 5,000 residents who live in the town, 2.48 million people visited Jasper National Park last year.
    

            Jasper Mayor Richard Ireland said residents will work together to rebuild after the wildfire “ravaged our beloved community.”
    

            “Your resilience and strength have always been the backbone of our community. In the coming days and weeks, we will rally together, support one another, and begin the daunting process of recovery,” Ireland said in a statement on Thursday.
    

            Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said all federal agencies are working together to provide resources to Jasper, support evacuations and strengthen response efforts on the ground.
    

            “Our governments are working together to keep Albertans safe and supported through this,” he said on Facebook.

78,WaPo_63,"164,000-acre Park Fire was started by flaming car, Calif. officials say",https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/26/park-fire-california-chico-arrest/,"Northern California’s massive Park Fire continued to grow overnight, fueled by wind and dry, hot weather. The wildfire, which authorities believe was an act of arson, reached more than 164,282 acres by early Friday and was only 3 percent contained. It is California’s largest this year.Butte County fire chief Garrett Sjolund told a news conference Thursday that the fire “quickly began to outpace our resources because of the dry fuels, the hot weather, the low humidity, and the wind.” Gusty winds and dry conditions were predicted for the region until at least late Friday, with a National Weather Service Red Flag warning for critical fire weather conditions in effect.The fire started about 3 p.m. Wednesday and “exploded from a 400-acre fire to a more than 71,000-acre inferno consuming everything in its path” overnight into Thursday, Cal Fire said on social media. By late Thursday it was burning across more than 145,000 acres in Butte and Tahoma counties and had produced several fire tornadoes.About 4,400 residents were under evacuation orders, including the communities of Cohasset and Forest Ranch and areas in northeast Chico, authorities said. There had been two minor injuries, and photos showed multiple homes damaged or destroyed.District Attorney Michael L. Ramsey said Chico resident Ronnie Stout, 42, would be arraigned Monday on to-be-determined charges related to arson. Investigators allege a witness saw him pushing a flaming car off an embankment in upper Bidwell Park, starting the blaze.“She saw him get into the vehicle, do something in the vehicle, get out of the vehicle, and then push the flaming vehicle down the embankment,” Ramsey told reporters. “ We are here today because of that.” He said the vehicle was Stout’s mother’s car.Stout was arrested early Thursday on a no-bail warrant, Ramsey said.Butte County has repeatedly been ravaged by deadly and destructive wildfires. The Camp Fire nearly incinerated the town of Paradise in 2018, killing 85 people. On Friday, residents of Paradise were on edge after authorities told them to prepare to evacuate, because of the nearby Park Fire.In 2021, the Dixie Fire, which was sparked by PG&E power lines, devastated the town of Greenville and ended up burning nearly 1 million acres, the second-largest fire in state history. Earlier this month, the Thompson Fire near Oroville destroyed or damaged dozens of structures, and burned more than 3,700 acres before fire crews contained it.So far this year, 4,367 fires have erupted in California, burning 343,253 acres. These ignitions have come from a mix of causes — including lightning and arson. Scientists say that climate change is a driving force in making wildfires more explosive in California, and around the world."

    Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.


            Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged Hong Kong to prevent Russia from using the Asian financial hub to bypass Western sanctions during a visit to the city on Thursday.
    

            The United States and European Union have sanctioned dozens of companies in Hong Kong and mainland China for evading the extensive measures imposed on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine, including the supply of critical dual‑use goods such as semiconductors.
    

            Kuleba “called on the Hong Kong administration to take measures to prevent Russia and Russian companies from using Hong Kong to circumvent the restrictive measures imposed for Russia’s aggression against Ukraine,” according to a statement from Ukraine’s Foreign Affairs Ministry issued after the minister met with Hong Kong leader John Lee.
    

            “These restrictive measures are necessary to weaken Russia’s capacity to wage war and kill people in Ukraine,” it added. “The Minister stressed that Russia’s machinations should not spoil Hong Kong’s reputation as a highly developed liberal economy based on unwavering respect for the rule of law.”
    

            Dual-use items are goods, software or technology that can be used for both civilian and military applications. The US has said that some of the dual-use items targeted by its sanctions are critical to Russia’s defense-industrial base.
    

            In a statement, a spokesperson for the Hong Kong government told CNN on Friday that it “implements and strictly enforces” United Nations Security Council (UNSC) sanctions.
    

            While the UN General Assembly has passed resolutions condemning Russia’s invasion and demanding the withdrawal of its troops from Ukraine, similar resolutions at the UNSC have been vetoed by Russia, a permanent member of the group.

            Hong Kong officials have previously said the city has no obligation to implement unilateral sanctions imposed by other countries – including when a mega yacht linked to a Russian oligarch sanctioned by the US, the EU and the United Kingdom dropped anchor in the city in October 2022.


            However, international companies based in Hong Kong, including Chinese banks, have generally adhered to US sanctions to avoid any risk of being frozen out of the dollar dominated global financial system.
    

            Kuleba’s visit to Hong Kong was the final leg of his trip to China, the first time the close partner of Russia has hosted a top Ukrainian official since Moscow’s invasion began nearly two and half years ago.
    

            Beijing, which has forged deeper ties with Russia since the invasion and become a vital economic and diplomatic lifeline for Moscow, has repeatedly decried “unilateral sanctions” and what it calls “long-arm jurisdiction” by Western countries, saying they have no basis in international law.
    

            In a meeting in the southern city of Guangzhou on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Ukrainian counterpart that, “although the conditions and timing are not yet ready,” China was “willing to continue to play a constructive role in ceasefire and resumption of peace talks.”
    

            Kuleba told Wang that Ukraine was prepared for peace talks “when Russia is ready to negotiate in good faith,” according to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, but stressed that Kyiv saw no such willingness from Moscow.
    

            The Ukrainian diplomat’s visit comes as Beijing faces increasing pressure from the West over its deepening ties to Russia and allegations that it’s aiding Moscow’s war effort by providing dual-use goods. Beijing denies this and says the West is fueling the conflict by supplying arms for Ukraine’s defense.

84,CNN_41,French rail lines disrupted by ‘coordinated sabotage’ ahead of Paris Olympics opening ceremony,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/europe/france-rail-network-disruption-paris-olympics-intl-hnk/index.html,"
            France’s high-speed train lines were targeted by multiple “malicious” acts including arson on Friday, in what has been described as “an attack on France” and “coordinated sabotage” to disrupt travel ahead of the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics.
    

            The French state railway company SNCF called the overnight disruption a “massive attack aimed at paralyzing the high-speed line network.”
    

            In a post on X, SNCF said that “a large number of trains were diverted or canceled,” and asked “all travelers who can to postpone their trip and not go to the station.”
    

            The operator said the Atlantic, Northern and Eastern high-speed lines were impacted, with damage caused to several of its facilities, adding that one of the acts was “foiled” in the east after SNCF agents scared off several individuals.
    

            SNCF CEO Jean-Pierre Farandou told journalists on Friday that cables – which are there to ensure the security of train drivers – were set on fire and taken apart but that authorities “don’t know who is behind it.”
    

            An intelligence source told CNN that French intelligence services are “fully mobilized” to find those responsible. The source added that “these methods have been used by the far-left in the past” but “there is no evidence to tie today’s actions to them.”
    

            Travel on the affected lines is “very disrupted,” with the railway network needing to divert and cancel a large number of trains, SNCF said. Disruptions – which it estimates could impact around 250,000 travelers today – were expected throughout the weekend, affecting 800,000 passengers, as work crews oversee repairs, it added.

            Passengers milled around outside Paris’ Gare du Nord train station and sat with their luggage on staircases as the disruption laid waste to their travel plans. Francoise, an 80-year-old from La Rochelle, is trying to get home and back to her nurse after medical treatment in Paris. She told CNN she is preparing to wait another five hours in the forlorn hope of catching a train. “We didn’t need a day like this!” she said.
    

            Meanwhile, Raphaël, a SNCF user who has been waiting for his train at Montparnasse Station in the capital since 6 a.m. local time, told CNN affiliate BFMTV that “people are a little exasperated.”
    

            The Rémi Train Centre Val de Loire said travel on its railway lines would be disrupted until at least Monday, with a fire near the tracks in Courtalain, northern France impacting services to Paris.
    

            Farandou explained that they have to pull the damaged cables back together one by one, reconnect and test them. “It’s a question of security,” he said. “We have to make sure we test them so when trains are back up and running, they are safe.”
    

            Brittany, a region in the northwest France, and the north of the country are the most impacted areas, SNCF said, though some trains have started running again, notably in eastern France. There would be no trains from Paris’ Gare Montparnasse, however, until at least 1 p.m. local time, Christophe Fanichet – the CEO of SNCF Voyageurs – told reporters.
    

            Eurostar, the high-speed train service that connects the United Kingdom with France, has been forced to cancel and divert trains due to the “coordinated acts of malice,” on French lines.
    

            In a statement to CNN, Eurostar said that the incidents have impacted travel between Paris and Lille, forcing the train network to cancel and divert journeys, and extend travel times.
    

            These incidents come just hours before the Olympic torch relay concludes and the opening ceremony begins, with more than 320,000 spectators expected to attend along the River Seine. The opening ceremony will go ahead as planned, a Paris 2024 spokesperson told CNN, and organizers have “no concerns from their side in light of the overnight events on the train network.”
    

            The French Minister of Sports and the Olympic and Paralympic Games, Amélie Oudéa-Castera said the disruption to the train lines are “a sort of coordinated sabotage.”
    

            Speaking BFMTV, Oudéa-Castera condemned the attacks in the “strongest possible terms,” and said it is “truly appalling.”
    

            “We will assess the impacts on travelers, athletes, and ensure the proper transport of all delegations to the competition sites,” she said.
    

            Other French officials echoed her description of the attacks being intentional. Outgoing French transport minister Patrice Vergriete and Valerie Pecresse, head of the Île-de-France region, in which Paris lies, said on Friday that “all elements” pointed towards it being a “deliberate attack.” Vergriete added those elements were “the coincidental timing, the vans found after the people had fled (and) the arson materials found on location.”

The Olympic Games face a unique set of potential security threats in Paris. Organizers say everyone will be safe


            Outgoing French prime minister Gabriel Attal said in a post on X that the consequences are “massive and serious” while SNCF called the disruption an “attack on France.”
    

            In response to the attacks, Paris police chief Laurent Nunez said Friday that police are stepping up security and focusing manpower on the capital’s train stations.
    

            Security in Paris had already been bolstered in recent weeks.
    

            France plans to deploy around 35,000 police each day during the Games, peaking at 45,000 for the opening ceremony, a spokesperson at the French interior ministry previously told CNN. In addition, 10,000 soldiers will be deployed in the Paris region – an effort supported by 1,800 police officers from around the world, they added.
    

            Nicolas Nordman, Deputy Paris Mayor in charge of security, recently told CNN that authorities had been working for months to try to anticipate what might happen and were confident the ceremony would be safe.
    

            The cause of the disruptions is currently unclear. But there has been growing domestic unrest, powered in part by recent national elections that saw a battle between the left and far-right.
    

            Interior Minister Darmanin confirmed security forces had detained a “member of the extreme-right” this week who was “suspected of wanting to commit violent action during the Olympic Games.” According to Darmanin, the man had an “intention to intervene during a phase of the torch relay.”

99,CNN_46,The USWNT kicks off in France as a team in transition – and one that’s looking to make a point,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/sport/uswnt-team-in-transition/index.html,"
            As the US Women’s National Team made attack after attack last week in Washington, DC, the final pass was just a little bit off the mark or the decisive shot was just fired a few inches wide.
    

The USWNT’s scoreless draw against Costa Rica in their final game before heading to France for the 2024 Summer Games was as frustrating as the nation’s capital was hot that night with the thermometer reading 97 degrees at kickoff. But it also made for a neat encapsulation of the task ahead of head coach Emma Hayes and her squad during these Paris Games.


            The old reliable stars of the team’s golden generation are largely gone. And this will be the competition where new ones will have to be made – or a streak of disappointing major tournaments will go on for another frustrating few years.
    

            “We want to make this environment comfortable, but also know, you know, what the standard is – you’re here for a reason,” said Lindsey Horan, the midfielder who serves as the team’s captain. “Any new player coming in, that means you’re one of the best in the country and you have every right to be here. So, the nerves and all those things, they’re normal. That means this means something and you’re playing on one of the best teams in the world. And we want to get back to being the best in the world.”
    

            “So, we need those players. And like I said before, we have a lot of new players and new players that make up you know, the starting spots on this roster so we’re gonna need them to be great, be confident, and you know, everyone that’s come in so far – new players, young players, too – the confidence is outstanding.”
    

            For young stars like Sophia Smith and Trinity Rodman entering their first Olympics, and four other players playing in their first major tournament for the US national team, it’s the first major test in what they hope will be a long career in the red, white and blue. Other veterans like Rose Lavelle and Alyssa Naeher will be looking to redeem themselves from disappointing showings in Tokyo and Australia and New Zealand, where the US suffered its earliest-ever defeat in the World Cup.
    

            The USWNT defeated Zambia 3-0 in their first game Thursday in Nice, France.
    

            When she set the roster, Hayes acknowledged the surprising decision to not bring Alex Morgan to France, picking players who she felt adapt to her style and could play in the tight turnarounds that Olympic competition requires.
    

            It was arguably Hayes’ first tough decision as the manager of the women’s team after coming on board in late 2023 following a successful decade-plus at Chelsea FC in London. She told reporters after the Costa Rica game that at that point she’d only had about a half-dozen training sessions with her team, leaving her not much time to build the kind of relationships that major competition victories are built on.
    

            Even still, she is finding it easier than anticipated to get her team to come together.
    

            “I’ve only had a half a dozen sessions and four games. No problem, like, I’ll make the most of those” she said. “And in the sessions we have leading into the Olympics will add another layer to prepare us for the opening game in Zambia, when we have to be patient. There’s a lot of young, inexperienced players that are still learning at this level. And yes, it’s a new era. Yes, we want to win. But we have to understand the steps to take to do that.”
    

            For first-time Olympians like defender Sam Coffey, that patience is key.
    

            While Coffey says she intends to enjoy her Olympic experience and live in the moment as much as possible, the 25-year-old added she and other players stepping onto this stage for the first time are going to be doing a lot of learning.
    

            While that learning is part of the path to success, it can be a difficult position to be in when so much is expected quickly of the US women’s national team.
    

            “This is a new group, there’s a new energy, there’s a new philosophy, culture, I think we’re learning a lot as we go. And in some ways, we need to have patience with ourselves as we do that. It’s not going to be linear,” she said, adding, “But I again, I think – I hope it’s evident in the way that we’re playing and the difference in the style of play.”
    

            While the team has been gelling – Hayes and multiple players described good vibes being prominent in the locker room as the trip to France will likely be an intense period of bonding for the veterans and younger players.
    

            “We’re in our little bubble so traveling to new places is difficult because you don’t have that much free time,” forward Trinity Rodman said when asked what she was looking forward to at her first Olympics. “So, I would just say, having family members and friends there to support us through everything. being far away from home. I think the togetherness is great.”
    

            That group mentality is key to Hayes’ preparation for the rigors of tournament play.
    

            “We do a lot internally in terms of, you know, getting them to focus on the things that happen in our environment,” Hayes said.
    

            She nodded at the pressure that comes with being a part of one of the most successful women’s soccer teams of all time, saying, “We can’t control the keyboard warriors. And for us, you know, we have to realize the privilege to play for USA at the Olympics. Not only is it, you know, the greatest honor for these players, but one that we did not want to waste and we certainly don’t want to waste that with, you know, remarks and comments that are happening away from us that – people are entitled to – but we should just focus on ourselves and look after each other.”
    

            It’ll be up to players like Mallory Swanson, who’s playing in her second Olympics and third major tournament, to guide the younger players through the pressure that is heaped on the American women’s team.
    

            Swanson said so far, the mix of younger and more veteran players has led to a positive atmosphere in a locker room full of some of the game’s top players.
    

            “You got a mix of not of veterans, and then some newer players and I think that makes us really, really good,” Swanson said. “I think. It’s like I said, like the vibe has been really positive and it’s been a lot of fun and, yeah, I think just going into the tournament, that’s important.”
    

            With Morgan left at home, it’s the first major tournament in many years for the US women where there is not one striker who is expected to pour in the goals.
    

            Smith, Rodman and Swanson made up an electric front three against Costa Rica, often blitzing down the flanks of Las Ticas to create chances. Their intricate passing and combination with Horan occasionally left Costa Rican defenders flailing.
    

            But the chances were left wanting. That leaves room for a concerning question – who’s the classic striker that can be counted on to finish off the build-up play like Morgan, Carli Lloyd, Abby Wambach and Mia Hamm once did?
    

            “It’s frustrating, obviously, when you’re creating those chances that it’s just not going in. And but yeah, I think that we’re getting in those positions, and I think that you take the positive from that,” Swanson told reporters after the July 16 game. “And then I think you just go back to the training ground, and you just continue to work on finishing that last little bit. And yeah, I think it’ll come and, and just be a little – me myself, I just had to be a little bit more clinical, and just go back to the training ground and just get some reps in.”
    

            Hayes is happy to be patient with her team while they forge their new identity, and said the teams the team played ahead of their trip to France allowed them to get great experience playing different types of defenses.
    

            “The last part in the box is that little bit of composure, whether it’s to find the right – the spear player in the right moment, and where it’s just execute,” Hayes said. “When I analyze the chances, should we win the game? Of course we should win the game. But for me I’m always, I’m always about analyzing what you have to do to be able to ensure that happens or at least we can get into the positions again and again. I cannot finish the ball for players, but I can certainly coach to put players in positions.”

99,WaPo_69,The USWNT insists the goals will come at the Paris Games. Everyone’s waiting.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/26/uswnt-not-scoring-paris-olympics/,"MARSEILLE, France — The U.S. women’s national soccer team returned to its Olympic base of operations by bus in the wee hours Friday following a satisfactory exercise on the French Riviera.The match in Nice for Thursday’s 3-0 victory over Zambia — the lowest-ranked team in the 12-nation tournament — was decided midway through the first half. The performance put to rest questions about readiness for the first major competition under new coach Emma Hayes but also heightened concerns about the squad’s ability to score.Although the Americans netted three early goals, superior talent at almost every position and a one-player advantage for 57 minutes did not yield a bounty. It’s an issue that has haunted the team since Olympic camp opened several weeks ago.In two tuneups and Thursday’s match, all against weak opponents, the U.S. team had massive advantages in shots (70-13), shots on goal (26-4) and corner kicks (24-5) but a measly margin in scoring (4-0).Hayes and the players say they would be worried if they were not creating those opportunities. The popular refrain has been “the goals will come.”Aside from the opening 25 minutes Thursday, everyone is still waiting.“I’m happy we’re getting those quality chances,” captain Lindsey Horan said. “We know we have to be better. We know we need to put more of those in the back of the net.”Alex Morgan’s slip in production the past two years was the primary reason the veteran forward was left off the Olympic roster. Her replacement at striker, Sophia Smith, scored against Mexico on June 13. Three days later, the United States dominated Costa Rica but failed to score.Wingers Mallory Swanson (two goals) and Trinity Rodman were responsible for the goals Thursday — all classy finishes after terrific buildups assisted twice by Horan and once by Smith.But opportunities surely will not be as plentiful Sunday in Marseille against Germany, which opened with a 3-0 victory over Australia. The inability by the United States to beat Zambia by a larger margin could prove costly. Should the Americans and Germans play to a draw, Germany would sit in prime position to win the group on goal differential by thumping Zambia on Wednesday while the United States faces a stiffer test in Australia.By finishing first, a team would face a third-place side from Group A or C in the quarterfinals in Paris. By finishing second, the opponent would be Group A’s runner-up (probably Colombia or Canada) in Marseille.Hayes attributed some of her team’s scoring problems Thursday to Zambia playing shorthanded after Pauline Zulu’s red card. Though that seems counterintuitive, Hayes explained that: “Sometimes when you play an opponent that goes down to 10 [players] and then they drop lower [in the formation], they start doing different things. You start doing different things. So this is just really a mindfulness piece for us.”The other issue is what the U.S. team has done with ample opportunities in the penalty area. While goalkeepers, crossbars, posts and goal-line clearances have foiled several efforts, the Americans have not been clinical enough. Many shots have been at bellybutton level or not requiring fast reaction by the keeper. Others simply have missed the frame entirely.Thursday’s performance was eerily similar to the team’s 2023 World Cup opener against Vietnam: two first-half goals and a 28-0 advantage on shots but just a 3-0 victory. The Americans went on to score once in the final three matches and were bounced in the round of 16, the earliest elimination at a major tournament in program history.Hayes might not have all her attacking pieces Sunday. Smith, who left late in the first half with an ankle injury, will continue to be evaluated this weekend, a team spokesman said. Jaedyn Shaw (leg injury) was not in uniform Thursday.Regardless who is on the field, the U.S. team appreciates the urgency to become ruthless.“We’re not just an athletic team with fast forwards,” Rodman said. “We are so much more than that. And I think we need to believe deep down we can break down teams. If that’s passing it up and laying it off and moving off each other, there’s so much more depth we can bring. Living that and breathing that on the field is going to help us improve.”"
105,CNN_66,"A man is accused of pushing a burning car into a gully, causing a California wildfire that’s spread to over 164,000 acres",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/us/california-park-fire-oregon-durkee-jasper/index.html,"
Hot and dry weather is fueling wildfire activity in the Western United States and Canada, with fires damaging homes, causing injuries and forcing evacuations. The largest active wildfire in the US has scorched more than 280,000 acres in eastern Oregon and another blaze has exploded to over 164,000 acres in California. Here’s the latest:


• Man accused of starting California wildfire is arrested: A suspect has been arrested on suspicion of pushing a burning car 60 feet into a gully, “spreading flames” that caused what’s now become California’s largest wildfire of the year, authorities said. The Park Fire in the Butte County area has quickly burned an area larger than the city of Atlanta. On Friday morning, Cal Fire said the fire had burned more than 164,000 acres and was 0% contained, after saying it had been 3% contained on Thursday.
    

            • Park Fire explodes in size: By Thursday morning, the wildfire had burned an average of nearly 50 football fields per minute since starting Wednesday afternoon. The blaze has forced mandatory evacuations in Butte County, where the state’s deadliest wildfire, the Camp Fire, killed more than 85 people and destroyed thousands of homes in 2018. Conditions around the Park Fire continue to be difficult for the 1,153 firefighters battling the flames as dry air, warm temperatures and gusty winds linger over the area Thursday. The area is under a red flag warning until Friday evening.
    

            • Three firefighters injured and structures damaged: Three firefighters had minor heat-related injuries on Wednesday while fighting the Park Fire, Cal Fire Captain Dan Collins told CNN Thursday. They were treated and released, he said. Officials know structures have been damaged or destroyed by the fire, but there is no official count yet, Collins said.
    

            • Firefighters battle massive Oregon fire: The Durkee Fire, which has burned an area larger than the city of Indianapolis, started on July 17 near the Oregon-Idaho state line. The lightning-sparked fire is the largest of 34 large wildfires currently burning across Oregon, which has been the hardest hit by fires in recent days. Amid high temperatures, extremely dry vegetation and strong winds, the fire has grown tens of thousands of acres and is 20% contained as of Thursday night, according to InciWeb. More than 500 firefighters and resources from 22 states are working to fight the fire, according to InciWeb. Over the weekend and earlier this week, the Durkee Fire exhibited extreme fire behavior, even creating its own weather in the form of pyrocumulus clouds.
    

            • Oregon wildfire destroys buildings: Three people were injured and two homes and 12 other structures were destroyed as the fire spread, according to the Oregon Department of Emergency Management. Evacuations are still in effect in Baker County for areas around the Durkee Fire. Some communities do not have power, according to Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, who has deployed resources from the National Guard to assist. Dense smoke from the flames has also impeded traffic on Interstate 84, leading to periodic closure of the freeway. Wildfire smoke was spreading into Boise and beyond. Air quality alerts have been issued for parts of Colorado, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.
    

            • Wildfire engulfs tourist town in Canada: A fast-moving wildfire sent thousands of visitors and residents fleeing the town of Jasper in Alberta, where flames devastated up to half of the town’s structures. Officials say the losses are significant, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has deployed federal support to help battle the blaze. Cool temperatures and rain are expected to keep fire behavior low for the next 72 hours, which will help crews fight the blaze, Jasper National Park said on Facebook Thursday night.
    

            • Fire-conducive weather continues in Western US: Triple-digit heat and dry conditions across the West this week have made conditions poor for firefighters actively fighting to contain the 89 large wildfires burning nationwide. “Many wildfires in the Northwest area continue to exhibit active to extreme fire behavior, with evacuation orders in effect on 17 wildfires. Several teams are managing multiple fire starts as complexes. Evacuation orders are also in effect for several fires in California, the Northern Rockies and the Great Basin,” the National Interagency Fire Center said. Conditions will begin to improve for much of the West over the weekend as cooler temperatures and higher humidity levels arrive in the area.
    

            Some families have found themselves displaced as the Park Fire raged near Chico, a city in northern California, burning homes and forcing evacuations.
    

            A former news anchor told CNN affiliate KOVR that she watched her Butte County house burn down live through security camera footage.
    

            “There is no rhyme or reason. Our house is gone, their house is okay. The house next to it you can see it’s gone,” Julia Yarbough said.
    

            Looking at the remnants of her home, Yarbough said she felt numb.
    

            “It’s surreal,” she said. “It probably won’t hit me till later, I’m pretty sure.”
    

            Triple-digit temperatures and high wind gusts have fueled the explosive growth of the Park Fire amid an active fire season in California. An estimated 343,253 acres have burned across the state so far in 2024, compared to 22,439 acres burned by this time last year, according to Cal Fire.
    

            A 42-year-old man, identified as Ronnie Dean Stout II, has been arrested after being accused of igniting the inferno.
    

            Witnesses reported seeing someone “pushing a car that was on fire into a gully near the Alligator Hole in upper Bidwell Park shortly before 3:00 p.m. yesterday,” Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said Thursday. “The car went down an embankment approximately 60 feet and burned completely, spreading flames that caused the Park Fire.”
    

            The DA says the man was seen “calmly leaving the area by blending in with the other citizens who were in the area and fleeing the rapidly evolving fire.” Stout was later arrested at a mobile home park in Chico, Ramsey said.
    

            Stout will likely face an arson charge, though it is unclear what count, or whether any enhancements will be added, Ramsey said. The DA’s office told CNN Stout has not retained an attorney and will be assigned a public defender at his arraignment.
    

            In Jasper, a popular tourist town in Alberta, 25,000 residents and visitors were forced to evacuate from a fast-moving blaze that has damaged 30 to 50% of the town’s structures, officials said during a press conference on Thursday.
    

            “Homes and businesses have been lost to a wildfire that people are calling a ‘wall of flames,’” Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said.
    

            An “enormous wind gust” moved the wildfire roughly about 3 miles in “probably less than 30 minutes,” Alberta Minister of Public Safety & Emergency Services Mike Ellis said during the press conference. This created “a wall of fire that was about 100 meters high.”
    

            “Any firefighter will tell you there is little to nothing you can do when you have a wall of flames coming at you like that. Nobody anticipated that fire to come so fast, so large,” Ellis said.
    

            Two wildfires converged in the Jasper National Park area, becoming what authorities are referring to as the Jasper Wildfire Complex. It remains difficult to measure exactly how big the complex – which also includes a third nearby fire – is due to extreme fire behavior and thick smoke cover. Together, the fires have swallowed an estimated 89,000 acres, the Jasper National Park said.
    

            Damage wrought by the flames will result in “a significant rebuild and significant displacement,” Smith said. The most significant structural damage lies on the west side of town, according to a Facebook post from Jasper National Park.

            “We will recover from this,” Smith said while holding back tears. “To those in Alberta and around the world who have experienced the magic of Jasper, the magic is not lost, and it never will be.”
    

            The vast majority of evacuees were “visitors with other places to return to,” Ellis said. Along with about 5,000 residents who live in the town, 2.48 million people visited Jasper National Park last year.
    

            Jasper Mayor Richard Ireland said residents will work together to rebuild after the wildfire “ravaged our beloved community.”
    

            “Your resilience and strength have always been the backbone of our community. In the coming days and weeks, we will rally together, support one another, and begin the daunting process of recovery,” Ireland said in a statement on Thursday.
    

            Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said all federal agencies are working together to provide resources to Jasper, support evacuations and strengthen response efforts on the ground.
    

            “Our governments are working together to keep Albertans safe and supported through this,” he said on Facebook.

123,CNN_89,Dow closes more than 600 points higher as investors gear up for rate cuts,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/investing/stocks-rate-cuts-inflation-fed/index.html,"
            Wall Street is undergoing a palpable vibe shift.
    

            Strong corporate earnings have helped stocks notch repeated record highs in 2024, despite stubborn inflation forcing investors to dial down their expectations for how many times the Fed will cut rates this year.
    

            But cooling inflation data in recent weeks has led Wall Street to bet that the Federal Reserve will finally cut interest rates in September — and that there are now more options for gains beyond just the Big Tech stocks that have dominated the market this year.
    

            Data released Friday morning showed the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, slowed to 2.5% for the 12 months ended in June — another sign for hopeful investors that inflation is continuing to ease from its four-decade high.
    

            The Dow jumped 654 points, or 1.6%, on Friday after soaring more than 800 points earlier in the day. The S&P 500 gained 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite added 1%.
    

            For the week, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell while the Dow notched a gain.
    

            Economic data has also remained remarkably resilient even as rates stay at a 23-year high. That, coupled with the slowdown in inflation, has raised hopes that the central bank could tame prices without triggering a recession, a feat it has achieved just once since the 1990s, according to some economists. Data Thursday showed the economy expanded at a robust 2.8% annualized rate during the second quarter, blowing past economists’ expectations.
    

            Wall Street will get more clues about the Fed’s next moves at its policy meeting next week, where the central bank is expected to hold rates steady. While the Fed has penciled in just one rate cut for this year, traders are betting on up to three, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.
    

            Brightening prospects for rate cuts typically signal good news for stocks, since the market tends to do better when higher borrowing rates don’t weigh down companies’ balance sheets. But you wouldn’t know that from the carnage in stocks this week.

Nasdaq and S&P 500 log worst day since 2022 after Alphabet and Tesla fail to impress Wall Street


            While the market was broadly higher on Friday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Wednesday logged their worst daily performances since 2022.
    

            The reason behind the selloff: Investors are shedding shares of the Magnificent Seven tech stalwarts that have dominated the market for the past two years, and their large weighting has dragged down the major indexes. Tech companies make up 32% of the total market capitalization, the highest level since the late 1990s, according to MRB Partners data as of June 28.
    

            An underwhelming start to the earnings season for the cohort has only intensified its declines: Tesla shares tumbled 12.3% on Wednesday after the electric vehicle-maker reported a more than 40% plunge in profits the prior evening. Alphabet shares slipped 5% after beating earnings expectations but missing analysts’ expectations for YouTube advertising revenue.
    

            One area that has benefited recently from the prospect of lower rates is small-cap stocks.
    

            Shares of smaller companies tend to perform poorly when rates are high, since they have more floating rate debt than their larger counterparts. But they have historically tended to perform well when the Fed begins easing its high borrowing rates.
    

            The Russell 2000 index, which tracks the performance of small-cap stocks, has gained 10.4% so far this month, outperforming the S&P 500’s 0.03% loss.
    

            Investors are also picking at other areas of the market poised to gain when rates come down. Stephen Lee, founding principal at Logan Capital, said his firm added to its position in homebuilder stocks earlier this quarter, betting that cooling inflation would allow the Fed to cut rates and ease the ultra-tight housing market.
    

            Sky-high interest rates have led homeowners to hold off on selling their homes to keep their pandemic-era low mortgage rates even as demand surged, driving up home prices to record levels.
    

            Investors have fretted over the past year that the market’s gains are beholden to just a handful of tech stocks, making the rally more vulnerable to pullbacks a few stocks stumble. The Magnificent Seven drove about 60% of the S&P 500’s total return during the first half of the year, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial.
    

            The recent gain in small-caps is making some investors hopeful that the market rally will continue to broaden.
    

            There are signs that the pain in tech shares might not be over yet. Tech stocks’ steep losses following tepid quarterly results from Alphabet and Tesla suggest that investors are growing impatient with companies investing hefty sums into artificial intelligence with little to show for it in terms of revenue gains.
    

            Many big tech firms have released AI chatbots and other flashy consumer tools since OpenAI’s ChatGPT kicked off the AI arms race two years ago, but the path to monetizing the technology remains unclear.
    

            On Alphabet’s Tuesday earnings call, UBS analyst Stephen Ju noted that the initial use cases of the AI models that Big Tech firms have invested in building “are more on the cost savings or efficiency side.”
    

            “When do you think we’ll start thinking about products that can help revenue generation for the Fortune 500, Fortune 1000 companies, which is probably something that can, hopefully, create greater value over time, versus just cutting costs?” Ju said.
    

            As the AI arms race continues to heat up, companies are unlikely to slow their spending on AI. But it’s unclear when those investments will provide a boost to their balance sheets.
    

            “The risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us here,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said on the call.
    

As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might change slightly.

165,WaPo_65,Paris Olympics live updates: Arson attacks disrupt travel ahead of Opening Ceremonies,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/26/paris-olympics-opening-ceremony-arson-attack-live-updates/,"Among the many feats that will be attempted at the 2024 Olympics, the plan for the Opening Ceremonies is one of the most daring — and potentially dangerous. Thousands of athletes are supposed to take part today in a floating parade on the Seine later today, with a culminating celebration near the Eiffel Tower. All of this is taking place at an extremely tense geopolitical moment, with French police and soldiers out in force, and the day began with arson attacks that upended travel."
165,WaPo_68,Arson attacks target France’s high speed trains hours before Olympics,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/26/france-rail-disruptions-scnf-olympics/,"PARIS — High-speed train lines in France were targeted by arson attacks early Friday, French officials said, causing massive travel disruptions hours before the Opening Ceremonies of the Paris Olympic Games.Gabriel Attal, the French caretaker prime minister, said that “acts of sabotage” were carried out in a “prepared and coordinated manner” and “nerve centers were targeted which shows a certain knowledge of the network to know where to strike.”It was not immediately clear who was behind the suspected attacks and authorities did not announce any arrests. The public prosecutor’s office opened an investigation within its organized crime framework rather than a counterterrorism inquiry, indicating that range of individuals or groups — including political activists — could be responsible.Nobody was reported to have been injured, but French officials said the impact for travelers and the country’s reputation ahead of the Olympic Games are severe.“The consequences on the rail network are massive and serious,” Attal said in a post on X, adding that “our intelligence services and law enforcement are mobilized to find and punish the perpetrators of these criminal acts.”Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, however, asserted that the attacks would have “no impact” on the Opening Ceremonies set for Friday evening because the transportation networks inside the city were unaffected.By early Friday afternoon local time, traffic on some impacted train lines had started to resume, state-owned railway company SNCF said, with a third of trains running on the Atlantic line and delays of an hour elsewhere.France’s railway network was an obvious target ahead of the Opening Ceremonies. For weeks ahead of the Olympics, tickets into and out of Paris were unavailable for purchase for this Friday, with SNCF citing a lack of clarity about security measures.SNCF said Friday’s “malicious acts” targeted three of its high-speed train lines, just as about 250,000 people were expected to travel Friday and 800,000 during the weekend.“Arson attacks were started to damage our facilities,” SNCF said. Its Atlantic, Northern and Eastern high-speed lines were affected, it said, and advised customers to postpone travel. SNCF said it also prevented another “malicious act” targeting the Southeast line. It noted that some disruptions are expected to last until Monday.The last weekend of July is usually one of France’s busiest travel periods, as Parisians head off for vacation. Unlike in normal years, many travelers were also expected to head  into the capital city, as well, to attend the Opening Ceremonies or Olympic competitions in the coming days.“We have damage and intentional fires in pipes where a lot of cables pass, cables that are used for signaling,” Jean-Pierre Farandou, the head of SNCF, told reporters. “They must be repaired, cable by cable. It’s very delicate work.”Before railway traffic can resume, Farandou said, all repaired signals will also need to be tested. “It takes time,” he said.The Paris public prosecutor’s office said Friday that authorities are investigating “intentional damage caused to SNCF sites during the night of July 25 to 26.” The prosecutor’s office is looking into charges including  “damage to property affecting the fundamental interests of the nation” and “attacks on an automated data processing system.” Each of these potential charges could carry a long prison sentence.Jean Castex, the head of the Paris transport system and a former French prime minister, has ordered an “increased level of vigilance” across the capital region’s network. “We are deploying on all terrains,” he said, according to the French public broadcaster, with a particular focus “on the sensitive sites of our networks.”The Eurostar train, one of the principal transport lines from the United Kingdom to the European continent, also announced delays “due to coordinated acts of vandalism in France, affecting the high speed line between Paris and Lille” and listed trains arriving in France an hour and a half later than scheduled. It advised travelers to postpone their trips and said several trains have been canceled.Officials said they were assessing the impact on travelers and athletes set to compete.Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete strongly condemned what he called the “coordinated” acts. He told BFM TV that an investigation is underway but said the coordinated timing of the incidents suggested the fires were “criminal” in nature.“At this stage, it is probably one or several acts of vandalism, a kind of coordinated sabotage,” French Sports Minister Amélie Oudéa-Castéra told Le Parisien. “We will evaluate the impact for today, for travelers, the impact for the athletes and for this weekend.”The SNCF said its teams were on-site  to ascertain the problem and begin repairs. “Some trains are diverted, a large number of trains are canceled,” it said.Attal thanked “firefighters who intervened on the affected sites” and “the SNCF agents who will carry out the necessary work to restore the network” — as well as impacted travelers for “their patience, their understanding and the civic-mindedness they demonstrate.”Valérie Pécresse, president of the regional council of the Île-de-France region, called the incidents “coordinated sabotage” and “an attempt to destabilize just as we launch the Olympic Games.”Speaking to BFM TV, Pécresse said the incidents are “not a coincidence” but rather a “massive and coordinated attack.”France and other European countries have seen suspected arson attacks on their railway systems before, usually attributed to criminals and at times to political activists, although the scale of this incident and timing with the Olympic Games put these latest incidents in a new light.Security has been a major priority in the run-up to the Paris Games, with most preparations kept under wraps but plans announced for the deployment of 15,000 soldiers, 35,000 police and 22,000 private contractors working in and around the stadiums and sports facilities across the country.The main security concern was expected to be a terrorist attack, as happened in Paris in 2015 or Nice in 2016, but there are also fears of cyberattacks. France’s cybersecurity agency was quick to issue a statement Friday that the train disruptions did not have a cyber element.There has been added worry over reports that Russia has been paying amateur saboteurs to carry out operations throughout Europe. On Tuesday, French police detained a Russian national in connection with a suspected plot to cause “destabilization” during the Games, prosecutors said.The tensions in the Middle East have been a major factor for security considerations at the Games as well, with armed guards escorting the Israeli athletes into their first soccer match against Mali on Wednesday amid protests over the war in the Gaza Strip. There have also been online threats against the Israeli team, evoking memories of the terrorist attack that killed Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Games.There have also been bomb scares and false alarms.Friday’s  alleged attacks so far seem to have had a lesser effect on the Olympic Games than on the Parisians seeking to escape their city  to begin the much hallowed national tradition of August holidays.Eloise Lecat sat on the floor of Gare Montparnasse, the Paris train station most affected by the disruptions, with her giant suitcase and her 3-year-old daughter, Léonie, on the floor in front of her.They were heading to Pays Basque to visit Lecat’s mother for August vacation — which coincides with the Olympic Games this year. But their 10:15 a.m. train was canceled due to the overnight disruptions, so Lecat was frantically searching for other transport options — bus, car or anything to get them out of Paris. Léonie was eager to see her cousins, Lecat said. “We will look for a good solution and see what happens,” Lecat said.Bisset reported from London.

202,WaPo_83,U.K. ending challenge to ICC arrest warrants for Israeli leaders,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/26/icc-uk-israel-warrants-objections-starmer/,"The headline on a previous version of this article said that Britain was withdrawing an objection to arrest warrants against Hamas leaders. Britain did not object to those warrants. The headline has been corrected.LONDON — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his new Labour government will not continue with his predecessor’s objection to the International Criminal Court’s right to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the conduct of the war in Gaza.A spokeswoman for 10 Downing Street said Friday that the new prime minister’s team would not be pursuing the previous government’s intent to object to such a warrant, and one for Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, because it was up to the international court in The Hague to decide how to proceed.The withdrawal of opposition to the arrest warrants puts the new British government at odds with the Biden administration, which opposes the arrest warrants against the Israeli leaders.The move, first reported by the Guardian, does not make it more likely that the warrants sought by ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan will be granted. Other countries will also weigh in with the court.Israeli online news outlet Ynet quoted an unnamed senior Israeli official as saying: “Israel is deeply disappointed. This is a fundamentally wrong decision; it is contrary to justice and truth and violates the right of all democracies to fight terrorism.”Starmer, a former human rights attorney, has condemned Hamas and backed Israel’s right to defend itself, but has also called for a cease-fire and more humanitarian aid for the besieged enclave.In another move, Britain last week announced that it was resuming funding to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, despite reports by Israel that some of the agency’s staffers were involved in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack.Britain’s new foreign minister, David Lammy, said UNRWA had taken action to guarantee the “highest standards of neutrality” among its thousands of employees.On Friday, the official Downing Street spokeswoman, who traditionally is not named, said the new government’s decision not to oppose the arrest warrants should not be considered an endorsement or objection to any ICC case.“On the ICC submission, I can confirm the government will not be pursuing [the proposal] in line with our long-standing position that this is a matter for the court to decide on,” the spokesperson told reporters.Khan, who is British, announced in May that he was also seeking arrest warrants for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Hamas in its Oct. 7 attack and by Israel in the ensuing war in Gaza.Some 1,200 Israelis, including soldiers and civilians, women and children, were killed in the October attack. Since Israel’s war began, more than 39,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed, most of them women and children, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health.In seeking arrest warrants, the ICC prosecutor named Yehiya Sinwar, Hamas’s top leader in Gaza; Mohammed Deif, commander of the movement’s military wing; and Ismail Haniyeh, chief of the Hamas political bureau, based in Qatar. Both the United States and Britain had earlier branded Hamas a terrorist organization.The prosecutor said the Hamas leaders were wanted on accusations of murder, hostage-taking, rape, sexual assault and torture.The ICC prosecutor also asked the court to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant on accusations of starvation of civilians, causing great suffering, and intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population.Netanyahu in May said the threat of arrest warrants “will not stop us from waging our just war against Hamas.” He called the action a “travesty of justice.”President Biden at the time called the possible warrants “outrageous,” and added that “there is no equivalence — none — between Israel and Hamas.”The ICC prosecutor is requesting warrants before a pretrial panel of three judges, who have not yet determined if the proceedings can move forward.The three judges had earlier given Britain until the middle of July to submit its formal opposition to the warrants.Within days of his election on July 4, Starmer reached out to Netanyahu, calling for “further deepening the close relationship between the two countries,” according to a British readout. “He added that it was also important to ensure the long-term conditions for a two-state solution were in place, including ensuring the Palestinian Authority had the financial means to operate effectively.”"
207,WaPo_82,Mexico wasn’t told of cartel arrests until kingpins were in U.S. custody,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/26/sinaloa-cartel-arrests-zambada-guzman/,"MEXICO CITY — Mexico wasn’t informed of the secret U.S. operation to whisk two Sinaloa cartel leaders to Texas until after the men were taken into custody, the country’s top security official said Friday.The arrests Thursday of Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada and Joaquín Guzmán López were a historic coup for U.S. agents pursuing a drug syndicate that has flooded the United States with fentanyl.Security Minister Rosa Icela Rodríguez told reporters Friday that a small Cessna airplane carrying Zambada, 76, and Guzmán, about 37, took off from Hermosillo airport in northern Sonora state just before 8 a.m. Thursday and landed at around 10 a.m. in El Paso, where the men were promptly arrested.The U.S. Embassy didn’t notify Mexican authorities of the operation until 3:30 p.m. local time, Rodríguez said. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador wasn’t informed until 4:14 p.m.U.S. authorities have not said why they kept the plan from their Mexican counterparts. But U.S. anti-drug operations have been foiled in recent years by leaks from Mexican officials, leaving Washington wary.“We are awaiting official communication on whether what happened yesterday was a capture or surrender,” Rodríguez said during López Obrador’s daily news conference. “This is part of what the U.S. government must tell us.”Zambada, a co-founder of the Sinaloa cartel, was fooled into boarding the U.S.-bound private plane with Guzmán, a son of imprisoned cartel co-founder Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera, according to a Department of Homeland Security official. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive operation.Zambada and the elder Guzmán, who is serving a sentence of life plus 30 years in the federal supermax prison in Florence, Colo., jointly led one of the world’s most prolific drug cartels. The Sinaloa federation exported tons of heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and other drugs and is credited with building the fentanyl business. The Biden administration has targeted the cartel as it tries to combat the most deadly drug epidemic in history.The operation to bring the traffickers to the United States was so secret that their names were kept off the flight manifest filed shortly before the plane took off, Rodríguez said. The plan named only the pilot, Larry Curtis Parker, she said. He was listed in migration records as a visitor to the country, and wasn’t registered as a U.S. Embassy employee or U.S. government agent.Zambada was scheduled to appear in federal court in El Paso at 8 a.m. Friday, represented by Dallas attorney Frank Perez. His case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Kathleen Cardone, according to court records. His attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Zambada and the elder Guzmán were indicted in El Paso with 22 other high-ranking Sinaloa Cartel members in 2012. Zambada was charged with being part of a conspiracy to traffic cocaine and marijuana into the United States, launder money and murder perceived enemies.The younger Guzmán was set to make his first court appearance in Chicago on Saturday, U.S. officials said. He is to be represented by one of the attorneys who defended his father, at El Chapo’s narcotics trial in Brooklyn in 2019. “I’ve got no comment other than to confirm I represent Joaquin and will be in court for him at his initial appearance,” attorney Jeffrey Lichtman said.Rodríguez was peppered by reporters Friday on why Mexico wasn’t told in advance about such a critical operation. Zambada also faces arrest warrants in Mexico.Rodríguez insisted that cooperation with Washington against the illegal drug trade is strong.“We are going to continue cooperating with the U.S. government, as we have done up until this event,” she said.Miroff reported from Washington.

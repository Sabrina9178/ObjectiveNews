3,NBC_4,Trump agrees to give a victim interview to the FBI after assassination attempt,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-agrees-give-victim-interview-fbi-assassination-attempt-rcna164006,"WASHINGTON — Former President Donald Trump has agreed to participate in a victim interview with the FBI focused on his attempted assassination, a bureau official told reporters Monday.
The interview with Trump would be consistent with any interview the bureau would conduct for any victim of crime under any circumstances, an official said.
The FBI investigation has found that attempted assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks was a ""highly intelligent"" man as well as ""a loner"" with few friends and acquaintances outside of his family, and had a growing interest in weapons.
His motive is still not known. The FBI has conducted hundreds of interviews and requested information about his online accounts, including gaming accounts, from dozens of companies, an official said. His search history included seeking information about the attempted assassination of Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico earlier this year, as well as mass shootings and power plants, an official said. Last week, the FBI revealed that Crooks had searched ""how far away was Oswald from Kennedy?"" about the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald, about a week before the attack.
The FBI found that the ladder Crooks purchased before the shooting was not taken to the Trump rally, though officials found a bloodied receipt for it on his body. Crooks did appear to have used a drone ahead of the attack, although no recorded footage was found on the drone, the FBI said.
Crooks fired off eight rounds just 25-30 seconds after a local police officer attempted to confront him on the roof. As NBC News has previously reported, citing the FBI and law enforcement, the officer was boosted up above the roof line by a colleague and Crooks pointed his weapon at the officer just before firing.
Crooks appeared to have carefully planned the attack ahead of the campaign rally and worked to keep his plans quiet, an official said during a briefing for reporters Monday, more than two weeks after the July 13 attempt on Trump's life.
FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate said Monday that the bureau had been working around the clock on the investigation and that while the bureau typically does not share regular updates about ongoing investigations, FBI officials felt doing so here was important for the American public.
U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned last week in the wake of the attack and after a contentious House hearing about the attempt. The Senate will conduct its own hearing this week with the FBI and Department of Homeland Security.
Abbate said the bureau was collecting facts but was not focused on identifying failures by law enforcement that day, saying that type of analysis was better left to others.
“The entirety of the FBI is committed to uncovering the real facts, the truth about this attack on former President Trump and the murder of Mr. Comperatore and the injury to others as well,” Abbate said, referring to Corey Comperatore, a rallygoer who was killed in the attack. Two others were wounded.
FBI Director Christopher Wray told Congress last week that “there’s some question about whether or not it’s a bullet or shrapnel” that hit Trump’s ear during the assassination attempt, adding fuel to conspiracy theories about the shooting.
FBI Agent Kevin Rojek, who runs the Pittsburgh office, said Monday that Trump was struck with a bullet, whether it be a whole or fragmented bullet, echoing a statement from the bureau issued Friday after Wray’s congressional testimony.
Rojek said that Crooks appeared to have ""made significant efforts to conceal his activities.""
Rojek said Crooks appeared to be ""a loner,"" and another official said there was no indication that Crooks had any mental health treatment or institutionalization.
The FBI has had difficulty getting into some of Crooks' accounts because of his use of encrypted apps, a bureau official said.
""Encryption has been a challenge for us here in this investigation,"" said FBI official Bobby Wells.Ryan J. Reilly is a justice reporter for NBC News."
3,CNN_43,FBI to ask for Trump’s ‘perspective’ in shooting probe witness interview,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/politics/trump-shooting-fbi-details/index.html,"
            Donald Trump has agreed to sit for a victim interview with the FBI, which is investigating this month’s attempted assassination, an agency official said Monday.
    

            Victim interviews are a routine part of criminal investigations, but are voluntary.
    

            “The interview of the former president will be consistent with any other victim interview that we do,” Kevin Rojek, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Pittsburgh Field Office, told reporters on a conference call Monday. The FBI wants to “get his perspective on what he observed, just like any other witness to the crime.”
    

            “It is a standard victim interview, like we would do for any other victim of crime under any other circumstances,” Rojek said.

Minute-by-minute: Visual timeline of the Trump assassination attempt


            FBI investigators continue to focus their efforts on uncovering the motive of the 20-year-old would-be assassin, Thomas Matthew Crooks.
    

            Crooks was “highly intelligent” and had a growing interest in shooting, Rojek said. While officials had already revealed that he searched “how far away was Oswald from Kennedy” before the shooting, Rojek said Monday that he also made searches related to “power plants, mass shooting events, information on improvised explosive devices and the attempted assassination of the Slovakian Prime Minister earlier this year.”
    

            His primary social circle “appears to be limited to his immediate family, as we believe, he had few friends and acquaintances throughout his life,” Rojek said.
    

            “While the FBI investigation may not yet have determined a motive, we believe the subject made significant efforts to conceal his activities,” Rojek said. “Additionally, we believe his actions also show careful planning ahead of the campaign rally.”
    

            Crooks also used aliases to make firearms-related purchases online.
    

            “Starting in the spring of 2023, the subject made more than 25 different firearms related purchases from online firearms vendor using an alias,” Rojek said.
    

            In the first half of 2024, Crooks also made “six chemical precursor-related purchases online of materials used to create the explosive devices recovered in the subject’s vehicle and home,” Rojek said.
    

            “For those purchases he used aliases,” Rojek added.
    

            Crooks used foreign-based encrypted email accounts to purchase firearm components, chemicals and other explosive components, investigators said Monday.
    

            Bobby Wells, assistant director of the Counterterrorism Division at FBI headquarters in Washington, DC, said that the bureau had trouble initially gaining access to the accounts because of their encryptions. But since they accessed the accounts, investigators found that the shooter was using the emails primarily to make online purchases.
    

            “We also identified some additional accounts and identifying information, including aliases he was using on these encrypted platforms,” Wells said.
    

            While Crooks had explosive components in his home and purchased chemical precursors previously, investigators said his parents didn’t have clear reasons to report on their son prior to the shooting.
    

            “As far as what was in the home, the chemicals and explosive-related materials,” Rojek said, “it’s our understanding from the parents and others that the shooter had a long interest in science and things like this, doing experiments and things like this over a period of time.”
    

            He added that because of that, his parents “weren’t concerned” that the materials could have been “focused on committing an attack of this nature or harming other people.”
    

            “He wasn’t hoarding ammunition” or doing things that would raise clear red flags for his parents, Rojek said, adding that they have been “extremely cooperative” with the FBI.
    

            Describing Crooks’ isolation from others, Rojek highlighted his lack of friends both online and in person.
    

            “Even in his gaming chatrooms, we see very little interaction” with others, Rojek said, adding that it was unusual to see such a lack of activity there. “To date, we have not found anyone that is really close in any type of social circle.”

26,NBC_27,Judge temporarily bans Wayne LaPierre from returning to lead the National Rifle Association but does not appoint a monitor,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/judge-temporarily-bans-wayne-lapierre-returning-lead-national-rifle-as-rcna163637,"A New York judge on Monday temporarily banned Wayne LaPierre from returning to lead the National Rifle Association but said he would not appoint an independent monitor to oversee the gun rights group.
State Supreme Court Judge Joel Cohen denied one of the most significant remedies proposed by New York Attorney General Letitia James after a jury found the NRA and its executives liable in a civil corruption trial. 
In February, jurors determined that LaPierre, 74, had diverted millions of dollars from the NRA to live luxuriously, while the organization failed to properly manage its finances and adopt a whistleblower policy. 
Cohen has spent the last two weeks weighing whether to award nonmonetary relief in the second phase of the civil trial.
James sought to permanently bar LaPierre from returning to the lead the NRA or its affiliates. Cohen issued a 10-year ban instead.
The attorney general also wanted the judge to appoint an independent monitor who would oversee the NRA's finances and report to the court for three years, which he did not do.
LaPierre served as the NRA’s CEO and executive vice president for more than 30 years before he announced his resignation at the beginning of January, days before the start of the trial, citing health issues.
 Jurors still found there was cause for his removal from the NRA. They determined he had violated his statutory obligation to discharge the duties of his position in good faith, as did John Frazer, the group’s corporate secretary and former general counsel, and Wilson “Woody” Phillips, the NRA’s former treasurer and chief financial officer.
The jury said that LaPierre had caused $5.4 million in monetary harm to the NRA, but that he has already repaid at least $1 million of that. Phillips caused $2 million in monetary harm to the NRA, the jurors found, while Frazer did not cause any monetary harm to the group.
On Monday, Cohen declined to impose restrictions on Frazer.
Before the second phase of the trial began, the parties reached a stipulation agreement on the appropriate remedy for Phillips.
Phillips, who is retired, will be prohibited from holding fiduciary positions with any New York nonprofit for 10 years. After a decade, he can resume serving if he first notifies the attorney general’s office and completes a training program.
He will still have to pay $2 million in damages, the attorney general said.
During oral arguments in June, LaPierre’s attorney, P. Kent Correll, argued against banning LaPierre from working for the NRA or its affiliates.
Correll said that LaPierre was retired and “not coming back” to the NRA but that LaPierre wants to “keep his right to associate freely with whomever he wants and to speak freely.”
Attorneys for the NRA, LaPierre and Frazer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The NRA had fought against the independent monitor, saying the attorney general could not show that the NRA had continued violating any laws.
The group said it had fired those who took advantage of it and ushered in a fresh slate of leaders, including a new chief compliance officer, an internal auditor and a president.
In May, the organization replaced Frazer as general counsel, although he was re-elected to serve as corporate secretary, the NRA said.
The NRA has operated as a nonprofit charitable corporation in New York since 1871. Its assets are required by law to be used in a way that serves the interests of its membership and advances its charitable mission.
NRA membership dues and contributions have drastically fallen in the last few years, court records show. 
Dues dropped from about $170 million in 2018 to nearly $62 million in 2023, according to a court exhibit that contains the NRA’s audited financial statements. Contributions were nearly cut in half in that period.Melissa Chan is a reporter for NBC News Digital with a focus on veterans’ issues, mental health in the military and gun violence."
26,CNN_68,Judge declines to appoint monitor for NRA but bars former CEO Wayne LaPierre from working for group,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/us/nra-civil-trial-wayne-lapierre/index.html,"
            A New York judge on Monday banned Wayne LaPierre, the former head of the National Rifle Association, from holding a paid position with the organization for a decade, but he declined to appoint an independent monitor to oversee the gun rights group’s finances.
    

            The split decision from Judge Joel Cohen came on the final day of arguments in the second stage of the civil trial of the NRA brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James.
    

            Ruling from the bench, Cohen said the state’s request for a monitor was not the correct remedy, suggesting the outside oversight mechanism would be “time-consuming, disruptive and will impose significant costs on the NRA without corresponding benefits.”
    

            Cohen also said he had concerns about “speech-chilling government intrusion on the affairs of the organization.”
    

            He said the same First Amendment concerns did not apply to whether LaPierre could serve anytime soon in the organization.
    

            “This relief is about the privilege, not the right, to serve as an officer or director of a New York not-for-profit,” he said.
    

            Earlier Monday, LaPierre, told the judge that appointing a monitor to oversee the gun rights group’s finances would be “equivalent to putting a knife straight through the heart of the organization and twisting it.”
    

            He described the appointment of a monitor as an existential threat to the group because it would send a message to prospective members and donors that the NRA was “being surveilled by this attorney general in New York.”
    

            If the monitor is appointed, he said, “General James will have achieved her objective to fulfill that campaign promise of, in effect, dissolving the NRA for a lack of money and a lack of members.”
    

            Following the trial’s first phase earlier this year, a jury found LaPierre and another deputy liable for misspending millions of dollars on personal expenses. James was seeking an independent monitor to oversee the group’s finances and compliance with whistle-blower policies. She was also seeking to bar LaPierre, the organization’s mouthpiece for decades, from returning to the NRA.
    

            It’s unclear what effect, if any, the 10-year ban on LaPierre serving with the NRA might have.
    

            In her closing statements, NRA attorney Sarah Rogers said the group had no plans to rehire LaPierre, even as she described him as a “visionary leader who commanded a lot of respect and deference.”
    

            She said the group has implemented strong internal controls that made the appointment of a monitor unnecessary.
    

            LaPierre served as the group’s CEO and executive vice president for more than three decades. He resigned in January on the eve of the first phase of the trial.
    

            Those proceedings cast a spotlight on the leadership, culture and financing of the organization, with state lawyers accusing LaPierre of siphoning millions of dollars from the organization to fund his lavish lifestyle, including trips on private jets and other personal gifts.
    

            The jury ordered LaPierre to repay almost $4.4 million to the organization, while the NRA’s retired finance chief, Wilson “Woody” Phillips, was ordered to pay back $2 million.
    

            The second phase of the proceeding was a bench trial, meaning there was no jury and the judge handed down the verdict.
    

            Earlier this month, Jeffrey Tenenbaum, a lawyer testifying for the state as an expert in nonprofit law, said the NRA had made some strides toward transparency but could backslide without the appointment of an independent monitor. He described the organization’s policy manual as “a dumpster fire.”
    

            State attorneys noted that LaPierre hadn’t been reprimanded by the organization. Although the NRA has touted a change a leadership, several LaPierre loyalists remain in its upper echelons. The NRA has lost more than 1.3 million members since 2018, according to an expert witness called by the group.
    

            James sued the NRA and its executives in 2020 under her authority to investigate not-for-profits registered in the state. She originally sought to have the entire organization dissolved, but the judge ruled in 2022 that the allegations did not warrant a “corporate death penalty.”

Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro was declared the winner of the country's presidential election on Sunday after securing more than 50% of the vote, although the opposition contends that the results are not accurate.
The National Electoral Council said at around midnight that Maduro received 51% of the vote, while the main opposition candidate, Edmundo González, had 44% support, according to The Associated Press.
Elvis Amoroso, head of the National Electoral Council, said the results were based on 80% of voting stations and represented an irreversible trend.
Despite Maduro being declared the winner of a third term, the opposition claimed victory, setting up a showdown with the government over the results.

The electoral authority, controlled by Maduro loyalists, did not immediately publish the results from each of the 30,000 polling booths across the country, impeding the opposition's ability to challenge the results after alleging it only had data for about 30% of the ballot boxes.
""The Venezuelans and the entire world know what happened,"" González said.
Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado claimed González's margin of victory was ""overwhelming."" Machado said the opposition had voting results from about 40% of ballot boxes across the country and that more were expected overnight.
Officials and lawmakers in the U.S. and elsewhere expressed skepticism about the validity of Venezuela's presidential election results after Maduro was declared the victor.
Speaking in Tokyo, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. has ""serious concerns"" about the announced outcome.
Blinken said the U.S. feared the result did not reflect the will or the votes of the Venezuelan people, and called for election officials to immediately release the full results. He also said the U.S. and the international community would respond accordingly.

""The international community, of which Chile is a part of, will not accept anything else,"" he said.

            Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro and his political opponents both claimed to have won the presidential election on Monday, as the United States and multiple regional nations voiced skepticism about official results handing victory to the strongman leader.
    

            With 80% of votes counted, Maduro won more than 51% of the vote, besting the Democratic Unitary Platform (PUD) candidate Edmundo González Urrutia, who gained more than 44%, according to a statement by the National Electoral Council (CNE).
    

            But the opposition painted a very different picture of the results. Opposition leader María Corina Machado said in a news conference that their own records showed their candidate Edmundo González Urrutia had received 70% of the vote against Maduro’s 30%.
    

            “We won, and everyone knows it,” Machado said, adding that the opposition would “defend the truth.”
    

            “The entire international community knows what happened in Venezuela and how people voted for change,” she said.

            Gonzalez, also at the news conference, alleged that rules had been violated during the election.
    

            If Maduro takes office, it will be for a third consecutive six-year term – representing the continuity of “Chavismo” in power, which started in 1999 at the hands of former president Hugo Chávez. Maduro has been in power since Chávez’s death in 2013.
    

            The vote has come at a crucial moment for Venezuela, an oil-rich nation that experienced the worst economic crash of a peacetime country in recent history. Maduro has blamed foreign sanctions against his regime, saying Venezuela is victim of an “economic war.”
    

            Meanwhile, the opposition — which has been galvanized this election cycle, posing the most significant threat to Maduro’s grip on power in years — had promised to restore Venezuela’s democracy and rebuild the economy if they won.
    

            Throughout the election process, there have been mounting concerns that the opposition will not see a fair contest, as Maduro’s government controls all public institutions in Venezuela including the Supreme Court – which could be the final arbiter on any claim of electoral fraud. The government has also been accused of rigging votes in the past, which it denied.
    

            Voters had turned out in droves, with many saying they would leave the country if Maduro won — pointing to violent repression and economic collapse under his rule.
    

            After the results were announced, Maduro described it as a “triumph of peace, stability, republican ideals, and the ideas of equality.”
    

            “They could not overcome the sanctions, they could not overcome the aggressions, the threats, they could not now and will never be able to overcome the dignity of the people of Venezuela,” he said during his public speech, referring to his political opponents.
    

            The results announced by the election authorities were met with mixed emotions in the capital Caracas, with Maduro supporters cheering and celebrating outside the president’s official residence. Meanwhile, opposition supporters were seen crying and hugging on the streets.
    

            Earlier Sunday evening, opposition leaders claimed there were election irregularities — including opposition witnesses being denied access to the CNE headquarters as the authority counted votes, and the CNE allegedly halting data being sent from local polling stations to their central location to prevent more votes from being processed.
    

            The run up to the vote was also marred by allegations of foul play.
    

            The election campaign saw at least 71 people arbitrarily detained – the majority of whom provided some sort of service to the opposition – and a dozen online media outlets were blocked within the country, according to human rights organization Laboratorio de Paz.
    

            The government a﻿lso created significant impediments for Venezuelans abroad to vote, including widely unattainable passport and residency requirements.
    

            CNN has reached out to the CNE, which has not responded to the opposition’s allegations.
    

            After the CNE announced Maduro’s win, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed “serious concerns that the result announced does not reflect the will or the votes of the Venezuelan people.”
    

            He added that it was “critical” for votes to be counted fairly and transparently, and called for the CNE to publish its vote tabulations.
    

            The opposition’s accusations may cast doubt on Venezuela returning to the international stage after Maduro pledged last year to hold free and fair elections in US-brokered talks, in exchange for sanctions relief.

            The results were also met with mixed reactions across the region. The presidents of Peru, Chile, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Argentina and Uruguay, all either denounced or cast doubt on the results, with several saying they would not recognize Maduro’s win. Ahead of the election, many Latin American leaders had urged Maduro to commit to stepping down if he lost.
    

            But some of Venezuela’s partners congratulated Maduro on his win, including the Bolivian, Honduran and Cuban presidents.
    

            Earlier Sunday night, a government statement shared online by the Venezuelan foreign minister decried what it called foreign “intervention” against the election, pointing the finger at a number of countries that had criticized the results – including Argentina, Paraguay, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Peru and more.

27,WaPo_16,Maduro’s electoral council declares him winner of Venezuelan election,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/28/venezuela-election-maduro-gonzalez/,"CARACAS, Venezuela — Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s electoral council declared the authoritarian socialist the winner of Venezuela’s election Sunday despite independent exit polling that suggested opposition candidate Edmundo González had captured twice as many votes.The opposition, which sent thousands of ordinary citizens to monitor voting centers across the country Sunday, was expected to challenge the result.The electoral council said Maduro won with 51 percent of the vote to González’s 44 percent.The opposition had seen the vote as its best chance in more than a decade to unseat the strongman, whom many here blame for this oil-rich country’s economic collapse and the exodus of millions of citizens, hundreds of thousands of them to the United States.As votes were being counted, opposition leaders denounced what they said was a government order to voting center workers to refuse to hand over printouts of voting results to opposition poll watchers.Alexis Cedeño, an opposition campaign coordinator for Caracas, said poll workers at a majority of voting centers in the capital were denying opposition poll watchers the physical copies, which are used to corroborate machine counts.Exit polling released after voting centers began to close Sunday evening showed opposition González taking 65 percent of the vote, more than doubling Maduro’s 31 percent, Somerville, N.J.-based Edison Research reported.“The results are undeniable,” González said in a post on X. “The country chose change in peace.”As night fell, violence broke out at some polling centers. When opposition supporters at the Liceo Andrés Bello in Caracas complained of being denied access to the vote count, a colectivo — a gang of at least 150 Maduro supporters on motorbikes — arrived shouting pro-government chants.A Washington Post reporter saw the men, hooded and wearing black, begin to punch and kick those outside the polling center, injuring multiple people. “Viva Nicolás,” they shouted.Leiner González, caught in the middle, was beaten, and his shirt was ripped.“Please, we need change in Venezuela,” the first-time voter, 25, said, “so that there is no more violence in our beloved country from a group of criminals. We demand peace, freedom and truth. Please, we want a transition.”While poll workers counted ballots, opposition leaders urged voters to stay at their local centers and support poll watchers.“We have to keep vigil,” María Corina Machado, the face of the opposition campaign, said in a news conference. “We’ve been fighting all these years for this day, and these will be crucial minutes, decisive hours.”Delsa Solórzano, an opposition’s electoral council observer, decried a “concerning, widespread pattern.” She said she and others had not been allowed into the council headquarters.She said the printouts the opposition had seen so far showed that “Venezuela has a reason to celebrate.”Perkins Rocha, another opposition council observer, said the opposition was “willing to defend the happiness citizens expressed today in the streets.”“The world’s eyes are upon Venezuela,"" he said. “Beware government officials: Don’t mock citizens. Just like you, we have the proof of what the votes were. It’s time to tell the truth.”In the runup to the vote Sunday, the government barred Machado, Venezuela’s most popular politician, from running, arrested campaign workers and blocked access to state media.Still, the opposition said it could win — and by a landslide.But in a country where the electoral council, courts and military are controlled by Maduro, the outcome was far from certain.Sunday saw reports of blocked access at voting centers, delays and some violence. In Maturín, a state capital about 350 miles east of Caracas, local opposition leaders said a voting center coordinator and her mother were demanding access for opposition poll watchers when members of a colectivo rode up and shot the mother in the leg.Voting centers were scheduled to open 6 a.m. Sunday, but at a school in the Chacao neighborhood of Caracas, a group of 18 people arrived three hours early. They would wait for more than six hours, amid delays opening some voting tables.By 9 a.m., some of the hundreds of people began to chant: “We want to vote!” Esther Pérez Villegas, whose husband was among those waiting, stepped in to help organize the lines. “Anxiety is high, very high, because of all of the uncertainty we feel,” she said.Noemi Tovar, 61, had been in line since 3 a.m. “If I have to wait all day, I’ll wait all day,” she said.“We’ve made lines here for many things — for food, for gasoline,” said Martha Salas, 62. “This is for so much more — for a vote.”At midday, Machado said problems at voting centers “were exceptions to a process that is developing peacefully.”“The way things are going, I think we are going to have, as they say, irreversible results,” she said at a voting center in Caracas.Edison Research, which interviewed more than 6,800 voters at 100 locations, said González outpolled Maduro among men and women, rural, suburban and urban voters, and every age group.“Our exit poll projects a resounding victory for Edmundo González,” executive vice president Rob Farbman said. “The opposition candidate had broad support across nearly all demographic backgrounds.”Several voting centers saw long lines. It was not possible to determine whether this reflected the greater turnout that the opposition had said would be its key to victory, but some voters in Caracas said they hadn’t seen such long crowds in many years.“I haven’t seen this kind of voter intention since Chávez,” said Vladimir Ramos, a 60-year-old engineer waiting in line. Hugo Chávez, Maduro’s mentor and predecessor, founded Venezuela’s socialist state in 1999 and led it until his death in 2013.“I think people are no longer afraid,” said Natalie Moreno, 47.By 12:40 p.m., Maduro addressed the nation to announce the activation of Operation Remate — a word meaning “finish it off” — a government-led effort to rally supporters to the polls. Maduro campaign staff and supporters called people to pressure them to vote and offer food and supplies.“Let’s mobilize ourselves with force,” Maduro said in a message aired by state television. “Let’s vote with strength as was planned, and with the force of the” social programs.The government aid was flowing in the rural eastern state of Delta Amacuro. In an Indigenous community there, people were being offered bags of food in exchange of support, said Yoxsamar Jiménez, a poll watcher for the opposition.“But that’s normal here,” she said. More concerning, she said: Poll watchers were not allowed inside, and the center’s coordinator hit Jiménez.“To avoid violence, we couldn’t do anything so we had to leave the table,” Jiménez said. “The table is alone, and they’re doing whatever they want in that center.”González, a former diplomat, was unknown to most Venezuelans just months ago. But as the election loomed, polls predicted he could beat Maduro by double digits.He ran as a stand-in for longtime Maduro critic Machado, the “Iron Lady” who draws tens of thousands of Venezuelans to her near-messianic campaign caravans — and has been disqualified from running by Maduro’s supreme court.Her campaign focused on a simple message: Vote for us, and your loved ones can come home.“The central theme is family, in the sense that this could be the last opportunity to reunite our families,” she told The Washington Post. “This is not just an electoral campaign. This is a redemption movement, for liberation.”Maduro’s campaign portrayed the opposition as an extreme, right-wing threat that would bring instability.Some voters in Caracas seemed to agree. Hector Trujillo, a 79-year-old retired architect, said he was voting for “peace” and the continued improvement of the economy. He blamed U.S. sanctions for the country’s troubles. He feared the opposition would “eliminate everything,” including the country’s welfare benefits.Ana Rosas, 26, voted Sunday for the first time in her life. Rosas, who now lives in El Salvador, is among the millions of Venezuelans dispersed across the world — and among the scores who returned home to vote.“I have goose bumps,” she said. “I still can’t believe I’m able to vote. I hope it makes a difference.”In Miami, dozens of Venezuelans, unable to vote from abroad, gathered at the Dolphin Mall to watch coverage of the election. Many wore shirts of red, yellow and blue, the colors of the Venezuelan flag, that read “Venezuela Libre.”“God willing, today the country will be free,” said Lennyn Padilla, 47, tears in his eyes. “I’m emotional because when I speak about it my throat closes up. It makes me so sad.”Victor Manuel Morina Parra, a 59-year-old bus driver in Caracas, said he has noticed discontent among his passengers. He moved from his farm in the countryside to the Catia neighborhood of the capital, he said, because his rural town was “in a state of total abandonment.”“We no longer have help from the government. There’s no fuel, the electricity goes out every eight hours,” he said. “That’s why we want change. For our children, for our grandchildren.”Maduro had warned of a “bloodbath” if he lost.“The destiny of Venezuela depends on our victory,” he told rallygoers this month. “If we want to avoid a bloodbath or a fratricidal civil war triggered by the fascists, then we must guarantee the biggest electoral victory ever.”"

President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are calling on Congress to impose term limits and a code of conduct on the Supreme Court while also drafting limits on presidential immunity, a White House official said.
Biden will discuss the proposed reforms during remarks on Monday at the LBJ Presidential Library, in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, the official said. Biden also addressed his desire for Supreme Court reform in an op-ed published Monday morning.
""I served as a U.S. senator for 36 years, including as chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. I have overseen more Supreme Court nominations as senator, vice president and president than anyone living today,"" Biden said in the op-ed, published by the Washington Post. 
""I have great respect for our institutions and separation of powers. What is happening now is not normal, and it undermines the public’s confidence in the court’s decisions, including those impacting personal freedoms. We now stand in a breach,"" Biden wrote.

Biden's reforms would eliminate any immunity a former president enjoys for crimes committed while in office.

            President Joe Biden called for major Supreme Court reforms Monday, a long-shot move that would make him the first sitting president in generations to back seismic changes to the way the nation’s highest court operates.
    

            Biden’s proposals — a constitutional amendment stripping the president of immunity for crimes committed while in office, term limits for Supreme Court justices, and a binding code of conduct for the high court — stand little chance of going anywhere with a divided Congress. But they serve as an election-year message designed to excite the Democrats’ progressive base. Vice President Kamala Harris, now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, quickly endorsed the proposed changes, which come at a time of deep unpopularity for the high court.

            Biden’s announcement, which he made at an event in Austin, Texas, commemorating the Civil Rights Act, follows this month’s monumental decision by the Supreme Court granting presidents full immunity for some actions taken while in office and after a tide of revelations about justices accepting vacations and gifts from wealthy conservative donors. Democrats on the campaign trail frequently point to the Supreme Court’s conservative majority – solidified by former President Donald Trump – to underscore what they see as the high stakes of the 2024 election.
    

            “In recent years, extreme opinions that the Supreme Court has handed down have undermined long-established civil rights principles and protections,” Biden said Monday, listing a litany of recent cases, including the 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade and this month’s immunity decision.
    

            Biden is also calling for an amendment dubbed the “No One Is Above the Law Amendment,” which will state the Constitution “does not confer any immunity from federal criminal indictment, trial, conviction, or sentencing by virtue of previously serving as President.”
    

            “I share our Founders’ belief that the president must answer to the law,” Biden said.
    

            In what would be another major change, Biden also called for term limits for Supreme Court justices, who serve lifetime appointments. That move, Biden said, would make the timing for the nomination process “more predictable and less arbitrary.”
    

            The reforms Biden is proposing would require congressional approval, which would be difficult to achieve before his term ends, as Republicans control the House and Democrats have a slim majority in the Senate. The constitutional amendment, meanwhile, would require a more complicated process involving the states that seems nearly impossible to succeed.
    

            The reforms, which will face heavy resistance, are meant to “restore trust and accountability when it comes to the presidency and the United States Supreme Court,” a White House official said.
    

            Ahead of Biden’s announcement, White House officials acknowledged the reform package faces an uphill battle, declining in a gaggle with reporters Monday to say whether Biden believes the proposal is “realistic.”
    

            Steve Benjamin, the White House director of public engagement, said the proposed reforms “will require some type of legislative action,” but he struck a hopeful tone that voters will be able to sway their representatives in Congress.
    

            CNN reported this month that Biden was seriously considering endorsing major Supreme Court reforms, actions that liberal lawmakers and groups have been pushing in recent years.

Analysis: Biden’s 41-year evolution on Supreme Court reform


            Biden’s proposals drew sharp and swift pushback from Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson. Johnson said the proposal would go nowhere in the House, assuming Republicans retain control of the chamber next year.
    

            “It is telling that Democrats want to change the system that has guided our nation since its founding simply because they disagree with some of the court’s recent decisions,” Johnson said. “This dangerous gambit of the Biden-Harris administration is dead on arrival in the House.”
    

            Biden, asked about Johnson’s assertion that the proposal would be dead on arrival in the House, responded after landing in Texas: “I think that’s what he is. Dead on arrival.”
    

            Pressed on how he’d pass the measures on Capitol Hill, Biden said, “We’re going to figure a way.”
    

            Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said “the Supreme Court is under attack” in a speech on the Senate floor Monday, calling for Biden and Harris to accept rulings from the court instead of responding “with a full schedule attack on the justices who ruled against them.”
    

            Leonard Leo, a conservative legal advocate whom Democrats accuse of playing a central role in some of the ethics controversies swirling around the court, also criticized the Biden administration proposals in a rare statement.
    

            “No conservative justice has made any decision in any big case that surprised anyone, so let’s stop pretending this is about undue influence,” Leo said. “It’s about Democrats destroying a court they don’t agree with.”
    

            Leo, board co-chairman of the influential Federalist Society, was subpoenaed by Senate Democrats in April. The Senate Judiciary Committee is seeking to better understand whether specific individuals and groups have used undisclosed gifts to gain access to the justices. Leo called the subpoena “unlawful” and “politically motivated” and told CNN at the time that he was “not capitulating” to that request.
    

            Others praised the administration’s ideas.
    

            Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat and member of the Judiciary Committee who has proposed legislation to tighten ethics rules at the court, described the Biden announcement as a “strong” proposal.
    

            “This court has proven time after time that it cannot police itself,” he said.
    

            Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin acknowledged that there is only a “remote possibility” that the chamber could pass court ethics legislation, but noted that they are “urging” Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to bring up Whitehouse’s bill before the end of the year.
    

            The Monday announcement comes more than three years after Biden created a commission to study structural changes at the Supreme Court, including term limits and proposals to increase the number of justices. The group submitted its report to the White House in late 2021, but the administration did not pursue any of the ideas discussed in the document.
    

            The debate over proposed structural changes at the Supreme Court has become deeply partisan, with Republicans widely opposed. But the issue has drawn renewed attention after it was reported in May that controversial flags were previously hoisted on properties owned by conservative Justice Samuel Alito. Both of the flags were flown by rioters during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, though Alito has denied any connection to that incident and has said his wife hoisted them for different reasons – including a spat with neighbors.
    

            Meanwhile, the court handed down several controversial decisions this summer that drew sharp criticism on the left, including the stunning 6-3 ruling that granted Trump broad immunity from criminal prosecution over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

Justice Elena Kagan says Supreme Court’s code of conduct needs an enforcement plan


            Last year, the high court adopted its own code of conduct. But the measure was heavily criticized by ethics experts because it included no way to enforce its requirements. Liberal Justice Elena Kagan defended the code of conduct in remarks last week but also conceded it would be more effective if it included an enforcement mechanism.
    

            Biden’s proposal comes as polling indicates support for the court is hovering near historic lows. A Marquette Law School poll in May found that 61% of Americans disapprove of the job the court is doing. Just four years ago, the same poll found the court had a 66% approval rating.
    

            Democrats have sought to use public disapproval of the court – particularly its 2022 ruling overturning Roe v. Wade – to drive voters. Biden and Harris have made that decision a central part of their campaign arguments, hoping the issue of abortion rights will galvanize voters heading into November.
    

            Harris endorsed the proposed changes in a statement released by her campaign Monday, saying they would “restore confidence in the Court, strengthen our democracy, and ensure no one is above the law.”
    

            She also said there was a “clear crisis of confidence facing the Supreme Court.”
    

            “In the course of our Nation’s history, trust in the Supreme Court of the United States has been critical to achieving equal justice under law,” Harris wrote. “President Biden and I strongly believe that the American people must have confidence in the Supreme Court. Yet today, there is a clear crisis of confidence facing the Supreme Court as its fairness has been called into question after numerous ethics scandals and decision after decision overturning long-standing precedent.”
    

            White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Monday that Harris was closely involved in the proposal.
    

            “The president consulted her closely,” Jean-Pierre said. “Let’s not forget that she was a former member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, as well as a former attorney general, so he certainly listened to her expertise in this arena as well.”
    

            Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee who has resisted calls from his party to expand the court, has become increasingly critical of its makeup. He has described the Supreme Court as “out of kilter” and has warned of the impact a second Trump presidency could have on the nation’s highest court.
    

            Biden, who is making his first trip since bowing out of the 2024 race, called for the changes at the presidential library honoring President Lyndon B. Johnson, who ended his own reelection bid in 1968. Biden also used his remarks to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, the landmark legislation that cemented Johnson’s legacy.

33,WaPo_35,"Biden endorses Supreme Court reforms, amendment to limit immunity",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/29/biden-supreme-court-reform-ethics-code-term-limits/,"President Biden endorsed sweeping changes to the Supreme Court on Monday, calling for 18-year term limits for the justices and a binding, enforceable ethics code for the high court.He is also pushing for a constitutional amendment that would prohibit blanket immunity for presidents, a rebuke of the Supreme Court after it ruled this month that former president Donald Trump is immune from prosecution for official acts.For Biden, who has long resisted calls to reform the Supreme Court, the announcement Monday marked a major shift in his posture toward one of America’s three branches of government. Since assuming the presidency, the Supreme Court has veered sharply to the right — overturning Roe v. Wade, ending affirmative action in college admissions, weakening federal agencies’ power by overturning a 40-year decision and striking down Biden’s student-loan forgiveness program.“I have overseen more Supreme Court nominations as senator, vice president and president than anyone living today,” Biden wrote in an op-ed in The Washington Post published Monday morning. “I have great respect for our institutions and separation of powers. What is happening now is not normal, and it undermines the public’s confidence in the court’s decisions, including those impacting personal freedoms. We now stand in a breach.”The president will officially announce his support for the changes during a speech commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act at the LBJ Presidential Library in Austin The Post previously reported that Biden was set to call for these three changes.The calls, however, are largely aspirational at this stage given the long odds they face in implementation. Term limits and an ethics code are subject to congressional approval, and the Republican-controlled House is unlikely to support either. Both proposals also require 60 votes to pass the Senate, and Democrats only hold 51 seats in the upper chamber. Passing a constitutional amendment requires clearing even more hurdles, including two-thirds support of both chambers, or via a convention of two-thirds of the states, and then approval by three-fourths of state legislatures.Biden’s proposed amendment, which Biden is calling the “No One Is Above the Law Amendment,” states the “Constitution does not confer any immunity from federal criminal indictment, trial, conviction, or sentencing by virtue of previously serving as president.”In his op-ed explaining his decision, Biden wrote, “This nation was founded on a simple yet profound principle: No one is above the law. Not the president of the United States. Not a justice on the Supreme Court of the United States. No one.”The Supreme Court immunity decision, which came along ideological lines, made it extremely unlikely that Trump would go to trial on charges of trying to subvert the 2020 election before voters cast ballots in this year’s presidential contest.Less than an hour after that decision, Biden called Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard Law School, to discuss the ruling and the arguments for and against remaking the court. The next week, Biden called Tribe again, and the two discussed a Guardian opinion piece he wrote endorsing reforms to the Supreme Court. Among the options they discussed: term limits, an enforceable ethics code and the constitutional amendment to address presidential immunity.Tribe confirmed that he spoke with Biden but declined to comment on their discussion.Biden’s call for an enforceable ethics code follows a year of scandals at the Supreme Court, largely centered on Justice Clarence Thomas and his lack of disclosures over gifts. Justice Samuel Alito has also come under criticism for flying politically provocative flags at his homes.Biden wrote that the ethics codes should require justices to “disclose gifts, refrain from public political activity, and recuse themselves from cases in which they or their spouses have financial or other conflicts of interest.”The term limits, Biden said, would allow future presidents to appoint a justice every two years and make high court nominations “more predictable and less arbitrary.” He noted that the United States is the only major constitutional democracy that gives lifetime appointments to its high court justices.After The Post first reported on Biden’s proposals, former president Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, criticized the president’s plan.“The Democrats are attempting to interfere in the Presidential Election, and destroy our Justice System, by attacking their Political Opponent, ME, and our Honorable Supreme Court,” he wrote on Truth Social. “We have to fight for our Fair and Independent Courts, and protect our Country.”During the 2020 presidential race, Biden rebuffed calls from liberals who advocated expanding the court but he promised he would create a commission to study potential changes. He followed through on that vow after being elected, and the commission issued a 294-page report to the president. Before Monday, Biden had not acted on the commission’s report since it was approved in December 2021.Biden had been planning to endorse the changes to the high court, even before he last weekend announced he was reversing course and not seeking a second term as president. Biden hinted about his plans during a call with the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a call that was part of his unsuccessful effort to keep Democrats united behind his candidacy.“I’m going to need your help on the Supreme Court, because I’m about to come out — I don’t want to prematurely announce it — but I’m about to come out with a major initiative on limiting the court. … I’ve been working with constitutional scholars for the last three months, and I need some help,” Biden said, according to a transcript of the call obtained by The Post."
52,FOX_27,Iran trying to sabotage Trump's presidential campaign: US intelligence,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/iran-trying-sabotage-trumps-presidential-campaign-us-intelligence,"The FBI on Monday shared new details regarding their investigation into an assassination attempt against former President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13. 
U.S. intelligence officials believe that Iran is trying to sabotage former President Trump's presidential campaign through online influence operations, according to a press briefing on Monday.
Speaking to reporters, an official with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said U.S. spy agencies ""observed Tehran working to influence the presidential election,"" likely because Iranian leaders want to avoid increased tensions with the U.S.
The official didn't directly say that Iran was trying to undermine Trump, but that American spies ""haven’t observed a shift in Iran’s preferences"" since 2020, meaning that Iran was still targeting Trump.
During the briefing, an intelligence official also said Iran is utilizing ""vast webs of online personas and propaganda mills to spread disinformation,"" in addition to different online campaigns.

The Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations denied allegations of election interference to Fox News Digital.
""Iran does not engage in any objectives or activities intended to influence the U.S. election,"" a spokesperson said. ""A significant portion of such accusations are characterized by psychological operations designed to artificially pep up election campaigns.""
Earlier in July, Tehran was accused of a separate plot to kill Trump after a gunman shot the former president at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13. Shortly after the allegations were made, the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran said that the claims were ""unsubstantiated and malicious.""
""From the perspective of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Trump is a criminal who must be prosecuted and punished in a court of law for ordering the assassination of General Soleimani,"" the permanent mission said to Fox News Digital at the time. ""Iran has chosen the legal path to bring him to justice.""
Iran is not the only foreign adversary accused of meddling with the 2024 presidential election. On July 10, ODNI officials called Russia the ""preeminent threat"" to the election.

Russia is ""undertaking a whole-of-government approach to influence the election, including the presidential race, Congress and public opinion,"" an intelligence official said during the July 10 briefing, adding that Russia has grown ""more sophisticated"" in election interference. The country generally targets the Democratic Party in U.S. elections.
According to the Director of National Intelligence's latest report on Russia, the Kremlin targets the Democratic Party to diminish U.S. support for Ukraine, among other reasons.
""We assess that the Russian government and its proxies sought to denigrate the Democratic Party before the midterms and undermine confidence in the election, most likely to weaken U.S. support for Ukraine, and to erode trust in U.S. democratic institutions,"" the report reads.
Per the July 10 ODNI briefing, Russia is reportedly also using artificial intelligence to mimic American Southern and Midwestern accents on social media.
""Foreign adversaries continue to experiment with and have adopted at least some generative AI tools to more quickly and cheaply generate authentic looking content tailored primarily for social media platforms that can target specific audiences including in the U.S.,"" an ODNI official said.

52,CNN_59,"Iran using covert influence campaign to undermine Trump candidacy, US intelligence says",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/politics/iran-covert-influence-campaign-trump/index.html,"
            Iran is using covert social media activity and related influence operations in an effort to undercut the candidacy of former President Donald Trump, a US intelligence official said Monday in an updated assessment of threats to the November election.
    

            The US intelligence community has “observed Tehran working to influence the presidential election, probably because Iranian leaders want to avoid an outcome they perceive would increase tensions with the United States,” the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said in a statement.
    

            The recent Iranian influence activity has come in the form of “covert social media accounts and related activity,” the official from ODNI said at a media briefing when CNN asked for examples of the activity.
    

            Iran’s preference for a US presidential candidate has not changed since 2020, the ODNI official said. In the 2020 election campaign, Iran “carried out a multi-pronged covert influence campaign intended to undercut former President Trump’s reelection prospects,” according to a declassified US intelligence report.
    

            Russia’s preferences for the presidential race also haven’t shifted since 2020, when Moscow conducted a range of influence operations in support of Trump and aimed at denigrating Joe Biden, the ODNI official said.
    

            “Iran does not engage in any objectives or activities intended to influence the U.S. election,” the Iranian Permanent Mission to the United Nations said in a statement to CNN. “A significant portion of such accusations are characterized by psychological operations designed to artificially pep up election campaigns.”
    

            As president, Trump ordered the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, and withdrew from a multilateral deal aimed at curbing Tehran’s nuclear program. Iran has vowed revenge for Soleimani’s death.
    

            The alleged Iranian threats to the Trump candidacy have not just been online.
    

            US authorities obtained intelligence from a human source in recent weeks on a plot by Iran to try to assassinate Trump, a development that led to the Secret Service increasing security around the former president, CNN first reported on July 16. There’s no indication that Thomas Matthew Crooks, the would-be assassin who attempted to kill the former president at a rally in Pennsylvania on July 13, was connected to the Iranian plot.
    

            Iran has denied the assassination plot allegations.
    

            Foreign influence actors have used the attempted assassination of Trump “as part of their narratives, portraying the event to fit their broader goals,” the ODNI official said without offering examples.
    

            Iran is also attempting to covertly stoke protests in the US related to the Israel-Hamas conflict by posing as activists online and in some cases providing financial support to protesters, US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said this month.
    

            “Tehran relies on vast webs of online personas and propaganda mills to spread disinformation and have notably been active in exacerbating tensions over the Israel-Gaza conflict,” the ODNI said in its statement on Monday.
    

            The updated intelligence assessment covers a range of covert and overt influence activity, showing that the number of foreign actors targeting US elections has continued to grow since the Kremlin’s sweeping effort to influence the 2016 election.
    

            “Russia remains the predominant threat to U.S. elections,” ODNI said in its assessment on Monday. Moscow is using Russia-based “influence-for-hire” firms that are getting better at tailoring content to American audiences, US officials said.
    

            CNN has requested comment from the Russian Embassy in Washington, DC. The Russian government regularly denies US allegations of election influence.
    

            China “probably does not plan to influence the outcome” of the US presidential election, but US intelligence is monitoring the possibility that China-linked propagandists and influence actors could “denigrate down-ballot candidates,” the updated assessment says.
    

            Chinese leader Xi Jinping told Biden that China would not interfere in the 2024 US presidential election when the two men met in November, CNN previously reported.

58,CNN_13,Venezuelans anxiously await results in crucial presidential election as opposition signal high voter turnout,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/americas/venezuela-presidential-election-polls-open-intl-latam/index.html,"
            Venezuelans are anxiously awaiting the result of a highly consequential presidential election after casting their votes Sunday, in which the country’s longtime strongman, Nicolas Maduro, faces one of his greatest political challenges yet, say analysts.
    

            People began lining outside polling centers at dawn, casting votes throughout the day — though it remains unclear when the electoral authorities will announce the results.
    

            As night fell, many of those out on the streets voiced concerns that the opposition will not see a fair contest, as Maduro’s government controls all public institutions in Venezuela and has been accused of rigging previous votes, which it denied.
    

            Experts had said that opposition party representatives will be present at each polling station to watch against vote tampering and to ensure fairness. But on Sunday night, the opposition’s main witness said she and other members had been denied access to the National Electoral Council (CNE) as it collates the results in the capital Caracas.
    

            Delsa Solórzano, president of the Citizen Encounter Party, part of a larger opposition coalition, also said CNE had stopped sending voting data from polling stations to the central authority, to prevent more votes from being processed. She added that she had tried contacting the CNE, without any response.
    

            CNN has reached out to the CNE, which has not yet commented on the allegations.
    

            Maduro, who took the mantle of the ruling Chavismo movement after his predecessor Hugo Chavez’s death in 2013, is seeking his third consecutive six-year term in office. Of the nine other candidates running for the presidency, his biggest challenger is a unified opposition movement that overcame their divisions to form a coalition known as the Democratic Unitary Platform.

The woman behind Venezuela’s upstart opposition movement


            The opposition movement has maintained its momentum despite sustained government repression, in which their first-choice candidate, María Corina Machado, was disqualified from running. Machado, an avowed capitalist who has promised privatization of several state industries, has since rallied for her replacement, the soft-spoken former diplomat Edmundo González Urrutia.
    

            The vote has come at a crucial moment for Venezuela, which has experienced violent repression under Maduro’s watch and the worst economic collapse of a peacetime country in recent history. The oil-rich nation, once the fifth-largest economy in Latin America, has seen its economy shrink in the last decade to the equivalent of a medium-sized city, according to data from the International Monetary Fund. 


            Punishing sanctions on the regime by the United States and European Union have failed to topple the populist incumbent, who argues that Venezuela’s woes are due to being a victim of an “economic war.”
    

            Around eight million Venezuelans have fled the country amid shortages of vital goods and soaring inflation, and others will feel compelled to leave if Maduro wins, says the opposition coalition that has promised to restore Venezuela’s democracy.
    

            Fleeing Venezuelans “would create huge pressure and destabilization in the region. And of course, in the south border of the United States, but in the country,” opposition leader Machado said Sunday, adding that an opposition victory would bring “millions of Venezuelans … back home.”
    

            On Sunday, some voters in Caracas appeared optimistic for change. “[After] 25 years, I see that there is a real chance to change. I see a lot of people getting together to vote,” voter Mariana Schemel said.
    

            “I’m doing this for my children and my grandchildren,” voter Amelia Perez told CNN. She has three sons, one of whom is living in Washington, D.C. “I want him to come back and I don’t want my children to leave. All the rest of my family already left.”
    

            Voters came out in droves to vote on Sunday, according to the opposition coalition. Outside a polling station in Caracas, Venezuelans chanted “we want to vote” as they waited for hours in line to get to the ballot box. Abroad, Venezuelan expatriates rallied in Miami, Florida, and the Peruvian capital Lima.

            More than 21 million people are registered to vote, both in the country and abroad. The opposition coalition reported later on Sunday afternoon a 54.8% voter turnout, representing at least 11.7 million voters.
    

            “This is huge. If this continues, it will be a historic participation figure,” Machado said in a statement released Sunday afternoon. “What you are seeing is the most important civic act in our history.”
    

            There were also minor “problems” at some voting stations, including a small number of stations that couldn’t be set up and delays in processing voters’ ID cards, Machado said.
    

            And in Caracas, 55-year-old voter Henrique Mendoza told CNN he was turned away from a polling center by soldiers for wearing cargo shorts, after queuing for hours – despite the CNE previously saying there is no dress code for polling centers.
    

            When Maduro voted at 6 a.m. in the capital, he urged citizens to respect the results of the election. His main challenger González said the opposition coalition is “going to wait for the results from the National Electoral Council, however, we also have our methods and mechanisms to know the progress of today’s electoral process.”

            The election campaign has seen at least 71 people arbitrarily detained – the majority of whom provided some sort of service to the opposition – and a dozen online media outlets blocked within the country, according to human rights organization Laboratorio de Paz.
    

            The government has also created significant impediments for the millions of Venezuelans abroad to vote, including widely unattainable passport and residency requirements. Only 69,211 Venezuelans living abroad are eligible to vote in this year’s poll, according to data published by the CNE.
    

            A limited group of election observers, including a team from The Carter Center – a non-profit organization set up by former US President Jimmy Carter – will be on the ground. But several international election observers have announced this week that they will no longer travel to Venezuela to monitor the vote.
    

            Latin American leaders, including Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, have called on Maduro to commit to stepping down if he loses. Venezuelan opposition figures have also appealed to the country’s military, that has long supported Maduro and his predecessor, to respect the results. The Venezuelan leader has said his victory will ensure “peace” in the country.
    

            The Biden administration has been monitoring the elections, telling reporters on Friday that the US stands prepared to levy additional sanctions against Venezuela if the democratic process is not allowed to unfold.
    

            Vice President Kamala Harris said “the will of the Venezuelan people must be respected” in a post on X, adding that “despite the many challenges, we will continue to work toward a more democratic, prosperous, and secure future for the people of Venezuela.”
    

            How the army reacts to the outcome could be an important factor in any scenario, but analysts say it impossible to parse where it stands.
    

            “The military is absolutely key. But I must also say that the military is very hermetic, [and] it is very difficult to access information about what it is thinking,” Laura Cristina Dib, the Venezuela Program Director of Venezuela Program at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), told CNN.

62,CNN_34,Text messages from law enforcement show concerns were raised more than 90 minutes before Trump rally shooting,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/politics/trump-assassination-attempt-police-shooter-presence/index.html,"
            Text messages between law enforcement before the assassination attempt against Donald Trump earlier this month suggest that some officers raised the shooter’s presence at the rally more than 90 minutes before he climbed onto a roof and fired eight rounds at the former president.
    

            In text messages obtained by Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley from the Beaver County Emergency Unit, a local countersniper first raised with his colleagues that he saw someone park near their vehicles and sit on a nearby picnic table at 4:26 p.m.
    

            According to the messages, which were first reported by The New York Times, local law enforcement later took a picture of the same man, who turned out to be the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, and sent it to other officers in a group chat nearly 30 minutes before Crooks would shoot at Trump at the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally.

Minute-by-minute: Visual timeline of the Trump assassination attempt


            “Kid learning around building we are in,” one texts reads. “I did see him with a range finder looking towards stage. FYI. If you wanna notify SS [Secret Service] snipers to look out. I lost sight of him.”
    

            Questions remain over how local law enforcement failed, after spotting Crooks previously, to stop the shooter from climbing up the side of a nearby building and coming so close to killing a former president and current Republican nominee. It’s also unclear how the Secret Service designated security that day and who managed the communication between local and federal law enforcement.
    

            Members of the Beaver County SWAT team, which assisted in security, said in an interview with ABC News that they were supposed to have a face-to-face briefing with the Secret Service when the agents arrived in Butler but that no such meeting took place.
    

            “We were supposed to get a face-to-face briefing with the Secret Service members whenever they arrived, and that never happened,” Jason Woods, a sniper on the team, told ABC News.
    

            CNN has reached out to the Secret Service for comment.
    

            It’s also unclear, based on congressional testimony and reporting, what time local law enforcement told the Secret Service directly about Crooks and sent the pictures one of their members took of the soon-to-be shooter before he accessed the roof.
    

            In the wake of the resignation of Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, acting Director Ronald Rowe, along with FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate, will testify before two Senate committees Tuesday about the assassination attempt, as lawmakers hope to get more answers around the failures that day.

80,CNN_30,"Alma Powell, wife of late Secretary of State Colin Powell, dies at 86",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/politics/alma-powell-dies/index.html,"
            Alma Johnson Powell, the wife of the late Secretary of State Colin Powell, has died. She was 86.
    

            Her death was confirmed by the former diplomat’s chief of staff and family spokesperson, Peggy Cifrino.
    

            The Powells were married for nearly 60 years, and Alma was by her husband’s side during his remarkable and historic military career. The two met on a blind date in 1961 shortly before he was deployed to Vietnam as a military adviser, and he later rose to become chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff beginning under President Ronald Reagan and secretary of state during George W. Bush’s administration.
    

            Four months after the Powells were married, he was sent to Vietnam, leaving Alma to navigate the first few years of her life as a newlywed alone, which she later called “the defining experience of my life.”
    

            “Part of who I am is because of my career as a military wife. I think of the military as family,” Alma Powell once said. “During the course of our young lives, he was often away. … So, like many military spouses today, you’re essentially a single parent. Your job was to make a home wherever you were. Home was where we were as a family, wherever that was.”
    

            At the time of her passing, Powell was listed as chair emeritus of America’s Promise Alliance, a nonprofit founded by her husband that seeks to help at-risk youths by coordinating the efforts of a “cross-sector association of community organizations, businesses, and government organizations,” according to the National Museum of African American History & Culture.
    

            She also served on the board of trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, was on President Barack Obama’s Board of Advisors on Historically Black Colleges and Universities from 2010 to 2012 and was the advisor to the Red Cross of the military district of Washington during her husband’s tenure as chairman of the Joint Chiefs, according to a biography of Alma Powell on the website of America’s Promise Alliance.
    

            Alma Powell “is survived by her three children, Michael, Linda, and Annemarie and their families, her niece and two nephews, and countless beloved extended family members and friends,” Cifrino said in a statement.

Colin L. Powell, the first Black national security adviser, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and secretary of state, died July 28 in Alexandria, Va. She was 86.Peggy Cifrino, former chief aide to Colin Powell, who died in 2021 at 84, confirmed the death but did not provide the cause.In a career mostly as a military spouse, Mrs. Powell also was a children’s book author and served on the board of America’s Promise Alliance, which focuses on civic engagement, education and workforce development.She married Powell, then a lieutenant in the Army, shortly before he left for his first deployment to Vietnam in 1962. Her husband rose to the rank of general, becoming the first Black national security adviser in 1987 and the youngest and first Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1989.He retired from the military in 1993, was appointed secretary of state by President George W. Bush in 2001 and spent four often-beleaguered years in that job amid the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.The Powells moved more than 20 times during Colin Powell’s decades of active-duty service, and Mrs. Powell took a leading role helping other military families prepare for similar adjustments with their families. She was also a member of the Arlington Ladies, a group that attend funerals of service members at Arlington National Cemetery.After her husband reentered civilian life, Mrs. Powell began to focus her energies more on education issues and improving children’s lives.The couple were key to launching America’s Promise Alliance in 1997, and Mrs. Powell held several positions on its board, including her most recent post of chair emeritus. She also wrote two children’s books to support the mission of the organization, called “America’s Promise” and “My Little Red Wagon,” aimed at encouraging children to give back to their communities, according to publisher HarperCollins.From 1989 to 2000, she was chair of the National Council of the Best Friends Foundation, which aims to improve the lives of young girls.Mrs. Powell, who was appointed to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts board during Bill Clinton’s presidency, was also picked to be on an advisory board for historically Black colleges and universities in 2010 by President Barack Obama. She sat on many other boards and won service awards.Alma Vivian Johnson, the oldest of two daughters, was born in Birmingham, Ala., on Oct. 27, 1937. Her father was the principal of one of Birmingham’s Black high schools, and her mother ran a day care, according to the obituary sent by Cifrino.In 1957 she received a bachelor’s degree in speech and drama at Fisk University, a historically Black college in Nashville. She returned to her hometown and briefly hosted an afternoon radio show that played music and discussed household tips.She soon relocated to Boston, where she studied pathology and audiology at Emerson College and worked for the Boston Guild for the Hard of Hearing by providing hearing tests, fitting veterans with hearing aids and teaching the deaf to read lips, according to the family obit. She was set up on a blind date with Colin Powell in 1961.They married the next year, at the First Congregational Church in her hometown, and she did not complete her graduate education.Survivors include three children, Michael, Linda and Annemarie, and several grandchildren. Michael Powell, a lobbyist, served as Federal Communications Commission chairman under President George W. Bush.Mrs. Powell supported her husband throughout his military career, but she was opposed to him running for president, The Post reported, and despite entreaties from leaders of both parties, he said he was unenthusiastic about campaigning for high office.The Post’s Bob Woodward asked the former general a few months before his death, “Who was the greatest man, woman or person you have ever known?""“It’s Alma Powell,” he said. “She was with me the whole time. We’ve been married 58 years. And she put up with a lot. She took care of the kids when I was, you know, running around. And she was always there for me and she’d tell me, ‘That’s not a good idea.’ She was usually right.”"
88,CNN_40,A historic mining community is decimated as firefighters battle massive wildfires in Western United States,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/us/park-fire-paradise-california-chico/index.html,"
Wildfires are raging out of control in the Western United States and Canada – destroying homes, forcing evacuations and injuring residents. One inferno has reportedly destroyed the historic mining community of Havilah. Another has scorched more than 360,000 acres of California – an area larger than the city of Phoenix. Here’s the latest:


            • Borel Fire ravages historic mining community: The fire in Kern County, California, “swept through the community of Havilah and Piute Meadows Ranches,” CalFire said. Havilah was discovered in 1864 and for more than 20 years served as an active mining center, according to California State Parks. The Borel Fire had burned more than 50,000 acres and had zero containment as of Sunday night.

            • Hope for stopping wildfires’ spread: The weather forecast for the Northwest calls for lighter winds than the area has seen in recent days, giving firefighters some optimism about slowing the progress of the Park Fire, along with more than 100 large wildfires burning across the region, consuming thousands of acres. Temperatures across much of the West will be at or below average to start this week, with forecast highs through Tuesday ranging between the 60s and 70s along the Pacific Coast and the 70s and 80s in the inland Pacific Northwest.
    

            • Park Fire is largest active wildfire in the US: The Park Fire, the seventh-largest wildfire in California history, is now at more than 360,000 acres or 560 square miles. The fire has destroyed 100 structures and threatens thousands more, according to CalFire. It was 12% contained as of Monday morning but evacuations warnings or orders remained in Butte, Tehama, Plumas and Shasta counties. Lower winds from the south could help take pressure off the fire’s eastern edge. President Joe Biden has directed his administration to do everything possible to support ongoing fire suppression efforts, according to a White House official.
    

            • Arson suspect to be arraigned Monday: A 42-year-old man, identified as Ronnie Dean Stout II, has been arrested after being accused of igniting the Park Fire. The man is suspected of pushing a burning car 60 feet into a gully, spreading flames that caused the inferno, Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said.

            • Progress fighting Durkee Fire in Oregon: The Durkee Fire is the largest wildfire burning in Oregon, at more than 288,000 acres. It has injured three people and destroyed four residences. The fire was 49% contained as of Monday morning, according to InciWeb, and the figure could improve as winds calm and humidity levels moderate.
    

            • Crews to see more challenges in Jasper, Alberta: Though weekend rain helped firefighters combat the Jasper Wildfire Complex – the park’s largest wildfire in more than a century – warmer weather in the days ahead might present further challenges. Temperatures in the area have dropped and there is a chance of showers Monday, with highs expected in the upper 60s to mid-70s and rising through the week. Wildfire danger for the southern areas of the province remain very high to extreme, according to Melissa Story, spokesperson for Alberta Wildfire. “This area did not see the moisture as the other areas of the province did,” Story said.
    

            • Air tanker pilot who died fighting fire in Oregon identified: James Bailey Maxwell, an experienced pilot who logged about 24,000 hours of flight time in his 54 years of flying, died after his single-engine air tanker crashed while working near the Falls Fire in Oregon Thursday, according to a statement from the US Forest Service – Malheur National Forest. “He is survived by and will be missed by family members in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington,” the statement said. The Falls Fire began on July 10 and has since burned more than 142,000 acres and is 57% contained as of Sunday, according to InciWeb.
    

            The Borel Fire has destroyed the historic mining community of Havilah, with only a few buildings left standing, the Los Angeles Times reported.
    

            “We lost everything — it’s all gone,” resident Sean Rains told the Times on Sunday. “This whole town burned down. Multiple people, friends that I know — everybody lost everything.”

            The number of homes and businesses destroyed in Havilah – population 250 – is still being assessed, fire officials said at a weekend news conference. But evacuation orders have been in effect, according to Jim Snow, one of the incident commanders.
    

            Fueled in part by red-flag conditions – such as warm temperatures, very low humidities and strong winds – the Borel Fire has exploded in growth. It scorched 30,000 acres in a 24-hour period, Snow said.
    

            Despite 1,200 personnel assigned to the inferno, the blaze was 0% contained as of Sunday.
    

            “Some of those edges of the fire, with rapid growth, we’re having to chase down rather than stand in front of it,” Snow said. “We have had some light injuries on the incident – a lot of heat-related injuries.”
    

            Cloud and smoke coverage allowed firefighters to increase containment lines around the Park Fire Saturday, but the challenges returned on Sunday, CalFire Incident Commander Billy See said.
    

            While some areas were downgraded from evacuation orders to warnings, spot fires prevented officials from lifting or changing more orders and warnings, officials said.
    

            “We are working really hard to get people back into their house as soon as possible,” Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea.

            Conditions have not been favorable for crews, Yuba City Fire Department spokesperson and firefighter Jeremy Hollingshead told CNN.
    

            “It was a wind-driven fire, it was a topography-driven fire, fuel-driven fire, everything was stacked against us,” Hollingshead said. “At that point in time, we threw everything we had at it, but again, we’re not going to put anybody at the head of this thing. What we had to do was put crews in the high-risk areas, where structures could possibly burn and do the best work they can there.”
    

            He added firefighters took advantage of more favorable conditions to try and get a better handle on the blaze.
    

            “Firefighters right now, from the sky to the ground, they’re taking advantage of the break we do have in the weather, so hopefully in the next few days we can mitigate a lot of that threat,” Hollingshead said.
    

            Chico, California, the largest city in Butte County where the Park Fire is ongoing, will see temperatures in the low 90s for Monday and Tuesday, a significant drop from the triple digit temperatures of last week. Winds continue to decrease for the Park Fire area as well, with sustained winds below 10 mph Monday, and as low as 5 mph by Tuesday.
    

            There is even a weak storm system approaching the Pacific Northwest, expected to bring some shower chances. This amount of rainfall is helpful as it doesn’t lead to as great of flash flooding risk for burn scars.
    

            The massive Park Fire, believed to be the result of arson, forced thousands to flee their homes after igniting Wednesday near Chico, California, consuming thousands of acres per hour, burning dozens of structures and leaving behind graveyards of burned trees and cars.
    

            Retired Chico firefighter John Maretti told CNN he has lost his house in the Park Fire despite preparing as best he knew how.
    

            “I bought a bulldozer. We cleared things out. We made sure that we had a Class A roof and non-flammable walls. We did a lot. We had sprinklers. We had hoses. I mean, I’m a firefighter. I set this up for maximum opportunity for the house to make it and it did not, Maretti said. “There’s just no way that anybody could have survived with this house.”
    

            Despite the destruction of his property, Maretti said he felt fortunate the household – including two dogs and a cat – had escaped unharmed – something he credited, in part, to breaking his ankle last Monday.
    

            “I felt very capable staying. And I have hoses, I have all sorts of equipment, but with a broken ankle, there’s just no choice. I had to leave. And fortunately, because I had the broken ankle, I probably saved my life, because I probably would have stayed and tried to fight it, which would have been the wrong decision,” he said.
    

            Maretti said the speed at which the fire had spread wasn’t what he was used to.
    

            “So this was just a lot faster fire than I’d ever seen,” Maretti said. “This is just an angry fire, and completely different than anything I’ve ever seen before.”
    

            A Tehama County resident described to CNN affiliate KOVR fleeing the Park Fire on the only exit road out of their neighborhood – which the blaze had already jumped.
    

            “When we saw the fire coming over the ridge, which it did, it was coming at us. We thought that was bad. And then we put everything in the car and took off,” Jim Young told KOVR.
    

            “We get on the highway and it is burning on both sides for 10 miles. It was like driving through an inferno,” Young said.
    

            The Park Fire is burning in Butte County, where California’s deadliest wildfire, the Camp Fire, killed more than 85 people and destroyed thousands of homes in 2018.
    

            Bruce Hey and his brother-in-law Christopher Apel told KOVR that the blaze had forced them to evacuate their adjoining properties in the Cohasset area.
    

            “We had a lot of people who were staying there from the Camp Fire and … and everything is burning,” Apel told KOVR.
    

            Hey said that he drove through the blaze to safety, but burned his arm in the process.
    

            “I tried to outrun it,” he said. “I wouldn’t have gotten burned if I hadn’t rolled down the window to look in the rearview mirror. I was right in the middle of it and I was trying to put it in reverse.”
    

            Jasper, a popular tourist town in the middle of Alberta’s Jasper National Park, has seen widespread destruction due to the wildfire there, which has scorched just under 90,000 acres.
    

            The park remains closed and more than 17,000 people are still under evacuation orders, Jose Tilney, deputy managing director of the Alberta Emergency Management Agency, said Sunday afternoon.
    

            Almost 40% of all structures in the city have been destroyed by the Jasper Wildlife Complex fire, data released Saturday by the Municipality of Jasper show.
    

            Of the 1,113 structures in the town, 410 were reported to be destroyed, and 10 sustained visible damage, the Jasper Rapid Visual Damage Assessment said.
    

            The fire remains “out-of-control and is expected to become more active over the coming days with warmer weather,” Parks Canada said.

108,CNN_73,Protests erupt in Venezuela as questions grow over strongman Maduro’s victory,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/americas/venezuela-election-results-maduro-opposition-intl-latam/index.html,"
            Protests broke out in several Venezuelan cities on Monday after authoritarian leader Nicolás Maduro was formally declared a winner by the county’s electoral authority in a presidential race marred by accusations of electoral fraud.
    

            In the capital of Caracas, security forces deployed tear gas to disperse a large crowd of protesters, while crowds of people were seen walking down a main road banging pots and pans as anger rose over Maduro’s victory on Sunday. PROVEA, a Venezuelan human rights organization, said pro-Maduro armed groups shot at peaceful demonstrators in Avenue Urdaneta.
    

            Protests were also reported in other cities, including Maracay, where opposition activist Esthefania Natera told CNN that people were on the streets “to yell and demand to tell the truth because we know the real results.” In the coastal state of Falcón, demonstrators toppled a statue of Maduro, video on social media showed.
    

            The next 24 hours will be key in seeing how Maduro responds to the allegations against him. Analysts say there could be a new wave of unrest in the country if there are widespread protests against the regime. Street demonstrations in previous years were crushed by the country’s military, which has long supported Maduro and his predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez.
    

            Maduro smiled as he entered the National Electoral Council (CNE) before a Monday ceremony at which he was declared the winner, receiving cheers and congratulations from many in the audience. The CNE, which is stacked with Maduro allies, has yet to issue final vote tallies from Sunday’s election.
    

            “Venezuela has the best electoral system in the world!” CNE president Elvis Amoroso announced before proceeding with the formal announcement.
    

            But the vote was riddled with claims of irregularities. It included opposition witnesses being denied access to the National Electoral Council (CNE) headquarters as votes were counted and the electoral authority allegedly prevented more votes from being processed. The government has also been accused of rigging votes in the past, which it denied.

            The US on Monday joined Venezuelan civil society groups and the opposition by calling on Venezuela’s government to “immediately” release specific data on the presidential election, citing concerns about the credibility of Maduro’s victory.
    

            Maduro’s government controls almost all state institutions, including the CNE, which was accused in 2017 of manipulating turnout figures by a software company that provided the voting technology. The CNE previously denied the assertion.
    

            The opposition coalition, headed by Maria Corina Machado, earlier rejected Maduro’s win, saying the opposition’s records show that opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez received 70% of the votes against Maduro’s 30%. “We won, and everyone knows it,” Machado said. The coalition plans on making a statement later on Monday.
    

            Machado is part of a unified opposition movement that overcame their divisions to form a coalition known as the Democratic Unitary Platform. Its energized campaign, which enjoyed strong polling figures prior to Sunday’s vote, was seen as the biggest challenge to Maduro’s rule.
    

            The United States is among regional leaders, including Peru and Chile, that have raised questions about the validity of the result.
    

            Brazil, an important regional player, was softer in tone but said it was awaiting “the publication by the National Electoral Council of data broken down by polling station, an essential step for the transparency, credibility, and legitimacy of the election results,” according to a statement by the foreign ministry.
    

            Venezuela’s government, in turn, said it was expelling diplomatic staff from Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Peru, Panama, the Dominican Republic, and Uruguay, calling them “right-wing Washington-subordinate governments” who were committed to “the most sordid fascist ideological positions.”
    

            Only a very limited number of election observers were allowed to monitor the vote. These included The Carter Center and the United Nations, which also called on the country’s election commission (CNE) to publish polling station-level results.
    

            “The Carter Center has a big responsibility on their shoulders,” Laura Cristina Dib, the Venezuela Program director at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), told CNN, explaining that it is the only international technical observation mission that can issue a public report on the results. It is unclear when it will be issued.
    

            Senior Biden administration officials said Venezuelan election authorities must release the “detailed precinct-level results” from the election. One senior administration official noted that this data is required under Venezuela law and should be immediately available. Another said that if the election results are credible, “then this should be a very simple act and one that they would be able to fulfill quite easily.”

            The officials declined to give specifics on the actions the US or international community would be prepared to take if the Venezuelan authorities do not release the data or if the results are determined to be fraudulent, but they did not rule out sanctions.
    

            US sanctions against Venezuela were first imposed in 2017 and gradually increased as the South American country’s political crisis deepened in the following years.
    

            The opposition’s accusations cast doubt on Venezuela’s return to the international stage after Maduro pledged last year to hold free and fair elections in US-brokered talks, in exchange for sanctions relief.
    

            The vote’s outcome is expected to be felt across the Americas – including the US – in the form of migration.
    

            Under Maduro’s watch, up to 8 million Venezuelans have fled the country amid unprecedented levels of poverty and economic mismanagement – thousands of whom have trekked north to the US’s southern border. If Maduro remains in power, one poll conducted in June estimates up to a third of the population is considering leaving the country after the election.
    

            According to Will Freeman, a fellow for Latin America studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, such a situation “could be a really bad October surprise for the Democrats” in the upcoming US presidential election.
    

            If Maduro is inaugurated next January, it would be his third consecutive six-year term and the continuation of “Chavismo,” the left-wing populist ideology named after Chávez.
    

            Chávez ruled Venezuela for 14 years until his death in 2013. His policies were dominated by nationalization and the redistribution of the nation’s huge oil wealth to the marginalized and poorest communities, as well as a constant push to protect Venezuelan sovereignty against “imperialist” powers.
    

            But the oil-rich nation has in the past few years experienced the world’s worst peacetime economic crash in recent history. Maduro has blamed foreign sanctions against his regime on the downturn, saying Venezuela is victim of an “economic war.”
    

            A loss in the election could have devastating consequences for Maduro, who is facing drug trafficking and corruption charges in the US and is under investigation for crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. If he was to relinquish control, he could end up in prison.

            On Monday, the Venezuelan Attorney General’s Office said it will investigate alleged attempts to sabotage the presidential election held on Sunday without providing evidence.
    

            There was an “attack on the electrical system and a cyber attack against the data transmission system of the National Electoral Council,” Attorney General Tarek William Saab said, echoing claims made by Maduro.
    

            The strongman has allies on the global stage, including Russia, China, Nicaragua, Cuba, and Honduras, whose officials congratulated Maduro on his win.
    

            “I am confident that your activities as the head of state will continue to contribute to their progressive development in all directions,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said in social media post.
    

            “Remember that you are always a welcome guest on Russian soil.”

133,WaPo_55,Region braces for Netanyahu to decide Israeli response to Golan Heights strike,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/29/israel-hamas-war-news-gaza-lebanon/,"JERUSALEM — Civilians on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border braced Monday for the Israeli army to launch a counterstrike — of a scale, scope and intensity that is still unknown — after Israel’s security cabinet authorized a military response to the weekend rocket attack from Lebanon that killed that killed 12 people, most of them teenagers and children.The region was gripped with uncertainty, hoping for a calibrated, pinpoint response but prepping for a widespread assault that diplomats warned could erupt into a regional war. Residents of Beirut stocked up on emergency supplies in case the expected strikes reached as far the Lebanese capital. Hezbollah militants threatened to target Haifa and other Israeli cities if it did.Multiple airlines suspended flights in and out of Beirut. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hinted to supporters that Turkey could “enter” Israel if necessary.“The concerns that it could spin out of control are very high,” said an Israeli official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.Israel’s security cabinet authorized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister late Sunday to decide on the “manner and timing” of Israel’s response to Saturday’s rocket strike on a crowded soccer field in Majdal Shams, a Druze village in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.“For me, a Jewish child murdered … on October 7 or a Druze child murdered in the Golan Heights is the same thing,” Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Monday on a visit to the village. “Hezbollah will pay a price for this — our actions will speak.”Israel’s military struck a number of Hezbollah targets deep inside Lebanon on Sunday. Hussein Fakih, a spokesman for Lebanon’s civil defense, said in an interview that two people were killed and three people, including a child, were injured in a Monday strike on the road between Chaqra and Meiss El Jabal, in southeastern Lebanon. Later Monday, Hezbollah announced the deaths of two of its members.But Israel’s response so far has stopped short of the fierce retaliation Netanyahu pledged after the strike, the deadliest single attack on Israel since Hamas’s Oct. 7 rampage. The Israel Defense Forces released a list on Sunday of victims who were 10 to 16 years old.Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, has denied any connection to the attack, which followed months of cross-border skirmishes between the militant group and Israel’s military. Israeli and American officials say the evidence that the weapon was an Iranian rocket fired from a Hezbollah position is incontrovertible.Netanyahu is under pressure from tens of thousands of border residents who have been displaced from their homes for months to mount a decisive blow. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has pushed previously for Israel to drive Hezbollah away from the frontier and degrade its considerable military capabilities.But a flurry of diplomatic efforts from Washington, Paris and regional capitals commenced within hours of the attack, according to Western and Israeli officials familiar with the efforts to calm the situation. U.S. officials said Israel has a right to respond to the attack but also urged its ally to show restraint.Early signals suggested that Jerusalem may be listening. The Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper quoted unnamed Israeli officials describing the likely operation as “limited but significant.”Israel’s dilemma, according to current and former security officials, is how to answer the attack without leaving Hezbollah with no choice but to escalate in turn — which might draw Iran more directly into the fight. The Israeli military keeps a range of target scenarios on the shelf, regularly updated with new intelligence, according to a military official who described readiness planning to The Washington Post on a visit to the border zone in the spring.Planners will also be looking at recent responses. Earlier this month, following a drone attack launched by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen that killed one person in Tel Aviv, Israel responded a day later with a withering strike that severely damaged a major Yemeni port.In April, after Israel and allies shot down most of an unprecedented barrage of missiles and drones fired from Iran, the military answered with a calibrated counterstrike that showed its ability to reach into Iranian territory but did minimal damage. Both sides stood down.One day after scenes from a mass funeral and devastated mourners from Majdal Shams, tensions remained high.Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, hit back at vague suggestions Sunday from Erdogan that Turkey could enter Israel as it had done in the past in Libya and Nagorno-Karabakh, a region in Azerbaijan.Katz and Turkish leaders, who have been sharply critical of Israel’s war in Gaza, have been exchanging hot-tempered statements for months.“Just as the genocidal Hitler met his end, so will the genocidal Netanyahu,” the Turkish Foreign Ministry posted Monday on social media.Erdogan did not provide any more detail in his remarks, which were made in a televised address in his hometown, according to Reuters. A Turkish political analyst downplayed the significance of the comment, saying it was in keeping with Erdogan’s recent bellicose rhetoric toward Israel.Lebanon’s main airline, Middle East Airlines, rescheduled flights to and from Beirut on Sunday and Monday, citing “technical reasons related to the distribution of insurance risks.” Among the departures affected by the delays were Monday flights to Cairo; Nice, France; and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. German airline Lufthansa said in a statement that it was suspending flights to Beirut through Aug. 5 — including from subsidiaries Swiss and Eurowings — because of “current developments in the Middle East.”Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed his condolences for those killed in the Majdal Shams attack in a call with Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Monday, in addition to emphasizing “the importance of preventing escalation of the conflict,” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said. British Foreign Minister David Lammy said on social media he spoke to Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati about the escalating tensions, with both agreeing that “widening of the conflict in the region is in nobody’s interest.”The majority of the Gaza Strip is under evacuation orders from Israel, with only 14 percent unaffected, according to Philippe Lazzarini, head of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, or UNRWA. The orders are “creating havoc + panic,” and people often have very little time to flee, he added. More than 200,000 Palestinians were displaced over the past week because of the orders, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said on social media.Conditions in Israeli prisons have deteriorated dangerously since Oct. 7, rights groups say, as detailed in a Post report. The Post spoke to former Palestinian prisoners and lawyers and reviewed autopsy reports and court records to reveal rampant violence and deprivation in Israel’s prison system, with routine beatings — usually with batons and sometimes with dogs — as well as psychological abuse and denial of sufficient food and medical care.At least 39,363 people have been killed and 90,923 injured in Gaza since the war began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, including more than 300 soldiers, and says 329 soldiers have been killed since the launch of its military operation in Gaza.Kareem Fahim and Suzan Haidamous in Beirut and Michael Birnbaum in Tokyo contributed to this report."

Follow along for live updates and highlights from the Summer Games in Paris.
176,WaPo_77,"This time, the USWNT has company at the Olympics: The U.S. men",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/29/usa-men-women-soccer-olympics-france/,"MARSEILLE, France — Before each of their respective Olympic soccer matches, U.S. women’s team captain Lindsey Horan and Walker Zimmerman, the elder statesman on a young men’s squad, exchange text messages wishing one another luck.For the first time since 2008, the men’s team joined the perennial women’s team in the tournament. And in a stroke of logistical fortune for the U.S. Soccer Federation and fans wishing to see both play, each side was drawn into first-round groups initially based in the south of France.The teams were staying in hotels about four miles apart in this Mediterranean port city and shared the same training grounds in Martigues, a canal-graced town about 25 miles northwest of Marseille’s famous waterfront.Because of preplanned off-day schedules, players have not been able to attend each other’s matches. And on Sunday, the men relocated 190 miles north to Lyon ahead of their group finale Tuesday in Saint-Etienne against Guinea.Nonetheless, the American soccer synergy was alive and well in Provence.“We are rooting them on, and it’s just really exciting to be here alongside them,” Zimmerman said. “We both have aspirations to really go far in this tournament, and hopefully we’ll meet up again in Paris.”Should results go their way in the coming days, both will head to Paris for quarterfinals on Friday (men) and Saturday (women) at Parc des Princes, France’s most famous soccer venue.Second in Group A behind France, the U.S. men (1-1-0) would secure one of the quartet’s two quarterfinal berths with a victory. A draw would also probably suffice. Even a defeat might not prevent them from their first visit to the Olympic knockout stage in 24 years.Having already clinched a place in the quarterfinals, the women (2-0-0) will aim to win Group B on Wednesday in Marseille against Australia (1-1-0).“I have a great relationship with Walker and great respect for him as a person and player,” Horan said. “We text each other before every game, wishing each other good luck and good luck to the teams.”Horan continued, “It’s really special to have the men’s team at the Olympics because we haven’t had that in a while. To have both teams here in Marseille for a few days and be able to share this experience is one of the things that makes the Olympics unique.”The U.S. men played their first two matches at Stade Vélodrome in Marseille, losing to France and defeating New Zealand, while the women traveled 120 miles east to Nice and defeated Zambia before returning to Marseille for a 4-1 rout of Germany on Sunday.Per tradition, Olympic soccer is played not only in the host city but throughout the host country. Lyon, Bordeaux and Nantes are also among the seven cities staging matches.The women’s players have been watching the men’s games in their meal room. The men say they have watched the women’s games in their hotel rooms or treatment room and caught highlight packages.“It’s great that they won [Sunday], and it’s obviously something we’re proud of,” center back Miles Robinson said. “We’re rooting for them.”Right back Emily Fox has taken a particular interest in Kevin Paredes’s performances, and vice versa. Both are from Northern Virginia.The women’s players are not as familiar individually with their male counterparts here as those on the men’s national team because this men’s competition is primarily for players 23 and under. (The women are allowed to field their full national team.)One exception to the men’s roster rule is Zimmerman, a 31-year-old center back who was among Coach Marko Mitrovic’s three over-aged selections.Two years ago, the 2022 World Cup starter was instrumental in forging collective bargaining agreements that provided pay equity for the women’s team, following years of labor acrimony with the USSF. The teams now pool and share tournament prize money.Missing the chance to attend Olympic women’s group matches has been a “bummer,” Zimmerman said. “I’ve been trying to link up with some of them, and it’s just so hard with the schedules and how quick the turnaround is” between matches.After the men’s 4-1 victory over New Zealand, Zimmerman half-jokingly credited the women, who’d scored three times in the first half against Zambia, for galvanizing his team’s fast start.“Being up at the half 3-0 was probably inspiration from the women’s team,” he said. “We saw they can do it; we wanted to join in on the fun.”"
181,WaPo_85,Flash flood at Dollywood forces fans to flee in high water,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/07/29/dollywood-flood-video/,"Dollywood fans enjoying a summer weekend had to flee the Tennessee theme park Sunday after strong storms sent floodwaters rushing through the park, forcing some to wade through nearly waist-deep water to get to their cars.Photos and videos captured on social media showed brown water surging through pedestrian areas and building up in the parking lot.“Craziest Dollywood experience in my almost 32 years of going,” one person wrote in a TikTok video that showed torrential rains and crowds in ponchos exiting the park in Pigeon Forge, Tenn.The resort, which is co-owned by country music superstar Dolly Parton, reopened at noon on Monday after visitors were forced out by the rushing waters Sunday. Two rides that need additional cleanup will be delayed, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported.In a statement on social media, Dollywood wrote that one minor injury had been reported amid the thunderstorm and flash flooding. Fire and police workers from Pigeon Forge helped direct “guests to safety during the storm,” the statement said.The flooding came as slow-moving thunderstorms passed over the area Sunday evening. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning at 5:39 p.m. that remained in effect until 10:45 p.m. The Weather Service said up to 4 to 5 inches of rain caused “multiple road closures, washouts, and even mudslides” in the area.“While the volume of rain was difficult for both the park’s and the city’s infrastructure to manage, the fact we have only one minor injury illustrates how well our hosts handled the situation and how well our guests followed their directions,” Dollywood public relations director Wes Ramey said in a statement.The forecast calls for the possibility of repeated showers and storms between Monday night and Tuesday night that could bring damaging winds in addition to more flooding. Some areas could see an additional 3 inches or more rainfall, the Weather Service said.Please see this park update for Sunday, July 28, and Monday, July 29.Bryan McCarter, vice mayor of Sevier County, wrote on his Facebook page Sunday night that “significant flooding” was occurring in parts of the county. He wrote that several roads — including one near Dollywood — were closed because of water or washout.Several people wrote on social media accounts that they were not able to leave the parking lot because of the floods.“Didn’t have being stranded in the @Dollywood parking lot due to major flooding on my 2024 bingo card,” one person wrote on X with a video of cars driving onto flooded streets as rain continued pouring.“Dollywood is supporting guests whose vehicles were affected by this weather event,” the park’s statement said.The theme park is eight miles north of Great Smoky Mountains National Park and 35 miles southeast of Knoxville, Tenn.Ramey said in the statement that the park will honor tickets with Sunday’s date for a future visit. The park will also accept rain checks that were provided.“We will evaluate the response to determine if any changes are needed moving forward, but we are proud of our maintenance and operations teams for their hard work that allowed us to reopen less than 24 hours after an unprecedented flooding event like this one,” he said."
184,WaPo_93,Northern lights could reach midlatitudes early this week. How to see them.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/29/northern-lights-aurora-us-forecast/,"Since the weekend, the sun has unleashed multiple waves of plasma that are set to bombard the Earth’s atmosphere and potentially bring colorful displays of the northern and southern lights.The lights, or auroras, may be visible Monday and Tuesday nights, especially in the high latitudes. It’s possible that the northern lights display will reach into the midlatitudes — as far south as Oregon and the lower Midwest, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).The potential for the aurora activity comes as the sun is near the peak of an 11-year cycle at which these plasma eruptions occur with greatest frequency. The eruptions, known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), originate from sunspot regions that tend to be particularly active around this solar maximum.A boisterous sunspot region is pointed at the Earth and began releasing CMEs over the weekend. According to SpaceWeather.com, some of them merged, forming a “cannibal CME,” which could produce a strong geomagnetic storm when it arrives at Earth. Geomagnetic storms are what cause auroras.Geomagnetic storms are rated 1 to 5 on the G-scale (G stands for geomagnetic), with 5 being the most intense. NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center is predicting conditions ranging from G1 to G3 through early Wednesday.A G3 storm often produces an aurora as far south as the northern half of the United States. Such storms can also have minor effects on power systems and disrupt satellite and low-frequency radio navigation.G1-G3 Watches are out for 29-31 July due to a number of possible CME arrivals. Solar activity increased over the weekend and the Sun has been erupting in solar flares up to include an X1 flare (R3-Strong) on Sunday evening. Visit https://t.co/9VAtkQeOwM... for the full story. pic.twitter.com/3VNJJ9CRgMIn May, a G5 storm hit the Earth, producing an aurora as far south as the tropics. By many accounts, it was the most widespread display in at least two decades.High-latitude locations such as Alaska, Canada and northern Europe have the best chance to see auroras Monday and Tuesday nights.Late Monday and toward Tuesday morning, when the geomagnetic storm may be strongest, the lights could extend south toward the midlatitudes.If the storm materializes as predicted, the lights may be visible into the Midwest, New England and the Pacific Northwest. Spots even farther south, including parts of California, the southern Plains and the Mid-Atlantic, could see a faint glow on the horizon, especially with the aid of long-exposure photography.However, because forecasting the arrival of CMEs is difficult, the timing of the most intense storm activity could shift.To follow the intensity of geomagnetic storm activity, consider monitoring the K-index. If and when this index reaches 7 or higher, that’s when auroras in the midlatitudes are most probable.The aurora forecast for tonight (7/29-7/30) calls for KP7/G3 conditions! Pending favorable data, aurora may be visible overhead in New England and the Midwest - and on the horizon as far south as North Carolina and Oklahoma. pic.twitter.com/5rvix7O5B3Best viewing will be where skies are clear and away from city lights. Clouds are most likely to interfere with viewing in the eastern United States and Pacific Northwest on Monday and Tuesday nights. However, even where clouds are forecast, it’s worth taking a peek outside, as there are sometimes unexpected breaks in the cloud canopy.Because the moon is in its last quarter phase, it will illuminate significantly less than when it was full about 10 days ago.The chance to see the aurora could extend beyond Tuesday night.Because a large sunspot region is facing Earth, there is the chance for more CMEs this week.“The active region is now directly facing our planet and in a great position for Earth directed eruptions,” SolarHam.com, an online resource for space weather and auroras, wrote on X."

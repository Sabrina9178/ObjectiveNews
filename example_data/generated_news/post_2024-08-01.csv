65,Hamas Leader Ismail Haniyeh Assassinated in Tehran; Blame and Reactions Differ,"Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, was assassinated in Tehran on Wednesday, with varying accounts and reactions emerging from the incident. The assassination occurred as Haniyeh was in the Iranian capital for the inauguration of President Masoud Pezeshkian.
The attack has been widely attributed to Israel by analysts and some media sources, given Israel's prior threats against Hamas leaders in response to the October 7 attack on Israel. This attack resulted in the deaths of 1,200 people and the abduction of approximately 250 others. While Israel has not officially confirmed its involvement and typically refrains from public comments on such matters, the nature of the attack and the timing suggest possible Israeli involvement.
Iranian officials, including Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian, have condemned the assassination, accusing Israel of orchestrating the killing and promising retaliation. Khamenei stated that Iran views the assassination as an act requiring revenge, while Pezeshkian vowed that Iran will respond to defend its honor.
Hamas has also condemned the assassination, calling it a significant escalation and a direct attack on their leadership. They have vowed to continue their resistance and not be deterred by the assassination.
International reactions have been mixed. Russia and Qatar have criticized the assassination as a violation of international norms and a threat to regional stability. They expressed concerns that the attack could exacerbate tensions and lead to further conflict in the region.
The details of how Haniyeh was killed remain unclear, and the incident is under investigation. The assassination adds to the ongoing volatility in the Middle East, where tensions between Israel, Hamas, and regional actors remain high.","<style type=""text/css"">

37,Trump’s Comments on Kamala Harris’s Racial Identity Draw Criticism,"Former President Donald Trump faced backlash on Wednesday for remarks made at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Chicago, where he questioned Vice President Kamala Harris’s racial identity. During a combative panel discussion, Trump claimed he only recently became aware of Harris's Black identity, stating, “I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black.” He further questioned whether Harris had always identified as Black or had only recently adopted the identity.
Trump’s comments were met with immediate criticism. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called the remarks “repulsive” and “insulting,” emphasizing that no one has the right to dictate another person’s identity. A source close to Harris described the comments as painful and false, highlighting Harris’s longstanding identification as Black alongside her acknowledgment of her Indian heritage.
Kamala Harris, the first female, Black, and Asian American vice president, has a history of embracing her Black identity. She graduated from Howard University, a historically Black college, and was a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, a historically Black organization. Her early career included leadership roles in Black legal and student organizations, and she has consistently identified as both Black and Indian throughout her public life.
Trump’s remarks also drew comparisons to his previous controversial statements, including his promotion of the ""birther"" conspiracy theory about former President Barack Obama and derogatory comments about other public figures of color. Trump’s responses during the panel included criticisms of the event’s organization and accusations of biased questioning from journalists.
The incident reflects ongoing debates and tensions surrounding identity and representation in American politics.","<style type=""text/css"">

0,"Kari Lake Wins Republican Primary, Set to Face Ruben Gallego in Arizona Senate Race","In the Arizona Republican Senate primary held Tuesday, Kari Lake emerged victorious, securing her position for the general election against Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego. Lake, a former news anchor and staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, led Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb by 54% to 40% with approximately 82% of the vote counted. Elizabeth Reye finished third in the race.
Lake, who gained national prominence for her promotion of Trump’s election fraud claims, will now compete for the Senate seat vacated by independent Senator Kyrsten Sinema. Her campaign has been marked by a strong MAGA-themed message and the endorsement of Trump. She faces the challenge of consolidating support within the GOP and appealing to independent voters in a crucial swing state.
On the Democratic side, Ruben Gallego, a Phoenix-area House member and Marine veteran, won his primary unopposed. Gallego, who has emphasized his bipartisan approach and focus on key issues such as abortion rights and economic relief, enters the general election with a notable financial advantage, reporting $8.2 million in campaign funds compared to Lake’s $2.1 million.
The upcoming Senate race in Arizona is considered pivotal in the context of the broader battle for Senate control. Polls indicate a competitive race, with Gallego currently leading Lake by 48% to 41% among registered voters. The dynamics of the general election will be influenced by the candidates' contrasting platforms and campaign strategies.","<style type=""text/css"">

10,Far-Right Protests Erupt in Southport Following Tragic Stabbing of Three Girls,"On Tuesday, Southport, England, witnessed severe unrest when far-right protesters clashed with police outside a mosque, one day after a tragic stabbing that claimed the lives of three young girls. The violence erupted following a peaceful vigil held in memory of the victims, who were attacked during a Taylor Swift-themed event at a local dance school.
Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the violence, stating that the protesters had hijacked a vigil meant to honor the victims and their families. The far-right group, believed to be affiliated with the English Defence League, engaged in destructive acts including throwing bricks, setting vehicles on fire, and attacking police officers. The unrest was fueled by false online rumors about the identity and background of the 17-year-old suspect arrested in connection with the stabbings.
Merseyside Police reported that over 20 officers were injured in the clashes, with eight sustaining serious injuries including fractures and concussions. Additionally, three police dogs were injured during the confrontation. The police clarified that the suspect, who was born in Cardiff and lived near Southport, was incorrectly identified on social media as an asylum seeker.
The stabbing incident, which resulted in the deaths of Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6, has been described as one of the most horrific attacks on children in the UK in recent decades. The local community, along with public figures including Prime Minister Starmer and singer Taylor Swift, expressed profound grief and solidarity with the victims’ families.
The Muslim Council of Britain criticized the exploitation of the tragedy to incite violence against the Muslim community, emphasizing that the attack was unrelated to Islam. They called for greater measures to combat far-right extremism and Islamophobia.
The violent protest and the stabbing have sparked a broader discussion on the rise of knife crime in the UK and the need for effective measures to prevent such tragedies. Authorities are continuing their investigation and urging the public to avoid spreading misinformation that could exacerbate tensions.","<style type=""text/css"">

15,Expanded Recall of Boar’s Head Products Due to Listeria Outbreak,"Boar’s Head has significantly expanded its recall of deli and poultry products in response to a multistate outbreak of listeria infections. The recall now includes approximately 7 million pounds of products across 13 states. As of Tuesday, 34 cases of listeria infection have been reported, including 33 hospitalizations and two fatalities in Illinois and New Jersey.
Originally, the recall encompassed over 207,000 pounds of deli meat, including liverwurst and ham, due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. The expansion, announced by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), includes 71 products manufactured from May 10 to July 29. These products were distributed nationwide and to international locations such as the Cayman Islands, Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Panama.
The initial recall followed a positive listeria test result from a liverwurst sample collected by the Maryland Department of Health. This led to the identification of the outbreak strain in products from Boar’s Head’s Jarratt, Virginia facility. The recall now includes all items produced at this facility.
Boar’s Head has temporarily halted ready-to-eat operations at the Jarratt facility and issued a statement expressing condolences for the affected families. Consumers are advised to dispose of or return any recalled products and to clean their refrigerators to prevent the spread of listeria.
The FSIS, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and state health departments are investigating the outbreak. Listeria, a foodborne illness, is particularly dangerous for older adults, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems. The CDC estimates around 1,600 cases of listeriosis occur annually in the U.S., with about 260 fatalities.","<style type=""text/css"">

16,California’s Park Fire Becomes Fifth-Largest Wildfire in State History Amidst Broader Fire Crisis,"The Park Fire, which began on July 24, has become the fifth-largest wildfire in California's history, having burned more than 386,000 acres (603 square miles). As of Tuesday, the fire is 18% contained and has destroyed at least 192 structures while damaging 19 others. Over 5,500 firefighters are working to control the blaze, which is fueled by dry grass and timber following a prolonged heat wave. The Park Fire's growth has been further fueled by triple-digit temperatures and high winds.
The fire has severely impacted communities, particularly in Butte County, where homes have been lost and evacuation orders have been in place. Public officials and local residents are calling for support and aid to help with recovery efforts, particularly in rural areas with limited resources.
In a related development, Ronnie Dean Stout II has been charged with arson in connection with the Park Fire. Stout, who has not yet entered a plea, is accused of starting the fire by pushing a burning car down an embankment. Authorities have noted that Stout was found with alcohol in his system, but they have not established a direct link between his intoxication and the fire. The case is ongoing, with additional charges possible and Stout being held without bail.
In addition to the Park Fire, wildfires are also affecting other regions in the Western U.S. and Canada. The Jasper Wildfire Complex in Canada has burned nearly 80,000 acres, leading to the evacuation of around 17,000 people. In Oregon, the Durkee Fire is 51% contained after burning over 293,000 acres. The National Interagency Fire Center reports that there are 89 large active wildfires across the U.S., covering more than 2 million acres.
The current wildfire season has been notably severe, with a substantial increase in the number of acres burned compared to the previous year. Authorities are preparing for continued challenges as temperatures and fire conditions are expected to worsen.","<style type=""text/css"">

24,Tesla Model S in Full Self-Driving Mode Involved in Fatal Crash Near Seattle,"On April 19, a Tesla Model S operating in Full Self-Driving (FSD) mode was involved in a fatal collision near Seattle. The crash occurred on State Route 522 when the vehicle struck a motorcycle, resulting in the death of 28-year-old Jeffrey Nissen. The Tesla driver, a 56-year-old from Snohomish County, admitted to being distracted by his phone at the time of the incident.
The Washington State Patrol confirmed that the Tesla was using its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) mode during the accident. This system, which requires driver supervision, is designed to assist with driving tasks but does not make the vehicle fully autonomous. The driver was arrested on suspicion of vehicular homicide due to his admission of distraction but has not yet been formally charged. The investigation is ongoing, with the final decision on charges pending from the Snohomish County Prosecutor.
Tesla’s Full Self-Driving technology has faced scrutiny and criticism, particularly in light of this incident. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is investigating the crash and has previously reviewed multiple incidents involving Tesla’s Autopilot system. Experts have raised concerns about the limitations of Tesla’s camera-only approach compared to systems that use additional sensors like lidars. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been vocal about the company's goals to achieve fully autonomous driving, but regulatory and technical challenges remain significant.
The incident highlights ongoing debates about the safety and effectiveness of self-driving technology and its implementation in vehicles. Tesla has faced regulatory challenges in the past and recently recalled many of its vehicles to improve software safety.","<style type=""text/css"">

26,Florida School Board Suspends Staffer for Allowing Transgender Daughter to Play on Girls’ Volleyball Team,"On Tuesday, the Broward County School Board in Florida voted to suspend Jessica Norton, a computer information specialist at Monarch High School, for 10 days without pay. This decision followed allegations that Norton permitted her transgender daughter to participate on the school's varsity girls' volleyball team during the 2022-2023 season, in violation of Florida’s Fairness in Women’s Sports Act.
The Act, signed into law in 2021, prohibits transgender girls from competing on girls’ sports teams at public schools. The school board's decision came after a district investigation and a recommendation by the district committee to suspend Norton, despite Superintendent Howard Hepburn’s initial recommendation for termination. Norton, who has worked with Broward County Public Schools for seven years, expressed her disagreement with the suspension decision, stating her commitment to her job and her belief that the suspension was unjust.
In addition to Norton’s suspension, Monarch High School was fined $16,500 and placed on probation for one year by the Florida High School Athletic Association (FHSAA) for violating the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act. The association’s letter also barred Norton’s daughter from participating in sports at any state school until November 2024.
Norton and her daughter faced significant personal challenges, including harassment and threats, following the controversy. Norton’s daughter, now 16, has since transitioned to online schooling. Norton’s legal team argued that she had no direct involvement in coaching or team selection, and the case remains part of a broader legal battle involving transgender student athletes.
Florida’s law is part of a larger national debate on transgender participation in school sports, with several states implementing similar measures. Norton and her daughter have sued Florida officials over the law, and the lawsuit is still pending.","<style type=""text/css"">

57,Study Finds Rising Cancer Rates Among Younger Generations Linked to Lifestyle and Environmental Factors,"A recent study published in the Lancet Public Health journal has revealed a troubling increase in cancer rates among younger generations, specifically Generation X and millennials. This study, conducted by researchers at the American Cancer Society, analyzed cancer diagnosis and mortality data from over 23.5 million patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2019.
The research highlights a significant rise in the incidence of 17 types of cancer among individuals born from 1990 onwards, compared to those born in earlier decades. Notably, cancers such as pancreatic, kidney, and colorectal have shown a marked increase in younger populations. While the exact causes are not fully understood, obesity is suggested as a leading factor. The obesity rates in the U.S. have surged from 13% in 1980 to over 40% in 2008, correlating with the observed rise in cancer cases.
In addition to obesity, the study points to other potential contributing factors, including dietary changes, sedentary behavior, environmental pollutants, and antibiotic overuse. Changes in the gut microbiome due to antibiotics and unhealthy diets are under scrutiny as possible links to the increased cancer rates.
The study also notes a rise in mortality rates for certain cancers among younger people, despite improvements in treatment. However, experts caution that while cancer rates in younger individuals are increasing, the majority of cancer diagnoses still occur in individuals over the age of 50.
The findings underscore the need for further research to identify specific causes and develop effective screening methods for younger populations. While improvements in diagnostics and treatment have been noted, the current lack of comprehensive screening for many cancers in younger people remains a significant concern. Researchers and healthcare professionals emphasize the importance of addressing this trend and enhancing preventive measures and early detection strategies.","<style type=""text/css"">

60,USA Basketball Team Defeats South Sudan 103-86 in Olympic Group Stage,"The USA men's basketball team secured a decisive 103-86 victory over South Sudan on Wednesday in their second group-stage game of the Olympics held in Villeneuve-D’Ascq, France. This win improves the U.S. team's record to 2-0 in Group B, ensuring their advancement to the quarterfinals.
The U.S. team took control of the game early, holding the lead for most of the contest after a tight start. The Americans led by as many as 21 points before South Sudan managed a brief comeback, cutting the lead to 10 in the third quarter. Despite this, the U.S. maintained their advantage and secured the win.
Bam Adebayo was the standout performer, scoring 18 points on 8-for-10 shooting, including two three-pointers. He also contributed seven rebounds and two blocks. The team's success was marked by a balanced offensive effort, with five players scoring in double digits. LeBron James added 12 points, six rebounds, and five assists to the team's total.
The game saw several changes in the U.S. lineup compared to their previous match against Serbia. Coach Steve Kerr opted to start Anthony Davis at center instead of Joel Embiid, and Jayson Tatum replaced Jrue Holiday in the starting lineup. Embiid did not play in this game, and Holiday joined the bench group alongside Adebayo, Kevin Durant, Derrick White, and Anthony Edwards. Tyrese Haliburton also made his first appearance of the Olympics, bringing the total number of players who saw action to 11.
The U.S. defense was effective, particularly from their second unit, leading to 19 turnovers by South Sudan. The American team's ball movement was fluid, and they capitalized on their opponents' mistakes. The victory followed a previous win against Serbia, further solidifying the U.S. team's strong performance in the group stage.
The U.S. will conclude their group play against Puerto Rico on Saturday.","<style type=""text/css"">

92,Ismail Haniyeh Assassinated in Tehran; Reactions and Impact on Ceasefire Efforts,"On Wednesday, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was reported to have been assassinated in Tehran. The exact details of the attack are unclear, and no party has officially claimed responsibility. However, analysts suggest that Israel might be behind the assassination, given its prior threats against Hamas leaders in response to the October 7 attacks on Israel.
The White House has not confirmed Israel’s involvement. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby stated that the U.S. is concerned about the potential escalation resulting from the assassination and emphasized that it could complicate ongoing ceasefire negotiations. The U.S. remains focused on achieving a ceasefire and providing humanitarian relief but could not provide details on how the assassination might affect these efforts.
Iranian officials, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have condemned the assassination, blaming Israel and pledging retaliation. Khamenei described the killing as an act that warrants revenge, while Iran's foreign ministry accused the U.S. of complicity due to its support of Israel.
Qatar’s prime minister criticized the assassination as a significant impediment to ceasefire talks, directly accusing Israel and highlighting the potential negative impact on negotiations. The assassination has heightened tensions and raised concerns about further regional instability.
The event follows recent escalations in the region, including a rocket attack by Hezbollah and subsequent Israeli retaliations. The impact of Haniyeh’s assassination on the broader conflict and ongoing negotiations remains uncertain.","<style type=""text/css"">

Ortberg, previously the CEO of Rockwell Collins, succeeds Dave Calhoun, who is retiring. Ortberg, an engineer by training, is expected to address ongoing safety and quality issues at Boeing, which reported a core operating loss of $1.4 billion for the second quarter—over three times the loss from the same period a year earlier.
Ortberg expressed his commitment to Boeing’s legacy and emphasized the importance of safety and quality. He acknowledged the significant work required to address the company’s current challenges. His appointment follows a period of turmoil under Calhoun’s leadership, marked by production issues, labor disputes, and financial difficulties, including the impact of the 737 Max crashes.
Boeing’s recent financial report also revealed a net loss of $1.4 billion for the second quarter, with revenue declining by 14% to $16.8 billion. The decision to appoint Ortberg was made after a thorough search, according to Boeing chair Steven Mollenkopf, who praised Ortberg’s reputation and experience in the aerospace sector.
Ortberg will also join Boeing’s board of directors. The company’s efforts to improve its financial stability and operational efficiency will be closely watched as Ortberg begins his tenure.","<style type=""text/css"">

147,Federal Reserve Maintains Interest Rates; Signals Possible Future Rate Cut Amid Mixed Economic Indicators,"The Federal Reserve decided to keep its benchmark interest rate steady on Wednesday, marking a full year at a 23-year high. The decision aligns with the Fed’s cautious approach towards managing inflation and economic stability. Central bank officials have indicated that a rate cut may be forthcoming, potentially as early as September, depending on future economic developments.
The Fed’s statement reflected a nuanced view of the current economic landscape. Inflation is described as “somewhat” elevated, a shift from previous descriptions of inflation as “eased but remains elevated.” This change suggests a reduced risk of inflation but indicates that the Fed is not yet ready to make adjustments without further data.
Economic data from recent months have been mixed. The U.S. economy grew at a robust annualized rate of 2.8% in the second quarter, surpassing previous expectations. Additionally, inflation, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, has slowed to 2.5% in June from 2.6% in May. Despite these positive indicators, the labor market shows signs of strain, with a slight increase in the unemployment rate to 4.1% and slower wage growth.
Some economists and financial analysts are calling for the Fed to act more decisively on rate cuts to prevent potential adverse effects on the labor market and economic activity. Conversely, there is also concern that the Fed’s cautious approach might delay necessary adjustments, affecting economic momentum and stability.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other officials have emphasized their commitment to achieving a “soft landing” for the economy, balancing inflation control with employment growth. The upcoming July labor market report will provide further insights into the health of the job market and could influence future Fed decisions.","<style type=""text/css"">

152,Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square USA Withdraws IPO Amid Investor Backing Issues and Revised Fundraising Goals,"Pershing Square USA announced on Wednesday that it is withdrawing its planned initial public offering (IPO), just one day after revealing a revised plan to raise approximately $2 billion in capital. The decision follows challenges in securing investor backing and a significant reduction from the original $25 billion fundraising target.
In a statement, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman noted that despite substantial investor interest, a critical question persisted: whether investors would be better served by waiting to invest in the aftermarket rather than participating in the IPO. Ackman indicated that the fund would revisit the IPO once a revised transaction plan is prepared.
The initial IPO plan had faced difficulties, including a key investor backing out and a downward adjustment of the fundraising target. Ackman’s recent high-profile activities, including his outspoken views on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and his political endorsements, have drawn considerable attention, potentially impacting investor sentiment.
Ackman, known for his activist investment strategy and significant influence in corporate turnarounds, had aimed to leverage his social media presence and reputation to attract everyday investors to Pershing Square USA. The fund was set to be his first new investment vehicle in a decade, underwritten by Citigroup Global Markets, UBS Securities, and BofA Securities.
Despite the withdrawal, Ackman emphasized that there was considerable interest in the fund and assured that a revised plan for the IPO would be presented in the future. The fund’s initial ambitious goals and the recent market dynamics will be re-evaluated as part of the revised strategy.","<style type=""text/css"">

160,US Women’s Soccer Team Advances to Quarterfinals After 2-1 Win Over Australia,"The U.S. women’s soccer team secured a place in the quarterfinals of the 2024 Paris Olympic Games with a 2-1 victory over Australia on Wednesday. The win allowed the team to finish the group stage with an unbeaten record.
Trinity Rodman scored the opening goal for the U.S. in the 43rd minute, converting a header from Sophia Smith. Korbin Albert added a second goal in the 77th minute with a long-range strike. Although Australia’s Alanna Kennedy scored in stoppage time to reduce the deficit, the U.S. managed to hold on for the win.
The U.S. women’s team topped Group B with nine points from three matches, having previously defeated Zambia and Germany. They will face Japan in the quarterfinals.
Historically, the U.S. women’s national team has been a dominant force in women’s soccer at the Olympics, with four gold medals in five Games since their debut in 1996. However, they have not won gold since 2012, finishing in the quarterfinals in 2016 and winning bronze in Tokyo 2021.
Under the guidance of new head coach Emma Hayes, the team has shown strong form in the group stages, scoring seven goals and conceding only once. Despite a strong performance throughout the tournament, midfielder Sam Coffey will be suspended for the quarterfinals due to a yellow card received in the match against Australia.","<style type=""text/css"">

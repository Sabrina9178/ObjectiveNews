1,Kamala Harris Emerges as Leading Democratic Presidential Candidate Following Biden's Withdrawal,"Following President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, Vice President Kamala Harris has quickly become the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. Biden's announcement, which he described as being in the ""best interest of my party and the country,"" has led to a swift consolidation of support around Harris.
Prominent Democratic figures, including House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar and Minority Whip Katherine Clark, have endorsed Harris, emphasizing her positions on reproductive rights, economic fairness, and healthcare. Aguilar described the upcoming election as a crucial battle for democratic values and criticized Trump’s policies, while Clark highlighted Harris’ achievements in lowering drug costs and expanding child tax credits.
In contrast, Trump’s political team has expressed skepticism about Harris, with former U.S. ambassador Richard Grenell labeling her as “unvetted” and “far left,” questioning her readiness for the presidency. This criticism underscores the ongoing debate over Harris’ qualifications and political stance.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar has praised Harris’ prosecutorial experience, asserting that it will be a significant asset in addressing Trump’s past actions. Meanwhile, Harris’ campaign has reported a substantial fundraising boost, raising $49.6 million in the wake of Biden's exit.
Despite the strong support Harris has garnered, her campaign will need to navigate the critiques and establish her position as the leading Democratic candidate in the upcoming primary contests. The primary process remains open, with Democratic delegates free to vote based on their personal convictions.","<style type=""text/css"">

18,"Kamala Harris Surges as Democratic Nominee Following Biden's Exit, Polls Show Mixed Results","Following President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris, recent polls have evaluated Harris’ position against former President Donald Trump. The data shows a complex picture of her candidacy.
A Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll conducted earlier this month indicates that 70% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents would be satisfied with Harris as the Democratic nominee. This is supported by a range of polls showing Harris performing comparably to or slightly better than Biden in hypothetical match-ups against Trump. For example, a New York Times poll in Pennsylvania and Virginia revealed Harris leading or performing similarly to Biden.
However, other polls present a less favorable view. A CNN survey shows Trump with a slight edge over Harris, with a 47% to 45% margin that falls within the margin of error. This suggests that while Harris may be a strong candidate, her chances of defeating Trump are not markedly improved compared to Biden’s.
Additional surveys reflect a diverse range of opinions among Democrats regarding potential replacements for Biden. The Economist and YouGov polls suggest Harris holds a higher net approval rating compared to other potential candidates such as Gavin Newsom and Michelle Obama.
Overall, while Harris has garnered significant support and endorsements, her effectiveness against Trump remains a subject of ongoing analysis and debate.","<style type=""text/css"">

42,US Airlines Struggle with Ongoing Flight Cancellations and Delays After Global Tech Outage,"The travel industry continues to face significant disruptions as more than 1,500 flights were canceled for the third consecutive day due to a global technology outage. This ongoing issue has led to widespread delays and cancellations across major US airlines.
The tech outage, which began after a flawed software update for Microsoft Windows systems by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, has impacted numerous industries worldwide. The disruption has affected an estimated 8.5 million devices, leading to operational challenges for airlines, banks, businesses, and health services.
Delta Air Lines has been notably impacted, with over 1,000 cancellations reported by FlightAware. The airline's CEO, Ed Bastian, stated that recovery efforts are ongoing, including restoring their systems and managing a backlog of customer service requests. Delta has also suspended unaccompanied minor travel until July 24 due to the ongoing issues.
Other airlines, such as United Airlines and American Airlines, have also faced challenges but have made progress in restoring operations. United reported that most systems have recovered, while American Airlines indicated a successful reestablishment of its operations.
The outage has led to significant delays and disruptions, with more than 8,500 flights delayed and many travelers experiencing long wait times and difficulties in receiving compensation. The Department of Transportation has called on airlines to adhere to customer service commitments, including offering refunds and timely reimbursements for affected passengers.
Despite the rollback of the flawed software update, recovery efforts are complex, requiring manual rebooting of thousands of systems. The full restoration of services is expected to take time, with ongoing reports of disruptions and delays.
The incident highlights the broader impact of technology failures on critical services and infrastructure, affecting various sectors beyond air travel.","<style type=""text/css"">

46,Hunter Biden Withdraws Lawsuit Against Fox News Over Miniseries Featuring Intimate Photos,"Hunter Biden has withdrawn his lawsuit against Fox News, which he had filed over the network’s miniseries that included intimate images of him. The lawsuit, initiated on June 30, 2024, alleged that the Fox Nation miniseries, ""The Trial of Hunter Biden,"" unlawfully used sexually explicit images of him and caused emotional distress, violating New York’s “revenge porn” law.
The withdrawal of the lawsuit occurred on the same day that President Joe Biden announced he would not seek reelection in 2024. The reason for the timing of the lawsuit’s dismissal has not been clarified by Biden's legal team, and no immediate response was received from Hunter Biden’s representatives.
Fox News had removed the miniseries from its streaming platform in April after receiving a legal warning from Biden's lawyers. The network defended the series as a dramatization based on publicly available information and newsworthy events related to Hunter Biden’s legal issues. Fox News described the lawsuit as meritless and politically motivated.
Hunter Biden, who faces ongoing legal challenges including a federal tax evasion trial and recent convictions on gun-related charges, has not been charged in connection with the allegations portrayed in the miniseries. His legal troubles have been a subject of public and media scrutiny.
The miniseries, released in 2022, presented a fictionalized courtroom drama about Hunter Biden’s legal troubles and foreign dealings. It included elements purportedly derived from documents found on a laptop that Biden claimed was either hacked or stolen.","<style type=""text/css"">

51,Global Software Outage Causes Widespread Disruptions Across Sectors,"A global software outage triggered by a flawed update from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike has led to significant disruptions across various sectors. The incident, which began late Thursday and into early Friday, impacted airlines, healthcare facilities, government services, and other critical sectors worldwide.
The outage was linked to a defect in a software update for CrowdStrike’s Falcon product, which is used by numerous organizations, including major banks, healthcare providers, and government entities. According to CrowdStrike, the issue was isolated to the Falcon software running on Microsoft Windows operating systems and did not affect Mac or Linux systems. The company confirmed that the problem was not related to a cyberattack and issued an apology for the disruptions caused.
The effects of the outage were extensive. Airlines experienced substantial delays and cancellations, with over 1,800 US flights canceled and more than 9,900 delayed on the third day of the outage. Major US carriers, including Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, reported significant operational issues, with Delta canceling over 3,500 flights. Public transportation systems in several regions, including Washington, DC, and New York City, also faced delays.
In healthcare, the outage led to delays and cancellations of medical procedures and appointments at several large hospital systems and cancer centers. Emergency services were briefly disrupted in some areas, including 911 services in Alaska and Arizona, but were restored by the afternoon.
Government agencies, including Social Security offices and various state departments, reported service interruptions. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded flights from several major airlines, and public transit systems in the Northeast were affected. The Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies are working to assess and address the fallout from the incident.
CrowdStrike has stated that they have deployed a fix for the issue and are working to ensure full transparency regarding the outage. Microsoft estimated that the problem affected approximately 8.5 million Windows devices, less than one percent of all Windows machines, but noted the broad economic and societal impacts due to the widespread use of CrowdStrike’s software in critical services.
As recovery efforts continue, the full extent of the financial impact and the steps for compensation to affected customers remain unclear.","<style type=""text/css"">

79,LeBron James Named Team USA Flag Bearer for Paris Olympics Opening Ceremony,"LeBron James, star of the Los Angeles Lakers, has been selected to serve as the male flag bearer for Team USA at the Opening Ceremony of the Paris Olympic Games, as announced by the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee on Monday. This marks a historic moment as James becomes the first NBA player to carry the American flag at an Olympic Opening Ceremony.
The Opening Ceremony, scheduled for July 26 at 1:30 p.m. ET, will feature a unique format this year. Unlike traditional ceremonies held inside stadiums, this year's event will take place along the River Seine. Athletes will be transported via river barges, navigating through the heart of Paris and arriving at a temporary arena set up across from the Eiffel Tower.
James, who is making his fourth Olympic appearance, was chosen by a vote of his fellow US Olympians. He will be joined by a female flag bearer, to be announced on Tuesday. Over 350 of the 592 US athletes expected to participate in the Games will take part in the ceremony.
In addition to his ceremonial role, James will compete in the men's basketball tournament, aiming to help Team USA secure another gold medal. The team, which includes other notable players such as Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, and Joel Embiid, will start their Olympic campaign against Serbia on Sunday.
James has previously won gold medals in the 2008 and 2012 Olympics and a bronze medal in 2004. Reflecting on his selection, he expressed his honor and pride, noting the significance of the role for himself, his family, and his hometown of Akron, Ohio.","<style type=""text/css"">

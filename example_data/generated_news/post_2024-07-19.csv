5,Houthi Rebels Claim Responsibility for Drone Attack in Tel Aviv,"On Friday, Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for a drone attack in Tel Aviv, resulting in the death of one person and injuries to at least five others. The explosion occurred in a central district near a US Embassy branch office but did not damage the embassy building or result in injuries to US personnel.
According to the Houthis, the attack was executed with a new drone capable of evading interception systems, intended as a response to Israel's military actions against Hamas in Gaza. The Houthis have vowed to continue their operations until what they describe as ""aggression"" against Gaza ceases.
Israeli officials confirmed that the drone, identified as an Iranian-made Samad-3, was detected by their aerial defense systems but was not intercepted due to a reported ""human error."" The IDF increased air patrols following the incident. There was no siren activation at the time of the attack, which has led to questions about the readiness and effectiveness of Israel’s defense mechanisms.
Emergency services responded to the explosion on Shalom Aleichem Street, treating the injured and securing the area. The Israeli military and police are continuing their investigation into the attack, including whether additional threats are present.
The incident highlights ongoing regional tensions and the broader implications of the conflict between Israel and various Iran-backed groups. The attack has also raised concerns about potential increases in drone capabilities and their impact on regional security.","<style type=""text/css"">

24,Trump and Vance Headline GOP Convention Amidst Controversies and Media Scrutiny,"Former President Donald Trump is set to deliver a major address on Thursday night at the Republican National Convention (RNC) in Milwaukee, concluding a four-day event dedicated to his nomination as the party’s presidential candidate for the upcoming November election.
On Wednesday, Trump's running mate, Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, made a notable introduction to the national stage. Vance, a prominent right-wing figure known for his robust opinions, shared insights from his background and military service post-9/11. His speech aimed to underscore his commitment to party unity and address significant national issues. However, Vance's unconventional choice to quote from Quentin Tarantino's film ""Pulp Fiction"" drew mixed reactions from attendees and critics alike.
The convention has also been marked by several controversies, including media coverage of President Joe Biden’s recent interview where he appeared to mix up names and historical facts. Biden's verbal gaffes, including mistakenly referring to J.D. Vance as ""Mance"" and misidentifying historical figures, have been widely reported, affecting public perception.
Additionally, Trump’s first public appearance since a recent assassination attempt at one of his rallies has drawn considerable attention. The convention has highlighted various speakers, including Kid Rock and Hulk Hogan, reflecting the diverse personalities and support within the GOP.
The RNC continues to showcase the party’s key figures and strategies, setting the stage for a highly anticipated election season.","<style type=""text/css"">

29,Thomas Crooks' Failed Assassination Attempt on Trump Sparks Congressional Response and Investigation,"Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old man charged with a failed assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, had posted a cryptic message on the gaming platform Steam, stating, “July 13 will be my premiere, watch as it unfolds.” This message was revealed during a Congressional briefing attended by Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, FBI Director Christopher Wray, and Deputy Director Paul Abbate. The timing of the post remains unclear, and no further details about additional posts have been disclosed.
Investigators are examining various aspects of Crooks' actions leading up to the incident, including his visits to the Trump rally location, the content of his cell phone, and his online search history. Crooks had images of both Trump and President Joe Biden on his phone, and his searches included dates of significant political events and information about major depression disorder. Despite these findings, authorities have yet to determine a clear motive for the attempted assassination.
The incident has also prompted political reactions. Following the briefing, GOP senators expressed dissatisfaction with the handling of the case. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has called for new leadership at the Secret Service, reflecting concerns about the agency's response to the threat.
The investigation into Thomas Crooks' motives and actions continues, and further updates are expected as new information becomes available.","<style type=""text/css"">

32,South Korea’s Supreme Court Rules in Favor of Health Insurance Benefits for Same-Sex Couples,"South Korea's Supreme Court has issued a landmark ruling stating that same-sex couples are entitled to the same health insurance benefits as heterosexual couples. This decision, announced on Thursday, addresses a dispute between a gay couple and the National Health Insurance Service, which had previously denied spousal coverage to the couple.
The case began when So Seong-wook and Kim Yong-min challenged the National Health Insurance Service after the agency revoked So’s status as a dependent of Kim. The Seoul Administrative Court initially sided with the insurance agency in 2022. However, in February 2023, the Seoul High Court overturned this decision, citing that the denial of spousal coverage to So was discriminatory, as heterosexual couples receive similar benefits.
Amnesty International has praised the ruling as a significant victory for equality and human rights in South Korea. The organization highlighted the decision as a major step towards combating systemic discrimination and fostering inclusivity. However, the ruling does not extend to the legal recognition of same-sex marriages in South Korea, which remains unrecognized.
Public opinion on gender issues in South Korea has been gradually evolving, but critics argue that the country still has considerable progress to make compared to other developed nations. The ruling reflects ongoing legal and social challenges faced by same-sex couples in the country.
So and Kim expressed their emotional reactions to the verdict, with So stating that he was moved to tears upon hearing the decision. Both hope that the ruling will pave the way for broader legal recognition of same-sex marriages in South Korea.","<style type=""text/css"">

36,Federal Appeals Court Dismisses Challenge to Tennessee Drag Show Restriction Law,"On Thursday, a federal appeals court dismissed a lawsuit challenging a Tennessee law that imposes strict limitations on public drag show performances. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court ruling that had deemed the law unconstitutional and had blocked its enforcement in part of the state.
The law, passed in 2023, restricts “adult cabaret performances” in public spaces or anywhere minors might be present, aiming to shield children from content deemed inappropriate. Violators of the law face potential misdemeanor charges, and repeat offenders could face felony charges.
Friends of George’s, a Memphis-based LGBTQ+ theater company that produces drag performances, had filed the lawsuit arguing that the law would negatively impact their operations. However, the appeals court ruled that Friends of George’s lacked the legal standing to challenge the law, stating that their performances did not fall under the law’s definition of “harmful to minors.” The court noted that the term has a specific legal definition under Tennessee law, which includes materials lacking significant literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for a reasonable 17-year-old.
The ruling was criticized by some as a potential infringement on free speech and a measure that could be used to discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community. A dissenting judge on the appeals court believed that the plaintiffs had the right to challenge the law, citing concerns that the law could unfairly target performances likely to be seen by minors.
The case has highlighted ongoing debates over the balance between public morality, free speech, and protection of minors. Despite the appeals court ruling, the law's enforcement remains blocked in Blount County due to a separate lawsuit, and similar debates continue in other Republican-led states regarding LGBTQ+ rights and public performance regulations.","<style type=""text/css"">

54,Ursula von der Leyen Re-Elected as European Commission President Amidst Far-Right Surge and Criticism,"Ursula von der Leyen has been re-elected to a second five-year term as President of the European Commission following a vote by EU lawmakers. The decision was confirmed by a secret ballot in the European Parliament, where von der Leyen secured 401 votes in favor and 284 against. She needed a majority of 361 votes out of 720 to be re-elected.
In her final pitch to the European Parliament, von der Leyen emphasized her commitment to investing in EU infrastructure, advancing the green transition, and establishing a European Defense Union. She also expressed a resolve to counteract extreme polarization and maintain strong support for Ukraine amidst ongoing crises.
Von der Leyen's re-election comes as the EU grapples with a shift towards the far right, evidenced by recent elections that saw significant gains for far-right parties. Despite this, von der Leyen received backing from several key political blocs, including the center-right European People’s Party (EPP), the Socialist and Democrats (S&D), and the Green bloc. Her proposals include enhancing defense capabilities, coordinating efforts for a Europe-wide air defense system, and boosting investment in digital and social transitions.
However, her tenure has not been without controversy. A recent ruling by the EU’s second-highest court criticized the Commission for its lack of transparency regarding COVID-19 vaccine contracts, a point that has drawn criticism from various quarters. Additionally, von der Leyen's remarks on Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s recent diplomatic efforts with Russia were seen as a strong stance against perceived appeasement.
As von der Leyen begins her second term, she faces the challenge of navigating a complex political landscape while addressing both internal criticisms and external pressures.","<style type=""text/css"">

68,Nancy Pelosi and Democratic Leaders Raise Concerns Over Biden’s 2024 Candidacy,"Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has privately expressed concerns to President Joe Biden about his prospects in the 2024 presidential race. According to sources briefed on the conversation, Pelosi indicated that polling data suggests Biden may struggle to defeat former President Donald Trump and warned that his continued candidacy could jeopardize Democratic chances in the upcoming House elections. Despite these concerns, Pelosi did not explicitly instruct Biden to withdraw from the race.
The conversation marked the second known discussion between Pelosi and Biden following Biden’s debate performance on June 27, which was perceived as problematic by some Democrats. In response to Pelosi’s concerns, Biden reportedly defended his candidacy by referencing polling data that he believes indicates he can win. During the call, Pelosi also requested input from Mike Donilon, Biden’s adviser, to review the polling data.
Pelosi’s concerns reflect broader apprehensions within the Democratic Party about Biden’s re-election bid. Influential Democrats, including Rep. Adam Schiff, have publicly called for Biden to reconsider his candidacy, citing doubts about his ability to secure a victory against Trump and concerns about the overall state of his campaign.
A spokesperson for Pelosi declined to comment on the specifics of the private conversation, emphasizing her respect for confidentiality. White House spokesperson Andrew Bates did not address the details of the call but reaffirmed Biden’s commitment to running for re-election and working with Congress on his agenda.
As the 2024 election approaches, the debate over Biden’s candidacy continues, with key Democratic figures weighing in on his potential impact on the party’s prospects.","<style type=""text/css"">

85,JD Vance’s RNC Speech Emphasizes Populism and Critiques Both Parties’ Policies,"On the third night of the Republican National Convention, JD Vance, Ohio Senator and Vice-Presidential nominee, took the stage to introduce himself to the American public and outline his vision for the country. Vance’s speech marked a significant moment in the convention, reflecting his populist and isolationist views, and aiming to present a contrast to the policies of President Joe Biden.
Vance, known for his memoir “Hillbilly Elegy,” used his address to highlight his personal background and economic vision. He criticized past trade agreements supported by both parties, including the North American Free Trade Agreement and trade deals with China, attributing economic hardships in American manufacturing towns to these policies. His speech sought to align with Donald Trump’s broader campaign message, emphasizing a commitment to blue-collar conservatism and a critique of both Democratic and Republican policies.
The convention also featured significant moments of controversy. Peter Navarro, a former Trump official, addressed the crowd after spending time in prison for contempt of Congress, and was met with a standing ovation. His rhetoric included sharp criticisms of Democrats and the judicial system. Additionally, Paul Manafort, a convicted felon pardoned by Trump, was present at the event, adding to the convention’s contentious atmosphere.
An emotional moment occurred when the families of 13 service members killed in the 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal criticized President Biden’s handling of the situation. The families expressed their dissatisfaction with Biden’s response and actions following the incident.
In a separate incident, Republican senators confronted Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle over security issues related to an assassination attempt on Trump, demanding explanations and expressing frustration with the agency’s handling of the situation.
Overall, Vance’s speech and the convention proceedings reflected a mix of personal narrative, populist rhetoric, and contentious political moments, aiming to position the Trump-Vance ticket as a force for change against the current administration.","<style type=""text/css"">

95,Russian Espionage Trial of American Journalist Evan Gershkovich Resumes Amid Controversy,"The espionage trial of American journalist Evan Gershkovich resumed in a Russian court on Thursday. The hearing, held behind closed doors, follows an earlier court session on June 26. Gershkovich, who is accused of spying for the CIA, has attended the court sessions in person. The trial, which was moved up from its original date at the request of Gershkovich's defense, will continue with further arguments scheduled for Friday.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has publicly asserted that there is ""irrefutable evidence"" of Gershkovich's involvement in espionage activities, though specific evidence has not been disclosed. Lavrov's comments align with earlier statements from Kremlin officials, who claim that Gershkovich was caught engaging in espionage related to Russia's military-industrial sector.
Gershkovich, a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, was arrested in Yekaterinburg in March 2023. Both Gershkovich and his employer have denied the charges, calling them baseless. The Wall Street Journal and U.S. government officials argue that Gershkovich is being used as a political pawn in a broader negotiation context, reminiscent of previous instances where Russia has detained foreigners for leverage in prisoner exchanges.
The trial process is unusually swift compared to typical Russian espionage cases, raising speculations that it might facilitate negotiations for a potential prisoner exchange. Lavrov has confirmed ongoing discussions related to such exchanges but emphasized that they must be conducted confidentially.
If convicted, Gershkovich faces up to 20 years in prison. The U.S. Embassy in Russia has requested permission to attend the hearings, underscoring the international attention the case is receiving.","<style type=""text/css"">

124,"Lou Dobbs, Pioneering Business News Anchor, Dies at 78","Lou Dobbs, a prominent business news anchor known for his influential roles at CNN and Fox Business Network, passed away on Thursday at the age of 78. Dobbs, who was a key figure in cable news since CNN’s inception in 1980, spent over two decades at the network before helping launch Fox Business Network in 2009.
Throughout his career, Dobbs was recognized for his contributions to financial journalism and broadcasting. Both CNN and Fox News have expressed their condolences, with CNN referring to Dobbs as one of the network's originals who helped shape its early years, and Fox News praising his role in pioneering cable news.
In his later years, Dobbs became a notable supporter of Donald Trump, using his platform to promote the former president’s views and, at times, conspiracy theories related to the 2020 U.S. election. His promotion of these theories contributed to legal challenges for Fox News, including defamation lawsuits from voting technology companies Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic. Fox Business Network canceled Dobbs' show in February 2021 in response to these controversies.
No cause of death has been disclosed. Dobbs is remembered by supporters and colleagues for his dedication to journalism and his significant impact on the industry. Tributes have highlighted his strong personality and commitment to his principles.","<style type=""text/css"">

129,Rep. Jamie Raskin Urges President Biden to Reconsider Reelection Bid in Private Letter,"Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, recently sent a private letter to President Joe Biden urging him to reconsider his decision to seek reelection. The letter, dated July 6 and first reported by The New York Times, has been obtained by CNN.
In the letter, Raskin provides a personal and reflective argument for why Biden might consider stepping down from the 2024 presidential race. Raskin draws analogies to historical figures such as George Washington and sports figures like baseball pitcher Pedro Martinez, suggesting that Biden's decision could be likened to these figures' decisions to relinquish power or step away from their roles at critical moments.
Raskin highlights concerns about Biden’s political and physical stamina, suggesting that these are not only medical but also political considerations. He emphasizes the strategic importance of Biden's decision for the future of American democracy and urges Biden to consult with his team and consider the broader implications of his choice.
Biden has consistently affirmed his intention to continue his campaign despite recent challenges and criticisms. Raskin’s letter reflects his respect for Biden’s leadership while also expressing a concern for the future direction of the campaign and the presidency.
No cause of Biden’s reconsideration was directly mentioned in Raskin’s letter, which focuses on the broader strategic and symbolic implications of the president’s potential decision.","<style type=""text/css"">

213,"Bob Newhart, Influential Comedian and Television Star, Dies at 94","Bob Newhart, a pioneering comedian and beloved television star, passed away on July 18 at the age of 94. Known for his deadpan style and unique comedic approach, Newhart’s career spanned several decades and left a lasting impact on the world of comedy.
Newhart first gained national prominence with his 1960 debut album, The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart. This album, which reached No. 1 on the Billboard charts, was a groundbreaking success, becoming the first comedy album to sell over one million copies. It set Newhart apart as a major figure in comedy and earned him Grammy Awards for Best New Artist and Album of the Year.
Throughout his career, Newhart distinguished himself with a comedy style that emphasized the absurdities of everyday life. His routines often featured him delivering monologues that involved one-sided conversations with imaginary characters. One of his notable skits involved a telephone conversation between Sir Walter Raleigh and the East India Company about tobacco, and another featured a security guard at the Empire State Building dealing with King Kong.
In addition to his success in comedy albums, Newhart became a prominent television star. He was the lead in two popular sitcoms: The Bob Newhart Show (1972-1978), where he played a psychologist dealing with eccentric clients, and Newhart (1982-1990), in which he portrayed an innkeeper in Vermont. The final episode of Newhart, featuring a memorable twist, remains a celebrated moment in television history.
Newhart’s influence extended to other comedians and television personalities, shaping the humor of notable figures such as Bill Cosby and Jerry Seinfeld. His work was characterized by a clean, understated delivery and a focus on clever, observational humor.
Beyond television and stand-up, Newhart made appearances in films, including Hell Is for Heroes (1962) and Catch-22 (1970). He also appeared in later TV shows and films, including a notable guest role on The Big Bang Theory, for which he won an Emmy Award in 2013.
Newhart’s contributions to comedy were recognized with numerous accolades, including the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. He was also inducted into the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame in 1992.
Newhart was born on September 5, 1929, in Oak Park, Illinois. After graduating from Loyola University Chicago and serving in the Army, he worked in various jobs before finding success in comedy. He continued to perform well into his 80s and made frequent appearances on television, including as a guest host for Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show.
He is survived by his four children, and his wife Virginia Quinn, whom he was married to for 60 years, passed away in 2023. The cause of Newhart’s death has not been disclosed.","<style type=""text/css"">

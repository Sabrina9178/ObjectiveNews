0,Israel Conducts First Airstrike on Yemen in Response to Houthi Drone Attack on Tel Aviv,"Israel has conducted its first airstrike on Yemen following a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) targeted the port of Hodeidah in Yemen, resulting in at least six fatalities and numerous injuries. The airstrikes were a response to the Houthi attack on Tel Aviv, which killed one Israeli and injured several others.
The IDF stated that the airstrikes were aimed at military targets used by the Houthi rebels and associated with Iranian arms smuggling. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the action, asserting that the port had been used to facilitate the supply of weapons to the Houthis and to attack international shipping.
The Houthis, an Iran-backed rebel group, condemned the strikes as a severe escalation and an attack on civilian infrastructure. They reported that the strikes had hit oil facilities and a power station. Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam criticized the Israeli action as an attempt to exacerbate the suffering of Yemeni civilians and urged further retaliation. Houthi army spokesperson Yehya Saree promised continued attacks on Israeli targets.
The conflict between Israel and the Houthis marks a new front in a regional conflict already strained by the ongoing war in Gaza and heightened tensions with other Iranian-backed groups like Hezbollah. The Houthis have been targeting shipping in the Red Sea since early October, following the escalation of violence between Israel and Hamas.
On Sunday, the IDF reported intercepting a missile launched from Yemen, while the Houthis claimed further missile launches in retaliation. The situation underscores the increasing complexity of regional dynamics, as Israel and its allies face multiple fronts of conflict involving various state and non-state actors.","<style type=""text/css"">

43,"Sheila Jackson Lee, Influential Texas Congresswoman, Dies at 74","Sheila Jackson Lee, a prominent Democratic congresswoman from Texas, passed away on July 19 at a Houston hospital at the age of 74. Jackson Lee, who announced in June that she was battling pancreatic cancer, was a notable figure in U.S. politics with a career spanning three decades.
Jackson Lee, born in Queens, New York, on January 12, 1950, earned her bachelor’s degree from Yale University and a law degree from the University of Virginia. She began her political career as a municipal judge and later served on the Houston City Council before being elected to Congress in 1994. She was recognized for her advocacy on racial and gender equality, as well as for her legislative achievements, including the establishment of Juneteenth as a federal holiday in 2021 and the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act in 2022.
Her career was marked by both significant achievements and controversies. Supporters praised her for her unwavering commitment to advancing civil rights and women’s issues. However, critics pointed to her high public profile, allegations of mistreatment of staff, and her approach to legislative work as being attention-seeking. Her tenure in Congress was also noted for her high staff turnover and accusations of personal and professional misconduct.
Jackson Lee’s legislative contributions included efforts to address racial injustice and violence against women. Despite facing criticism for her personal style and public behavior, she was a staunch advocate for her causes and remained a central figure in the Democratic Party.
She is survived by her husband, two children, and two grandchildren. Her passing marks the end of a long and influential career in American politics.","<style type=""text/css"">

61,Israel Strikes Houthi-Controlled Port in Yemen Following Drone Attack on Tel Aviv,"On Saturday, Israel conducted airstrikes on Hodeidah, a port city in Yemen controlled by the Houthi rebel group, in response to a drone attack by the Houthis on Tel Aviv. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) stated that the strikes targeted military and dual-use facilities, including oil storage and a power station. This marks the first Israeli military action in Yemen.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu justified the strikes as retaliation for the Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv, which killed one Israeli citizen and injured others. Netanyahu emphasized that the operation aimed to demonstrate Israel's capability to respond to threats and to deter further aggression. The IDF also cited ongoing Houthi missile and drone attacks on Israeli territory and maritime targets as reasons for the escalation.
The Houthi-controlled Al Masirah TV reported that the Israeli strikes resulted in at least three deaths and 87 injuries, many from severe burns. The Houthis condemned the strikes as ""brutal aggression"" and vowed retaliation against Israeli targets. Houthi military spokesperson Yehya Saree criticized the strikes for targeting civilian infrastructure and exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in Yemen.
International reactions have been mixed. The U.S. and U.K., which have previously conducted strikes against Houthi targets, did not coordinate with Israel on this operation but affirmed Israel's right to self-defense. Meanwhile, Iranian officials condemned the strikes, attributing the escalation to Israel's actions in Gaza and suggesting that Yemen's suffering was a consequence of regional conflicts.
The airstrikes have raised concerns about further humanitarian impacts in Yemen, where the port of Hodeidah is a critical hub for imports. Analysts warn that the destruction of oil facilities and power infrastructure could lead to severe fuel shortages and additional suffering for the Yemeni population.","<style type=""text/css"">

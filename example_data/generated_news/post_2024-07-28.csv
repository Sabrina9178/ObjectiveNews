0,FBI Confirms Bullet Wounded Trump in Assassination Attempt Amidst Controversy,"On Friday, the FBI confirmed that former President Donald Trump was struck in the ear by a bullet or a fragment from it during an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13. The statement resolved ongoing speculation about the nature of Trump’s injury, which had been a subject of debate following the attack.
Earlier in the week, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified before Congress that it was uncertain whether the projectile was a bullet or shrapnel. This testimony sparked backlash from Trump and his allies, who insisted that Trump was definitively hit by a bullet. Trump publicly criticized Wray's comments and reaffirmed his claim on social media, describing the injury as a bullet wound.
Additional analysis by trauma surgeons supported the notion that Trump’s wound was consistent with a bullet graze rather than shrapnel. These experts noted that the injury’s linear appearance and the nature of high-velocity rounds suggested it was caused by a bullet.
The FBI’s confirmation on Friday aimed to address the controversy and affirm the nature of the injury. The investigation into the attempted assassination continues, with the FBI dedicating significant resources to the case. The attack resulted in Trump’s injury, the death of a spectator, and critical injuries to two others.
The incident has also led to political fallout, with House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senator Lindsey Graham criticizing Wray’s earlier statements and calling for clarification. The FBI has stated that it remains committed to a thorough investigation of the attack.","<style type=""text/css"">

2,Packers Sign Jordan Love to Record $220 Million Contract Extension,"The Green Bay Packers have signed quarterback Jordan Love to a record-breaking four-year contract extension worth $220 million, marking the largest deal ever awarded to an NFL quarterback. The new contract, which includes a record $75 million signing bonus and $155 million in fully guaranteed money, significantly exceeds previous quarterback contracts.
Love, who was drafted by the Packers in 2020, had his breakout season in 2023 as the team’s full-time starter. During the season, he led Green Bay to the playoffs, throwing for 4,159 yards and 32 touchdowns while maintaining a passer rating of 96.1. The Packers finished the season with a 9-8 record, making it to the divisional round of the NFC playoffs before being defeated by the San Francisco 49ers.
The new deal for Love matches the average annual salary of $55 million previously set by Joe Burrow of the Cincinnati Bengals and Trevor Lawrence of the Jacksonville Jaguars, placing Love among the highest-paid players in the league. This contract surpasses the average annual values of other recent quarterback extensions, including those of Jared Goff and Tagovailoa.
Love’s contract renewal comes after three seasons as a backup to Aaron Rodgers, during which Green Bay won only one playoff game. Love’s performance in his first full season as a starter appears to have bolstered his position as the Packers' long-term quarterback.
The Packers will open their 2024 season against the Philadelphia Eagles on September 6. The game will be available for streaming on Peacock.","<style type=""text/css"">

21,Justice Department Settles Lawsuits with Former FBI Officials Strzok and Page,"The Department of Justice has reached settlements with former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page over claims that their privacy rights were violated through the unauthorized release of their critical text messages about former President Donald Trump. Strzok will receive $1.2 million, while Page will receive $800,000.
Strzok, a former counterintelligence agent, and Page, a former FBI lawyer, argued that their dismissal and the subsequent exposure of their messages were politically motivated. Strzok, who was fired in 2018, claimed that his termination was a retaliatory act that violated his First Amendment rights. Page also alleged that the publication of her messages breached the Federal Privacy Act.
The Justice Department settled the cases to avoid further legal proceedings and potential litigation costs, though it did not admit to any wrongdoing. Attorney General Merrick Garland indicated that the settlements were based on an assessment of the legal risks and costs associated with continuing the lawsuits.
Critics, including House Republicans, have argued that the settlements effectively reward the former officials and criticized the DOJ's handling of the situation. They contend that the settlements suggest a politically motivated decision and raise concerns about the implications for future government employees.
The text messages exchanged between Strzok and Page, which criticized Trump and discussed their concerns about his potential presidency, were made public in December 2017. These messages became a focal point in allegations of FBI bias during the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
The settlement agreements were reached after legal motions were filed to question Trump and FBI Director Christopher A. Wray under oath. Despite the resolution, the controversy surrounding the cases continues to spark debate about political influence and government accountability.","<style type=""text/css"">

34,"Massive Wildfires Ravage Western US and Canada, Prompting Evacuations and State of Emergency Declarations","Wildfires across the Western United States and Canada have intensified, leading to significant damage, injuries, and evacuations. The Park Fire in Northern California has grown to over 307,000 acres, making it one of the largest wildfires in the state’s history. Fueled by high temperatures, strong winds, and dense vegetation, the fire started near Chico and has spread rapidly, threatening numerous communities and causing extensive damage.
As of late Friday, the Park Fire remains 0% contained, with evacuation orders issued for Butte, Tehama, and Shasta counties. The fire's growth has been exacerbated by challenging terrain and erratic winds, with officials working to protect lives and properties. Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency for the affected counties and secured federal aid to support firefighting efforts.
In addition to the Park Fire, the Durkee Fire in Oregon has burned over 288,000 acres and remains 20% contained. This fire, sparked by lightning, has caused significant damage, including the destruction of buildings and infrastructure. Evacuations are in effect, and smoke from the fire has impaired traffic and air quality in several states.
In Canada, a fast-moving wildfire in Jasper, Alberta, has forced the evacuation of thousands and caused substantial damage to the town. The Jasper Wildfire Complex, which includes several fires, has devastated up to half of the town's structures. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has deployed federal support to assist in the firefighting and recovery efforts.
Authorities have arrested a suspect in connection with the Park Fire, accused of arson. The suspect, Ronnie Dean Stout II, allegedly caused the fire by pushing a burning car into a gully. Stout, who has a criminal history, faces potential arson charges.
Overall, the wildfires have resulted in widespread evacuations, significant property damage, and ongoing efforts to manage and contain the blazes. Cooler temperatures and increased humidity are expected to aid firefighting efforts in the coming days.","<style type=""text/css"">

5,Team USA Opens Paris Olympics with Dominant 110-84 Win Over Serbia,"The U.S. men’s basketball team began their quest for a fourth consecutive Olympic gold medal with a decisive 110-84 victory over Serbia in their opening game at the Paris Olympics. Kevin Durant led the U.S. with 23 points, shooting an impressive 8-of-9 from the field. His performance was notable as he had missed all of the exhibition games leading up to the Olympics due to a calf injury.
LeBron James, making his return to the Olympic stage for the first time since the 2012 London Games, contributed significantly with 21 points, 8 rebounds, and 9 assists. The win highlighted James' ongoing impact on the game, as he provided key support throughout the contest.
The U.S. team demonstrated exceptional shooting accuracy, finishing the game with a 62.3% shooting percentage from the field, including 56.3% from three-point range. The team’s effective perimeter play was complemented by a strong defensive effort from their front-court rotation, including Joel Embiid, Bam Adebayo, and Anthony Davis.
Serbia’s Nikola Jokić, a three-time NBA MVP, led his team with 20 points and 8 assists. Despite Serbia’s efforts, including Jokić’s performance and solid contributions from other players, the team struggled to keep pace with the high-scoring U.S. squad.
The victory sets up the U.S. team for their next group stage game against South Sudan, a team they narrowly defeated in a recent exhibition match. Meanwhile, Serbia will face Puerto Rico in their next game.","<style type=""text/css"">

6,Léon Marchand Sets Olympic Record as U.S. and Italian Swimmers Also Claim Gold,"At the Paris Olympics, French swimmer Léon Marchand set a new Olympic record in the 400-meter individual medley with a time of 4:02.95. The performance surpassed the previous Olympic record held by Michael Phelps and came close to Marchand’s own world record. The crowd at Paris La Défense Arena provided enthusiastic support, breaking into chants and singing ""La Marseillaise"" before and during the race. Marchand, who won France’s first swimming gold since 2012, expressed his amazement and gratitude for the support he received.
In the women's 100-meter butterfly, American Torri Huske claimed gold, overcoming a previous close miss from three years ago. Huske's victory was complemented by fellow American Gretchen Walsh, who finished in second place. China’s Zhang Yufei took bronze in this event. Huske, who expressed her joy and disbelief, shared the podium moment with Walsh, highlighting their mutual support and the significance of the win for American swimming.
In the men’s 100-meter breaststroke, Italian swimmer Nicolo Martinenghi secured gold, while American Nic Fink and Great Britain’s Adam Peaty tied for silver. Fink, who had previously finished fifth in the 200 breaststroke at the Tokyo Games, expressed satisfaction with his podium finish and reflected on the significance of this achievement after his earlier disappointment.
Marchand, 22, who trains under Bob Bowman at Arizona State, is expected to compete in additional events including the 200 IM, 200 butterfly, and 200 breaststroke during these Games.","<style type=""text/css"">

42,Venezuelans Vote in Crucial Presidential Election Amid High Turnout and Tensions,"On Sunday, Venezuelans participated in a pivotal presidential election as Nicolás Maduro faced one of his toughest challenges since taking office. Voters lined up early outside polling centers in Caracas, with initial reports indicating a high turnout exceeding 9 million by the afternoon.
Maduro, who has led Venezuela since 2013 following Hugo Chávez's death, is seeking a third consecutive term. His campaign has faced significant opposition from a unified coalition known as the Democratic Unitary Platform, which supports Edmundo González, a former diplomat and substitute for María Corina Machado, who was barred from running.
González’s campaign reported strong support, with exit polls suggesting he may have won as much as 65% of the vote. The opposition coalition is optimistic about their chances, attributing potential success to high voter turnout. However, they have also reported various issues, including delays at polling stations, violence in some areas, and difficulties for opposition observers.
Maduro's camp remains confident despite these challenges. The incumbent has urged voters to respect the results and warned of potential unrest if he loses. The government has been accused of controlling all public institutions, leading to concerns about the fairness of the election.
The election comes at a critical time for Venezuela, which has been grappling with severe economic difficulties and a large-scale migration crisis. Both international observers and local citizens are watching closely to see how the military and other institutions will respond to the election outcome.","<style type=""text/css"">

52,Mark Meadows Appeals to Supreme Court to Move Georgia Election Case to Federal Jurisdiction,"Mark Meadows, former White House Chief of Staff under Donald Trump, has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review and overturn a lower court's decision that denied his request to transfer his Georgia election interference case to federal court. Meadows' legal team argues that his actions were conducted within the scope of his official duties and that recent Supreme Court rulings supporting federal immunity for officials bolster their case.
In a petition filed over the weekend, Meadows' lawyers contend that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit erred in its December ruling, which held that the federal removal statute does not apply to former federal officers. The ruling, authored by Chief Judge William Pryor, stated that the events leading to Meadows' indictment were not connected to his official duties.
The Supreme Court’s recent decision granting immunity to former President Trump for official acts is cited by Meadows' attorneys as a precedent supporting their argument. They argue that similar protections should apply to Meadows and that his case should be adjudicated in a federal court to ensure a proper legal forum.
The Georgia case, in which Meadows and 17 others are accused of conspiring to overturn Trump’s 2020 election loss, has been at a standstill due to ongoing legal challenges and ethics allegations against Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. The Georgia Court of Appeals is also considering an appeal related to Willis' conduct.
Meadows’ appeal seeks to have the Supreme Court either review the case fully or remand it for reconsideration in light of the recent immunity ruling.","<style type=""text/css"">

114,United States Women’s National Team Defeats Germany 4-1 in Olympic Soccer Match,"The United States women's national soccer team secured a decisive 4-1 victory over Germany in a group stage match of the Olympic tournament held on Sunday in Marseille. The win positions the U.S. team at the top of their qualifying group with one match remaining.
Sophia Smith led the attack with two goals, scoring in the 10th minute and again just before halftime. Mallory Swanson contributed with a goal in the 26th minute, her third of the tournament, while Lynn Williams added a late goal in the 89th minute. German midfielder Giulia Gwinn scored for her team in the 22nd minute, providing the only goal for Germany.
U.S. goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher made critical saves throughout the game, and the defense, including players such as Emily Fox, Naomi Girma, and Tierna Davidson, managed to contain the German offensive threats. Germany had several opportunities, including a notable miss by Lea Schüller in the fourth minute and a close attempt by Jule Brand that hit the post.
The U.S. team, coached by Emma Hayes, now prepares for their final group match against Australia on Wednesday. A win or draw in that match will ensure their advancement to the quarterfinals. Germany will face Zambia in their last group match.
The U.S. squad, which includes notable players like Sophia Smith, Mallory Swanson, and veteran Lynn Williams, has demonstrated strong performance despite some earlier concerns. The team, which has been under scrutiny following a lackluster showing at the previous World Cup, appears to be in good form as they approach the knockout stages of the tournament.","<style type=""text/css"">

NBC_1,"Barcelona will raise tourist tax for cruise passengers, mayor says",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/barcelona-raise-tourist-tax-cruise-ship-rcna162884,2024-07-21 18:00:03.096401,,"MADRID — Barcelona will raise the tourist tax for cruise passengers visiting the city for less than 12 hours, the mayor said in an interview published on Sunday.
Jaume Collboni said the current tourist tax for stopover cruise passengers was 7 euros ($7.61) per day. He did not say by how much the tax would be increased.
“We are going to propose..substantially increasing the tax for stopover cruise passengers,” he told El Pais newspaper.
“In the case of stopover cruise passengers (less than 12 hours) there is intensive use of public space without any benefit for the city and a feeling of occupation and saturation. We want to have tourism that is respectful of the destination.”
He said tourists, not local tax payers, should pay for local projects like air-conditioning schools.
The proposal will have to be agreed with the Catalan regional government, Collboni said.
In recent weeks, anti-tourism activists have staged protests in popular holiday destinations across Spain, such as Palma de Mallorca, Malaga and the Canary Islands, saying visitors drive up housing costs and lead to residents being unable to afford to live in city centres.
Another protest is planned in Palma de Mallorca, the capital of the largest Balearic Island on Sunday evening.
Collboni announced last month that the city will bar apartment rentals to tourists by 2028, an unexpectedly drastic move as it seeks to rein in soaring housing costs and make the city liveable for residents.Reuters"

As President Joe Biden faces a wave of new calls from elected officials to end his re-election bid, his political allies are actively exploring ways to publicly demonstrate he still has widespread support among key elements of the Democratic Party’s base, according to three Democrats familiar with the discussions.
The new effort is aimed at turning the pressure campaign against Biden back on party insiders by seizing on anger and frustration among some voters who feel disenfranchised by attempts to push the candidate they cast their ballots for aside, the Democrats said.

NBC_3,Heat-related Texas deaths climb after Beryl left millions without power for days or longer,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/heat-related-texas-deaths-climb-beryl-left-millions-power-days-longer-rcna162894,2024-07-21 22:00:03.004291,,"SPRING, Texas — As the temperature soared in the Houston-area home Janet Jarrett shared with her sister after losing electricity in Hurricane Beryl, she did everything she could to keep her 64-year-old sibling cool.
But on their fourth day without power, she awoke to hear Pamela Jarrett, who used a wheelchair and relied on a feeding tube, gasping for breath. Paramedics were called but she was pronounced dead at the hospital, with the medical examiner saying her death was caused by the heat.
“It’s so hard to know that she’s gone right now because this wasn’t supposed to happen to her,” Janet Jarrett said.
Almost two weeks after Beryl hit, heat-related deaths during the prolonged power outages have pushed the number of storm-related fatalities to at least 23 in Texas.
The combination of searing summer heat and residents unable to power up air conditioning in the days after the Category 1 storm made landfall on July 8 resulted in increasingly dangerous conditions for some in America’s fourth-largest city.
Beryl knocked out electricity to nearly 3 million homes and businesses at the height of the outages, which lasted days or much longer, and hospitals reported a spike in heat-related illnesses.
Power finally was restored to most by last week, after over a week of widespread outages. The slow pace in the Houston area put the region’s electric provider, CenterPoint Energy, under mounting scrutiny over whether it was sufficiently prepared.
While it may be weeks or even years before the full human toll of the storm in Texas is known, understanding that number helps plan for the future, experts say.
Just after the storm hit, bringing high winds and flooding, the deaths included people killed by falling trees and people who drowned when their vehicles became submerged in floodwaters. In the days after the storm passed, deaths included people who fell while cutting limbs on damaged trees and heat-related deaths.
Half of the deaths attributed to the storm in Harris County, where Houston is located, were heat related, according to the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences.
Jarrett, who has cared for her sister since she was injured in an attack six years ago, said her “sassy” sister had done everything from owning a vintage shop in Harlem, New York, to working as an artist.
“She had a big personality,” Jarrett said, adding that her sister had been in good health before they lost electricity at their Spring home.
With power outages and cleanup efforts still ongoing, the death toll likely will continue to climb.
Officials are still working to determine if some deaths that have already occurred should be considered storm related. But even when those numbers come in, getting a clear picture of the storm’s toll could take much more time.
Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, which uses death certificate data to identify storm-related deaths, estimated that it may not be until the end of July before they have even a preliminary count.
In the state’s vital statistics system, there is a prompt to indicate if the death was storm related and medical certifiers are asked to send additional information on how the death was related to the storm, Anton said.
Experts say that while a count of storm-related fatalities compiled from death certificates is useful, an analysis of excess deaths that occurred during and after the storm can give a more complete picture of the toll. For that, researchers compare the number of people who died in that period to how many would have been expected to die under normal conditions.
The excess death analysis helps count deaths that might have been overlooked, said Dr. Lynn Goldman, dean of the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University.
Both the approach of counting the death certificates and calculating the excess deaths have their own benefits when it comes to storms, said Gregory Wellenius, director of the Boston University School of Public Health’s Center for Climate and Health.
The excess death analysis gives a better estimate of the total number of people killed, so it’s useful for public health and emergency management planning in addition to assessing the impact of climate change, he said.
But it “doesn’t tell you who,” he said, and understanding the individual circumstances of storm deaths is important in helping to show what puts individual people at risk.
“If I just tell you 200 people died, it doesn’t tell you that story of what went wrong for these people, which teaches us something about what hopefully can we do better to prepare or help people prepare in the future,” Wellenius said. The Associated Press"
NBC_4,Secret Service denied requests for more security at Trump events before attempted assassination,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/secret-service-denied-requests-security-resources-trump-events-rcna162888,2024-07-21 22:00:03.004291,,"The Secret Service repeatedly denied requests for more personnel and other security resources from agents guarding former President Donald Trump prior to the assassination attempt on the candidate at a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, a Secret Service official told NBC News.
The earlier requests for additional resources, which stretched over two years, could not be fully accommodated because the Secret Service lacked the resources to fulfill them, the official said.
“The Secret Service has a vast, dynamic, and intricate mission. Every day we work in a dynamic threat environment to ensure our protectees are safe and secure across multiple events, travel, and other challenging environments,” said Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesperson for the Secret Service. “We execute a comprehensive and layered strategy to balance personnel, technology, and specialized operational needs.”
“In some instances where specific Secret Service specialized units or resources were not provided, the agency made modifications to ensure the security of the protectee,” he added. “This may include utilizing state or local partners to provide specialized functions or otherwise identifying alternatives to reduce public exposure of a protectee.”
The day after Trump was wounded by a 20-year-old gunman, Guglielmi said claims that resource requests from Trump’s Secret Service detail had been denied were “absolutely false.”
The Washington Post was first to report that the Secret Service had repeatedly denied requests for additional security at Trump events for two years prior to his attempted assassination.
The Post reported that Secret Service agents assigned to Trump had requested magnetometers and additional agents to assist with security screenings of attendees at large public gatherings Trump attended, as well as more snipers and specialty teams at other outdoor events.
The revelation that the Secret Service repeatedly turned down additional resources requested from agents guarding Trump comes as the agency experiences a decadelong staffing shortfall, as previously reported by NBC News.
Despite a near doubling of the Secret Service’s budget in recent years, the personnel shortage has continued. The number of senior officials requiring security has also increased as the potential threats against them have diversified.
The Secret Service and federal and local law enforcement agencies have struggled with recruitment in the wake of the police murder of George Floyd. Lengthy Secret Service background checks, which can take up to a year, have also delayed hiring.
The agency has also struggled to retain experienced agents due to the high pressure and grueling nature of the work, as well as the lure of higher salaries in the private sector.Julia Ainsley is the homeland security correspondent for NBC News and covers the Department of Homeland Security for the NBC News Investigative Unit.

NBC_5,Sen. Joe Manchin joins calls for Biden to drop out of the 2024 race,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/sen-joe-manchin-biden-drop-out-presidential-race-rcna162892,2024-07-21 22:00:03.004291,,"Sen. Joe Manchin, I-W.Va., on Sunday joined growing calls for President Joe Biden to drop out of the presidential race.
Manchin, who left the Democratic Party in May but continues to caucus with Democrats, said that during the first week after the president’s poor June debate performance, he initially thought Biden “needed time to evaluate and make a decision if he was going to at that time.”
“And then I thought, well, we’d hear from my colleagues who are in very difficult, challenging areas of the country, whether it be in Congress, as far as their districts, or in the states, as far as my senators, and they’re speaking out now,” he said in an interview on ABC News’ “This Week.” “And then when you see the donor class, basically, speaking up and saying that they went a different direction, if you will.”
Manchin said he believes that if Biden exits the race now, it would allow him to address a series of key issues, and his departure would give him the chance to “show the rest of the world the orderly transfer of power from the superpower of the world.”
“He will go down with a legacy unlike many people, as one of the finest and truly a [patriotic] American,” Manchin said. “So, with that, I come with a heavy heart to think the time has come for him to pass the torch to a new generation.”
Manchin called for an open process to replace Biden on the Democratic presidential ticket and suggested Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear as potential nominees.
“It’s time, it’s just time,” Manchin said.
Manchin, who had decided against launching a presidential bid against Biden, blamed “both sides” for escalating rhetoric that led to the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump at a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.
“This should be a wake-up call for all of us,” Manchin said. “I am angry, as I know others are, that we are in this position. We must acknowledge that both sides share responsibility for where we are and where we go from here.”
Manchin, however, acknowledged Biden’s “irreparable” debate performance and criticized Democrats voicing their support for the president after the debate.
“At a time when the Democratic Party must realize they risk losing the Senate and even the House, in addition to losing the presidency, they are doing nothing to broaden the tent and appeal to more Americans,” Manchin said. “Instead, they continue to pull the party to the left. Sadly, their vocal support for President Biden in the face of his irreparable debate performance are just evidence of how much control the far left has over the current administration.”
Manchin joins four Democratic senators who have called for Biden to exit the race.
Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., was the first Democratic senator to call for Biden to end his re-election bid. Welch, a fixture in Vermont politics, argued that Biden should exit the race “for the good of the country” in an opinion piece published in The Washington Post this month.
Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., who is running for re-election in one of the most vulnerable Senate seats for Democrats, also called on Biden to depart the race. Tester said in a statement that while he appreciates Biden’s “commitment to public service and our country,” Biden shouldn’t seek re-election. He said that he has worked with Biden “when it has made Montana stronger, and I’ve never been afraid to stand up to him when he is wrong.”
Sens. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Sherrod Brown of Ohio have also pushed for Biden to exit the race. More than 30 congressional Democrats thus far have said they want a nominee to replace Biden on the Democratic presidential ticket.
However, members of the Congressional Black Caucus and BOLD PAC, the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, have continued to voice their support for Biden’s re-election campaign.
The president and his campaign have maintained that he has no intention to drop out of the race. In a statement Sunday, Mia Ehrenberg, a spokesperson for the Biden campaign, said the campaign believes that Democrats will “absolutely come together” to fight against Trump in November.
“While the majority of the Democratic caucus and the diverse base of the party continues to stand with the President and his historic record of delivering for their communities, we’re clear-eyed that the urgency and stakes of beating Donald Trump means others feel differently,” Ehrenberg said in a statement. “We all share the same goal: an America where everyone gets a fair shot and freedom and democracy are protected. Unlike Republicans, we’re a party that accepts — and even celebrates — differing opinions, but in the end, we will absolutely come together to beat Donald Trump this November.”
Jen O’Malley Dillon, Biden’s campaign chair, on Friday also maintained that the president isn’t going anywhere.
“You have heard from the president directly time and again: He is in this race to win, and he is our nominee, and he’s going to be our President for a second term,” O’Malley Dillon said during an interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”Summer Concepcion is a politics reporter for NBC News."

Biden, 81, could not reverse growing sentiment within his party that he was too frail to serve and destined to lose to Donald Trump in November. He backed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him as the Democratic nominee.

“While it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,” Biden wrote in a letter posted on X. “I will speak to the Nation later this week in more detail about my decision.”
Biden thanked Harris for “being an extraordinary partner” in his letter and then endorsed her in a subsequent post.
""My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President,"" Biden posted. ""And it’s been the best decision I’ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year.""
Biden and Harris spoke today ahead of the president’s announcement, according to a source familiar with the campaign.
His withdrawal caps a singular national political career, bookended by Richard Nixon’s fall and Trump’s rise. He mounted four presidential bids. He spent 36 years in the U.S. Senate representing tiny Delaware. He rose to the chairmanships of the powerful Judiciary and Foreign Relations committees. And he served eight years as Barack Obama’s vice president.
Reactions from politicians quickly began pouring in.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in a post on X that Biden “has been an extraordinary, history-making president — a leader who has fought hard for working people and delivered astonishing results for all Americans.”
“He will go down in history as one of the most impactful and selfless presidents,” said Newsom, who was one of the most prominent Biden surrogates. Newsom has also been floated as a possible Democratic presidential contender.
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, another prominent Democrat talked about as a future national candidate, called Biden a “great public servant” in a post to X.
“My job in this election will remain the same: doing everything I can to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump, a convicted felon whose agenda of raising families’ costs, banning abortion nationwide, and abusing the power of the White House to settle his own scores is completely wrong for Michigan,” Whitmer wrote.
The president's granddaughter Naomi Biden said in a post that she was “nothing but proud today of my Pop,” adding that he has “served our country with every bit of his soul and with unmatched distinction.” First lady Jill Biden posted her husband’s statement to X with a heart emoji. 
Across the aisle, Republicans slammed the move and many called on him to resign his office, days after the completion of a Republican National Convention where speaker after speaker slammed the Biden-Harris ticket.
""If Joe Biden is not fit to run for president, he is not fit to serve as President. He must resign the office immediately,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson. 
In a brief phone interview with NBC News, Trump reacted to Biden's decision, calling the president ""the worst president in the history of the United States by far.""
When asked whether he was surprised by Biden's decision, Trump said that Biden ""should never have been there in the first place.""
“He should have stayed in his basement,"" Trump said.
In a fundraising email, Trump’s campaign said that Biden “quit the race in complete disgrace.”
Biden’s decision to exit the race less than a month before his party’s convention and a few months before voters head to the polls is unprecedented in the modern political era. The last sitting president to abandon a re-election bid was Lyndon Johnson, whose expansion of the Vietnam War in the 1960s split the Democratic Party. But Johnson’s announcement came in March 1968 — eight months before that election.
“We’re in uncharted waters,” said Barbara Perry, a presidential studies professor at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center. “No president has dropped out or died this close to the convention.”
Replacing Biden atop the Democratic ticket is likely to set off internal Democratic tremors as ambitious officials maneuver to become his successor. Factions have already formed around Harris, Whitmer and Newsom.
Harris would seem to be the heir apparent. She broke a barrier as the first female vice president. A woman of color, she enjoys strong support among African Americans, a loyal piece of the Democratic coalition. Overall, though, Harris’ approval rating stood at only 32% in an NBC News poll released earlier this month. 
“There’s no one you can name right now who is an obvious substitute,” Perry said. “That’s what makes this so uncertain and chaotic.”
The mechanics of putting a new name on ballots also gives rise to myriad legal questions. Republicans could work to throw obstacles in the nominee’s path by mounting legal challenges aimed at keeping that person off the ballot.
Questions about Biden’s capacities dogged him throughout his presidency, but peaked following his debate with Trump on June 27. Combined with his flagging poll numbers, his listless performance sparked a panic among his own party that he couldn’t win in November. 
With 51 million people watching, Biden spoke in a raspy voice and often failed to complete thoughts or deliver a cogent explanation of why voters should choose him over Trump. He later attributed his poor performance to exhaustion and a cold. He implored the country not to let one bad night overshadow his accomplishments in office.
Unpersuaded, Democratic lawmakers began calling on him to step aside, a rebellion that started slowly but grew steadily in size and intensity. Thirty-seven congressional Democrats, including independent Sen. Joe Manchin, who previously was in the Democratic Party, had called on Biden to drop out of the 2024 election before he delivered his decision Sunday afternoon.
They appealed to Biden’s patriotism, arguing that if he sincerely believed Trump is a threat to democracy, he needed to put his country first and stand down.
Biden fought back. He held numerous calls and meetings with Democratic officials at all levels to shore up support inside the party — to no avail.
Looking to blunt concerns about his acuity, he gave interviews and held press conferences to prove to voters that he could still think on his feet. But the gaffes kept coming and his poll numbers remained stagnant.
In another bit of bad fortune and timing, Biden tested positive for Covid-19 on July 17, forcing him off the campaign trail.
For Democrats, Biden’s illness created an unwanted contrast. While Trump delivered a triumphal speech accepting the Republican nomination in Milwaukee on July 18, five days after surviving an assassination attempt, Biden was in self-isolation back home.
Biden’s departure is the latest in a series of jarring developments that has made the 2024 presidential race the most chaotic in living memory. Trump easily won the Republican presidential nomination despite splitting his time between the campaign trail and various courtrooms where he was a defendant in criminal and civil cases. In May, a jury in Manhattan convicted him on 34 felony counts related to hush money payments to a porn star.
Then, in short order, Trump rebounded. The Supreme Court issued a much-anticipated ruling on July 1 that immunized Trump from official conduct when he was president, impeding special counsel Jack Smith’s efforts to prosecute Trump for interfering in the 2020 election.
Trump nearly died on July 13 as he appeared at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. A gunman lying on a roof 130 yards away fired a bullet that grazed his ear. Trump dropped to the ground in self-defense. Then, his face smeared with blood, he rose and defiantly pumped his fist, yelling “Fight!”
Another fortuitous development came two days later, coinciding with the opening of the Republican convention in Milwaukee that certified Trump’s nomination. Federal Judge Aileen Cannon in Florida dismissed a separate case brought by Smith alleging that Trump improperly retained classified documents that he took home with him when he left the White House in 2021. Cannon, who had been appointed by Trump, ruled that Smith’s appointment was illegal. Smith quickly appealed her ruling.
The rolling streak of news gave Trump a jolt of momentum, allowing Republicans to present an energized and unified front at this month’s convention. 
Biden seldom sparked any such enthusiasm. HIs primary campaign was mostly a coronation. He faced token opposition as party leaders cleared the field, betting that having beaten Trump once before, Biden was best positioned to do it again. But poll after poll confirmed that voters harbored doubts about him, believing he was too old and infirm to serve another term.
An AP-NORC survey released July 17 found that a whopping 65% of Democrats believed Biden should exit the race.
Pressed by his voters, abandoned by party leaders, Biden gave in.Peter Nicholas is a senior White House reporter for NBC News."
NBC_8,Xander Schauffele wins the British Open for his 2nd major this year,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/xander-schauffele-wins-british-open-rcna162916,2024-07-22 02:00:02.831781,,"TROON, Scotland — Xander Schauffele won the British Open on Sunday for his second major of the year, delivering a masterpiece at Royal Troon with a 6-under 65 to overcome a two-shot deficit and give the Americans a sweep of the majors for the first time since 1982.
Schauffele won the PGA Championship at Valhalla two months ago by making a 6-foot birdie putt on the final hole. In a final round set up for big drama — nine players separated by three shots at the start — Schauffele made it look like a nice walk along the Irish Sea.
He played bogey-free in a strong, chilly wind and pulled away with three birdies in a four-hole stretch early on the back nine to go from two shots behind to leading by as many as three.
He won by two shots over American Billy Horschel and Justin Rose, the 43-year-old from England who had to go through 36-hole qualifying just to get into the field. They were among four players who had at least a share of the lead at one point Sunday.
They just couldn’t keep up with Schauffele. No one could.
Given the wind, heavy air off the Firth of Clyde and punishing nature of Royal Troon, Schauffele’s 65 ranks among the great closing rounds in British Open history. Playing in the third-to-last group, he matched the round of the championship with a score that was just over eight shots better than the field average.
The 30-year-old from San Diego became the first player since Jordan Spieth in 2015 to win his first two majors in the same season. And he extended American dominance on this Scottish links as the seventh Open champion in the last eight visits to Royal Troon.Rose closed with a 67 and it was only good for second place. Horschel, who started the final round with a one-shot lead in his bid to win his first major, dropped back around the turn and birdied his last three holes for a 68 for his best finish in a major.
The player Schauffele had to track down was Thriston Lawrence of South Africa, who birdied three of four holes to end the front nine with a 32.
Schauffele was two shots behind when it all changed so suddenly. Schauffele hit a wedge out of the left rough on the difficult 11th and judged it perfectly to 3 feet for birdie. He hit another wedge to 15 feet for birdie on the 13th, and capped his pivotal run with a 12-foot birdie putt on the par-3 14th.
Lawrence finally dropped a shot on the 12th and didn’t pick up any shots the rest of the day. He closed with a 68 and earned a small consolation — a trip to the Masters next April, his first time to Augusta National.
Scottie Scheffler, who got within one shot of the lead briefly on the front nine, lost his way with a three-putt from 6 feet for a double bogey on the ninth hole. Scheffler finished his round by topping a tee shot on the 18th and making another double bogey. The world’s No. 1 player closed with a 72 and tied for seventh.
Schauffele went from the heaviest major trophy at the PGA Championship to the smallest and oldest, the famed claret jug that he will keep for a year.
He finished at 9-under 275 and earned $3.1 million, pushing him over $15 million for the season.The Associated Press"
NBC_9,Some Republicans call on Biden to resign the presidency too after ending his 2024 campaign,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/republicans-call-biden-resign-ending-2024-campaign-rcna162923,2024-07-22 03:45:03.108204,,"WASHINGTON — Some Republicans reacted immediately to President Joe Biden’s announcement that he won’t seek re-election in November by demanding that he resign the presidency as well.
“If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President. He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement shortly after Biden revealed his decision.
New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, the conference chair and fourth-ranking House Republican, added: “If Joe Biden can’t run for re-election, he is unable and unfit to serve as President of the United States. He must immediately resign.”
Follow for live updates
It was a widespread response within the Republican Party, with multiple others reacting similarly, including Rep. Pat Fallon, R-Texas:
Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., the chair of the Senate GOP campaign arm, said he is “formally calling on President Biden to resign from office ... out of concern for our country’s national security.”
“If Joe Biden is no longer capable of running for re-election, he is no longer capable of serving as President. Being President is the hardest job in the world, and I no longer have confidence that Joe Biden can effectively execute his duties as Commander-in-Chief,” Daines said in a statement.
Biden said in his Sunday statement that he will “stand down” from the presidential race and “focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.” While many Democrats called on Biden to withdraw from the 2024 race, none have pushed for him to quit the presidency early. The skeptical Democrats have not taken issue with Biden’s ability to do the job, but rather with his declining communication skills and ability to wage a vigorous campaign leading into November after his poor debate performance.
Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., proposed that Biden be forcibly removed from office through the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, which governs succession if a president cannot fulfill his duties.
“If Joe Biden is unfit to run for re-election, he is unfit to carry out his term,” Mullin said on X. “25th Amendment.”
Far-right Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., said: “How is he strong enough to continue serving as Commander in Chief of the strongest nation in the world? Joe Biden ought to step down.”
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., accused Democrats of contradicting the will of voters who chose Biden as their nominee in a statement, adding, ""We cannot afford four more years of failure.""
But McConnell, 82, a longtime friend of Biden's who is himself stepping down at the end of this term, did not join GOP calls for the president to resign before his term ends.
Some Republicans, including Johnson, slammed the Democratic Party for Biden’s decision to withdraw and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris to be the standard-bearer this fall.
“Having invalidated the votes of more than 14 million Americans who selected Joe Biden to be the Democrat nominee for president, the self-proclaimed ‘party of democracy’ has proven exactly the opposite,” Johnson said in his statement, seeking to undercut a major Democratic attack line against Donald Trump this campaign season — that the former president has worked to undermine U.S. democracy.
“The party’s prospects are no better now with Vice President Kamala Harris,” Johnson added.
Other Trump allies responded by saying Trump has been running against not just Biden, but an entire party and system.
“Presidents Trump has never just been running against Joe Biden. He’s been running against the destruction of America brought by Democrats and their policies,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said on X, adding that Democrats waged “a coup” against Biden.
Vivek Ramaswamy, a former presidential contender and Trump supporter, said: “We’re not running against a candidate. We’re running against a system.”Sahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News."

The 25-year-old Slovenian rider became the first cyclist to secure the Giro d’Italia and Tour de France in the same year since the late Marco Pantani in 1998.
Two-time defending champion Jonas Vingegaard of Denmark was second overall. He also finished the 21st and final stage in second place.
Pogacar won the 34-kilometer (21-mile) time trial on the French Riviera’s roads from Monaco to Nice in 45 minutes, 24 seconds. Vingegaard was 1 minute, 3 seconds behind him and Belgian rider Remco Evenepoel 1:14 back in third spot.
In the overall standings, Vingegaard finished 6:17 behind Pogacar and Evenepoel was third overall, 9:18 behind Pogacar — whose other Tour wins came in 2020 and 2021.
The race did not finish in Paris as it usually does because of the Olympic Games. Nice mayor Christian Estrosi called the region between the Mediterranean Sea and the southern French Alps “perfect cycling territory.”
From early Sunday morning, fans camped along the popular Promenade des Anglais in Nice to guard a spot that would offer the best glimpse of cyclists.
Some fans chanted “Remco, Remco” as the race-against-the-clock specialist zoomed past them.
They may have been surprised to see Pogacar going flat out.
After his explosive attack on Friday, Pogacar said he would not try to win Saturday’s stage. But he could not resist and won that to become the second man to win five mountain stages in one Tour after Italian rider Gino Bartali in 1948.
Pogacar had no need to attack on Sunday, either, considering he led Vingegaard overnight by more than five minutes.
But the lure of another stage win proved too strong and he flew down the winding roads past picturesque Èze and Villefranche-sur-Mer on the approach to Nice, where the route flattened out again.
Pogacar held out three fingers as the finish line and a sixth stage win approached on this year’s Tour — the same number of stages he won when dominating the Giro d’Italia.
It was Pogacar’s biggest winning margin of his three Tour wins — beating the 5:20 gap on Vingegaard three years ago, but below the 7:29 victory margin Vingegaard enjoyed over Pogacar last year.
The battle with Vingegaard was not as close as it might have been in different circumstances.
The 27-year-old Vingegaard was hospitalized for nearly two weeks in April following a high-speed crash in the Tour of the Basque Country. He resumed competitive racing only on this Tour.The Associated Press"
NBC_12,"Democrats praise Biden's achievements as president, with some endorsing Harris as his successor",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/democrats-praise-bidens-achievements-president-endorsing-harris-succes-rcna162932,2024-07-22 04:13:02.826426,,"WASHINGTON — Top Democrats on Sunday praised President Joe Biden for his accomplishments in the White House after he ended his re-election campaign, with some following his lead by expressing support for Vice President Kamala Harris to take his place as the party’s 2024 presidential nominee.
Many Republicans, meanwhile, said that Biden’s decision means he shouldn’t continue serving the rest of his term in the White House, which ends in January.
After Biden announced he was exiting the presidential race in a letter Sunday afternoon, he endorsed Harris in a post on X. Harris said in a statement later on that she’s honored to have earned Biden’s endorsement and said her “intention is to earn and win this nomination.”
Harris celebrated Biden and his legacy, saying it’s “unmatched in modern American history, surpassing the legacy of many Presidents who have served two terms in office.”
“With this selfless and patriotic act, President Biden is doing what he has done throughout his life of service: putting the American people and our country above everything else,” she said.

The top Democratic leaders in Congress, however, didn’t offer an endorsement of Harris — or any other candidate.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement, that Biden “has not only been a great president and a great legislative leader but he is a truly amazing human being.”
“Joe, today shows you are a true patriot and great American,” said Schumer, who served with Biden in the Senate and spoke to him Sunday afternoon, according to a source familiar with their conversation.
House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who until Sunday had been supportive of Biden remaining in the race, said the president is “one of the most accomplished and consequential leaders in American history,” pointing to his handling of Covid and the economy and defeating Trump in 2020.
Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who has significant influence in the party, said in a post on X that “God blessed America with Joe Biden’s greatness and goodness.”
“President Joe Biden is a patriotic American who has always put our country first. His legacy of vision, values and leadership make him one of the most consequential Presidents in American history,” she wrote. “With love and gratitude to President Biden for always believing in the promise of America and giving people the opportunity to reach their fulfillment.”
Pelosi had been hinting since Biden’s devastating debate performance that she was concerned about his prospects in November.
Former President Barack Obama touted Biden’s accomplishments in a lengthy statement, ranging from helping end the pandemic to creating millions of jobs to enacting the first major piece of gun safety legislation in 30 years.
“More than that, President Biden pointed us away from the four years of chaos, falsehood, and division that had characterized Donald Trump’s administration,” Obama wrote. “For him to look at the political landscape and decide that he should pass the torch to a new nominee is surely one of the toughest in his life. But I know he wouldn’t make this decision unless he believed it was right for America. It’s a testament to Joe Biden’s love of country  —  and a historic example of a genuine public servant once again putting the interests of the American people ahead of his own that future generations of leaders will do well to follow.”
Obama didn’t endorse anyone for the Democratic nomination in his statement.
In a joint statement, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that they are “honored to join the President in endorsing Vice President Harris and will do whatever we can to support her.”
“We’ve lived through many ups and downs, but nothing has made us more worried for our country than the threat posted by a second Trump term,” they warned.
Biden decided not to run for president in the 2016 cycle against Hillary Clinton, who went on to become the Democratic presidential nominee, but lost to Donald Trump.
Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a former member of Democratic leadership who was credited with helping to turn Biden’s 2020 primary campaign around and propel him to the nomination, endorsed Harris for president on Sunday. 
“I echo the good judgment [Biden] demonstrated in selecting Vice President Harris to lead this nation alongside him, and I am proud to follow his lead in support of her candidacy to succeed him as the Democratic Party’s 2024 nominee for President,” Clyburn wrote.
The South Carolina Democrat, a key member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said he’s had the honor and privilege of calling Biden a friend for many years. 
“President Biden has improved the lives of countless Americans through his selfless service, and I thank him for his unparagoned leadership,” he said, listing many of Biden’s accomplishments as president. 
Presidential historian and former journalist Jon Meacham, who has helped write key speeches for Biden in the White House, said in an interview on MSNBC on Sunday that Biden’s withdrawal is a “singular moment in the history of the American presidency” for a man who “has given the lion’s share of his life to the service of the republic.”
“It tells us a lot about what he truly values — President Biden has decided that this campaign is not about him but about us,” he said. “It’s not about personal ambition, it’s about the durability and viability of the constitutional order that so many of us believe could be in danger as events unfold.”
Trump, for his part, wrote in a post on Truth Social that “Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve — And never was!”
Trump claimed that Biden “attained” the job as president “by lies, Fake News, and not leaving his Basement.” He went to say, “We will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”
House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., called on Biden to resign as president, a message shared by other Republican lawmakers on Sunday.
“If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President,” Johnson said. “He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough.”
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who served in the Senate with Biden and worked with him to reach compromises in negotiations on a variety of pieces of legislation, said in a statement that the country is “less prosperous and less secure than it was in January, 2021.”
“We cannot afford four more years of failure,” said McConnell, who criticized Democrats for pushing Biden out of the race by saying they have been “trying to upend the expressed will of the American people in primary elections across the country.”Rebecca Shabad is a politics reporter for NBC News based in Washington."
NBC_13,Kamala Harris is officially running for president. Will any Democrats challenge her?,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/kamala-harris-running-president-democratic-challengers-vp-biden-rcna162939,2024-07-22 07:43:02.749294,,"WASHINGTON — Soon after President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race, Vice President Kamala Harris accepted his endorsement and announced she will seek the Democratic Party’s nomination to face Donald Trump in November.
“I am honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination. Over the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election. And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead,” Harris said in a statement. “I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party—and unite our nation—to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda.”
In a way, Biden’s momentous decision Sunday moves up a long-anticipated 2028 Democratic primary campaign that was expected to feature a broad cast of rising stars in the party. But the sudden start and a shortened four-month timeline mean Harris starts out with a massive advantage — a campaign apparatus and millions in funds she can inherit, as well as rapid endorsements from broad swaths of the party eager to quickly settle on a nominee.
It’s far from clear any prominent Democrats will challenge Harris in what could be a murky process to replace Biden. And if the party coalesces around her, some of those future presidential prospects could become contenders for her vice presidential pick.
A source close to the Harris campaign effort said she has been working phones hard to get support from all the short-listers. “She’s already rallying all the potential candidates behind her,” this person said. “You’re going to see everyone fall into place.”
While some quickly endorsed Harris on Sunday, other rumored or would-be candidates are keeping their cards close to the vest, with most of them refraining from discussing Biden's succession.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is term-limited and has well-known national ambitions, endorsed Harris Sunday afternoon, posting on X that “no one is better to prosecute the case” against Trump than Harris.
Earlier he heaped praise on Biden, calling him “an extraordinary, history-making president” who “will go down in history as one of the most impactful and selfless presidents.”
Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro also issued a statement praising Biden “and his unwavering commitment to delivering for Pennsylvania” before backing Harris.
“The best path forward for the Democratic Party is to quickly unite behind Vice President Harris and refocus on winning the presidency,” said Shapiro, who won his competitive state in a blowout against a strongly pro-Trump Republican in 2022. “The contrast in this race could not be clearer and the road to victory in November runs right through Pennsylvania — where this collective work began. I will do everything I can to help elect Kamala Harris as the 47th President of the United States.”
Two-term Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, whom many have discussed as a future presidential candidate, praised Biden in a statement that did not mention Harris and said on social media that she’ll keep working to stop Trump.
“My job in this election will remain the same: doing everything I can to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump, a convicted felon whose agenda of raising families’ costs, banning abortion nationwide, and abusing the power of the White House to settle his own scores is completely wrong for Michigan,” she said.
Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker posted a statement praising Biden, attacking Trump and promising to work to defeat Trump, without discussing possible replacements.
“As we extend our gratitude to President Biden and reflect on his many accomplishments, we must not ignore the threat posed by Donald Trump’s potential return to the White House,” he said. “I will work every day to ensure that he does not win in November.”
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a Biden rival in 2020-turned-Cabinet secretary, said: “Joe Biden has earned his place among the best and most consequential presidents in American history. I am so proud to serve under his leadership, and thankful for his unwavering focus on what is best for our country.”
He later endorsed Harris, saying he'd ""seen her extraordinary leadership firsthand"" as a 2020 candidate and in the White House, adding: ""I will do all that I can to help her win this election to lead America forward as our next President.""
Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., a former astronaut who won two back-to-back statewide elections in battleground Arizona, has been rumored as a possible vice presidential contender. Kelly endorsed Harris on Sunday to take the mantle from Biden this fall.
﻿The source close to the Harris campaign effort said Kelly is the “dark horse” in the contest for vice presidential candidate, given his military experience and personal narrative and that he comes from a swing state.
North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper also issued a statement praising Biden and the “transformative legislation” he steered through Congress. He then endorsed Harris, posting: ""I’ve known @VP going back to our days as AGs, and she has what it takes to defeat Donald Trump and lead our country thoughtfully and with integrity.""
Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who won two elections in Republican-friendly Kentucky, released a statement praising Biden’s decision as being “in the best interest of the country, and our party.”
“Now it is time for our nation to come together. We need to dial down the anger, rancor and noise,” Beshear said, while also praising Harris as his partner in leading the country through crises.
First-term Maryland Gov. Wes Moore tweeted a statement heaping praise on Biden as “an exemplar of true leadership,” without mentioning Harris or discussing a replacement nominee.Sahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News."
FOX_1,1 in 3 Democrats believe Trump faked assassination attempt. I talked to one,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/1-3-democrats-believe-trump-faked-assassination-attempt-i-talked-one-them,2024-07-21 08:47:02.860575,politics,"MSNBC's Michael Steele was accused of pushing ""conspiracy theories"" when he was questioned if former President Trump’s ear was actually hit by a high-caliber bullet.
If some polls are to be believed, one in three Democrats think that Donald Trump faked his own assassination attempt. When I read that, I thought, could this possibly be true? But this weekend on my drive home to West Virginia from the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, I got the theory first hand. And it's a fascinating doozy.
Station Square Ristorante, just off of I-80 in Liberty, Ohio, is an absolute gem. Ottavio and Bridget Musumeci have somehow managed to create a legitimate fine-dining experience attached to the Super 8 motel. And no, I’m not kidding. In the wood-paneled bar, as I ordered oysters and antipasto for a late lunch, I met Mark, originally from northern New Jersey, which his accent revealed before he did. And Mark, well, he had some very interesting things to say.
MSNBC BRINGS THE CRAZY TO COVERAGE OF TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT
As is my way, I turned the conversation to politics and the assassination came up.
""That whole thing was a setup,"" Mark told me.
Station Square Ristorante in Liberty, Ohio, serves up delicious Italian food no matter what you think of Donald Trump. 
Before I could even respond, John, the bartender, who I would learn doesn’t like Trump or Biden, said, ""Nah, two people are dead. No way."" 
Mark’s response was, ""this is Donald Trump, he’s capable of anything.""
So I dug in a bit. How did they get the kid to do it? Mark was ready with answers. They paid off the family, or maybe told him he’d get off with just a few years in jail, he suggested.

""And the death of Corey Comperatore?"" I asked, referring to the retired fire chief who died shielding his family from the assassin's bullets.
""Donald Trump doesn’t care if his supporters die,"" Mark shot back, quite certain of himself.
You should know that Mark did not come off as some kind of lunatic. A bit prone to conspiracy theories maybe, but by no means crazy. So how could he believe all this with no evidence whatsoever?
He also had a good appetite, and as he wolfed down his caesar salad and veal piccante topped with mussels, he made it clear that it all came down to one simple precept: Trump is capable of anything.
I couldn’t help but think that the fact that Mark shares this kind of weird, irrational thinking with a third of his party faithful is because it is exactly what Democrats and their media allies have been feeding them. 
EX-ESPN STAR KEITH OLBERMANN QUESTIONS WHETHER TRUMP WAS SHOT AFTER FORMER PHYSICIAN'S UPDATE
Why wouldn’t Mark, if he has a steady diet of liberal media, think that Trump is capable of killing innocent people? After all, they say he will deny women their rights, he won’t let black people vote, he will destroy democracy, and on and on and on. Mark is conditioned to believe that Trump is a unique evil and nothing should be put past him.

I said to Mark that if I thought one party, one side, or call it what you will, was willing to kill innocent Americans in this way, then it might be time to buy some guns. Then he said something that surprised me.
""It’s not the other side, it’s just Trump.""
It made little sense, but in a strange way, I was glad to hear him say it. At least Mark doesn’t blame his fellow citizens who support Trump. Not yet, anyway. Mark finished and left before I did, and we had a wholesome and sincere goodbye. After the door closed, I asked to John, ""What do you make of that?"" ""It’s crazy,"" he shrugged.
Yes it is, but here we are.

Chinese authorities say at least 11 people have died and 30 are missing in the partial collapse of a highway bridge in the northwest of the country following heavy storms and flooding. A similar number are missing in the southwest after dozens of houses were destroyed by storms.
The official Xinhua News Agency said five vehicles that fell off the bridge have been recovered after the structure in Shaanxi province crumbled at around 8:40 p.m. Friday. A photo released by Xinhua showed a section of the bridge snapped and folded down at almost a 90-degree angle into the rushing brown water below.

In Sichuan province to the southwest, an estimated 30 people were missing and around 40 houses wrecked in flooding and storms, Xinhua reported. It said roads, bridges and communication networks in hardest hit Hanyuan county had been damaged or knocked out and that rescue teams had been working since before dawn to restore communications and transport connections.

As its economy boomed over recent decades, China built a huge network of highways, high-speed railways and airports, most of which have helped fuel further growth.
However, a dramatic decline in that economic expansion, the poor-quality infrastructure, poor safety supervision and a desire to cut corners by industries looking to save money have led to a steady stream of deadly accidents.

China's western and southwestern provinces are particularly prone to flooding and landslides due to their mountainous landscapes and the powerful rivers that run through them. Mining, tourism and rising urbanization have also disturbed a precarious balance with the natural environment that had been sustained over thousands of years.

A candidate for the populist Reform UK Party in Britain had to defend himself after allegations that he was not an actual person but in reality an artificial intelligence (AI)-generated candidate put up for election last month.
""I am a real person and that is me in the photo,"" Mark Matlock confirmed to British news outlet The Independent. ""Though I must admit I am enjoying the free publicity, and when I feel up to it, I will put out a video and prove these rumors that I’m a robot are absolute baloney.""
""I just laughed when I saw it,"" he added. ""I think it perked me up. I thought, ‘I need to get back out there.’ This is doing more good for me than my campaign, it’s fantastic.""
Reform exceeded expectations in the most recent general election in the United Kingdom, taking 14% of the vote, which only translated to 1% of the seats in Commons – five seats overall – due to the ""first past the post"" system. 
RUSSIA INTERFERING IN 2024 ELECTION TO HELP TRUMP, US INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS SAY
The party’s success was enough to deeply impact the ruling Conservative Party’s candidates, splitting the vote in the lowest voter turnout for almost a century, resulting in a near-historic win for the rival Labour Party.
A number of people on social media raised suspicions that Reform had tried to game the system and propped up fake candidates in many constituencies, of which Matlock, who stood in London's Brixton and Clapham Hill, became the poster boy due to his seemingly artificial appearance.

Alan Mendoza, co-founder and executive director of the Henry Jackson Society, told Fox News Digital that ""the political mainstream has been looking to catch Reform out – given its shock surge in the polls – for some time"" and that AI proved a useful cudgel to do so.
""The surprise factor of the election and the need for Reform to field as many candidates as they could, even in unwinnable seats, provided ample opportunities to do so, and some Reform candidates were indeed exposed for their unpleasant views,"" Mendoza argued.

""The idea of AI candidates was simply an extension of that approach, although it has now been proven completely false,"" he noted, adding that more such allegations will arise in cases where an election is called on short notice, leading to ""paper candidates"" who may never be met by their prospective constituents.
""Of course, were such a candidate to actually win, the whole scheme would collapse, so it is difficult to see the circumstances under which any political party would actually stoop to such lows,"" Mendoza said, referring to fully AI-generated candidates.

Users online pointed to a severe lack of online activity from many of Reform’s candidates and soon started analyzing leaflets and campaign materials they claimed showed AI-generated candidates, Scottish outlet The National reported. 
Green Party candidate Shao-Lan Yuen seized on these allegations and claimed that she hadn’t ""seen or heard"" from Matlock, running as a rival in his constituency. She mentioned ""suspicions"" that people said he could be AI-generated, and Independent candidate Jon Key said he saw ""no sign"" of Matlock on election night.

Key claimed that Matlock ""doesn’t live in the constituency"" and that he had not heard back from an email he sent out, which he had sent to all other candidates he ran against, but Matlock claimed to have illness the night of the election. 
""I got pneumonia three days before election night. I was exercising, taking vitamins so I could attend, but it was just not viable,"" Matlock revealed. ""On election night, I couldn’t even stand.""

Referring to his campaign poster, Matlock explained, ""The photo of me was taken outside the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. I had the background removed and replaced with the logo, and they changed the color of my tie.""
""The only reason that was done was because we couldn’t get a photographer at such short notice, but that is me,"" he insisted. 
WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?
Matlock told the BBC that he’s received ""a lot of nastiness"" from people online, calling them ""very mean"" and dismissing their ridicule as ""unnecessary."" The BBC also reported that its own investigation into claims of fake Reform UK candidates revealed ""no evidence"" of any fraudulent candidates.
Reform did admit that in a last-minute rush to find candidates – due to the surprise snap election decision then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called – and were so ""desperate"" to find candidates that they ended up recruiting some friends and family to stand for office.

""Basically it’s friends, relations, office workers,"" a party spokesperson told reporters. ""One of the candidates got their partner to stand.""
The entire episode shows the growing concern over AI’s potential impact on elections as the technology continues to improve.

JD Vance.
The U.S. Secret Service recently responded to a Washington Post report that claimed the agency's top officials ""repeatedly"" denied requests to former President Trump's security detail.
The report comes exactly a week after former President Donald Trump was shot in Butler, Pennsylvania, while speaking at a rally, prior to his 2024 presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. 
The gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, had been observed by attendees before the shooting began.
The Post reported that, before the July 13 assassination attempt on Trump, top Secret Service officials ""repeatedly"" denied requests for tighter security measures from Trump's detail. An official granted the interview to the media outlet on the condition of anonymity.
According to the report, agents tasked with protecting Trump requested additional security resources in the past. These requests involved things such as magnetometers or a larger number of personnel to screen guests. Additional snipers had also reportedly been requested in the past.

Senior officials reportedly told the agents that the Secret Service lacked the resources to fulfill the requests. The Post reviewed multiple requests, but none of them pertained to the Butler rally. 
On Saturday night, the Secret Service released a statement obtained by Fox News Digital explaining that the agency ""has a vast, dynamic, and intricate mission.""
""Every day we work in a dynamic threat environment to ensure our protectees are safe and secure across multiple events, travel, and other challenging environments,"" the statement read. ""We execute a comprehensive and layered strategy to balance personnel, technology, and specialized operational needs.""
The Secret Service also added that, even if a request is denied, the agency still tries to accommodate in some form to ensure the safety of whoever is being protected.

LONDON - Voters abandoned mainstream center-right parties for the populist right in the U.K. and French elections this month but failed to convert support to electoral gains amid a right-wing vote split and tactical voting by the left.
Britain’s Labour Party, led by Keir Starmer, won a landslide election victory, scoring 412 seats in the 650-seat Parliament, eclipsing the mainstream Conservative Party that managed to hold on to just 121 seats after losing 244 seats. 
This was the worst performance in the Conservatives’ nearly two-century history amid the surge of upstart populist Reform Party, led by ‘British Trump’ Nigel Farage, that received over four million votes but gained only five seats.
NIGEL FARAGE SHAKES UP UK ELECTION, ESTABLISHMENT ON RETURN TO POLITICS: ‘BRITISH TRUMP’

In France, a broad leftist coalition consisting of hardline communists, environmentalists and socialists won 188 out of 577 seats in the parliament, seconded by French President Emmanuel Macron's centrist alliance Ensemble (ENS), which won 161 seats, forming a ruling majority. 
France’s populist National Rally, led by Marine Le Pen, won over 37% of the vote and was the single most popular party among French voters, yet it came third in the number of parliament seats. The mainstream center-right Republicans came a distant fourth, with just 6.2% of the vote.
""What was quite clear was that this was a rejection of the Conservative Party, the mainstream Conservative party,"" Alan Mendoza, the executive director of the London-based Henry Jackson Society, told Fox News Digital. ""In France, they got a very high turnout for France, and in that case, it was clear that this was an anti-National Rally election.""

The elections demonstrated the voters’ persistent support for political movements embracing right-wing populism on issues related to immigration, crime and social issues while abandoning milquetoast traditional center-right parties for failing to bring meaningful change.
Yet, the insurgent populists came up short of converting the widespread support at the voting booth to electoral gains due to tactical voting agreements and support split among right-leaning voters.
FRENCH ELECTIONS: RIOTS ERUPT AFTER LEFT-WING COALITION PROJECTED TO WIN PLURALITY OF SEATS
""In both cases, the left-wing parties were able to maximize their votes, and the right-wing parties were not able to maximize their votes,"" Mendoza said. ""It's been said that Labour's support is a mile wide and an inch deep, but that's what you need to win British elections with large numbers of support without being focused in certain areas,"" Mendoza added about Labour’s lower overall popular support.
""The reality in France was that various left-wing parties and Macron got together and basically shut the right out, but the right did not do a similar thing. The Republicans stayed in the race and did not give way to the National Rally or vice versa.""

Le Pen’s National Rally came out on top in the first round of voting last month after campaigning on significantly reducing immigration and crime and improving the economy. 
The populist party was on the cusp of winning the majority of seats in the second round, but the effort was curtailed after a tactical election agreement was struck between Macron’s centrists and the leftist coalition. Both parties agreed to withdraw candidates to avoid splitting the anti-National Rally vote.
Farage’s Reform Party was the third-most-popular party with over four million votes across the U.K., but due to Britain’s first-past-the-post electoral system, in which the candidate with the most votes in the area wins the seat, the party ended up with just 1% of the seats in the parliament.

The mainstream Conservatives got over two million more votes than the Reform Party but remain the second-largest political force in the country, prompting calls to reform the electoral system to give more representation based on the total votes.
Despite winning a historic number of seats in the U.K. Parliament, the Labour Party won the election with 9.6 million votes, down by over 600,000 votes, compared to its 2019 election results, when the party led under controversial socialist Jeremy Corbyn suffered two separate election defeats.
""In some cases, the Reform vote was probably mostly conservatives who had left the Conservative Party and decided to go there. But the far bigger component in Britain's case was people who just decided not to vote at all,"" Mendoza said. ""The Conservative vote share went down 20 points, and a lot of conservatives who voted Conservative in 2019 just stayed at home and were not inspired by any of the parties.""

In the 2019 election, the Conservatives, under the leadership of former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, won the majority of the parliament seats after campaigning on a populist platform of ""Get Brexit Done."" The Reform Party’s predecessor, the Brexit Party, stood down its candidates in the election to boost the Conservatives.
In the aftermath of the elections, influential Conservative figures argued that the ""Conservative family"" consisting of the Reform Party and the Conservatives still beat Labour and won the majority of the votes – over 11 million – indicating the voters’ overall right-leaning bent.
Suella Braverman, a potential Conservative Party leadership contender, criticized the party’s performance in a speech at the Popular Conservatives conference and urged the party to embrace populism for the sake of the party’s future.
""To my mind, the Reform phenomenon was entirely predictable and avoidable and all our own fault,"" she told the audience. ""It’s no good denigrating Reform voters, it’s no good smearing the Reform party, it’s no good comparing Reform rallies to the rallies of Nuremberg. That’s not going to work. Criticizing people for voting Reform is a fundamental error to make.""

She further urged the Conservatives to ""restore credibility on the core conservative policies that unite"" and address the immigration issue, ""because we've been weak, we've been squeamish, we failed to tackle this very pressing concern.""

In France, although failing to gain legislative power, National Rally maintains populist momentum and is eyeing the 2027 presidential elections, with Le Pen primed to take control of the country's highest office.
The new parliamentary majority of leftists and centrists, meanwhile, leaves Macron, already deeply unpopular, facing the prospect of presiding over a politically paralyzed hung parliament.

Burgess Owens spared with Northwestern University's president over millions of dollars in donations from Qatar.
I know what racism looks like. I saw it during my childhood in the Jim Crow South.
I have also experienced the gift of growing up in a remarkable community that never let circumstances stand in the way of a dream. I was raised by educators who taught me that success was possible; I just needed to work for it. And I did. I never let failure hold me back. Instead, I fought to take advantage of every opportunity.
When I think about my kids' and grandchildren’s future, I imagine a nation well beyond using race as a measure of intelligence and potential. Unfortunately, over the past several years, the political Left has tried to drag us down. They are intent on teaching Black and Brown students that the system is stacked against them, there is nothing they can do to stop it, and it is better to live in a perpetual state of victimhood.
This pessimistic message – holding back countless students because of race – is what the Left is trying to instill in our youth. (iStock)
This pessimistic message – holding back countless students because of race – is what the Left is trying to instill in our youth. This nonsense has reached America's classrooms, where school boards and staff are waging a war on merit by lowering standards, canceling advanced and AP classes, and replacing entrance exams with arbitrary quota systems all in the name of so-called equity. 
SCHOOLS ACROSS COUNTRY DISBANDING DEI PROGRAMS IN DROVES; EDUCATION EXPERT EXPLAINS WHY
Not only is minimizing standards counterintuitive to what we should be doing in K-12 and higher education, but it is also an insult to every student who is being fed myths that they are not as smart or capable as their peers because of race.
From teacher training to grading rubrics, we have seen how the ""war on merit"" has permeated our schools. Fairfax County, Virginia, one of the most egregious offenders of COVID school closures, provided their teachers with training on ""grading for equity,"" and they downplayed the data that showed student performance was lacking.
In Seattle Public Schools, the district made the insane decision in the name of ""equity"" to shut down 11 schools dedicated to offering hundreds of students gifted programs, leaving parents ""flabbergasted"" and disappointed.
Wake County Public Schools in North Carolina went as far as formally adopting an ""equity policy"" that stated, ""all employees must apply an equity lens to examine and reflect on individual practices and biases,"" while eliminating gifted and advanced courses.
SCHOOL DISTRICT DEI TRAINER SAYS AMERICAN FLAG BECOMING 'HATE' SYMBOL, EMPLOYEES RESISTING CRT SHOULD BE FIRED
Instead of putting in the work and resources to help the kids who are falling behind, some districts have squandered money on ""equity"" consultants and other insulting and ineffective initiatives that only succeed in holding students back and stoking division.
In Boston, Massachusetts, the school district paid out $120,000 to create so-called ""equitable grading policies."" A report released by the nonprofit, grassroots organization Parents Defending Education found that at least 20 school districts were implementing DEI hiring practices instead of focusing on applicants’ experiences, qualifications, and credentials.
Some school districts have gone as far as making it impossible for students to fail, even if they have not proven baseline proficiency in core subjects. In August 2021, Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon signed a bill into law that would allow students to graduate high school even if they couldn’t perform the reading, writing and math expected of a student who completed 12th grade. 
What happened? Students figured out they could show up briefly, get marked present, leave, and hand in two assignments, and they would still be able to pass.

In a separate case, an audit conducted by the Maryland Inspector General’s Office and released in June 2022 found that high schools across Baltimore changed more than 12,000 grades to passing. It should be no surprise that at 13 high schools in the district, zero students demonstrated proficiency on the 2023 state math exam.
Our education system needs an overhaul. Schools should not be looking for ways to lower standards. Slashing academic opportunities is not the answer. We need policies in place that meet students where they are, help them progress, and challenge them to meet and exceed their true potential. 
Excellence should be the standard – not the exception.

Meritocracy and education are how a man like me could rise to serve in the most powerful legislative body in the world. Every American student deserves that same opportunity.

Independent Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia on Sunday called on President Biden to step aside. 
""He will go down with a legacy unlike many people as one of the finest and surely a patriot, an American,"" Manchin said of Biden during an appearance on ABC's ""This Week."" ""And so with that, I come with a heavy heart to think the time has come for him to pass the torch to a new generation."" 
Manchin changed his party registration from Democrat to independent this year, though he still caucuses with the Democrats in the Senate.
ABC host Martha Raddatz asked Manchin directly if he believes Biden should step aside as the Democratic nominee. Manchin said Biden ""has the ability for the last five months of his presidency to be the president he always wanted to be, be able to unite the country, bring it back together, to be able to maybe spend all of his time on solving the problems in Gaza, bringing peace to Gaza and to the Middle East."" 
CAMPAIGN CRISIS: DEMS WHO HAVE CALLED FOR BIDEN TO DROP OUT OR RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT HIS HEALTH
From now until the end of his term, Manchin said, Biden could also ""dedicate his time to enforcing, reinforcing Ukraine's ability to defend and win their freedom, and then be able to show the rest of the world the orderly transfer of power from the superpower of the world.""
In the three weeks since Biden's disastrous debate performance against former President Donald Trump, Manchin said he ""thought the president needed time to evaluate and make a decision if he was going to at that time."" The senator also acknowledged Democratic colleagues facing competitive races in Congress or at the state-level in November who fear Biden's re-election campaign could ruin their chances. 
KAMALA HARRIS REASSURES DEMOCRATIC PARTY DONORS THAT THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT
With the donor class also speaking up saying ""they want a different direction,"" Manchin said he believes Biden must withdraw, noting too it's ""concerning"" to watch the 81-year-old on the campaign trail.
""It's concerning. It's concerning when you watch him. I'm concerned about the President's health and well-being, I really am,"" Manchin said. ""But when I've been talking to him, you know, I can tell when he's in a good mood. He'll say, Hey, Joe, Joe, how's it going? And when he's upset with me, he'll say, Joe, what's up? So we're still communicating the way we always have.""

Though he believes Biden should stop his re-election campaign, Manchin said he believes Biden still has the mental acuity required to remain president for the remainder of his term. 
""I think basically he can finish this job that he started and finish the way he wanted to lead,"" Manchin said.

""I think it's about time… I think there's a little bit of nervous anxiety in the comedy community because, when Trump is not running, or we're not talking about him, we run out of things to joke about and, finally, it's fine to joke about the Democrats and the progressive side because it has actually become that funny,"" she said.

3RD DEMOCRAT SENATOR CALLS ON BIDEN TO STEP ASIDE AS PRESURE ACCELERATES

Twenty-three Democratic governors from across the nation descended on the White House earlier this month to meet with the embattled president, but after the gathering, only Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who leads the Democratic Governors Association, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore spoke to reporters to express their support. 
Moore described the meeting with Biden as ""honest"" and ""candid"" and said the governors were ""going to have his back.""
Hochul said Biden was ""in it to win it"" and that the trio had pledged their support to him ""because the stakes could not be higher.""
California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who many commentators have proposed as a possible Biden replacement, also took part in the White House meeting and backed the 81-year-old. 
""I heard three words from the President tonight – he’s all in. And so am I,"" Newsom posted on X on July 3. Newsom also publicly backed Biden immediately after the debate. 
""You don’t turn your back because of one performance,"" Newsom said after the debate. ""What kind of party does that? This president has delivered. We need to deliver for him at this moment.""

Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker has also publicly backed Biden, as has Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs and Hawaii Gov. Josh Green. 
Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont did not outright say Biden should withdraw from the race but told reporters at an event in New Haven July 12 that he is ""simpatico"" with Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., who has called on Biden to drop out.
""I think we’ve come to the same conclusion,"" Lamont said.

FOX_13,Former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson backs Trump: 'Indomitable spirit' is 'exactly what the world needs',https://www.foxnews.com/media/former-uk-prime-minister-boris-johnson-backs-trump,2024-07-21 22:00:03.004291,politics,"U.S. Senate candidate Mike Rogers, R-Mich., shares highlights from Trump’s rally in Michigan and discusses the demand for answers in the assassination attempt against the former president.
Former U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson threw his support behind Donald Trump in an op-ed for the Daily Mail on Friday and said the former president was the person for the job, arguing, ""the world is at a crossroads.""
""I believe that indomitable spirit is exactly what the world needs right now, and exactly what is needed in the White House,"" Johnson wrote after he recalled the assassination attempt against the former president. 
The former prime minister spotlighted several potential and current conflicts across the world, including in Ukraine, the Middle East, Europe and Taiwan.
""Having talked to Donald Trump this week, I am more convinced than ever that he has the strength and the bravery to fix it, to save Ukraine, to bring peace — and to stop the disastrous contagion of conflict,"" Johnson wrote. ""I believe that Trump understands the reality: that a defeat for Ukraine would be a massive defeat for America.""

WHO WAS THOMAS MATTHEW CROOKS? WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT TRUMP'S ATTEMPTED ASSASSIN
Johnson argued that the Ukrainians have shown they can win the war against Russia, and said, ""I believe that Trump can end it."" 
""He could construct a great deal for the world, in which Putin is ultimately persuaded that Ukraine’s future is as a free, sovereign and independent European country; and that means a two-stage approach,"" he wrote. 
He said there was a chance for ""global rapprochement"" with Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin, if Trump wins in November. 
""But there is only one way to achieve this outcome — through strength. Washington under Trump will have to show that international borders must be respected, and that the Soviet empire cannot be rebuilt by force,"" Johnson wrote.

""If and when he is back in power, later this year, Trump has a massive chance — not just to fix his predecessor’s legacy, but to take the world forward. Donald Trump can see the risk: that a defeat for Ukraine would exact a huge long-term cost on America and the world,"" Johnson said. 
The former prime minister added that Trump showed he had the ""mettle for the job"" with his initial response to the assassination attempt.

FOX_14,Our family reunion showed how we can unite America,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/our-family-reunion-showed-how-we-can-unite-america,2024-07-21 22:00:03.004291,opinion,"‘MediaBuzz’ host Howard Kurtz joins ‘Special Report’ to discuss the media and political responses to former President Trump’s Pennsylvania rally attack.
I spent this past weekend in the Smoky Mountains attending a DeBartolo cousins family reunion in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. We had a great time reconnecting and reminiscing. Love and laughter filled the house.
President Trump's assassination attempt took place during the reunion. It contrasted the unity we were experiencing and the division our country is experiencing.
Re means ""back to"" so a reunion is back to the union. It’s needed in families, communities and our country. We should, in the words of our Constitution, be seeking a more perfect union.
The DeBartolo cousins gather for a familly portrait in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. (Jeremy Passamonte) 
It can start in the family, the most basic unit of our culture. Our family reunion experience was a microcosm of what can happen across our land.
AMERICANS AGREE ON MOST CORE VALUES, THINK OUR DEMOCRACY FUNCTIONS POORLY, POLL FINDS
We all stayed in one big house. People from Connecticut to Arizona, Florida to Ohio all under one roof. The age divide spanned 30 years. Family, yes, but still different in many ways.
We are one big American family. A variety of states but one homeland. A span of ages but all still Americans. Differences, certainly, but also neighbors who care for each other.
It takes work to get along, but it can be done. (iStock, courtesy of user Patrick Chu)
I’ve learned this in many years of marriage, sometimes you must agree to disagree. We simply can’t always agree on everything. And sometimes we vehemently disagree. You don’t dissolve the marriage over it; you work on getting along despite it.
At our reunion, some went to Dollywood, some to the national park and some stayed in the house the entire time. Different ways to enjoy our family connections. We didn’t have to all agree on one approach.
FOUNDERS' JULY 4TH LESSON: DIVIDED BY POLITICS BUT UNITED IN CORE VALUES OF A FREE PEOPLE
Of course, we did need to agree on meals, responsibilities, schedule. Different doesn’t mean chaos. It takes work to get along; it’s not natural. Selfishness is inborn, service takes effort. But it can be done. Americans have proved it for almost 250 years.

We didn’t have any blowout fights. But with a group of Italian Americans together for three days it certainly could have happened. But even if there was conflict, we would have resolved it because we love each other.
Americans can disagree without being disagreeable. We can have fights without violence. We can have our views without hating those who have different views.
On Sunday morning, we had a worship service in the theater room of the house. Music was played and my cousin’s husband spoke on God’s grace to our family. We worshiped together because we all share the Christian faith.
AMERICAN VALUES: WHAT SMALL TOWN AMERICA IS SAYING ABOUT THE AMERICAN DREAM, 'GETTING TOO HARD'
 There is much that binds us together as Americans, much more than what divides us. (iStock)
But not everyone in America does. So, I may disagree with certain values or viewpoints of others. This means we will advocate differently and vote differently. And that is America. I support your right to have a different opinion – even in opposition to mine.
Our family reunion reinforced what I know is true. People need to reconnect over what they love more than what they hate. There is much that binds us together as Americans, much more than what divides us.
I love my cousins, but I have not spent enough time with them. Getting to know them better helped me to appreciate them more, to value their journey and story. 
Let’s reconnect over our shared values and reunite America. (iStock)
I spent time with one of my cousins and her husband. I’ve always liked them but now I do in a deeper way. The greater knowledge leads to a stronger affinity. I would like to get to know them better.

The back deck replaced the front porch and changed our communities. Americans need to spend more time outside of our usual echo chambers. Listening and getting to know their neighbors.
This doesn’t mean we will all magically agree. Unity does not mean uniformity. But we can lower the temperature of our discourse if we spend more time together instead of isolated online.

President Biden has defiantly remained in the presidential race despite mounting calls from allies to drop out, and speculation that he would bow out as early as this weekend. 
The Biden campaign has hit back against anonymous sources and speculation that Biden would end his campaign in the coming days, suggesting a pressure campaign was building to force Biden's hand. 
""There are a lot of anonymous sources out there this week telling y’all what is and isn’t happening on Team Biden-Harris. I’m here – on the record (!) – to give you an overview of what actually happened, what’s to come, and a few thoughts on the very bad things coming out of the Republican National Convention,"" Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Muonoz said in a press release late last week. 
The comment was released shortly following Newsmax's Mark Halperin reporting that unnamed Democratic sources informed him that Biden will drop out of the race as soon as this weekend, that he would not endorse Vice President Kamala Harris to take the mantle, and would call for an open convention during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month.

""It will happen as early as this weekend. A speech has been drafted for him. He will continue on as president, is his intention. He also will not, I'm told, endorse Vice President Harris as his successor. They're hoping that he will endorse an open process in which the convention will be open to Vice President Harris and a few other candidates in Chicago to pick the Democratic nominee for president,"" Halperin said on Thursday. 
CAMPAIGN CRISIS: DEMS WHO HAVE CALLED FOR BIDEN TO DROP OUT OR RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT HIS HEALTH
Axios also speculated the president would drop out this weekend, with unnamed Biden aides allegedly saying the president was warming up to the idea of giving into the calls to bow out. 
The Biden campaign, however, has so far not given an inch on the speculation and calls for the president to drop out, with campaign and White House officials shooting down speculation on social media, releasing press releases and continuing to announce fundraising efforts. 
Biden’s deputy campaign manager doubled down on Sunday that reports of the president dropping out are ""false"" and that Biden has been clear he is remaining in the race. 
""It is false. And I think that it is false to continue to try to gin up this narrative. Joe Biden has said he is in this race,"" deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said on MSNBC on Sunday. ""He is in this race to win it. He is instructing us to continue to carry out a plan to make sure that we are communicating [to as] many voters as possible. Actions speak louder than words, although sometimes, in this case, I wish that our words would speak louder so that people would stop asking this question. But we are doing both. The president has doubled down and said that he is running in this race to win it, and that he is not going anywhere.""

Biden is currently self-isolating in his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, after he was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Wednesday. He was diagnosed while in Las Vegas, forcing the campaign to cancel events in the city as the president recovers. 
Thirty-six Democrats have called on Biden to drop out of the race in the days and weeks following his disastrous debate performance, which put his mental fitness under further scrutiny as he stumbled over his words and appeared more subdued than in previous years. 
Ahead of his COVID diagnosis, Biden hit the campaign trail at a faster clip than before the debate, holding rallies and meetings across the nation, coupled with his official duties as president, including hosting world leaders for a NATO summit earlier this month. Biden delivered a stronger than typical speech during the NATO summit, and received mixed reviews for his first solo press conference of the year. The events, however, have evidently not swayed Democrats that he's up for the job, as traditional allies continue releasing statements calling on him to drop out. 
""While the choice to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden’s alone, I believe it is time for him to pass the torch. And in doing so, secure his legacy of leadership by allowing us to defeat Donald Trump in the upcoming election,"" California Rep. Adam Schiff said in a statement last week.

AMBER ROSE CLAPS BACK AT JOY REID AFTER CRITICIZING CONVENTION SPEECH: ‘STOP BEING A RACE BAITER’
The chair of the Democratic National Committee, Jamie Harrison, has also notably not called for Biden to pull out of the race, instead saying earlier this month that Biden is the party's nominee.
""This ain’t the West Wing… we have had a process, millions voted for Joe Biden and we have our nominee!"" Harrison tweeted on July 2.

Biden is not yet the official nominee for the ticket, but is expected to be formally nominated in a virtual roll call on Aug. 7, DNC Rules Committee members voted Friday. The move leaves Democrats with roughly two weeks to rally renewed support for Biden as their nominee, or for Biden to drop out and let another candidate step up to the job. 
AOC CALLS ‘BULL----’ ON DEMOCRATS PRIVATELY TURNING ON BIDEN
The speculation mounting around Biden dropping out comes as former President Trump was officially nominated as the Republican Party's choice for president. Trump joined the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, last week, where he announced Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate and accepted the nomination.

Li made the statement during an appearance on Fox News Sunday with host Shannon Bream. Bream pressed Li on whether Biden should stay in the race and whether Vice President Kamala Harris is the right candidate to replace him.
""Fundraising has -- big money fundraising has slowed. People -- major donors who have pledged massive amounts of checks, and I’m talking six, seven -- seven-figure checks have suddenly disappeared, fallen off the face of the Earth, rescinded their pledges,"" Li said.
""It's just hard because a lot of these people are successful business people and they see the election as a business proposition. And they would only bet on a campaign if it's a winning prospect.

""Skipping over Kamala Harris would be political malpractice. Full stop, end of story. The base -- our base, Black Americans in particular, is why we defeated Trump at all,"" Li responded.
""It's not my place to tell President Biden what to do but if he were to step aside, Vice President Kamala Harris would be an excellent candidate. She's a consummate prosecutor and she's out there every single day effectively prosecuting the case, litigating the case against convicted felon Trump,"" she said.

While Biden and his staff have publicly insisted that he is staying in the race, the 81-year-old is reportedly now asking whether Harris could win, according to the New York Times.

Former President Trump said President Biden ""was not fit to run for president"" and is not — and ""never was"" fit to serve. 
The Republican presidential nominee was reacting to Biden’s stunning announcement Sunday afternoon that he is suspending his re-election campaign. 
""He is the worst president in the history of our country,"" Trump told Fox News Digital in a phone interview Sunday afternoon. ""There has never been a president so bad."" 
""He is not fit to serve,"" Trump continued. ""And I ask — who is going to be running the country for the next five months?"" 
Trump also posted on his Truth Social Sunday afternoon. 
""Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve — And never was!"" Trump posted to his Truth Social. ""He only attained the position of President by lies, Fake News, and not leaving his Basement."" 
BIDEN ENDS BID FOR SECOND TERM IN WHITE HOUSE AS HE DROPS OUT OF HIS 2024 REMATCH WITH TRUMP
Trump said that ""all those around him, including his Doctor and the Media, knew that he wasn’t capable of being President, and he wasn’t."" 
""Now, look what he’s done to our Country, with millions of people coming across our Border, totally unchecked and unvetted, many from prisons, mental institutions, and record numbers of terrorists,"" he wrote. ""We will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly."" 
He added: ""MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"" 
Trump’s comments come one week after he survived an assassination attempt and just days after formally becoming the 2024 Republican presidential nominee. 
Biden announced Sunday that he will suspend his 2024 re-election campaign amid mounting pressure from his Democratic colleagues on Capitol Hill, top donors and Hollywood stars after a disastrous debate performance last month.
The unprecedented announcement came as an increasing number of Democrat lawmakers had begun to publicly call for Biden to step aside and the party's leadership reportedly was engaged in efforts to convince Biden, 81, he could not win in November's general election against former President Trump, the 2024 GOP nominee who Biden defeated four years ago to win the White House.

""It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your president,"" Biden wrote in a public letter. ""While it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interests of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term.""
TRUMP PREACHES UNITY AS HE ACCEPTS GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION DAYS AFTER SURVIVING ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT
Biden said he will formally address the nation later this week about his decision. 
""For now, let me express my deepest gratitude to all those who have worked so hard to see me reelected,"" Biden wrote. ""I want to thank Vice President Kamala Harris for being an extraordinary partner in all this work. And let me express my heartfelt appreciation to the American people for the faith and trust you have placed in me."" 
Biden added: ""I believe today what I always have: that there is nothing America can't do — when we do it together. We just have to remember we are the United States of America.""
Biden was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Wednesday, a revelation that came on the heels of several TV interviews and campaign appearances in which the president insisted he was remaining in the race. But the interviews failed to reassure supporters and provided critics — including those on the left — with further evidence that Biden was no longer up to the job.
Biden delivered a strong welcome address to world leaders at last week's NATO summit in Washington, D.C. The showcase served as an opportunity to prove he was fit to continue his current term and eager and able to lead the nation for another four years.

For a time, it seemed Biden could survive the surge of calls for him to quit the race after House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced that they backed Biden's bid. 
But Biden, who has long been known for a propensity to commit gaffes, continued to stumble. His missteps included a glaring error on the world stage at the NATO summit. While speaking on live television, Biden referred to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as ""Putin,"" name-checking Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose invasion of Zelenskyy's Ukraine has precipitated more than two years of hellish war.
Questions over whether Biden would end his campaign remained the top political story heading into last weekend.

But two blockbuster developments in rapid succession — the attempted assassination of Trump at the former president's rally in western Pennsylvania on Saturday and Trump's naming Monday at the Republican National Convention of Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate — briefly halted the fervor over Biden for a couple of days.

But the call on Wednesday by Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic Senate nominee in California, for Biden to end his campaign, as well as reporting that top Democrats such as Schumer, Jeffries, and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had frank conversations with Biden, quickly reignited the political crisis for the president.
Biden's stunning announcement occurred during the roughest stretch of what was a more than year-long campaign for a second term. Doubts about his viability at the top of the Democratic Party's 2024 ticket began seeping out into the mainstream after his halting delivery and awkward answers were placed on full display for a national audience during June's presidential debate with Trump in Atlanta.

He thanked Harris for her work in the administration, but stopped short of offering her his endorsement in his initial letter. Harris has been considered the top choice to replace Biden ahead of the president officially dropping out. 
Democrats' calls had mounted for weeks that Biden should drop out of the race, following his disastrous debate performance on June 27, which put his mental fitness under further scrutiny as he stumbled over his words and appeared more subdued than in previous years. 
As early as Sunday morning, however, Biden allies and the campaign doubled down that the president would not bow out of the race. 
TRUMP GETS BOOST IN POLLS AFTER BIDEN'S BOTCHED DEBATE 
""It is false. And I think that it is false to continue to try to gin up this narrative. Joe Biden has said he is in this race,"" deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said on MSNBC on Sunday. ""He is in this race to win it. He is instructing us to continue to carry out a plan to make sure that we are communicating [to as] many voters as possible. Actions speak louder than words, although sometimes, in this case, I wish that our words would speak louder so that people would stop asking this question. But we are doing both. The president has doubled down and said that he is running in this race to win it, and that he is not going anywhere.""

Biden dropping out comes as former President Trump was officially nominated as the Republican Party's choice for president. Trump joined the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, last week, where he announced Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate and accepted the nomination. 
The RNC was held just two days after an assassination attempt nearly ended Trump's life, leaving him with an injury to his right ear. A shooter opened fire on Trump's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last Saturday, injuring Trump and two others, and killing a 50-year-old married dad who was protecting his wife and family from the gunfire.

Democrat politicians lavished President Biden with praise and predictions of a great legacy following his announcement that he is ending his re-election bid just months before the November election. 
""President Biden has been an extraordinary, history-making president — a leader who has fought hard for working people and delivered astonishing results for all Americans. He will go down in history as one of the most impactful and selfless presidents. Thank you, @JoeBiden,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., wrote on X just minutes following the revelation.

Newsom has been speculated as a potential Democratic candidate for president in 2024 for roughly a year, despite his own dismissals of the idea on several occasions. He has been one of Biden's most high-profile surrogates on the campaign trail, continuing to promote Biden even after his poor debate performance last month.

 ""Joe, today shows you are a true patriot and great American,"" he added.

Schumer had been made aware of the decision of vulnerable Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., to call on Biden to drop last week and told him to do what he thought was best, a source with knowledge told Fox News Digital. 
Another Democrat whose name has been the subject of presidential speculation, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, was also among the first to react: ""President Biden is a great public servant who knows better than anyone what it takes to defeat Donald Trump.

""My job in this election will remain the same: doing everything I can to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump, a convicted felon whose agenda of raising families’ costs, banning abortion nationwide, and abusing the power of the White House to settle his own scores is completely wrong for Michigan,"" Whitmer wrote.

With President Joe Biden stepping aside in the 2024 White House race, the question becomes who has control over, and what could be done under applicable federal campaign finance laws and regulations with, the campaign funds that have been raised by the official ""Biden for President"" campaign committee? 
As of June 20, when Biden for President filed its latest campaign report summarizing its finances through the end of May with the Federal Election Commission (""FEC""), where I once served as a commissioner, Biden’s campaign committee had ""cash on hand"" of $91.5 million. Here are a series of questions and answers on what can – and can’t – be done with this money. 
AOC CALLS 'BULL----' ON DEMOCRATS PRIVATELY TURNING ON BIDEN: TRUMP IS 'OLD AND A RACIST'
There is no requirement in federal law for campaign committees to provide refunds to donors who want to get their contributions returned. It would be entirely up to the Biden for President committee to decide whether it wants to provide refunds if donors request them. 
The campaign cash for President Joe Biden could go to Vice President Kamala Harris if she is becomes the nominee. FILE: The two appear on the Truman Balcony of the White House in Washington, DC, on Thursday, July 4, 2024.  (Tierney L. Cross/Bloomberg via Getty Images)
Yes, because when the Biden for President committee filed its registration statement with the FEC, it registered itself as the ""principal campaign committee"" for both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. 
No, under FEC regulations, the new nominee would have no access to or control over the Biden for President campaign cash. Biden for President would be limited to giving no more than a $2,000 contribution to the new presidential nominee’s campaign committee. 
Yes, under FEC regulation 11 CFR 113.2, there is no limit on the transfer of funds from a candidate committee to party committees. Biden for President could, therefore, transfer all of its cash to the Democratic National Committee, Democratic congressional and senatorial committees, and state and local party committees, which could then use the money to support their federal, state, and local candidates. Additionally, pursuant to the regulation, it could make donations to ""State and local candidates subject to the provisions of State law."" 
However, because political party committees have expenditure limits (a vestige of the 1970s post-Watergate federal campaign finance reforms), the DNC is limited in the amount of its expenditures that it is permitted to make in coordination with the new nominee’s campaign committee.  
For the 2024 campaign, the limit is $32.4 million. A party committee could make independent expenditures regarding the presidential campaign, but it could not make unlimited coordinated expenditures of the newly transferred funds. 
Yes, those funds that are transferred to the new superPAC could only be used to engage in independent expenditures without any coordination with the new nominee. As the FEC explains, superPACs cannot use their ""funds to make contributions, whether direct, in-kind or via coordinated communications, to federal candidates or committees."" While the DNC is permitted to make some expenditures coordinated with the new candidate, a SuperPAC can make no coordinated expenditures.  
Biden for President could convert itself to a regular political action committee that is subject to federal contribution and donation limitations. But it could then only contribute $3,300 to the new presidential nominee, as FEC rules require a six-month waiting period before the new PAC qualifies to contribute at the higher ($5,000 per election) level.

No, federal law prohibits the personal use of campaign funds under 52 U.S.C. §30114. On the other hand, campaign committees are allowed to make charitable contributions in any amount to any organization that qualifies under 26 U.S.C. §170(c).  
The future of President Joe Biden's campaign has been in doubt since the presidential debate. (Getty Images)
That federal law includes ""religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational"" institutions and foundations. That means that if Joe Biden wanted to transfer (after paying off all his remaining campaign expenses) $91.5 million to the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy & Global Engagement, he could do it. 
And it should be noted that none of the funds from the campaign committee could be spent for ""personal use"" on behalf of Biden either, as the funds retain their character as candidate funds until exhausted.

The bottom line is that, in addition to facing almost immediate deadlines to certify the name of their presidential nominee to state election officials for inclusion on the general election ballot, Democrat officials will have a potential issue in not being able to use the political contributions raised by the Biden campaign – unless Vice President Kamala Harris becomes their presidential nominee. 
If it is someone else who is waiting in the wings to become the new nominee, it will be a whole new ball game when it comes to the campaign finance arena, an area fraught with legal peril and arcane restrictions that the Democrats and their leftist allies have insisted upon and imposed on campaigns, candidates and political parties for over five decades.

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., joins ‘America Reports’ to discuss the ‘stark’ comparison between 30 Democrats calling on President Biden to drop out of the 2024 race and the energy at the Republican National Convention.
With only months until the presidential election and once-presumptive nominee President Biden no longer in the race, the next steps for the Democratic Party may seem somewhat unclear. 
Here is what you need to know about the Democratic Party's nominating process following Biden's decision to drop out of the 2024 race. 
Biden was the presumptive nominee for his party, having secured the vast majority of its delegates, which were awarded after primary elections this year. But now that the president has withdrawn, the delegates are no longer pledged to him and are free to vote as they choose.
MAJORITY OF DEMOCRATS THINK KAMALA HARRIS WOULD BE A GOOD PRESIDENT, POLL SHOWS

Now, any eligible candidate can run for the nomination. Vice President Kamala Harris, Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, D-Mich., are often mentioned in the media. If Biden endorses a candidate, that person would have a clear advantage.
In order to become a candidate, someone must receive signatures from at least 300 delegates. A maximum of 50 can come from each state delegation.

To win the nomination, a candidate must receive the vote of a majority of pledged delegates at the party’s roll call vote, which would be 1,976 or more delegates. This is not a ""popular"" or ""public"" vote.

The Democratic primaries, which were such votes, have already happened throughout 2024. Biden won almost all those contests and was therefore awarded almost all the pledged Democratic delegates.
The only step left in the process is for delegates to formally nominate a candidate during the party’s ""roll call vote."" This is the regular part of the nominating process that would have occurred even without Biden ending his campaign. 
If no candidate reaches a majority in the first round of the roll call, then multiple rounds of voting take place, and superdelegates can also vote. At the Democratic convention a superdelegate is an automatically credentialed delegate — such as party leaders, governors and members of Congress.

No deadlines have passed that would prevent or lock out another eligible Democratic candidate from appearing on a general election ballot.
The Democrats are currently expected to formally nominate a candidate in August but before meeting at their convention, in a ""virtual"" roll call.

The process and schedule could, however, still change.
A change in candidacy after that point would be settled by the Democratic National Convention. It would certainly be a political disaster and, as time passes, could also present legal and logistical challenges.

President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race on Sunday, and campaign finance experts say there are financial roadblocks to replacing him as the Democratic nominee.
The Biden-Harris campaign brought in a huge cash haul this cycle, reporting $127 million raised in June alone. But after Biden officially withdrew from the race, there are serious questions about whether another candidate would be able to inherit these funds.
While there are several candidates being floated as a Biden replacement, a political fundraiser with knowledge of presidential campaign finance told Fox News Digital that, as of right now, the money ""is only accessible if your name is Joe Biden or Kamala Harris."" 
Election law experts told Fox News Digital that Vice President Harris could likely use the campaign funds given that her name is on the Biden-Harris ticket. However, even the vice president could face hurdles with the money.

The unprecedented announcement came as an increasing number of Democrat lawmakers had begun to publicly call for Biden to step aside and the party's leadership reportedly was engaged in efforts to convince Biden, 81, he could not win in November's general election against former President Trump, the 2024 GOP nominee who Biden defeated four years ago to win the White House.
And Biden quickly offered his ""full support and endorsement"" for Vice President Kamala Harris to take over as the party's presidential nominee.
""It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your president,"" Biden wrote in a public letter. ""While it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interests of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term.""
Biden said he will formally address the nation later this week about his decision. 
""For now, let me express my deepest gratitude to all those who have worked so hard to see me reelected,"" Biden wrote. ""I want to thank Vice President Kamala Harris for being an extraordinary partner in all this work. And let me express my heartfelt appreciation to the American people for the faith and trust you have placed in me."" 
Biden added: ""I believe today what I always have: that there is nothing America can't do – when we do it together. We just have to remember we are the United States of America.""

In a social media post, Biden backed Harris to take over as the party's standard-bearer.
""My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it’s been the best decision I’ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this,"" Biden wrote.
Biden was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Wednesday, a revelation that came on the heels of several TV interviews and campaign appearances in which the president insisted he was remaining in the race. But the interviews failed to reassure supporters and provided critics – including those on the left – with further evidence that Biden was no longer up to the job.
Biden had delivered a strong welcome address to world leaders at last week's NATO summit in Washington D.C. The showcase served as an opportunity to prove he was fit to continue his current term and eager and able to lead the nation for another four years.
For a time, it seemed Biden could survive the surge of calls for him to quit the race after House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced that they backed Biden's bid. 
But Biden, who has long been known for a propensity to commit gaffes, continued to stumble. His missteps included a glaring error on the world stage at the NATO summit. While speaking on live television, Biden referred to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as ""Putin,"" name-checking Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose invasion of Zelenskyy's Ukraine has precipitated more than two years of hellish war.
Questions over whether Biden would end his campaign remained the top political story heading into last weekend.
But two blockbuster developments in rapid succession - the attempted assassination of Trump at the former president's rally in western Pennsylvania on Saturday and Trump's naming Monday at the Republican National Convention of Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate - briefly halted the fervor over Biden for a couple of days.
But the call on Wednesday by Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic Senate nominee in California, for Biden to end his campaign, as well as reporting that top Democrats such as Schumer, Jeffries, and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had frank conversations with Biden, quickly reignited the political crisis for the president.
Biden's stunning announcement occurred during the roughest stretch of what was a more than year-long campaign for a second term. Doubts about his viability at the top of the Democratic Party's 2024 ticket began seeping out into the mainstream after his halting delivery and awkward answers were placed on full display for a national audience during June's presidential debate with Trump in Atlanta. 
The performance sparked widespread panic within the president's party and almost immediately spurred calls from political pundits, editorial writers and some party donors for Biden to step aside as the party's 2024 standard-bearer.

As Biden struggled to regain his footing, an increasing number of House Democrats publicly urged the president to end his re-election bid.
Biden huddled with worried Democrats, including governors and congressional leaders, in the wake of the debate debacle and also was engaged in ""working the phones,"" according to campaign officials. 
He started last week in a defiant posture, sending a letter to congressional Democrats in which he vowed that he was committed to campaigning against and beating Trump in November. Biden also urged lawmakers to stop focusing on the debate and end the calls for his withdrawal – pleas that he said only helped Trump. 
Biden followed that up with a call with members of the Congressional Black Caucus and also gained the support of members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. 
But concerns mounted and intensified. Democrat lawmakers met behind closed doors hoping to come to a consensus and support the president, but some were hesitant. 
The Biden campaign met with Senate Democrats on Capitol Hill and, for days, the White House and the Biden campaign – and the president himself – said Biden had no intention of dropping out of the race. 
BIDEN CAMPAIGN SENDS ‘ALL STAFF’ MEMO TO TRY AND STEM DEEP CONCERNS
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre had told reporters that the president was ""absolutely not"" considering dropping out.
And Quentin Fulks, the principal deputy Biden campaign manager, emphasized that ""the president is in this race to win it. He is the Democratic nominee.""
On the day after the presidential debate, Biden acknowledged at a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, ""I know I’m not a young man, to state the obvious.""

""Folks, I don’t walk as easy as I used to. I don’t speak as smoothly as I used to. I don’t debate as well as I used to,"" Biden added. ""But I know what I do know. I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. And I know how to do this job. I know how to get things done. And I know, like millions of Americans know, when you get knocked down, you get back up.""
And the president, pointing to his 2024 rematch with Trump, emphasized, ""I would not be running again if I did not believe with all my heart and soul that I can do this job.""
CASH DASH: TRUMP TOPS BIDEN IN FUNDRAISING RACE 
But Biden soon was staring down a slew of polls showing his standing against Trump was slipping while concerns over his age were surging.
The president's shocking announcement brings to an end his 2024 presidential campaign, which he launched in April of last year.

And it also seemingly brings to an end a half-century-long career in national politics. 
Biden was first elected to the Senate representing his home state of Delaware in 1972. During his nearly four decades in the Senate, he notably drafted and steered to passage the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act, chaired the Senate Foreign Relations and Judiciary committees and oversaw six Supreme Court confirmation hearings.

He also ran unsuccessfully for the 1988 and 2008 Democratic presidential nominations.
After dropping out of the 2008 race, then-Democratic presidential nominee and Sen. Barack Obama named Biden as his running mate. Biden served eight years as the nation's vice president as he and Obama won the 2008 election and re-election in 2012.Biden considered, but ultimately decided against, a run for the White House in the 2016 election cycle, as he mourned the loss of his elder son, Beau, to brain cancer. With Biden on the sidelines, the party coalesced around the candidacy of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
But four years later, Biden launched a bid for the 2020 nomination. After dismal early finishes in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, Biden turned his campaign around and a landslide victory in the South Carolina primary propelled him to the Democratic nomination. Biden went on to defeat Trump and win the White House.

Do you trust the bureau?VANCE: I don't trust the bureau leadership, but I certainly think there are a lot of good field agents, guys on the ground. But what the hell was going on? How was that guy ever allowed to be there in the first place? I think somebody, whether it's higher up or somebody else involved really did screw up.TRUMP: There's some things going on with our government that we have to really worry about. Did we have enough people? Why didn't we have enough people? Somebody said that a lot of people would put on Biden's detail. The problem is Biden doesn't draw anybody. He draws flies.(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: We got some breaking news on that overnight, and we'll have more of Jesse's interview later in the show. You can see the full conversation this Monday, 8:00 p.m. Eastern, on the FOX News Channel.Now, on the other side of the ticket, a growing number of Democrats urging President Biden to step aside for the good of the party, fearing a major defeat up and down the ballot if he remains on the ticket.In a moment, we'll get reaction from Democratic Congressman Jake Auchincloss who's not publicly called for Biden to drop out.But, first, let's turn to FOX News correspondent Kevin Corke in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, near the president's vacation home. He's recovering there.Hello, Kevin.KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hello, Shannon.There are competing Democratic narratives surrounding the Biden campaign at this hour. It's either Joe must go, or we're not unanimous, but we are united in our support of the president.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)CORKE (voice-over): But that tug of war continues amid growing concerns among Democrats about the health of the Biden campaign, and increasing calls for the president to step aside and leave the race, with nearly three dozen Democrat lawmakers insisting time's up.CROWD: Pass the torch! Pass the torch!CORKE: Worse yet, the drumbeat for Biden to leave the top of the ticket really hit home Saturday, with large protests outside the White House itself from self-proclaimed Democrats urging him to end his run for reelection.Summing up the rift, Virginia's Gerry Connolly who told ""The New York Times"": We have to cauterize this wound right now, and the sooner we can do it the better.A sentiment shared by many in party leadership privately, who continue to insist publicly that they're riding with Biden for now.SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): Look, Joe Biden is our nominee and he has a really big decision to make. But what gives me a lot of hope right now is that if President Biden decides to step back, we have Vice President Kamala Harris who is ready to step up, to unite the party.CORKE: This as a detailed update on the president's condition from White House physician Kevin O'Connor shows the president completed a sixth dose of Paxlovid on Saturday.(END VIDEOTAPE)CORKE (on camera): The 81-year-old said to be experiencing hoarseness and a persistent cough but his symptoms, Shannon, apparently are improving steadily.Back to you.BREAM: That is good news. Kevin Corke reporting from Rehoboth Beach, thank -- thank you very much, Kevin.Joining me now, Massachusetts Congressman Jake Auchincloss.Always great to have you with us. Thanks for your time today.REP. JAKE AUCHINCLOSS (D-MA): It's good to be back.BREAM: So you've, it seems, remained sort of neutral on this idea of what happens with the ticket. Do you feel like you're getting access to the information you need to know about what is happening moving forward? Is that still your position?AUCHINCLOSS: Well, the information is public and that's the polls and the battleground states. Ultimately, my opinion is much less important than the opinions of Pennsylvanians and Michiganders and Wisconsinites who are going to be the critical swing voters in this election. And the Democratic Party is having a deep debate about how we best win because we are absolutely aligned on the imperative to win.Come what may on Labor Day, the party is going to be united behind the top of the ticket. We're going to be rolling and rollicking behind a strong and sharp contrast on rule of law against the lawless Republican Party, and the Republican Party is going to be going in the opposite direction.I know right now, Shannon, they seem united coming out of Milwaukee. I've had a front row seat to these folks for the last four years. I've seen them divided on certifying the election results, on abortion, on supporting Ukraine.And when they underperform an election day, those fractures are going to blow up into the open. Donald Trump is going to try to pull them back --BREAM: Well -- AUCHINCLOSS: -- into the big lie, and that speaker's fight inside the Beltway is going to be a national affair.BREAM: Are you worried though about Democrats underperforming because speaker -- former Speaker Nancy Pelosi has apparently shared privately with President Biden? She's very worried about what's going to happen to the House, that you all may lose the opportunity to flip it.So do you think if President Biden stays at the top of the ticket, how worried are you about that?AUCHINCLOSS: I'm concerned right now. If the election were held today, Democrats would be in trouble. I think there's no empirical way to say otherwise. But the election is four months from now, and we have not just very strong candidates at the House and the Senate level, we also have strong surrogates.We've got Kamala Harris who can prosecute a case, which is good, because Trump's a convicted felon. We've got Pete Buttigieg who can talk about infrastructure and the economy for swing state voters. We got Gina Raimondo, a successful governor, who's now leading the strategy to out- compete China.And I'll take any of those folks up against J.D. Vance who is a MAGA shapeshifter and whose only consistent track record is denigrating women. This is a guy who --BREAM: Okay, wait a minute. Well, I know your full-throated support for the Democrats and definitely the issues that you have with President Trump and Vance.But I want to talk about who ends up on your ticket because you mentioned a lot of different names there, it seems like the DNC is moving forward with this virtual roll call that looks to be slated between August 1st and 7th.Do you think the party will be coalesced around a solution at that point? Do you think they should delay that?AUCHINCLOSS: That roll call should happen at the convention. I've been publicly clear about that because the party needs the time and the space to have this debate. And I don't think that's a sign of weakness actually. Parties are meant to have vigorous conversations about who best can win an election in order to effectuate policy for the American people.Unlike the Republican Party, which right now is a mosh pit on a human hand grenade. They call it unity, I call it an impending disaster because they are going to underperform and he's going to try to steal the election again, and they are going to fail to meet the moral -- moral moment.BREAM: Do you think the -- do you think the polls are wrong?AUCHINCLOSS: No. No.BREAM: For Republicans? Do you -- do -- well, when we talk about the swing states, you talk about underperforming, do you not think there will be a victory for President Trump if the ticket remains as it is on the Democrat side, with the polling you have now?AUCHINCLOSS: Well, predicting politics is not a very fruitful affair four months out. You and I both know how much can change between now and then.If the election were held today, we are in trouble. The elections are not going to be held today. They're going to be held in November.And we're going to have a big opportunity after Labor Day to talk to the American people about Trump's record as a lawless chaos agent and about Vance's record because he is under-known in the electorate as somebody who voted against exceptions for rape and incest for abortion, as somebody who does not want safe and legal in vitro fertilization for women trying to start a family, and yet calls women without children miserable cat ladies. This is not a guy --BREAM: OK, I think --AUCHINCLOSS: -- that is going to architect a country that women are going to be respected in.BREAM: I think he would -- he would take objection with a lot of that, including the IF -- IVF position which he says he's in support of, access to that for everyone. But --AUCHINCLOSS: His vote record does not support that.BREAM: OK.AUCHINCLOSS: And this just goes back to the -- to the fact that you can't trust him. He's a shapeshifter. He's going to do what's best for him as he did in 2016, and as he's done now.BREAM: But who's going to be making this argument against Trump and Vance? Do you think if President Biden steps off the ticket, it is a natural progression that Vice President Harris would take up the mantle? Or do you believe as your colleague, Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, says there should be a mini-primary?Here's what she says.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA): Maybe a vetting hosted by former presidents, including Obama and Clinton would be helpful, and help focus the attention and whoever emerges, including Kamala Harris, would be a stronger candidate than if we tried to exclude a transparent public process.(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: Do you think that that's a good option for Democrats?AUCHINCLOSS: It's -- it should certainly be a transparent and accountable process, and it can immediately put the GOP on the defensive because 70 percent of Americans have said they don't want frankly either Joe Biden or Donald Trump at the top of the ticket.If there were to be a contested convention, Democrats would say, we listened, we're passing the torch. Republicans meanwhile are furthering their cult of personality that puts self before country.BREAM: But what about Democrats and the issue that there have been 14 million or more votes for people who voted in the Democrat primaries and now they're being told, we don't think our candidate can win, so we're just going to have the party bosses or others sort of do an internal coup in the Democratic Party and pick someone else, what do you say to those voters?AUCHINCLOSS: To be clear, it would not be a coup. I've witnessed a coup up close and personal on January 6. I know what that looks like. This is a party having difficult conversations about how best to win an election.Your point about 14 million voters is absolutely valid, which is why I am wrestling with this -- with this question because I represent 800,000 people. A lot of them went and voted at a contested, free, fair primary election and said they want Joe Biden to lead the ticket. I'm going to walk humbly before contravening their will.BREAM: Okay. So this idea of whether or not President Biden is able to win the election is a different conversation about whether he should be governing now.The Federalist says this: Whether Biden is -- primaries -- Democrats' best bet or not, primary voters already chose him. The only acceptable excuse for rejecting those voters' decision is if Biden is constitutionally unable to serve as president.I know you've talked about as many of us have this op-ed by your colleague Seth Moulton who said President Biden didn't recognize him when they talked in Normandy. There are other questions and conversations that have surface where people tell the similar story.So is he just not good enough to win or should he even be governing now?AUCHINCLOSS: First of all, I do think Joe Biden could win the election in November. Whether he's the strongest candidate to win the election in November is an open question I also think he is fully fit to be commander- in-chief right now and frankly his track record over the last three and a half years shows that.This is the first president in American history who came into office and had to defend democracy at home and abroad simultaneously. Lincoln had to do it at home, FDR abroad, Joe Biden has had his hands full with both.And he has done so. He has helped heal the soul of this nation. He has put this economy back on track after it was flat on its back, and he has upheld U.S. global leadership.BREAM: Well, we will see what your party does in the coming days.Congressman, we always appreciate your time.AUCHINCLOSS: Nice to be with you.BREAM: Thanks for coming in.Okay. Joining me now, Biden-Harris National Finance Committee member, Democratic fundraiser and Biden delegate, Lindy Li.Great to have you with us.LINDY LI, BIDEN-HARRIS NATIONAL FINANCE COMMITTEE MEMBER, DEMOCRATIC FUNDRAISER AND BIDEN DELEGATE: Thank you so much.BREAM: Okay. So, you're a delegate. There are decisions to be made at this point. What would you do if this roll call starts August 1st?LI: Well, it's not my place to tell President Biden what to do but if he were to step aside, Vice President Kamala Harris would be an excellent candidate. She's a consummate prosecutor and she's out there every single day effectively prosecuting the case, litigating the case against convicted felon Trump.And just because there was a heinous assassination attempt, it doesn't erase the fact that he faced 88 criminal charges, four indictments, two impeachments and a guilty verdict.BREAM: But again, the conversation is about who will be making that case. I know that you were on a call with major donors. You've done a ton of fundraising for the party. You've said it's dried up when it comes to -- respect to President Biden.But you were on this call with major donors. The vice president stepped in on that call for a bit on Friday.We just have reporting from NBC out this morning talking to people who were on the call and I know you were as well, saying it was a total -- total failure. It was damaging. It was poor planning and it was ludicrous.What was your sense of that call?LI: I got the sense that some people were getting antsy on the call. She didn't take any questions and I think she spoke for about four or five minutes. I think people are expecting more of a interactive conversation, but I understand that she's busy. She just raised $2 million just yesterday.So -- but yeah, I think the call was marketed as more of a news-breaker as -- as in she would give us things that she hadn't yet said on the campaign trail, but --BREAM: Okay, and because you've done so much fundraising successfully and you say it's gotten really difficult at this point, the ""A.P."" reported this yesterday that David Letterman will headline a fundraiser with President Biden in 10 days with Hawaii Governor Josh Green, a sign that his campaign is forging ahead despite continued calls for the president to bow out of the '24 race.The campaign has at least 10 other fundraising events over the last 10 days of July.Will people show up? Are they going to give? Are you surprised by this news?LI: I'm not. Well, I also am privy to the fundraising calendar, so I saw that it was coming.But let me tell you just some a personal experience and I'm not here to gaslight anybody or you deserve the truth, and I would lose my credibility if I withheld that from you.Fundraising has -- big money fundraising has slowed. People -- major donors who have pledged massive amounts of checks, and I'm talking six, seven -- seven-figure checks have suddenly disappeared, fallen off the face of the Earth, rescinded their pledges.It's just hard because a lot of these people are successful business people and they see the election as a business proposition. And they would only bet on a campaign if it's a winning prospect. But it's just -- I wish I had better news, but I'm also not here to give you talking points. This is just the truth.And it's just excruciating -- excruciatingly difficult for me to say this at all.BREAM: Well, I know that you're supportive of President Biden and have been very full-throated. You're one of the people who when we said we had a really hard time trying to book anyone to come defend him, you reached out because you've wanted to do that for him.I want to ask you about this question. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez did a live event on social media the other night. And she said, if you think there's consensus among people who want Joe Biden to leave, that they're going to support Kamala Harris, the Vice President, you'd be mistaken.She says a lot of people who want President Biden off the ticket want the entire ticket wiped out. So are -- are Democrats risking something completely unknown if they do support efforts for President Biden to step down?LI: Well, I think, speaking to our point, skipping over Kamala Harris would be political malpractice. Full stop, end of story. The base -- our base, black Americans in particular, is why we defeated Trump at all.And we owe our base, the respect that they deserve by not sidelining an eminently qualified vice president who's out there every single day, who's ferociously fighting for our reproductive rights, which would be even more imperiled under a second Trump term. It would be a catastrophic mistake to skip over her.BREAM: Interesting too that we got some reporting from ""NBC"" yesterday that former President Bill Clinton -- this is on social media from one of their correspondents, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have privately been supportive of President Biden's decision to stay in the race and have been actively encouraging donors to stay with him. That's according to people close to the Clintons. Does that surprise you at all, knowing what you do about the fundraising situation?LI: And then they added an addendum. They were differential, not to him in particular, but to the process. And so I think they're kind of adopting the Pelosi line of, we just got to give the President time to make a decision again.So I think everyone realizes, everyone sees the polling data. I'm from Pennsylvania. I see it firsthand every single day. The blue wall is crumbling, unfortunately. So we got to do -- this is a break glass in case of emergency moment.BREAM: What happens though, if you guys do start to this virtual roll call, which DNC Chair Jaime Harrison says is going to start probably August 1st, what will you do as a delegate? Could groups of delegates go rogue?LI: I think while there are group chats already, there are a lot of group chats around. People are applauding, people are anxious. And I think it would be another catastrophic mistake to have it on August 1st.Like the Congressman said, I think it should be at the convention because in politics perception is reality and we ought to do everything we possibly can to make it as democratic and as inclusive as possible.BREAM: All right. Lindy Li, we appreciate your time and for you coming on to state that position. And we'll watch and see how it plays out.LI: Thank you.BREAM: All right. Tomorrow marks the very first hearing into the security failure that led to the assassination attempt against President Trump. The man overseeing those hearings, House Oversight Chair James Comer joins us for an exclusive interview next.But first, Fox News is live on the ground in Michigan where Trump and his new VP pick held their very first joint rally last night.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM: Secret Service Director Kim Cheatle is expected to testify on Capitol Hill tomorrow. House Oversight Chair James Comer is here to preview the highly anticipated hearing and exclusive interview.But first, we've got team coverage. FOX News Correspondent CB Cotton is on the ground in Butler, Pennsylvania with the latest on the investigations into the assassination attempt.But we start with FOX News Correspondent Alexis McAdams in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where the Trump Vance ticket rallied supporters last night.Hello, Alexis.ALEXIS MCADAMS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, good morning from Grand Rapids, Michigan, where we can tell you the mood inside of that arena here in Michigan was absolutely electric as soon as J.D. Vance took the stage. And then people just kept clapping and waiting for the former president to get up there.Now, he really didn't skip a beat, Trump, because, as you know, he was nearly assassinated a week ago in Butler, Pennsylvania, but he got up there, reflected on that shooting.And one thing we did want to point out was that he had a different, smaller bandage on his ear, but he stayed focused on his message. And J.D. Vance and Trump are trying to connect with working class voters. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The Republican Party is now the party of the people. We're the party of hardworking Americans of every race, religion, color and creed.The other side's going around trying to make me sound extreme, like I'm an extremist. I'm not. I'm a person with great common sense. I'm not an extremist at all.VANCE: And there's nothing radical about stopping the poison and the gangs and the criminals from taking care of our country. We're going to shut down that border.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCADAMS: That was the first rally with these two together on stage, and that was their message. Look at those long lines, though, Shannon. Thousands of people wrapped around that Grand Rapids arena for blocks. People even camped out overnight.The capacity of the Van Andel Arena is 12,000, and it looked like every seat was full, plus they added more seats on the ground there right in front of Trump speaking. Each person went through airport-like security as federal, state and local authorities stayed focused here.People we talked to out here said they weren't really worried about their safety. They just wanted to hear from the former president and believe Michigan's going to turn red. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When, in 2016, I traveled the state, and I would see these Trump signs all across state and the farmlands. And I said, wow, he's going to win way before. And I'm starting to see it now from people that never put a sign out there.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think that Joe Biden has shown what he can do for the country. Obviously, gas prices are higher. Food prices are higher.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Michigan is going to turn red. Yeah!(END VIDEO CLIP)MCADAMS: So, there's that excitement out here in Grand Rapids, Michigan. And you just have to look at where the former President and J.D. Vance are having their rallies to figure out a little bit of their game plan, right, Shannon?So, they're having it here in the swing state of Michigan in this battleground area, hoping they can flip this and win it again like they did in 2016. And then J.D. Vance is going to be back in his home state of Ohio tomorrow, so they're going after the working-class voter.Shannon.BREAM: Yeah, that belt area is very important. Alexis, thank you so much, reporting live from Grand Rapids.MCADAMS: Thank you.BREAM: We turn now to CB Cotton Live in Butler, Pennsylvania, with the latest on this investigation into the attempted assassination.And CB, news just keeps breaking.CB COTTON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, that's right. And we're told by a federal source that whenever former President Donald Trump's security detail was denied access to more resources or manpower, it was because the Secret Service was too thin. But we're told last Saturday's rally was not one of those instances.In fact, U.S. officials insist that security detail was enhanced because of an Iranian assassination plot against Trump's life.So, Shannon, now the question is, how was a 20-year-old gunman able to get past, droves of law enforcement?(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)TRUMP: Take a look at what happened -- oh.COTTON: Lawmakers, briefed by the FBI, are now demanding answers as to why former President Donald Trump was allowed to take the rally stage when law enforcement had been looking for a suspicious person nearly an hour before. The former president telling Jesse Watters he wonders the same thing, too.TRUMP: When you had Trumpers screaming, the woman in the red -- in the red shirt, she was screaming, there's a man on the roof. And then other people said, there's a man on the roof who's got a gun. And that was quite a bit before I walked onto the stage. So you would have thought somebody would have done something about it.COTTON: Thomas Crooks quickly identified as a person of interest for his strange behavior near the metal detectors. A little more than 30 minutes before the shooting, Crooks is then spotted with a golf range finder and officers begin circulating this photo in an effort to track him down.But by the time rally goers spotted Crooks on the roof of a warehouse building, it was too late. A federal source says investigators believe Crooks hid his father's AR-15 style rifle near an AC unit that he used to climb to the roof. A local officer assigned to traffic detail was lifted to the roof by a fellow officer but had to retreat once the gunman's weapon was pointed towards him.Moments later, Crooks fired, leaving Trump bloodied, two people injured and retired firefighter Corey Comperatore killed. Hundreds of first responders turning out for a solemn farewell in Pennsylvania on Friday. A Secret Service sniper killed Crooks with what a source calls a quote, ""one in a million shot.""Next to Crooks' body, a cell phone and remote transmitter were found. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle told ""ABC News,"" Crooks fired from a building outside the security perimeter, an area she says was delegated to local and state law enforcement. But local and state police say that's not true, as federal investigators dig through Crooks' encrypted social media accounts with servers based overseas.A federal law enforcement source tells Fox News a local sniper team was positioned inside the building Crooks fired from. But Shannon, now there are conflicting reports that say that sniper team was actually in a nearby building. Lawmakers hope to get some transparency at upcoming hearings.We know that bomb-making materials found inside Crooks' home are now at the FBI's lab in Quantico. Back to you.(END VIDEOTAPE)BREAM: All right, CB Cotton reporting from Butler, Pennsylvania. CB, thank you very much.Joining us now, Kentucky Congressman and House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer.Congressman, welcome. We know yours is the first hearing in this investigation to start off tomorrow. Do you have assurances that the Secret Service Director is indeed going to be there?REP. JAMES COMER (R-KY): Well, she told us yesterday that she was going to be there. We fully expect her to be there. I subpoenaed her, so she's going to have to honor that subpoena or she's going to pay the price.The American people have lots of questions and they deserve answers. And this hearing tomorrow will serve as the beginning of that process to get answers for the American people as to what went wrong with an agency that has a no-fail mission.BREAM: Well, so last week, when we were still on the air Saturday night reporting on this as it was all unfolding, there were some outlets, one in particular, ""The Federalist,"" said they had sources telling them that the Trump group had asked for more assets, more resources, and they were denied or unanswered.The next day, we got this from the Secret Service. ""There's an untrue assertion that a member of the former president's team requested additional security resources and those were rebuffed. This is absolutely false."" They go on to say, they added protective resources and technologies and capability.But then overnight from the ""Washington Post,"" we get this report talking about agents who were protecting the president said that they asked for more magnetometers, more agents. There were all kinds of things they needed for these large gatherings and that they were sometimes denied. So where does the truth lie?COMER: Well, we're going to find out tomorrow with the Director, but it's my understanding that the Trump campaign did ask for more resources, and it's my understanding that the Secret Service denied those resources.Now, days after the -- the assassination attempt, a spokesperson for the Secret Service denied the Trump report that they had requested more resources. But then, as you noted in the ""Washington Post"" story, it was confirmed that, in fact, the Trump campaign did ask for more.Look, the Secret Service has a budget of $3.1 billion. They have thousands of employees. There aren't that many people that require Secret Service protection. There aren't that many events that the Secret Service have to secure.So the budget is more than enough to provide adequate protection for the presidential candidate. So we have a lot of questions as to how they're managing their money.But if you look at the history of the House Oversight Committee, dating back to when Jason Chaffetz was chairman of this committee, there have been lots of investigations of the Secret Service. There have been lots of reports issued that they lacked proper training, that they did not efficiently spend their funds. So our question for the Director Cheatle is, are you competent to run the Secret Service?We want to know who's at fault for what happened.Every American can tell that there should have never been allowed anyone on that roof and the fact that there are videos showing that people were trying to notify the authorities, that there was a person on the roof with a gun and nothing was done about it and that shooter was allowed to get that many shots off at President Trump. That's unacceptable.We think not only do we need answers, but people need to be held accountable and that's what the director is going to have to answer tomorrow. She's going to have about a six-hour hearing and she's going to have hundreds of questions that she's going to have to answer and the American people will be watching that hearing.BREAM: We know for one of the other committees and there are multiple committees here in the House that have started these investigations.One of them has now, Homeland Security, they have subpoenaed Secretary Mayorkas because they said he's declined to show up. They're asking for documents and other information.Is the House prepared to take action against Secretary Mayorkas if he defies that subpoena?COMER: I hope so. We've already impeached even the House and in the Senate just turned a blind eye to the debacle at the southern border.If you look at all the agencies under the Homeland Security banner, FEMA, the Secret Service, Border Patrol, I mean, Mayorkas clearly is not up to the job. I mean, Mayorkas has been a disaster for the American people.You just -- you name the agency and there are 19 agencies under Homeland Security that Homeland Security was created after September 11th.You made a bunch of bureaucracies even more bureaucratic. And then you have a leader like Mayorkas who I have zero confidence in.I think the Republican Conference has already expressed our confidence level in Mayorkas by the fact that we have already impeached him.So it's not surprising that when the assassination happened, our committee communicated quickly with Director Cheatle and the Secret Service.But then days later, the Homeland Security stepped in and tried to cut off that communication. Homeland Security tried to block Cheatle from coming to testify to our committee when she had already agreed to testify.That's when I issued the subpoena. Now she has to come, but we shouldn't have to issue a subpoena.Director Cheatle should want to be transparent with the American people.This is one of the darkest days in the history of America. This was a huge debacle. And yet, the American people, one week later, have no answers to the many questions that we have. This has been a public relations disaster for the Secret Service.Tomorrow, hopefully, we'll begin to get answers, but not only do we need answers and not only do we need to hold someone accountable, we need to make sure that this problem is fixed.BREAM: Mm-hmm.COMER: And that we have President Biden, President Trump, their family members, that they are protected throughout this campaign and into the next term.BREAM: I want to ask you quickly about the issue of whistleblowers because it's something that Senator Josh Hawley, Republican, on the other side of the Hill, has brought up.He has a lot of questions. And he's asked Secretary Mayorkas to answer these as well. He says the detection canines were not used to monitor entry and detect threats in the usual manner, according to whistleblowers.Individuals without proper designations were able to gain access to backstage areas. Department personnel did not approximately police the security buffer around the podium. And we're also not stationed at regular intervals around the events security perimeter.Have you heard from any whistleblowers? What can Congress do to protect people who, you know, may still want to come forward but are very fearful?COMER: We've heard from a lot of whistleblowers. They're coming forward and I think they're the sources of a lot of the press stories that have come out.Look, the morale at the Secret Service has always been low, but it's gotten lower. We're going to talk about that in the hearing. We have a lot of specific questions.You know, why weren't drones used? There are reports that the shooter had a drone just a few hours before the event, scoping it out.There are reports that there were Secret Service in the building where the sniper -- where the shooter was on the roof, but they didn't go on the roof because it was too hot. We have lots of questions.And look, this director has done nothing over the past seven days to assure the American people that she's able to lead the Secret Service and that the problems have been -- have been resolved.I think we've got an agency in peril here. The American people are restless, whether you're a Republican or Democrat. Every American is outraged that we have a Secret Service with a budget of $3.1 billion with thousands of employees that failed to identify this threat to President Trump.BREAM: Yes.COMER: How many other threats are out there? And will this trigger more events where there are copycat shooters and people like that?We've got to instill confidence in the American people that we have a Secret Service that's up to the job. And right now, I don't think we have that.BREAM: Well, we will be watching, everyone will. This hearing tomorrow, we know that there are scores and scores of good people who work in Secret Service who are risking their lives every day.COMER: Yes.BREAM: And you need answers from leadership.COMER: That's right.BREAM: So we'll watch. Chairman, thank you.COMER: Thank youBREAM: Amid speculation that the Democrats could soon be making big changes to their ticket, the question becomes, how would a Trump-Vance campaign pivot to that?We'll bring in our panel to discuss that and how it may force a change in strategy, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. SHONTEL BROWN (D-OH): So for me, it is, he is the nominee. He has said it multiple times and he said it with his chest. So now, it's time for us to stop worrying and to start working.REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA): I am concerned that Mr. Biden will fall short. I know that he wants to beat Donald Trump. The problem is all the data is pointing in the other direction.(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: There is this public growing divide between Democrats who think the president should stay in the race and those who want him to leave so the party can figure out what to do next.It's time for our Sunday group. Maybe they'll figure it out.""USA Today"" White House correspondent, Francesca Chambers. American Enterprise Institute fellow, ""Washington Post"" columnist and Fox News contributor, Marc Thiessen. Fox News contributor and former State Department spokesperson, Marie Harf. And legal commentator and Project 21 Chairman, Horace Cooper. Welcome, everyone.HORACE COOPER, CHAIRMAN, PROJECT 21: Good morning.BREAM: OK. Let's dive in here first with what's happening on the D side of the ticket.DNC Chair, Jaime Harrison, not happy about those who are still out there making public hay of this saying on X. ""I'm going to say this as clearly as I can. If you are a Democrat Party elected official, pundit, et cetera, focus your time, especially T.V. time, talking about how disastrous Trump- Vance, your opponent, if you have one and Trump's project 2025, will be to the nation. Full stop. If you are not, then you definitely aren't helping.""Marie, how does this get resolved?MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I knew that was coming to me.BREAM: Surprise.HARF: I think we have been doing that for a long time. And the polls for Joe Biden keep getting worse.BREAM: Mm-hmm.HARF: I think two things are true. Number one, he's dug in. That is very clear. And number two, I think that's not sustainable. Right? Polls aren't perfect, but this amount of data doesn't lie.We have a new poll out from Michigan this morning that Biden is down even further.So we know there are a lot of voters who don't want to vote for Donald Trump. We see that in poll after poll after poll.And so if Joe Biden were to step down from the -- from the ticket, there is a process for this. You know, some of us will be at the DNC. There is a process to do this.We know that a lot of voters want to vote for a Democrat. They don't want to vote for Trump. They're nervous about Biden, but they would vote for Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris, they would vote for Wes Moore, Josh Shapiro, Mark Kelly.So as a Democrat, this is messy. And this has been a difficult few weeks. I think the writing's on the wall that we need a new candidate because that's what voters want. And there's a process and, you know, we will get there at some point, I think.Well, as I talked to Congressman Auchincloss, this is about getting a new candidate or also a new president at this point because ""Federalist"" says, if Biden's unable to continue his presidential duties, an attempt to undermine him by party leadership, and if he's able to continue, and other Democrats amounts to nothing less than a coup attempt.So, Mark, either they're saying he's well enough to stay in this now and govern now or they're undermining all of the millions of voters who voted for him in the primary.MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Hundred percent. And also, all the people that Marie just named have zero votes in the primaries.Joe Biden got 14 million votes and 57 primaries and caucuses. He got 3,900 delegates. If you're saying democracy is on the ballot, how do you just install somebody like this to a Soviet General Secretary elected by the politburo?And the problem they have is, also, that Kamala Harris is less popular than Joe Biden. And she doesn't do any better than him -- than him on the polls. So, why would you push Joe Biden aside for Kamala Harris? He doesn't do any better.And then if it's not going to be Kamala Harris, because I think a few months ago, everybody, every Democrat was terrified at the idea of Kamala Harris being president and somebody else. Why would anyone challenge her? Why would anyone?If Donald Trump, if he wins, is going to be a one-term president. So you just got to wait four years in 2028. It's an open seat. If you're a rising star of the Democratic Party, why would you get to become the captain of the Titanic just before it hits an iceberg?And then on top of that, why would you try and knock the first black woman nominee of a major party off their ticket and earn the enmity of Clyburn and the -- and the Congressional Black Caucus for the rest of your career?So there's no incentive for anybody to try and take out Kamala Harris.BREAM: Well, an interesting piece in ""The Atlantic"" was written by a former Harris campaign staffer talks about that she shouldn't be coordinated. That's their terminology. It says an automatic coronation of Harris would be a grave mistake. Primary campaigns are tests, and Harris, who ultimately dropped out before the Iowa caucus, failed hers.Francesca, I know you've got to piece out on this. What does the party do with Vice President?FRANCESCA CHAMBERS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, USA TODAY: So as my colleagues and I wrote in ""USA Today,"" the reason that supporters and allies of Vice President Kamala Harris believe that she would be the most logical person to replace Joe Biden on the ticket, if that were to happen, is because some polling does show that she could beat a former president Donald Trump. She could also potentially inherit the war chest, although there would be legal challenges to that, by the way.There is a belief that she could energize women, black voters, as well as progressives down (INAUDIBLE), even if in the polling right now, it doesn't necessarily show that she would do better. That Democrats believe that what's needed is a shock to the system that would potentially help her.And as far as whether Democrats would rally around her or not, in terms of being a logical choice, this would keep it from being a messy, open convention. And the Democrats who would have to oversee this process be involved in it at the convention, they say that this would be the choice that would make that easier.BREAM: Well, and then the question becomes, if she does rise to the top of the ticket, what did that do for the Trump-Vance campaign?""New York Times"" reporting on that issue said that, quote, Liam Donovan, who's a former NRSC aide saying this, ""Being the front-runner against another history making candidate would introduce new risks for a campaign hoping to reap historic gains among black voters.""So, how does the calculus change on the R side of the ticket if she does rise to the top?COOPER: Look, to describe this as messy, sort of does a disturbance to a hurricane coming through and destroying your town.This circumstance that they find themselves in, is a seriously terrible circumstance. I wouldn't be surprised if the sitting president of the United States announces a Stop the Steal rally because he is insisting that what is happening violates democracy, violates the democratic process.As Marc just explained, there was a process in place. Placing a very unpopular vice president in his stead will look ugly. Yogi Berra said, it's getting late early here. If they don't do something soon, I don't know how they fix this.BREAM: Well, and if they -CHAMBERS: If I could just jump in.BREAM: Quickly.CHAMBERS: There is actually - so, there is, actually, by the way, a process for how this would work at the Democratic National Convention -BREAM: Yes.CHAMBERS: Were this to take place. And Elaine Kamarck, who is one of the longest serving -BREAM: Right.CHAMBERS: One of the longest serving members of - of the DNC rules committee, laid this out in a call for delegates on Friday, not because they're trying to push Biden out, because they believe it's (INAUDIBLE).HARF: (INAUDIBLE) well -THIESSEN: The - the politics (ph) (INAUDIBLE) -CHAMBERS: No, no, no. No, no, no.BREAM: Well, but if the DNC chair - if the DNC chair, though, launches their virtual roll call vote August 1st-ish, that is a different conversation. You won't even get to the convention then. But -HARF: That's a different conversation.BREAM: Yes.HARF: The reason the conservatives on this panel and in the country want Joe Biden be the nominee is because they know he's easier to beat.THIESSEN: Oh, my God. I -BREAM: Yes, they -HARF: The Trump campaign wants to run against Joe Biden. They're (INAUDIBLE) campaign is fed up against Joe Biden.THIESSEN: They'd love for the (INAUDIBLE) against Kamala Harris.BREAM: Of course they do because that polling looks very good for them right now.HARF: Exactly.BREAM: OK. Panel -CHAMBERS: OK, but in case he steps aside, they believe that there is a -BREAM: There's a plan.CHAMBERS: It's prudent that - to lay out that there is actually a process for how this would look.BREAM: All right.CHAMBERS: It would involve getting signatures. There is a whole -BREAM: There is a whole thing.CHAMBERS: There's a whole process. There's a whole thing.BREAM: We'll see if they get to that. OK.CHAMBERS: OK.BREAM: Our next topic, one week after the deadly shooting at his rally in Pennsylvania, President Trump takes the stage with his new VP pick and speaks out on the investigation into what went so terribly wrong. We dig into that, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Mistakes were made. They are monitoring this guy for an hour beforehand.TRUMP: Yes.WATTERS: No one told you not to take the stage?TRUMP: No, nobody mentioned it. Nobody said there was a problem. And I would have waited for 15 - they could have said, let's wait for 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 5 minute, something. Nobody said - I think it was a mistake.How did somebody get on that roof and why wasn't he reported because people saw that he was on the roof.(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: Yes. Well, President Trump telling Jesse Watters that he was left in the dark and allowed to take the stage last Saturday as law enforcement was still in the process of investigating sightings of the attempted assassin who wound up shooting him.You can see that full interview with Trump and his VP pick, JD Vance, on ""JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME"" Monday, 8:00 p.m., on Fox News Channel.Back now with the panel.I want to read something from ""National Review"" that talks about just how bad this was. ""The agency's failure is total: A man is dead, two others were injured, the president was injured, and the social fabric of the country came within one lucky head-tilt of being rent asunder. And nobody is being held accountable for it. President Biden cannot bring himself to fire the Secret Service director, even amid the escalating revelations of professional incompetents surrounding the worst and most fatal presidential security failure since the days of Dealey Plaza and the Ambassador Hotel.""Horace, why has no one been fired?COOPER: Apparently they haven't read Dr. Seuss' book, ""Marvin K. Mooney, Please Go Now."" She needs to go. She needs to be gone. I don't understand why she would even put up with this hearing this week and go through this excruciating pain.Here's what we know. She is at DEI hire. And as a DEI hire, she's done an excellent job at being at DEI hire.What she isn't good at is being the Secret Service director.BREAM: No, I would say, I don't know that she's a DEI hire. I mean, she's a woman who's in this position. But -COOPER: Oh, she chose - she chose to - to make her mark on - instead of getting more funding for her agents and seeing that the qualifications were increased, she chose to make sure that it looked more like America. We don't need the Secret Service to look more like America. We needed to look like the number one security force on the planet.BREAM: She'll have a lot of questions to answer.I want to get to some other topics, but, Marc, you have a quick comment on that. I see you nodding over here.THIESSEN: So, there was an active plot by the Iranian regime, this most sophisticated terrorist state in the world, to - to kill Donald Trump, that the U.S. government was aware of, and they let a teenager shoot him. I mean what is wrong with this - with this - with this administration? This - they - Donald Trump said in the debates, in this presidency nobody gets fired for anything. No one was - no one was fired for Afghanistan. No one was fired for the border chaos. And now nobody's getting fired for allowing the president to be shot? I mean, you know, your job, as the head of the Secret Service is to protect the president. The president got shot. It's - it's a two minute decision, and the first minute's for coffee. You should be gone.BREAM: OK, I - there's so much more we could say about that. We're going to watch all these hearings play out this week. But I want to make sure we have this, because Bibi Netanyahu, Israel's prime ministers, is coming to town this week. He's going to speak to this joint address of Congress. And also, if the president is well enough and not contagious with Covid, me with him as well.""New York Times"" says that might have something to do with President Biden delaying a decision about his future, saying this, ""advises believe that Mr. Biden would not want to do it before Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel visits Washington on Wednesday at the initiative of Republicans to address Congress, unwilling to give the premier the satisfaction given their strained relations lately over the Gaza war.""How big is this visit this week, Francesca?CHAMBERS: Well, the White House says that President Biden still intends to meet with Bibi Netanyahu this week provide that he's able to do so. But Bibi Netanyahu's visit could not come at a worse time politically for President Joe Biden right now, when he's already facing pressure from Democrats to step aside in this race. There'll be progresses who plan to boycott this. His position on Gaza has been the major dividing line in the Democratic Party at this point. And certainly he has not want to host Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House his entire presidency. Indeed did so in New York previously during UNGA. But based on what I'm hearing now, that is the plan for him to do that this week as they continue to sort out the hostage and peace negotiation deal.BREAM: Final word to you, Marie.HARF: Yes, I mean, I was just in Israel and talk to Israelis across a poetical spectrum. Bibi is under a ton of pressure at home. He hasn't brought the hostages home. The way he's prosecuting the war, many of them feel like is hurting Israel's security and is on in the long-term security interest.Bibi is coming here looking for a political lifeline. And he has made clear he wants President Trump to be president again.So, this is a political visit. I will be very curious to see what he says to Congress, if this will be partisan, like he did before in 2015, or if he tries to be a little different now. We will all be watching it together.BREAM: We will, to see if there's a walkout or boycott or a combination of that.Panel, thank you very much. We will see you next Sunday.Up next, as we mentioned, the prime minister is headed this way to Washington to meet with Congress and we think President Biden amid a very tense relationship juncture for them. We're going to take you live to Israel next for a preview.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM: Israel launching strikes against the Iran backed Houthis Saturday in response to the attacks against Israel.Fox News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst is live in Israel with the very latest.Hello, Trey.TREY YINGST, FOX NEWS FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, good morning. It was a busy weekend for the Israelis on the battlefield as the country's prime minister prepares for a visit to the United States. You can see in this video here, a fire raging in Yemen after Israeli fighter jets targeted oil tanks and a power station belonging to Houthi rebels. These strikes were meant to send a message of deterrence an Israeli defense official told Fox News, and came in response to a drone attack against Tel Aviv early Friday that killed one person and injured ten others.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): The fire that is currently burning in Hodeidah is seen across the Middle East, and the significance is clear.(END VIDEO CLIP)YINGST: Already the Houthis have responded to the new Israeli action, launching a surface to surface missile towards the southern Israeli city of Eilat this morning.Now, developments on the front against the Houthis come amid hopes of a possible cease-fire deal in Gaza. Nearly 300 days into the war, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says that negotiators are at the 10-yard line to get a deal together. With a focus on Gaza, Israel is still actively fighting Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Now, the group launched nearly 70 rockets into Israel on Saturday, as Israeli strikes against the Iran-backed organization continue.With no concrete plans for peace on the horizon, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu leaves Israel on Monday. He will meet with President Biden on Tuesday. Now the hope is that this visit will facilitate a ceasefire deal and bring dozens of hostages home that have been held in Gaza by Hamas since Black Saturday, October 7th.Shannon.BREAM: Trey Yingst, we appreciate it. Thank you so much.And that is it for us today. Thank you for joining us on FOX NEWS SUNDAY. I'm Shannon Bream.

MSNBC host and former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki reacted live on Sunday during her show, ""Inside with Jen Psaki,"" to President Biden's decision to drop out of the 2024 race. 
""There’s very little indication from people close to him and many people in the campaign that this was about to happen, as much as there were reports of Democrats calling on him to do that,"" she said after reading the letter posted to X by the president. 
The president announced on Sunday that he will ""stand down"" from the 2024 race, following many calls from prominent Democrats. 
""I don’t think either of us had any indication,"" Psaki said to her guest, The Bulwark's Tim Miller. ""And I am always a believer that you have to share with the public what you know, and what you don’t know. We knew that there were lots of calls, but we had not been given any official indication, even as of 10 minutes ago, that decision had been made. I even spoke with Keisha Lance Bottoms earlier this hour, and asked her if she had any indication, and she is a senior adviser, and she had not.""

MAJORITY OF DEMOCRATS THINK KAMALA HARRIS WOULD BE A GOOD PRESIDENT, POLL SHOWS
""I am digesting this myself here, because I worked for him for a year and a half, and he is a remarkable person, a remarkable president. He has had such a tremendous presidency where he has overcome the odds and defied people’s expectations. People didn’t think he could pass an infrastructure bill, they didn’t think that he could lead through COVID, they didn’t think he could pull the countries together,"" Psaki added. 
She also appeared to start getting choked up. 
""He did all of those things and will continue to do those things and also, is a deeply good human being, and I am digesting this myself. I just want to share that,"" Psaki said.

Biden announced Sunday that he is suspending his 2024 re-election campaign and announced his ""full support and endorsement"" for Harris to take over as the party's presidential nominee.
In a statement, the Clintons said Biden ""has capped his extraordinary career of service with a Presidency that has lifted America out of an unprecedented pandemic, created millions of new jobs, rebuilt a battered economy, strengthened our democracy, and restored our standing in the world. By any measure, he has advanced our founders’ charge to build a more perfect union and his own stated goal of restoring the soul of our nation.""

""We join millions of Americans in thanking President Biden for all he has accomplished, standing up for America time and again, with his North Star always being what’s best for the country,"" they said in their joint statement. ""We are honored to join the President in endorsing Vice President Harris and will do whatever we can to support her.""
""We’ve lived through many ups and downs, but nothing has made us more worried for our country than the threat posed by a second Trump term. He has promised to be a dictator on day one, and the recent ruling by his servile Supreme Court will only embolden him to further shred the Constitution. Now is the time to support Kamala Harris and fight with everything we’ve got to elect her. America’s future depends on it.""

Biden's announcement came after weeks of speculation and pressure from Democrats for him to step aside after a disastrous presidential debate performance against Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump. 
""It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your president,"" Biden wrote in a public letter. ""While it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interests of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term.""
TRUMP GETS BOOST IN POLLS AFTER BIDEN'S BOTCHED DEBATE 
In a social media post after the letter, Biden backed Harris to take over as the party's standard-bearer.
""My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it’s been the best decision I’ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this,"" Biden wrote.

The president's endorsement, along with power players like the Clintons, may dissuade any serious completion from other Democrats who may have mulled a bid for the presidential nomination and could clear a path for the vice president to succeed Biden as the party's nominee.

FOX_28,Biden is out and Harris is almost inevitable as nominee. But who knows if my party can win in November?,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-out-harris-almost-inevitable-nominee-who-knows-my-party-win-november,2024-07-22 03:35:03.108204,politics,"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reacts to President Biden announcing he is dropping out of the 2024 presidential race and has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris.
Joe Biden announced Sunday that he is ending his 2024 campaign for president. There’s no doubt he made the announcement because major Democratic leaders in state after state have increasingly come to abandon his candidacy. 
The steady drumbeat questioning the Biden candidacy since his disastrous debate performance just over three weeks ago made Sunday’s announcement all but inevitable. Still, the decision by the incumbent president is virtually unprecedented at this point in a modern election campaign. 
The question now is what is likely to happen in the wake of Biden’s endorsement of his Vice President Kamala Harris? 
BIDEN ENDS BID FOR SECOND TERM IN WHITE HOUSE AS HE DROPS OUT OF HIS 2024 REMATCH WITH TRUMP
With Biden’s endorsement, the nomination of Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party’s 2024 presidential nominee is all but inevitable. And, even if some Democrats talk about a mini-primary or an open convention, I believe the party will be hard-pressed, whatever procedure they adopt, to deny the sitting vice president the party’s nomination. 
Here’s the bottom line: While Harris’ nomination is inevitable, her election as the next president of the United States certainly is not.
Former President Donald Trump is correct to say that Harris will be easier for him to beat than Biden. And the polling evidence we have suggests that she is essentially as weak nationally and in the seven key swing states as President Joe Biden was. Moreover, while Joe Biden arguably has a record of achievement to run on, it’s hard to point to any accomplishments by the vice president. Indeed, her most prominent role in the Biden administration has been to be responsible for the southern border as our so-called Border Czar, which objectively, as well as politically, has been an unqualified disaster for the Democrats and the Biden-Harris administration.
BIDEN ENDS BID FOR SECOND TERM IN WHITE HOUSE, ENDORSES KAMALA HARRIS
It is hard to see how Harris will be able to run a campaign that will be in any way fundamentally different from the one Joe Biden was running. And her political appeal does not seem to be as broad as that of Biden, even with his support eroding this summer.
To be sure, it is likely that African-Americans in the party, especially the Congressional Black Caucus, will be strong, indeed vociferous advocates of Harris’ candidacy, as will the progressive left. But in a situation and in circumstances where former President Trump has spoken of uniting the country, it’s hard to see how Vice President Harris, given her political posture and appeal, will be able to do similarly. 
To be sure, there is one issue that Harris will run on, and she will run very, very aggressively on it, and that’s abortion.
Still, objectively speaking, given that the two most important issues facing the country are inflation and the southern border, it’s hard to see how abortion will have the same impact electorally that it had in the midterms two years ago.

Moreover, given Harris’ posture on the Middle East, it also seems likely that she will be challenged to do what Democrats invariably have done in presidential elections, both nationally and in swing states, and that is to win the Jewish vote.
All of this adds up to a very great challenge for my party. And under these circumstances, the calls for an open convention and a mini-primary process seem likely not to succeed or, if they do succeed, to create an unprecedented degree of uncertainty and potentially chaos, over the next month or so.

Indeed, there will be calls from the Republicans, which have already begun, to get the cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment. These leaders are asking, in effect, if Joe Biden can’t run for another term, how can he continue to serve as our president?
At the very least, that is a fair question. But for now, we can say with some degree of certainty that the race has swung decisively in the direction of former president Donald Trump. 
What and how the Democrats respond to these extraordinary circumstances will determine whether the race remains competitive, or whether the Republicans achieve the large scale victory they are seeking with a decisive win in the presidential election, holding the House and retaking the Senate.

President Biden announced Sunday he would drop out of the presidential race, making him the first president since 1968 to not seek re-election.
Biden made the announcement on Sunday afternoon, with just 183 days left in his term, and 29 days before the Democratic National Convention on Aug. 19, 2024.
On March 31, 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced he would not seek re-election with 295 days left in his term, and 148 days until the party convention.
Before that, President Harry S. Truman announced he would not seek another term on March 29, 1952, and Calvin Coolidge announced he would not seek re-election on Aug. 2, 1927.

In U.S. history, only three presidents made and kept their promises to serve only one term.
President Rutherford B. Hayes announced in advance that he would serve only one term, and when his term was up he retired to Spiegel Grove, his home in Fremont, Ohio, in 1881.
President James Buchanan was another president who promised to serve only one term, and at the time, the nation was facing turmoil over slavery and nobody asked him to rescind his pledge.

Finally, President James K. Polk kept his promise to not seek a second term. He was succeeded in office by Zachary Taylor, a hero from the Mexican War and a member of the opposing Whig Party whom Polk despised.

Republican lawmakers are calling on President Biden to resign from office immediately after he announced he will not seek re-election in November.
Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement, ""If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President. He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough.""
""If the Democrat party has deemed Joe Biden unfit to run for re-election, he's certainly unfit to control our nuclear codes,"" House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said minutes after the bombshell news broke. ""Biden must step down from office immediately.""
House GOP Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., similarly said, ""If Joe Biden can’t run for re-election, he is unable and unfit to serve as President of the United States. He must immediately resign. The Democrat Party is in absolute free fall for their blatantly corrupt and desperate attempt to cover up the fact that Joe Biden is unfit for office.""

""If Joe Biden is unfit to be the Democrat nominee for president, he’s unfit to be president for the rest of his term. For the good of the country, Joe Biden should resign immediately,"" said Republican Study Committee Chair Kevin Hern, R-Okla.
The 81-year-old president has been under mounting pressure to drop out of the 2024 presidential race in the wake of his disastrous debate performance against former President Trump last month. 
His weak showing spurred concerns over whether he had the mental and physical stability to run a campaign and serve another four-year term. 
Biden finally bowed to that pressure on Sunday, writing in a public letter, ""It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.""

Democratic lawmakers who have called on Biden to drop out have insisted they are confident he can finish the roughly five months left in his term. 
Some of their arguments against his candidacy include that questions about his fitness for office are a distraction from the campaign, while others have said their concerns lie with where he will be four years down the road, rather than the immediate future.
But Republicans who have long claimed Biden is not mentally fit for office have seized on his announcement as vindication of their doubts.

I’ve been acutely aware of the possibility of President Joe Biden dropping out of the 2024 race since the debate at the end of June. I was still on maternity leave, but it was about all my friends could talk about. 
""What do you think he’s going to do?"" they asked. ""Do we like Kamala, now?"" they wondered. ""Is there time to swap him out and get on all the ballots?"" they panicked. 
Now we know the answer. Biden just announced that he won’t be seeking reelection this November. And even though I knew it was coming, it feels profoundly sad to me.  
'PROUD OF OUR PRESIDENT': DEMS HEAP PRAISE ON BIDEN FOR DECISION TO END 2024 CAMPAIGN
Sad on a human level. Joe Biden is a fundamentally good man who did not want this outcome. He believes he can win, even if the data doesn’t say so. And sad on a political level. Biden was an incredible president with a record to be enormously proud of. Whoever is at the top of our ticket will no doubt celebrate his accomplishments – and him! – but there’s a joy to how he talks about what the Biden-Harris administration has gotten done that I’ll really miss.

Like he always says, it’s personal for him. 
Getting the American Rescue Plan in response to COVID-19 passed was personal. Because of Biden, low-to-medium income earners got $1,400 to put towards groceries and rent. The child-tax credit was extended. And over $7 billion was allotted for small business loans. 
Getting the bipartisan infrastructure bill passed was personal. Because of Biden, our roads, bridges, public transport and airports are getting much-needed investment. Over $60 billion is going toward expanding broadband. And $55 billion for clean drinking water. It should be noted that not one single Republican voted for the bill.

Getting the bipartisan gun safety bill passed was personal. Because of Biden, the largest gun safety legislation in over three decades was signed into law. It includes incentives to states to pass red-flag laws and prohibit people convicted of domestic abuse from owning a gun. It also expands background checks on people ages 18-21. Did it do everything Biden wanted? Absolutely not. But he got it done. 
Getting the Inflation Reduction Act passed was personal. Because of Biden, the U.S. made the largest investment in combating climate change on record. Corporations now have to pay their fair share. Medicare can now negotiate the price of certain expensive drugs. Insulin is capped at $35 a month! Come on, man, as Biden would say.  
Getting the CHIPS and Sciences Act passed was personal. Because of Biden, over $50 billion in federal incentives was granted to semiconductor manufacturing, leading to thousands of new, good-paying jobs across America. There has been over $200 billion in private sector investment as a result. By the end of the decade, we’ll produce close to 20% of the world’s most advanced chips. That’s how you stick it to China. 
What’s more, under Biden we have record low unemployment and a record high stock market. We are producing more crude oil than any other country in history – 13 million barrels a day. Our economy is the envy of the world. NATO is stronger, and we are a force for good in the world.

Vice President Kamala Harris is rapidly emerging as the logical successor to President Biden, Democratic strategists said soon after the 81-year-old leader announced he would drop out of the 2024 election.
Meanwhile, leaders in the Democratic Party, including Biden himself, are already coalescing around Harris, strengthening her position as the president's heir apparent.
""I think that the only practical, logical and ethical thing we do is to coalesce around Kamala Harris in this moment,"" former Obama administration Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs to the House Joel Rubin told Fox News Digital. 
Rubin said Harris was ""vetted and experienced,"" having gone through much of the Democratic primary process already, and pointed out that she stands to inherit the Biden campaign's vast infrastructure and $240 million war chest.

""Nothing gets upended that way,"" Rubin said. That point was echoed by strategist Antjuan Seawright, who urged Democrats to unify swiftly around the vice president, so the party could remain ""focused on the message"" for the remainder of the election.
""She is the only person that can inherit the operation that's been built, as well as the… finances that have been built,"" Seawright said. ""So I think that's important, and quite frankly, because 14 million voters have spoken, decisively about the two of them. And in any situation, if it becomes two minus one, she becomes the one.""
Harris' case is also bolstered by endorsements from former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,  Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., and the Congressional Black Caucus.

Biden was under mounting pressure from fellow Democrats to drop out of the 2024 race after his disastrous performance in the CNN Presidential Debate last month. His weak showing spurred concerns among his allies about whether Biden is mentally and physically fit to run a campaign and serve another four years.
Jim Kessler, a former senior aide to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Harris clinching Biden's blessing is ""significant"" in cementing her place as his successor.
""I think no matter which Democrats decide to get in the race, Harris is in the pole position,"" Kessler told Fox News Digital. ""Just remember, like, these are —these are Biden-Harris delegates going to the convention. And there's a ton of loyalty among convention delegates towards Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.""

Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the presidential race on Sunday only affirms what we’ve known, despite media running interference for him for years, about his incapacity and inability to handle the rigors of another presidential election campaign. The American people saw it clearly. That’s s why they prefer President Trump’s reelection by overwhelming margins.
For months, members of the left and the liberal media have tried to pull the curtain over the eyes of the American electorate. They played American voters for fools in the weeks following the debate after the president’s cognitive decline was made abundantly clear. But now, Joe Biden has all but admitted to what his adversaries, and even members of his own party, have said repeatedly – he is unfit to serve in the Office of the President for another four years. 
This isn’t the end of the story, though, and we cannot allow the left to turn a new page without accountability. The media must be held accountable for its lies on behalf of a decrepit president for so long. The courtiers and aides who defended their power and privilege at his expense, including Jill and Hunter, must be held accountable. And, most of all, the Democratic power structure that just successfully executed a coup against a sitting president must be held accountable.
BIDEN ENDS BID FOR SECOND TERM IN WHITE HOUSE AS HE DROPS OUT OF HIS 2024 REMATCH WITH TRUMP
In the timing of this decision, the Biden administration and its Democratic allies have successfully invalidated their party’s primary system. Voters across the country will now no longer have the chance to elect a Democratic nominee for president through primary elections; rather, an open convention will grant a few thousand party elites the opportunity to decide on behalf of the many. This is not an electoral process fit for the democratic republic our founding fathers established. 
Amid all of this, it is shocking to think that some still argue that President Trump is the ""threat to democracy."" Take one look at how the Biden administration and the Democratic Party have handled their 2024 presidential nomination and you will see where the real threat to our democracy lies. 
For all this, the question remains: if Joe cannot run, how can Joe preside? If he is unfit to be a candidate, then he is absolutely unfit to be a president. Section 4 of the 25th Amendment has not been invoked in the history of our nation… perhaps it is time for that to change.

Yet, Democrats continue to outdo themselves, showing just how out-of-touch they are with the American people. Just look at Biden’s endorsement of Kamala Harris on Sunday. They are elevating the woman who has supposedly been in charge of our Southern border since 2021 – the same border that has proven to be the top issue for most voters this November. 
A senescent and incompetent president who has deemed himself unfit to run has endorsed yet another incompetent, unfit vice president to follow in his footsteps. If it had not been clear enough already, one thing is certain today – no member of this banana administration is fit to lead our great United States of America. 
Throughout this race, we have heard President Reagan’s famous question: ""Are you better off today than you were four years ago?"" Well, it seems Joe Biden has finally answered that question for himself – no.

Another attendee told Fox News Digital that she has ""mixed thoughts"" on who would replace Biden, given that Harris is believed to be the only candidate who can immediately access funds in the Biden war chest: ""It's a really unusual situation.""

Biden announced Sunday that he will suspend his 2024 re-election campaign amid mounting pressure from within the Democratic Party for the president to drop out after a disastrous debate performance against Trump last month.
The unprecedented announcement also came as an increasing number of Democrat lawmakers publicly called for Biden to step aside and the party's leadership reportedly engaged in efforts to convince the president, 81, he could not win in November's general election against former Trump, the 2024 GOP nominee who Biden defeated four years ago to win the White House.
""It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your president,"" Biden, who endorsed Harris, wrote in a public letter. ""While it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interests of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term.""
Biden said he will formally address the nation about his decision this week.

World leaders have quickly responded to the long-awaited news that President Biden has decided not to run for a second term, which took many by surprise despite the reports over the past two weeks.
""I respect President Biden's decision and I look forward to us working together during the remainder of his presidency,"" British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, elected and appointed to office less than three weeks ago, wrote on social media platform X. 
""I know that, as he has done throughout his remarkable career, he will have made his decision based on what he believes is best for the American people,"" he added. 
Biden issued a statement at around 2 p.m. EST on Sunday, by all accounts keeping his decision very private up until the moment he published his statement online. Reports indicate that his campaign staff were still geared up to continue this coming week when they heard the news. 
DEMOCRATIC DELEGATES SHIFT SPOTLIGHT TO KAMALA HARRIS FOLLOWING BIDEN'S 2024 DROPOUT DECISION
But reports had indicated that Biden was increasingly likely to decide to stand down, as major donors threatened to pull support and over three dozen elected Democrats in Congress urged Biden to stand aside and let the party put forward a new candidate.

Former British prime minister and current member of parliament Rishi Sunak wrote that ""working with Joe Biden, I saw firsthand his love for America and dedication to service.""
""Our partnership has led to significant achievements, including AUKUS, steadfast support for Israel and joint efforts in defending our people from Houthi threats,"" Sunak wrote. ""I wish him all the best.""

Aside from Sunak and Johnson, mainly left-leaning European and world leaders have issued statements of thanks to Biden, praising his brave decision to step back from the election at his party’s insistence. 
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese paid respects to Biden, thanking him for his ""leadership and ongoing service"" and touting the U.S.-Australia alliance as stronger than ever ""with our shared commitment to democratic values, international security, economic prosperity and climate action for this and future generations.""

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called Biden a ""great man,"" adding that ""everything he does is guided by his love for his country.""

Biden will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later this week, but Israeli President Isaac Herzog issued some immediate thoughts on X, writing to ""extend my heartfelt thanks to POTUS Joe Biden for his friendship and steadfast support for the Israeli people over his decades long career.""
""As the first US President to visit Israel in wartime, as a recipient of the Israeli Presidential Medal of Honor, and as a true ally of the Jewish people, he is a symbol of the unbreakable bond between our two peoples,"" Herzog wrote. ""I send him, FLOTUS Jill Biden, and all his family, my warmest wishes from Jerusalem."" 
BILL HEMMER: ‘THE DEMOCRATS ARE REALLY IN A BIND’
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz wrote on X that his ""friend"" Biden ""has achieved a lot: For his country, for Europe, for the world."" 
""Thanks to him, transatlantic cooperation is close, NATO is strong and the USA is a good and reliable partner for us,"" Scholz wrote. ""His decision not to run again deserves respect.""
Irish Taoiseach Simon Harris issued a statement ""on behalf of the people and government of Ireland,"" a country that Biden has strong familial ties to and great admiration for, saying that ""I wish you, Mrs. Biden and your family every success and I look forward to working with you for the remainder of your presidency."" 
""I … would like to thank you Mr. President for your global leadership and your friendship as you make your announcement that you will not stand in the 2024 US presidential election,"" Harris wrote. 
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez wrote of all his ""admiration and recognition for the brave and dignified decision of the President Joe Biden."" 
""Thanks to its determination and leadership, the US overcame the economic crisis after the pandemic and the serious assault on the Capitol and has been exemplary in its support for Ukraine in the face of Putin's Russian aggression,"" Sanchez wrote on X, according to a translation.

Democrats in the House's far-left ""Squad"" are lining up behind Vice President Kamala Harris to replace President Biden after he made the bombshell announcement that he is dropping out of the 2024 White House race.
The group of young progressives who made a name for themselves by rebelling against traditional Democratic Party leaders are quickly falling in line behind 81-year-old Biden's chosen successor.
""This was the president’s decision to make and I’m grateful for his years of service to our country. Thrilled to support [Harris] as our Democratic nominee and remain committed to working alongside her to defeat Donald Trump in November,"" Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., wrote on X.

Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., who recently lost his re-election bid to a more moderate primary challenger, said on X, ""Now that President Biden has suspended his campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris is the most qualified and best choice to lead us forward.""
Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., facing a similarly tough re-election bid, said in a statement, ""When we say trust Black women, we mean it. Black women are the backbone of the Democratic Party and it is past time for us to lead our country forward. Kamala Harris is more than ready to lead at this moment.""
Two notable figures who have been silent on the matter as of late afternoon on Sunday are Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.
Tlaib is one of the Biden administration's harshest critics in terms of its handling of the war between Israel and Hamas.

Ocasio-Cortez, who has backed Biden amid mounting pressure from fellow Democrats for him to drop out, hosted a live feed on Instagram just after former President Trump's speech at the Republican National Convention (RNC) last week. 
She said on video that high-dollar Democratic donors were to blame for pressuring Biden, and that those same people did not want Harris to run either.
""I’m here to tell you that a huge amount of the donor class and a huge amount of these elites and a huge amount of these folks in these rooms that I see that are pushing for President Biden to not be the nominee also are not interested in seeing Vice President being the nominee,"" she said.
Fox News Digital reached out to Ocasio-Cortez to ask if she would be endorsing Harris.

His weak showing spurred concerns over whether he had the mental and physical stability to run a campaign and serve another four-year term. 
Biden bowed to that pressure on Sunday, writing in a public letter, ""It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President.

Former President Trump has a narrow edge over President Biden after the 46th president’s disastrous debate performance last month, a Fox News poll found, but the election cycle was thrown into disarray Sunday when Biden announced he won’t seek re-election. 
""It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,"" Biden said in his letter posted to X on Sunday afternoon. 
Biden was ahead by two points last month (50%-48%), and now Trump is ahead by 1 point (49%-48%), which is also exactly where things stood in May, a Fox News national survey published last week found. 
Democrat strategist Julian Epstein told Fox News Digital that a ""ham sandwich"" would likely perform better in polls than Biden when asked how Trump would fare against a candidate other than the president.

""At this point, a ham sandwich would probably have a greater likelihood of success in the general election than Biden,"" he said. ""There are generic polls out there that suggest a young candidate versus Trump does well.""
""If the Democrats were smart, they would find a younger, attractive governor [in] their 40s or 50s who was in the political center. But Democrats being smart in the circumstance is giving them a huge benefit of the doubt,"" Epstein added.

Biden endorsed Harris shortly after his announcement. Other Democrats such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have been floated as viable candidates.
Harris appears to be the likely replacement for Biden as she gains additional endorsements from heavy-hitting Democrats such as former President Clinton and Hillary Clinton.
Harris notably has a lower favorability rating than Trump, according to a new ABC News/Ipsos poll. Trump recorded his highest favorability rating in the history of the poll at 40%, up from the low to mid 30% range the former president typically hovered in the poll. Harris received a lower favorability than Trump at 35%.

Fox News Digital asked Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene during the RNC in Milwaukee last week if a candidate other than Biden would diminish Trump’s shot at the White House, which she shot down, arguing that whoever takes the mantle will have to run on Biden’s record in the White House.
'PROUD OF OUR PRESIDENT': DEMS HEAP PRAISE ON BIDEN FOR DECISION TO END 2024 CAMPAIGN
""No matter who they put at the top of the ticket, that candidate has to run with the job record that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have brought the several past years, because Democrats are fully aligned behind those policies,"" Greene said.
""I think America really came to one mindset and got resolved behind President Trump and behind the Republican Party after seeing him almost assassinated on Saturday. It's a moment that everyone will always remember where they were when that happened, similar to 9/11. Everyone remembers where they were when that happened. I also think people are just really fed up with the border invasion that's happening every day. The fact that people can't afford food, can't afford rent and inflation is really crippling a lot of people,"" she added.
Harris has a long history as a California liberal stalwart, serving as San Francisco’s district attorney in the early 2000s, then serving as the state attorney general under former Democrat Gov. Jerry Brown, and U.S. senator from the Golden State before her 2020 election as vice president.
If Harris takes up the party’s 2024 presidential election mantle, it is unlikely Harris’ policies would drastically differ from Biden’s platforms, though she could swing harder to the left on issues such as immigration, abortion and foreign policy.
Three Democrat delegates expressed support for Harris in comments to Fox News Digital on Sunday, with one saying the party is ""100% supporting Kamala Harris.""

""I can tell you that the delegation in Florida that I'm speaking with ... people are 100% on board following President Biden's endorsement of Kamala Harris,"" said Samantha Hope Herring, a Democrat delegate and elected member of the DNC from Florida.
Echoing Herring, Karl Gentles, a Democrat delegate from Arizona, told Fox he supports Harris and will vote for her at the party's convention.
""While it is disappointing news that Biden has decided to not seek re-election, he has demonstrated that leadership starts with putting country first above all else. He understands what’s at stake for the future of our country and the imperative of winning this election,"" he said. ""I support VP Harris and will be casting my vote for her at the DNC Convention.""
Trump responded to the news of Biden dropping out by slamming him as the ""worst president"" in U.S. history.
""He is the worst president in the history of our country,"" Trump told Fox News Digital in a phone interview on Sunday afternoon. ""There has never been a president so bad.""
""He is not fit to serve,"" Trump continued. ""And I ask: Who is going to be running the country for the next five months?"" 
Trump added in comments to CNN on Sunday that he believes defeating Harris, if she emerges as the official nominee, would be an easier feat than defeating Biden in November.

Epstein said that for Democrats, Biden ""is only half their problem.""
""The other half is that the American people don't like the results of their governing for the last four years. That's true on every single issue other than abortion,"" he said.
He argued that with Democrats ""course correcting,"" they ""shouldn't half-a-- it with a stand-in for Biden. They should do a complete correction and find the political center with the younger candidate.""

Calls had mounted for weeks that Biden should drop out of the race after his disastrous debate performance against Trump on June 27, when he stumbled over his responses and appeared much more subdued in his demeanor than during other public events.

A list of former President Obama's allies and former advisers helped lead the charge in calling on President Biden to drop out of the 2024 race before he officially ended his campaign on Sunday afternoon.
Biden officially dropped out of the 2024 race after weeks of increasing pressure from traditional Democrat allies to bow out after his disastrous debate performance against former President Trump last month, which put concerns surrounding his mental acuity and 81 years of age under increasing scrutiny. 
""My fellow Democrats, I have decided not to accept the nomination and to focus all my energies on my duties as President for the remainder of my term,"" Biden posted on X after he dropped out of the race on Sunday afternoon.
""My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it’s been the best decision I’ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this,"" he said in a separate social media post.
GROWING LIST OF OBAMA ALLIES, FORMER ADVISERS LOOK TO SINK BIDEN RE-ELECTION BID

Among some of the most noteworthy voices calling on Biden to bow out were allies of Obama's, including his former adviser, David Axelrod, who said this month that Biden is ""not winning this race."" Biden served as Obama's vice president from 2009 to 2017. 
""There are certain immutable facts of life,"" Axelrod said in an interview with CNN while discussing Biden's age and leadership. ""Those were painfully obvious on that debate stage. The president just … hasn't come to grips with it. He’s not winning this race.""
Axelrod formerly served as Obama's chief campaign strategist, and he said Biden is used to fighting ""his way back from political defeats and against the odds.""
EX-OBAMA ADVISER SAYS BIDEN CAN'T BEAT 'FATHER TIME' AND IS 'NOT WINNING THIS RACE'
""So, his psyche is that he can beat anybody and any long odds,"" he said this month. ""What he can’t beat is Father Time."" 
""And that’s really the concern here. It’s not about his record,"" Axelrod continued.
Axelrod was soon followed by actor George Clooney calling on Biden to drop out of the race in a bombshell op-ed that was published just weeks after the Hollywood star co-hosted Biden, alongside Obama, for a ritzy campaign event in Los Angeles. Clooney has long had a personal friendship with Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama, including vacationing with the first couple in previous years.

""It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe ‘big F-ing deal’ Biden of 2010,"" Clooney wrote in a New York Times op-ed. ""He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.""
Another ally in Obama's orbit, Jon Favreau, who served as former director of speech writing for Obama, also called on Biden to drop out of the race this month, saying he attended the fundraiser in L.A. with Clooney and Obama and saw Biden's state of mental acuity.

""It was not surprising to any of us who were at the fundraiser. I was there. Clooney was exactly right, and every single person I talked to at the fundraiser thought the same thing, except for the people working for Joe Biden, or at least they didn't say that,"" Jon Favreau said during an appearance on CNN this month. 
""I remember my wife, Emily, turned to me after the fundraiser and said, ‘What are we going to do?’ And I said, ‘Well, there is a debate in a week. Either he’ll do well in the debate, and we'll think he was just tired because he flew all the way back from Europe, and that'll be that, or he'll be like this at the debate and then the whole country will be talking about it. So, here we are.""
Favreau, alongside former Obama advisers Jon Lovett and Tommy Vietor – known collectively as the ""Obama Bros"" when they worked in the White House – dedicated the majority of a podcast episode of ""Pod Save America"" this month to trashing Biden.

""I thought it was bad, and at times very hard to watch,"" Vietor said, referring to Biden's sit-down interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos after Biden's debate performance. 
Vietor said it ""seems like a clear-cut choice that we'd have a better chance with someone else,"" while Lovett added that Biden wasn't ""delivering the message effectively.""

Up until Sunday afternoon, Biden and his campaign remained adamant that the president would not bow out of the race. 
Obama has remained relatively silent while Biden weighed his options for the election, coming to Biden's defense after his recent debate performance but not responding to media reports that he was working behind the scenes to promote Biden's exit.
OBAMA SILENT OVER REPORTS HE'S WORKING ‘BEHIND THE SCENES’ TO FORCE BIDEN OUT OF THE 2024 RACE
""Bad debate nights happen. Trust me, I know. But this election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself. Between someone who tells the truth; who knows right from wrong and will give it to the American people straight — and someone who lies through his teeth for his own benefit. Last night didn’t change that, and it’s why so much is at stake in November,"" he posted on X at the time. 
As media reports circulated that Obama was working ""behind the scenes"" to oust Biden from the race, the 44th president remained mum, not denying the reports. Politico reported that Clooney even gave Obama a ""heads-up"" that his op-ed calling on Biden to bow out of the race was set to publish, with Obama reportedly not objecting to the opinion piece.

Obama released a statement on Sunday commending Biden for his work in the Oval Office, but he did not tip his hand as to who he believes should pick up the mantle now that the president is no longer running for re-election. Biden, as well as the Clintons and other powerful Democrats, announced their endorsement of Vice President Harris shortly after Biden's announcement.
""We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead. But I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges. I believe that Joe Biden’s vision of a generous, prosperous, and united America that provides opportunity for everyone will be on full display at the Democratic Convention in August. And I expect that every single one of us are prepared to carry that message of hope and progress forward into November and beyond,"" Obama wrote on Sunday in a lengthy statement. 
""Joe Biden has been one of America’s most consequential presidents, as well as a dear friend and partner to me. Today, we’ve also been reminded — again — that he’s a patriot of the highest order,"" Obama added. 
Amid the speculation that Biden would drop out, the Associated Press reported that Obama, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi were reportedly working in the background to encourage Biden to drop out due to concerns he could not defeat Trump. 
Pelosi notably suggested this month that Biden's previously adamant resolve to remain in the race was not his final decision.
‘OBAMA BRO’ CONFIRMS CLAIMS IN CLOONEY'S DAMAGING OP-ED ON BIDEN'S MENTAL FITNESS
""It’s up to the president to decide if he is going to run,"" she said this month on MSNBC. ""We’re all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.""
Obama had joined Biden for a handful of campaign events since last year, but long before joining Biden on the campaign trail – or even endorsing his former running mate – Obama cautioned Biden against seeking the White House, citing fears that the campaign could ""damage his legacy,"" according to a 2019 New York Times report.
""You don’t have to do this, Joe, you really don’t,"" Obama reportedly told Biden in 2019.

""Win or lose, they needed to make sure Mr. Biden did not ‘embarrass himself’ or ‘damage his legacy’ during the campaign,"" the New York Times reported, citing two people with knowledge of the conversation.
Biden had made a series of gaffes before becoming Obama's running mate in 2008, including in 2007 when Biden was about to declare his own run for the White House. On the eve of his announcement, Biden described Obama to a reporter as ""the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy.""
‘OBAMA BROS' GANG UP ON BIDEN AS LONGSTANDING RUMORS OF TENSION LINGER: ‘HARD TO WATCH’
Obama had remained coy about who he would endorse in the 2020 election, saying he would not back anyone during the primary. As Democrat contenders such as Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the primary race and cleared a path for Biden, Obama endorsed his former veep in August 2020.

As Democrats suss out who they will officially nominate for the 2024 election, some in the president's orbit have pinned blame on his failed 2024 race on donors and ""electeds.""
""Now that the donors and electeds have pushed out the only candidate who has ever beaten Trump, it’s time to end the political fantasy games and unite behind the only veteran of a national campaign — our outstanding @vp @KamalaHarris!! Let’s get real and win in November!,"" former White House chief of staff Ron Klain posted on X. 
After Biden's announcement, Republicans have demanded the president resign from office, arguing that if he is unable to run for another term, he's unable to fulfill his duties as president for the rest of his term.
""If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President. He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement on Sunday.

Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, also called on Biden to resign hours before he officially announced he was dropping out.
""If Joe Biden ends his reelection campaign, how can he justify remaining President?

There is no middle ground,"" Vance tweeted Sunday morning.

But what I came to admire even more was his character — his deep empathy and hard-earned resilience; his fundamental decency and belief that everyone counts,"" Obama said.The former president also cited Biden's track record in the 3½ years he has served as commander-in-chief, saying ""he helped end the pandemic, created millions of jobs, lowered the cost of prescription drugs, passed the first major piece of gun safety legislation in 30 years, made the biggest investment to address climate change in history, and fought to ensure the rights of working people to organize for fair wages and benefits.""

Former South Carolina state lawmaker and CNN analyst Bakari Sellers said Democrat voters are ""pissed off"" by President Biden's decision to withdraw from the race, blaming party leadership for pressuring him into suspending his campaign.
In an interview on ""CNN Newsroom"" Sunday, Sellers said his phone has been ""blowing up"" with concerned Democrats fearful that Kamala Harris will be ""pushed"" off the ticket as they believe Biden was following his announcement that he is ending his re-election bid.
""My phone is blowing up with people who are pissed off and the reason they‘re pissed off, is because they feel like people from on high pushed Joe Biden out the door,"" he said.

BIDEN ENDORSES KAMALA AFTER BOWING OUT OF 2024 RACE
Biden's announcement comes as an increasing number of Democrat lawmakers had begun to publicly urge him to step aside. The party's leadership reportedly was engaged in efforts to convince Biden, 81, he could not win in November's general election against former President Trump.

Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer reportedly told Biden in a ""blunt one-on-one conversation"" last week it would be best if he ""bowed out of the race,"" according to an ABC report on X.
Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., reportedly told President Biden in a phone call that polls are showing he cannot defeat former President Trump in November and that him staying in the race could destroy Democrats’ chances of taking the House in November.
Biden offered his ""full support and endorsement"" for Vice President Kamala Harris to take over as the party's presidential nominee. The president's endorsement is likely to dissuade any serious completion from other Democrats who may have mulled a bid for the presidential nomination and could clear a path for the vice president to succeed Biden as the party's nominee.
Following the news, Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement, ""Joe Biden has not only been a great president and a great legislative leader, but he is a truly amazing human being. His decision of course was not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first.""

Kennedy Jr. talks immigration, civil liberties and foreign policy as he pledges a return to transparent government and a battle against D.C. bureaucracy.
Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the contest for the White House is a ""two-man race"" and that only he can beat Donald Trump after President Biden's shocking withdrawal from a second-term bid.
Speaking Sunday at a hastily called press conference from his family's storied compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, Kennedy praised Biden while simultaneously blaming Democratic Party leaders for ""hiding"" his mental decline.
""I want to begin by commending President Biden for a career in public service: a long, long career and representing and serving our country and for his handling of the many difficulties and challenges, personal challenges and tragedies that he suffered during his life with so much admirable conduct and the empathy that he derives from those experiences,"" Kennedy said.
Kennedy, who left the party his family once ruled after it blocked his bid to challenge Biden in primaries, said the Democratic National Committee created a mess by covering for Biden.
RFK JR INTERVIEW: TRUMP, BIDEN 'BOTH RAVAGED AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AND THE REPUBLIC'""The reaction of the DNC to that obvious condition was to hide it from the American public and to use their power over the Democratic Party nomination process to make sure that nobody could compete with President Biden in a way that would expose his deficiencies,"" Kennedy argued.
Kennedy continued his campaign as an independent, and he has reached double-digits in some polls on a platform that decries ""corporate capture,"" the affordability crisis, and ""forever wars,"" according to his campaign website.

Kennedy also called out former President Trump as well as Vice President Harris, who appears poised to head the Democrat ticket. 
""President Trump has a connection to the American people, a populist connection,"" said Kennedy. ""But in many ways, it's the same fraudulent connection that we saw with the DNC over the past year, concealing a real purpose of their objective, which was to give us a president that … represents corporate interests rather than the interests of the American public.""
WHAT COMES NEXT FOR DEMOCRATS AFTER BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN SUSPENSION?
""If the Democrats do what I suspect they're going to do, which is to anoint Kamala Harris, a vice president who is monumentally unpopular within her own party … they're doing it because it's the easiest way to hold on to the money,"" Kennedy said.
Kennedy said he would consider accepting the Democrat nomination if were it offered to him.
""I would certainly listen to the party elders if they came to me, I would discuss something with them,"" said Kennedy. ""I'm the only presidential candidate who can beat Donald Trump, and if I were them, I would do that, and I would certainly listen to their proposals.""

""I wouldn't be the front-runner, because by the time I left the Democratic Party, it was really clear that, and this is the only reason I left that day, that the rules have been rigged to prevent me from winning,"" Kennedy said. ""So, I would be in the same position as [presidential candidates] Dean Phillips today or Marianne Williamson, which is, you know, sidelined.""
Kennedy added, ""I am very content running where I am, and I believe I can win this election. I believe at this point it's a two-man race or two-person race. Let me put it that way. And, you know, and that I'm in the best position to win.""

Former President Donald Trump said the next presidential debate should be moderated by Fox News, not ""on Fake News ABC,"" after President Biden dropped out of the 2024 race. 
""My debate with Crooked Joe Biden, the Worst President in the history of the United States, was slated to be broadcast on Fake News ABC, the home of George Slopadopolus, sometime in September.

Trump's statement comes after Biden officially dropped out of the 2024 presidential race following weeks of mounting pressure from Democratic allies that he should bow out and pass the mantle to someone better suited to defeat Trump come November. The calls for him to drop out stem from concerns over his mental fitness and 81 years of age, which came under heightened scrutiny after his disastrous debate performance last month. 
""It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,"" Biden said in his letter posted to X Sunday afternoon.

CNN_1,"Democratic consensus solidifies around Harris, should Biden step aside",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/politics/democratic-consensus-harris-should-biden-step-aside/index.html,2024-07-21 08:42:00,politics,"
            No one quite knows what the process of picking a new nominee would be if Joe Biden did step aside – but many Democrats say that any process is likelier than ever to quickly end with Vice President Kamala Harris as the nominee.


            The informal conversations about how a fight to replace Biden at the top of the ticket would play out have been raging for weeks behind the scenes. But uncertainty about the process has been so unclear it’s given multiple Democrats – even those with serious concerns about Biden – pause about coming out against the president’s candidacy, given that what comes next could be even messier.
    

            “F**k it, I’m coconut pilled. I just want this to stop,” said one well-known Democratic operative, referring to the online meme that has taken off from an old video of the vice president telling a story of her mother saying, “You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?”
    

            It’s not that everyone has suddenly coalesced – but exhaustion is gelling into consensus.


            Internal polls that show Harris would at least be more helpful to boosting Democratic enthusiasm and aiding down ballot races are getting passed around. Arguments that she would be fastest to put together a campaign are landing harder. Daydreams of her making a more active and vigorous case against Donald Trump are taking root.
    

            Many are deliberately holding off talking about hypotheticals as Biden aides say he plans to get back on the campaign trail next week once he recovers from Covid-19. But if that suddenly changes, two dozen leading Democratic politicians and operatives told CNN, they can’t realistically see this ending any other way.
    

            Some are pushing for a fast and closed process, where delegates would bless the swap as part of their planned pre-convention virtual nomination plan.
    

            Some reject the idea of a coronation, either because they prefer others or don’t like the way that would look. But – though there are musings about quickly creating a series of blitz primaries or town halls – no one can agree how that would work with just over 100 days until the election and much less than that before Democrats are scheduled to gather in Chicago. Still, it’s an idea some Harris backers support, doubting that anyone serious would challenge her, as much chest puffing as there is behind the scenes.
    

            Multiple Democratic members of Congress who have called for Biden to go declined on Friday when asked by CNN if they were ready to say they want Harris to be the nominee.
    

            If nothing else, people connected with several of the other possible most serious options and others acknowledge, they would likely feel boxed in by both party loyalty and their own future ambitions. Pressure will be high to unify after the last month of infighting, and anyone who takes her on would be risking torpedoing their reputation with the base in a potential 2028 open primary if she were seen as weakened by that and went on to lose.
    

            Some Democrats believe, even with the threat of early ballot deadlines, it could be settled on the floor of the convention in late August. If this stretches out that long, though, multiple Democrats predicted that the hunger for resolution will only intensify.
    

            That’s become ever more likely, those politicians and operatives say, both by how much closer they are to Election Day and by how impressed they’ve been by how the vice president has handled these weeks of Democratic crisis. They argue the vice president has not been caught scheming, even in private conversations, and instead has showcased being fiery and loyal to Biden at a series of campaign stops, which will continue on Saturday at a fundraiser she’s headlining in Provincetown, Massachusetts.
    

            “I do believe it has to be the vice president. She’s campaigning vigorously under the mantle and she’s the natural successor. It’s going to be important in the scenario that the president isn’t the nominee that we rally around her immediately,” said one Democratic House member who asked not to be named so as not to be seen undercutting the president.
    

            Few can conceive of Biden stepping aside and not tapping his running mate to take over. To do otherwise would be a devastating insult to her of the sort that pained Biden himself so much when Barack Obama turned to Hillary Clinton over him ahead of the 2016 election. He’d also be undercutting his own judgment in picking her four years ago as ready for the job, which he reiterated at his news conference last week.
    

            And it would mean passing over a Black vice president after Black voters and Black leaders— including South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, who has said repeatedly he wants Harris if not Biden — not only sustained him to victory in 2020 but are some of the ones standing most strongly with him through this now.
    

            That kind of support would likely only lead to more, which would be convincing to delegates and voters alike — and make taking her on, even with her history of a failed 2020 campaign and rocky start in the vice presidency, harder and harder.
    

            Eleni Kounalakis, the lieutenant governor of California and a Democratic convention delegate who is part of its rules and bylaws committee – as well as an old friend of Harris – said that it’s important to remember, if the president were to step down, that he won Democratic primaries while talking about “Biden-Harris” accomplishments.
    

            “When people voted for him as the nominee they were voting for this ticket, so it just has to be concluded that the best way to validate the vote of the primary voters is to support the vice president as our nominee,” she said. “There’s so much respect for President Biden that if he asked delegates to support her, even with a public chaotic media swirl, I believe most delegates would honor his wishes as the person who was chosen through the primary process and as our president.”
    

            Thinking like that resonates down-ballot as well.
    

            “I think Democratic frontliners know better than anybody else the power of stability. When there is chaos, they’re the ones who suffer the consequences,” an aide to one Democrat in a frontline district told CNN. “Frontliners are like the stock market.”
    

            Democratic politicians and senior aides across national politics fear that unleashing an open process at the convention would be a mess, prolonging the party’s drama and cratering support from the powerful Congressional Black Caucus, a force for mobilizing grassroots support and driving up enthusiasm in November.
    

            Even some Democratic members up for reelection in swing districts also see little upside in the party engaging in a weekslong sojourn to battle test a new face of the party and that assumes that anyone would even want to go up against Harris, risking their own political future if they were to be unsuccessful now.
    

            “The internal fight is killing us. There is no world in which you can push Kamala to the side,” one Democratic member told CNN on the condition of anonymity to discuss the difficult political moment Democrats find themselves in.
    

            People who have long disliked Harris haven’t suddenly changed their minds. Amnesia hasn’t suddenly set in about her past weaknesses or problems. That’s been part of the calculations Biden is making himself as he deliberates what to do.
    

            Texas Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, who is running for reelection in a tough race, told CNN he was surprised by how quickly the conversation had moved from people saying just a few months ago that Harris would be a drag on the ticket and Biden might consider replacing her.
    

            “I just don’t understand how we go from that to the idea that she should be leading the ticket,” Gonzalez said. “I have nothing against her, but the facts are just the facts. Not everything changed, right? How did we go from that to this? I mean, nowhere else in the world but this town, right?”
    

            Republican operatives tell CNN they are salivating – not just at going back through the old attacks and the videos of her word-salad answers but asking her over and over about what she knew and when she knew it about Biden’s health and effects of aging. They’ll push for Biden to resign, to create more chaos and take her off the trail more.
    

            They’ll also question not just the legitimacy of her coming through whatever rushed process is chosen, but of whether she can legally be replaced on the ballot. House Speaker Mike Johnson’s comment in an interview this week that “there’s some preliminary research being done” is making the rounds, with real concerns that ballot access that could be affected if Democrats move ahead with a completely new candidate that comes out of a brokered convention.
    

            And already in 2020 when Biden put Harris on the ticket, some went beyond just deliberately mispronouncing her first name, but threatening lawsuits about whether she is constitutionally eligible to serve, hooking the flawed argument on that neither of her parents were born in America.
    

            They’re not the only ones.
    

            “If you think that’s going to be an easy transition, I’m here to tell you that a huge amount of the donor class, a huge amount of the elites, a huge amount of these folks in these rooms that I see that are pushing for Joe Biden to not be the nominee also are not interested in seeing the vice president be the nominee,” New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on an Instagram live chat on Thursday evening.
    

            Some progressives have said behind the scenes, meanwhile, that they trust Biden to be more aligned with their agenda than they do Harris – and that is part of why so many have stuck with him.
    

            To others, the political conversation is lagging behind the way this is landing to many outside Washington and the people who obsess over internal polls and donor data.
    

            “To some degree she’s auditioning for the presidency right now,” said Ashley Etienne, her former communications director and a longtime Hill aide still in touch with many current members. “She’s well positioned to shore up confidence about Joe Biden while assuring people that she’s ready. She needs to do that in more profound ways. The campaign needs to create opportunities for her to do that.”
    

            To Rep. Jared Golden, a Maine Democrat who has said he doesn’t think he could vote for the president, thinking of a move toward Harris is just logical.
    

            “I think that many Americans are thinking that there’s a very high likelihood that if the Biden-Harris ticket wins, that Kamala will finish that second term, Golden said. “So, it might beg the question: Why not just settle that matter in this election?”

CNN_2,Trump has long been criticized for his treatment of women. Some of his closest allies seek to present a different vision,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/politics/trump-treatment-women/index.html,2024-07-21 08:17:00,politics,"
            When Sarah Huckabee Sanders faced what she described as “relentless attacks from the left,” it was former President Donald Trump who comforted her, she said.
    

            Trump attorney Alina Habba described the Republican nominee as her “friend.”
    

            And Kai Trump, his oldest grandchild, made a surprise appearance to share “the side of my grandpa that people don’t often see.”
    

            A common theme rang through speeches from women at this year’s Republican National Convention: Despite how Trump’s public treatment of women may seem to some, he is an advocate for them behind closed doors.
    

            In speech after speech in Milwaukee this week, women spoke of quiet moments when they said Trump comforted them in the wake of Democratic attacks or media criticism, advocated for them professionally or showed compassion or familial care. They described him as a friend and a loving father and grandfather in the moments people don’t see.
    

            Trump has long been known for the brash, even vulgar way he sometimes speaks about women. He has also been dogged by allegations about sexual misconduct and extramarital affairs. Accusations of sexism plagued his 2016 presidential campaign, a race he won despite the October release of a video in which he bragged about being able to grab women by their genitals because he’s a celebrity.
    

            In 2023, a civil court found Trump liable of sexually abusing writer E. Jean Carroll in the 1990s. The former president was later ordered to pay millions of dollars in damages for his defamatory statements disparaging Carroll and denying her rape allegations.
    

            Speeches from women, including his family members and people who have worked for him, fit into a broader effort at the convention to soften his public image.
    

            “I was insulted as a guest at the White House Correspondents Dinner, my family was denied service and kicked out of a restaurant, and a parent at my 3-year-old son’s preschool spit on my car,” Sanders, who served as one of Trump’s White House press secretaries, said during her Tuesday night address. “And in those moments, it was President Trump who defended me.”
    

            Sanders, now the governor of Arkansas, said at one point the former president pulled her aside and told her, “Sarah, you’re smart, you’re beautiful, you’re tough, and they attack you because you’re good at your job.”
    

            Habba, one of Trump’s lawyers, said she wanted to take the audience “behind the headlines” to reveal “his character, his kindness” and his commitment to the country.
    

            “President Trump championed my journey, empowering me to be who I became today,” Habba said.
    

            Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s 2016 campaign manager and White House senior counselor, praised the former president for elevating women to key roles in his campaign and administration.
    

            “He saw something in me and the other working moms that perhaps we did not see in ourselves,” Conway said.
    

            Family members, from his granddaughter – who said the former president bragged to friends when she made the honor roll – to his son’s partners shared their personal experiences with him.
    

            “I know what you hear out there about Donald Trump,” Lara Trump, the former president’s daughter-in-law and the co-chair of the Republican National Committee, said in her speech. “But when I look at Donald Trump, I see a wonderful father, father-in-law and, of course, grandfather to my two young children, Luke and Carolina.”
    

            The effort to reframe Trump’s treatment of women was part of a larger push to soften the former president’s image in the wake of the assassination attempt last weekend.
    

            “The media’s negative portrayal of President Trump and his treatment of women is entirely false,” Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign’s national press secretary, said in a statement. “President Trump is loved by millions of women across the country, and those who know him personally, myself included, will tell you he’s supportive, generous, and kind.”
    

            Leavitt added that during Trump’s first term he supported policies such as expanding access to paid family leave and child care and that he would do so again.
    

            Broadening the former president’s appeal to women will be key in November. Biden’s success in swing states in 2020 is attributable in part to his stronger support among women turned off by Trump’s brashness. In 2020, Biden won 57% of women, compared with 42% who backed Trump, according to CNN exit polls.
    

            But it’s not clear whether praise of the former president’s private behavior will impact how people perceive years of his public behavior. Trump had faced allegations of sexism since he sought the Republican nomination in 2016.
    

            During a 2015 GOP primary debate, moderator Megyn Kelly asked then-candidate Trump about his history of referring to women he disagreed with as “fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.” He later blasted Kelly and said she had “blood coming out of her wherever.”
    

            During that first campaign, he insinuated that both Carly Fiorina, one of his Republican opponents, and the wife of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, another 2016 rival, were unattractive.

Trump’s epic week began with cheating death


            And in the final weeks of that election, old Access Hollywood footage of him bragging about being able to kiss women and grab them by their genitals prompted mass condemnation from members of his own party.
    

            Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, his 2016 Democratic opponent, argued that Trump’s past treatment of women made him unfit to be president.
    

            “When I think about what we now know about Donald Trump and what he has been doing for 30 years, he sure had spent a lot of time demeaning, degrading, insulting and assaulting women,” Clinton said at a Florida rally days before the election.
    

            Clinton’s loss, and fears over what a Trump presidency would entail, prompted global Women’s March protests.
    

            Since then, other parts of his background have been scrutinized. Earlier this year, Trump was found guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up an alleged extramarital affair with a porn star. And then there is Carroll’s allegation that Trump sexually abused her in a luxury department store dressing room in the spring of 1996. Trump faced no jail time in the civil trial, but he was ordered to pay $88 million total for defamation.
    

            Trump has denied the affair at the center of the hush money case and denied assaulting Carroll.
    

            The former president has also denied about a dozen other sexual misconduct allegations, including groping and sexual harassment, that took place before he took office. In 2017, Trump called the claims “fake news.”
    

            Sanders, the White House press secretary at the time, was asked whether the White House’s official position was that all the women were lying.
    

            “Yeah, we have been clear on that from the beginning, and the president has spoken on it,” she said at an October 2017 press briefing.
    

            For much of the 2024 campaign, Democrats have focused their criticisms of Trump on his policies, specifically his appointment of Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn federal abortion protections. But as President Joe Biden has faced increased pressure within his own party to step aside, he has started to broaden his attacks. During a rally in Detroit earlier this month, Biden referenced both the hush money case and the civil case involving Carroll.
    

            “Mr. Trump raped her,” Biden said, referencing what the judge in the Carroll case wrote.
    

            In Milwaukee, however, Trump’s criminal cases were framed as further evidence of persecution he’s suffered for his supporters.
    

            “Every attack on President Trump only strengthens our movement,” said Habba, who represented Trump in the Carroll defamation suit. “Sham indictments and baseless allegations will not deter us, because the only crime President Trump has committed is loving America.”

CNN_3,1 dead after plane used for skydiving crashes in New York,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/us/niagara-county-ny-skydiving-plane-crash/index.html,2024-07-21 08:25:00,us,"
            Officials in New York launched an investigation Saturday after a person died in a small plane crash in Niagara County.
    

            The single-engine Cessna 208B – a plane that was used for skydiving – crashed near Lake Road near Youngstown, New York, shortly before 1 p.m., according to a statement from the Federal Aviation Administration
    

            The airplane from the Skydive the Falls skydiving center had released all divers and was heading back to land when it crashed, according to a news release from the Niagara County Sheriff’s Office on Saturday.
    

            The pilot, who was the only person on board, was conducting parachute operations prior to the crash, Tammy L. Jones, a spokesperson for the FAA, told CNN Saturday.
    

            It is unclear how many divers were on board before the crash, Niagara County Sheriff Michael Filicetti said at a news conference Saturday.

            A brush fire also reportedly began around the crash site, according to the release. The initial responding crew had to put out “a significant fire at that point,” Filicetti said.
    

            The sheriff called the plane crash “an unfortunate incident” and added that local and federal law enforcement partners are working to determine what led to the crash.
    

            “Well, I think this is like any other emergency-type incident. … You get here, you want to try to preserve life. Unfortunately, in this case, we couldn’t do that,” Filicetti said.
    

            A National Transportation Safety Board investigator is expected to be traveling to the crash site on Saturday, NTSB spokesperson Peter Knudson told CNN.
    

            The investigator will document the airplane wreckage, which will then be moved to a secure facility for further evaluation, Knudson said. The investigation will involve three primary areas: the pilot, the aircraft and the operating environment.
    

            The pilot’s name was not released pending family notification, according to the Niagara County Sheriff’s Office’s statement.
    

            CNN has reached out to the sheriff’s office for comment.

CNN_4,They used to work for China’s biggest companies. Now they’re doing manual labor,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/economy/china-economy-employment-blue-collar-work-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-21 08:16:00,us,"
    Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.


            Leon Li used to play a discreet but indispensable part at one of China’s biggest tech giants.
    

            As an administrative officer, she worked around the clock to schedule meetings, prepare documents and provide her bosses with whatever support they needed.
    

            But in February, she quit the company, forgoing a stable career and comfortable salary forsomething a little less stressful — cleaning homes.
    

            “Every morning when the alarm rang, all I could see was my dull future,” she told CNN, reflecting on her office job.
    

            Li, 27, is part of a growing base of Chinese workers swapping high-pressure office jobs for flexible blue-collar work.
    

            Many of them used to work for some of the biggest companies in the country.
    

            But these firms are slowly losing their appeal as China’s economy faces headwinds including a property crisis, declining foreign investment and slumping consumption.
    

            China’s economy grew 4.7% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2024, missing economists’ expectations and marking the weakest growth since the first quarter of last year, according to the latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released on Monday.
    

            Gruelingly long hours and shrinking resources have prompted employees like Li to rethink whether it’s worth trading their time and health for higher pay.
    

            “I like cleaning up. As living standards improve (across the country), the demand forhousekeeping services is also surging with an ever-expanding market,” she said.
    

            But more importantly, she feels happier.
    

            “The change it brings is that my head no longer feels dizzy. I feel less mental pressure. And I am full of energy every day,” she said.
    

            Li is not the only white-collar worker who has found a better work-life balance by trading an office job for manual labor.
    

            Alice Wang, 30, who is using an alias for privacy reasons, used to work for one of China’s leading live-streaming e-commerce platforms, earning 700,000 yuan ($96,310) per year.
    

            But she resigned in April, moving from Hangzhou, a picturesque tech hub, to the more laidback city of Chengdu, where rent is cheaper, to take up pet grooming.
    

            China’s notorious “996” work culture – the practice of working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week that is common among the country’s tech companies, startups and other private businesses – has been a push factor for many employees who call it quits.
    

            Wang recalled feeling physically frail and “very lifeless and stagnant” at her old job, when she used to dedicate most of her time to work.
    

            But she feels different now.
    

            “The feeling of growth is relatively good,” she said, adding that she’s undertaking grooming training and has ambitions to one day open her own store. “That’s the longer-term plan,” she said.
    

            The trend to move from professional to manual jobs comes amid surging demand for blue-collar workers, according to Chinese recruitment platform Zhaopin.
    

            In its latest survey released in June, the platform found that demand for blue-collarjobs – such as food delivery workers, truck drivers, waiters and technicians – had surged 3.8 times in the first quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2019.
    

            Demand for delivery workers grew the fastest, by 800%, after three years of Covid-related lockdowns that gave rise to a takeout food culture.
    

            And blue-collar workers’ pay has also gone up, attracting more people to jobs they might have previously avoided.
    

            The explosion of online shopping has seen the average monthly salary for a delivery worker surge 45.3% since 2019, from 5,581 yuan ($768) to 8,109 yuan ($1,116), according to the survey.
    

            For some college graduates though, taking a manual job was not their first choice.
    

            As the economy slows, positions for fresh grads have become harder to come by in an increasingly competitive corporate job market.
    

            The survey also found the number of people under the age of 25 who applied for blue-collar jobs in the first quarter of this year surged 165% compared with the same period in 2019.
    

            China’s unemployment rate for 16-to-24-year-olds reached a staggering 21.3% in June 2023, according to the NBS, which subsequently suspended the release of the figure for months while it adjusted its methodology.
    

            The authorities brought back the data in January this year – excluding from the figure some 62 million students, whose main task, they said, should be to study rather than look for jobs.
    

            In recent months, the jobless rate for prospective workers aged 16 to 24 years old has hovered between 14.2% and 15.3%, according to the NBS.
    

            Economists Larry Hu and Zhang Yuxiao, from Macquarie, wrote in a research report last year that China’s services sector, private companies and small and medium-sized enterprises used to be the major sources of employment for young workers. However, they have been hit hard by sluggish consumer demand.
    

            David Goodman, director of the University of Sydney’s China Studies Centre, said there hadbeen a mismatch between the kind of graduates that universities churn out and what the market really needs.
    

            He said China’s economy was shifting towards advanced technology, green tech and service industries, while university education still largely focuses on manufacturing and public service, areas that are outdated or saturated.
    

            “(There is) a key problem if the higher education system has not adjusted itself or beenadjusted to meet rapid changes in the structure of the economy,” he explained.
    

            But some wonder if blue-collar work is truly the stress-free refuge people like Li and Wang imagine it to be.
    

            A recent video circulated widely on Chinese social media demonstrated how things could go wrong. The clip showed a barista in Shanghai losing his temper over a customer who threatened to make a complaint against him.
    

            In a fit of rage, he threw coffee powder at her, instantly becoming the center of a cafe drama that sparked an online debate about the challenges workers in the service industry face.
    

            Complaints or bad online reviews can prove disastrous for shops and restaurants in China, as many consumers religiously follow recommendations on popular social media platforms such as Xiaohongshu and Douyin, China’s version of TikTok.
    

            The threat of a bad review puts pressure on low-paid workers to avoid doinganything that may draw negative attention to the company.

            Some internet users denounced the barista’s poor manner. But many more sympathized with him.
    

            “The pay is low to begin with, let alone having to face complaint. May as well just quit (when you are) squeezed both by the company and customers,” one online commenter wrote.
    

            But for Li, who works just six hours a day cleaning houses on a freelance basis, her experience has been positive.
    

            She enjoys bonding with her clients and says each cleaning session makes her feel like more than just a business transaction.
    

            “Customers will carefully pour water for us to drink. When it is time to eat, they will order takeout for us, bring us food, and constantly remind us to drink water and rest,” she said.
    

            So far, she said she has no regrets about quitting her office job.
    

            “After a tiring day, I can go home and eat and do what I like without any extra mental pressure,” she said.

CNN_5,"At least 3 killed and 87 injured, Houthis say, as Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen day after Tel Aviv drone attack",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/middleeast/yemen-israel-strikes-hodeidah-intl/index.html,2024-07-21 11:23:00,world,"
            At least three people were killed and scores more injured in Israeli airstrikes on a Yemeni port, Houthi rebels have said, a day after the Iran-backed group claimed a deadly attack on the Israeli city of Tel Aviv.
    

            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its fighter jets struck “military targets of the Houthi terrorist regime” in the area of Yemen’s Hodeidah Port on Saturday, in what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said was a direct response to the death of a 50-year-old Israeli in a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv on Friday.
    

            This is the first time Israel has struck Yemen, according to Israeli officials.
    

            The Houthi-run Al Masirah TV said the strikes targeted oil facilities in the port on Yemen’s west coast, killing at least three people and injuring 87, most of them with “severe burns.”
    

Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam said the strikes had also hit civilian targets and a power station. He slammed what he said was “brutal Israeli aggression” aimed at increasing the “suffering of the people of Yemen” and pressuring the group to stop its support of Gaza.
    

            Houthi army spokesperson Yehya Saree vowed to respond to the strike, saying the Houthis would not hesitate to strike Israel’s “vital targets” and warning that Tel Aviv – a major city home to scores of diplomatic missions – was still not safe.
    

            “We have prepared for a long war with this enemy until the aggression stops and the blockade on the Palestinian people is lifted,” Saree said.
    

            Netanyahu said in a statement on Saturday that Hodeidah was “not an innocent port.”
    

            “It was used for military purposes, it was used as an entry point for deadly weapons supplied to the Houthis by Iran,” Netanyahu said, adding that Hodeidah had also been used to attack international shipping in the Red Sea.
    

            Netanyahu also said the operation, which hit targets 1,800 km (1,118 miles) from Israel’s borders, shows the enemy Israel is serious about responding to threats.
    

            “It makes it clear to our enemies that there is no place that the long arm of the state of Israel will not reach,” Netanyahu said.
    

            United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a UN statement he was “deeply concerned” by reports of the strikes.
    

            “The Secretary-General calls on all concerned to avoid attacks that could harm civilians and damage civilian infrastructure,” the statement read.
    

            IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said the strikes were also in response to the roughly 200 projectiles the rebel group has fired towards Israel since October, when Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza began.

Israel investigates security failures around deadly Tel Aviv drone strike


            Since the start of the war, the Yemeni rebels have regularly targeted the country with drones and missiles, most of which have been intercepted by Israel’s defenses or those of its allies. However, the Houthis have claimed their drone attack in Tel Aviv Friday – which also injured 10 people – was performed by a new drone capable of “bypassing the enemy’s interception systems.”
    

            The Houthis have also regularly attacked US targets and commercial shipping in the Red Sea.
    

            Both the UK and the US have responded to the attacks on shipping by carrying out strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. However, Israel has not taken part in those responses.
    

            An Israeli defense official told CNN that this was a 100% Israeli strike. The official said Israel had previously let the US and UK take the lead on responding to Houthi attacks but decided to respond itself this time because of the death of the Israeli citizen in Tel Aviv.
    

            According to the official, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant informed US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin before the strike was carried out.
    

            The defense official added that Israel was able to strike so quickly because it had been preparing for this scenario for months.
    

            A White House official said US President Joe Biden had been briefed on “developments” in the Middle East. A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said the US had not coordinated with Israel on the airstrikes, but added that the US fully recognizes “Israel’s right to self-defense.”
    

            The Houthi movement, also known as Ansar Allah – Arabic for ‘Supporters of God’ – is a Shi’ite Islamist political and military organization backed by Iran, that emerged in the 1990s.
    

            Similar to chants used by Lebanon-based Iranian proxy Hezbollah, the Houthis’ official slogan reads, “God is the Greatest. Death to America. Death to Israel. Curse the Jews. Victory to Islam.”

            In 2014, Houthi forces allied with former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh took control of Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, from the UN-recognized Yemeni government, sparking a civil war that has afflicted the country ever since.
    

            Since March 2015, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have led a coalition in Yemen against Houthi forces.
    

            More recently, the group has come to be seen in parts of the largely Sunni Muslim world and beyond as champions of the Palestinian cause, defending the people of Gaza against Israel.
    

            Since October 7, Houthi rebels have carried out numerous missile and drone attacks on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, asserting that these vessels are linked to Israel and its allies, which has escalated tensions throughout the Middle East.
    

            In recent weeks Hezbollah has been ramping up cross-border attacks with Israel after months of low-intensity fighting, prompting the Israeli military to warn that it is prepared to launch a large-scale attack on its northern border.
    

            Following the Hodeidah strike, Israel’s Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir congratulated Netanyahu on the operation and said Israel should “adopt the same policy against Hezbollah in Lebanon.”
    

            Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Defense Minister Gallant echoed Ben Gvir’s sentiment. Smotrich said Israel must continue to attack “with all its might even in distant places,” while Gallant said “the blood of Israeli citizens has a price,” and that anywhere Israelis are attacked the “result will be identical.”

            “The fire that is currently burning in Hodeidah, is seen across the Middle East and the significance is clear,” Gallant said.
    

            Hezbollah in Lebanon condemned the attack on Yemen and said “we stand firmly with the Yemeni people in defending themselves, their sovereignty, and their heroic and historic stance alongside Palestine.”
    

            Hamas also condemned the attack, calling it a “dangerous escalation.”
    

            Meanwhile, Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Israel Katz called on the international community to “maximize sanctions on Iran.”
    

            “Iran supports, trains, and finances the Houthi terror organization as part of its regional network of terror organizations aimed at attacking Israel,” he said.
    

            “Iran is the head of the snake – it must be stopped now,” Katz added.
    

            Iran condemned the Israeli strike on Hodeidah. Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Nasser Kanaani warned of the risk of war in the region, saying Israel’s actions in Gaza were the “root” of the escalating tensions.
    

            “The oppressed but powerful people of Yemen are paying the price for their honorable support of the innocent citizens, women and children of Gaza,” Kanaani said.

CNN_6,Secret Service says it denied Trump additional resources even as his team complained,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/secret-service-trump-security-requests/index.html,2024-07-21 12:18:00,politics,"
            Former President Donald Trump’s security detail had complained they were not being given enough resources and personnel by the Secret Service over the past two years, and the agency acknowledged Saturday it denied some requests.
    

            A spokesperson for the Secret Service said in a statement Saturday that the agency has not provided certain resources in the past but has instead provided other security measures including from local partners.
    

            The news comes amid widespread concerns about how a sniper was able to obtain rooftop access roughly 150 meters from Trump’s position at an outdoor rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last week.
    

The Washington Post and The New York Times reported earlier Saturday that the Secret Service denied previous request from Trump’s security team over the past two years.

            Some close to the former president felt the decisions, which they believed were personal to Trump, came from the top ranks of the agency.
    

            While Trump holds close relationships with members of his Secret Service detail, the relationship between those agents and the upper ranks of the agency has been tense for some time, according to multiple sources familiar with the dynamic.
    

            In response to questions from CNN over whether the Secret Service had denied additional security requests, a spokesperson told CNN the agency makes “modifications” when certain resources are not provided to protectees.
    

            “In some instances where specific Secret Service specialized units or resources were not provided, the agency made modifications to ensure the security of the protectee,” Anthony Guglielmi, chief of communications for the Secret Service, wrote in a statement. “This may include utilizing state or local partners to provide specialized functions or otherwise identifying alternatives to reduce public exposure of a protectee.”
    

            Guglielmi said in a statement the day after the shooting that claims that Trump was denied additional security requests specifically for the rally in Pennsylvania were untrue.
    

            “This is absolutely false. In fact, we added protective resources & technology & capabilities as part of the increased campaign travel tempo,” Guglielmi wrote on X.
    

            Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle is facing a flurry of questions about how a gunman was able to get a clear line of sight to Trump at the rally site, and there have been calls for her resignation from members of Congress, including House Speaker Mike Johnson.
    

            Cheatle will likely face questions over these issues during her testimony this week before several committees in Congress over the security failures that led to the assassination attempt.

CNN_7,More flight cancellations are expected as airlines gradually recover from global tech outage,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/us/tech-outage-flight-cancellations-united-delta-airlines/index.html,2024-07-21 13:37:00,us,"
            Additional flight cancellations are expected through this weekend as airlines gradually recover from a global tech outage that has left thousands of passengers stranded at airports.
    

            More than 5,400 flights into, out of, or within the US were canceled Friday and Saturday and more than 21,300 flights were delayed, according to FlightAware.com. A third day of chaos at airports could be in store with more than 600 flights already canceled Sunday morning.
    

            The issue extended beyond airports, with businesses, government agencies, health and emergency services, banks, schools and universities around the world grinding to a halt or seeing services disrupted due to a flawed software update for Microsoft Windows operating systems issued by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, experts told CNN.
    

            The outage “has basically turned computers into bricks around the world,” Glenn Gerstell, former general counsel of the US National Security Agency, told CNN Saturday.
    

            “This is probably going to be the biggest single computer incident in terms of overall effect,” Gerstell said. “Maybe not the number of computers, but the impact on people’s lives.”
    

            CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz apologized to customers and said a fix has been deployed, but experts say getting systems back in order will be a lengthy process.
    

            The outage affected an estimated 8.5 million Windows devices, less than 1% of all Windows machines, according to a Saturday blog post from Microsoft. “While the percentage was small, the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services,” Microsoft said.
    

            Major airlines have said services are being restored, but that there could be more delays and disruptions.
    

            A majority of United Airlines systems have recovered from Friday’s outage, the airline said in a statement. More than 400 United flights were canceled Saturday, and over 200 flights were canceled Sunday, according to FlightAware.com.
    

            “While most of our systems have recovered from the worldwide third-party software outage, we may continue to experience some disruption to our operation, including flight delays and cancellations,” United said.

A global tech outage brought many computer systems and businesses to a screeching halt. Here’s what happened


            Delta Air Lines is “continuing its operational recovery” after the outage prompted the airline to pause flying on Friday, according to a Saturday morning update. Still, over 1,000 Delta flights were canceled Saturday and more than 200 were canceled Sunday.
    

            “Additional cancelations are expected as some of Delta’s technology continues to recover from Friday morning’s vendor-caused issue,” the update said.
    

            Also impacted was American Airlines, which said in a statement  Friday that “we were able to safely reestablish our operation” and that it “issued a travel waiver for our customers impacted by the vendor technology issue earlier this morning.” Allegiant Air said in a statement Saturday that, while “normal operations have resumed” after the outage, they’re processing a backlog of customer messages and troubleshooting their programs and platforms.
    

            Even with the flawed computer update rolled back, it’s not a quick fix for airlines, which have computers at thousands of gates that’ll need to be individually manually rebooted, David Kennedy, cofounder of cybersecurity company Binary Defense, told CNN Saturday.
    

            “It’s not just as simple as rebooting. There’s a lot more steps and complexities in this that are involved,” Kennedy said. “There’s just not enough people at those airports, at those locations to go and do it.”
    

            The US Department of Transportation on Friday said it determined that the flight delays and cancellations resulting from the system outage were “controllable,” meaning they’re “attributable to the airline.” In such cases, the airlines “must adhere to their customer service commitments.”
    

            Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in a social media post Saturday said he received reports of some airlines only offering flight credits to passengers for canceled flights.
    

            “Let me be clear — you are entitled to get your money back promptly if your flight is cancelled and you don’t take a rebooking,” Buttigieg said.
    

            Frustrated passengers lined up at airports backed up with flight cancellations and delays, some missing life events like weddings, funerals and birthdays.
    

            At Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, long lines of passengers waited for assistance Saturday, with many flights still canceled or delayed.
    

            Delta passenger Catalina Villareal described the scene: “Mayhem. Chaos. Frustration. Hunger.”
    

            Villareal expressed frustration with what she says is a lack of information from airlines.
    

            “I have had three cancellations. I’ve checked in three times for all of the flights. And now I have two bags some place … in the airport, and nobody knows how long they’ll take to come in,” Villareal said. “So we’ve been told just to come tomorrow or Monday.”
    

            Thousands of people face the same uncertainty as they cram together in airports across the country, waiting for answers.
    

            “I was supposed to be in California for my mom’s wedding,” Richard Whitfield of Pasco County, Florida, told CNN Saturday. Whitfield and his partner, Jonathan Shade, left Tampa on Thursday and missed their connecting flight in Atlanta due to poor weather conditions, delaying their landing and forcing the plane to refuel in Tallahassee.
    

            After their rescheduled flight on Friday was delayed many times, the couple decided to cancel the trip and just head home. But with no available flights back to Tampa, Friday night, they spent their second night in an airport hotel. They were unable to get a voucher from Delta for either of their stays.
    

            “(Richard has) been on hold for 24 hours,” Shade told CNN. “When he eventually got his number in line, it was 2,001.”
    

            Two hours later, Richard’s place in Delta Air Lines’ virtual customer service queue was 2,300 in line, Shade said.
    

            Whitfield tells CNN the whole ordeal has had an impact on him.

            “For me, it’s been the domino effect that it has on humanity and everything that we need to survive: food, sleep, or water, housing,” he said.
    

            After spending 48 hours in Atlanta, they found a Saturday evening flight back to Tampa they say they can only hope is not delayed or canceled. For now, there is nothing the couple can do but wait and “get a good stiff drink,” Shade and Whitfield said.
    

            Another traveler at Boston Logan International Airport was trying to get to Fort Lauderdale for her father’s 96th Birthday.
    

            “My flight this morning was canceled. I was supposed to fly to Ft. Lauderdale, so they rebooked to West Palm Beach and I got here to the airport, it was canceled. They didn’t tell me – I had no notification, nothing,” Charlotte Yeh told CNN affiliate WFXT on Saturday.
    

            Some passengers at the Boston airport were upset that their summer trips and plans were foiled.
    

            “We’ve had this trip booked to Las Vegas for some time now,” Marc Forbes told WFXT. “Straight up cancellation with the next possible flight being Monday at 6 p.m. and we were only going to be in Las Vegas for four nights so that trip is going to have to be rebooked.”
    

            Carol Edwards said her flights on Friday and Saturday were both canceled and the next available flight isn’t until Monday.
    

            “We have a lot of plans you know visit family, eat, see friends, party you know everything so there’s nothing we can do,” she told WFXT.

CNN_8,Biden outraises and outspends Trump in June as questions loom about the president’s political future,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/biden-trump-campaign-finance-reports-june/index.html,2024-07-21 14:21:00,politics,"
            President Joe Biden outraised – and dramatically outspent – the campaign of Republican rival Donald Trump last month, new campaign reports filed Saturday show, raising questions about how long the president’s political team can operate at full throttle if donations dry up.
    

            Some of the Democratic Party’s big-dollar donors have raised alarms about Biden’s poor performance at last month’s presidential debate, and he faces growing calls from elected officials to abandon his bid for a second White House term.
    

            Biden’s campaign stepped up its spending in June, the new filings with the Federal Election Commission show, plowing through more than $59 million as it advertised heavily. His principal campaign committee entered July with nearly $96 million remaining in its bank account – a substantial sum but not enough to sustain June’s blistering spending pace for long without fresh cash infusions.
    

            By contrast, Trump’s campaign spent just shy of $10 million, leaving $128 million in its war chest.
    

            The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, raised nearly $67 million in June – one of its strongest fundraising months in recent years, far surpassing the $39.2 million collected by the Democratic National Committee last month – as Trump’s political apparatus built up a cash advantage over Biden and the Democratic Party heading into July and the general election showdown.
    

            Biden’s campaign aides argue that they have capitalized on the fundraising advantage that the president held during the early months of this year to build out a robust ground operation in key battleground states that will help them prevail. And they said the campaign collected $38 million in the four days following Biden’s widely panned debate performance. The reports filed late Saturday, however, include only the final few days of last month after the June 27 faceoff in Atlanta. The full impact of the debate – and other key campaign milestones, including the just-concluded Republican National Convention and the announcement of Ohio Sen. JD Vance as Trump’s running mate – won’t be evident until the campaigns file fundraising and spending details with federal regulators in August.
    

            As CNN has previously reported, some donors – fearing a Republican rout in November should Biden remain atop the ticket – are withholding contributions or putting fundraising events on hold as the president faces pressure from some Democrats to exit the race. One fundraiser that proceeded over the weekend in Cape Cod brought in more $2 million, campaign officials said.
    

            The Saturday event was scheduled weeks before the party’s current turmoil and was headlined by Vice President Kamala Harris, the most likely heir apparent should Biden bow out of the race.
    

            “We are going to win this election,” Harris told Saturday’s crowd, asking them to spread that message to their friends.
    

            Many campaign finance experts say that, should Harris become the nominee, any money remaining campaign’s bank accounts would transfer to her political operation because she already is part of the ticket.
    

            But – in a preview of the likely legal fights that would erupt over a Biden departure – some Republican lawyers disagree, arguing that under some interpretations, Biden and Harris must be formally nominated by their party before any money could be shifted.
    

            “If President Biden is committed to passing the torch to his vice president, and wants to be able to seed her campaign with the current Biden for President campaign war chest, he’ll first have to become his party’s legal nominee,” veteran Republican election lawyer Charlie Spies wrote in a recent op-ed in The Wall Street Journal.
    

            Although Biden outraised his Republican rival last month, filings in recent days underscore how much Trump has seized on his legal troubles as a fundraising tool.
    

            Contributions to Trump’s political operation soared on the day of his conviction in the New York hush money case on May 30 – when three joint fundraising committees reported receiving $19 million in donations above $200, according to a CNN analysis of filings in recent days with the Federal Election Commission.
    

            Trump was convicted by a Manhattan jury on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to an adult film star. He and his allies have sought to characterize the conviction as politically motivated.
    

            May 30 marked the strongest fundraising day of the year for Trump through June 30, the analysis shows.
    

            CNN analyzed itemized contributions – those from donors who gave more than $200 – to determine the daily fundraising haul of Trump’s joint fundraising committees with the Republican National Committee and state party committees. A share of the proceeds from one of those committees, the Trump 47 Committee, also benefits a leadership PAC that has helped underwrite legal expenses for Trump and some of his allies.
    

            That leadership PAC, Save America, reported paying more than $827,000 legal expenses and carried another $1.64 million of legal debt into July, according to its FEC filings Saturday.
    

            Trump’s campaign, meanwhile, has consistently spent far less than Biden’s.
    

            The lion’s share of its expenditures in June went to direct mail expenses, according to the filings. Trump’s team is relying heavily on conservative super PACs for data and field work to help find a path to victory in battleground states – following a recent Federal Election Commission ruling that allows greater coordination between candidates and super PACs on costly door-to-door canvassing work.
    

            Saturday’s filings show that the leading pro-Biden super PAC, known as Future Forward or FF PAC, ended June with nearly $122 million in its coffers. Nearly half the $32.8 million the PAC took in last month came from the group’s nonprofit arm, which does not disclose its donors.
    

            Other large donors in June included LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman ($3 million), Google ex-chief executive Eric Schmidt ($1.6 million), and James Murdoch, the son of Fox News mogul Rupert Murdoch, and his wife Kathryn ($1,00,000 total for the couple).
    

            A super PAC backing Trump’s candidacy, MAGA Inc., meanwhile, entered July with nearly $114 million in available cash.
    

            Two-thirds of the $22.5 million that it raised last month came from just three donors who each wrote checks for $5 million: hotelier Robert Bigelow; Linda McMahon, who ran the Small Business Administration during Trump’s White House tenure and had a speaking slot at his nominating convention; and tobacco giant RAI Services.

CNN_9,"Bangladesh’s top court rolls back some job quotas after deadly protests, local media report",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/asia/bangladesh-supreme-court-rolls-back-job-quotas-intl/index.html,2024-07-21 17:52:00,world,"
            Bangladesh’s Supreme Court on Sunday rolled back some of the controversial quotas on government jobs which sparked violent protests, Reuters reported, citing local media.
    

            Under the quota system, some 30% of sought-after civil service jobs are reserved for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh’s war of independence from Pakistan in 1971 - with many of the country’s contemporary political elite related to that generation.
    

            Since the roles are linked to job security and higher pay, the quota system has angered many in the country, particularly students and young people, as Bangladesh faces high unemployment levels.
    

            Dozens of people have reportedly been killed and hundreds injured in the violence, which saw demonstrators gather on streets and university campuses in the capital Dhaka and other cities.
    

            In 2018, the civil service quota system was scrapped following similar protests but in June the High Court reinstated it, ruling its removal unconstitutional. On July 10, the Supreme Court suspended the quotas for one month while it took up the case.
    

            On Sunday, the country’s top court dismissed the earlier ruling that brought back the quotas, directing that 93% of government jobs will be open to candidates on merit, without quotas, Reuters reported citing local media.
    

            Ahead of the ruling, Bangladesh on Sunday extended a curfew imposed on Friday to try to quell the violence and deployed soldiers to patrol the streets of the capital Dhaka, according to Reuters.
    

            According to local media, the curfew was extended until after the Supreme Court hearing and will continue for an “uncertain time” following a two-hour break for people to gather supplies, Reuters reported.
    

            CNN has tried to reach the prime minister’s office, home affairs ministry, and police, but mobile and internet services appear to remain mostly down across the country after a government-imposed blackout.
    

            As of Saturday, internet monitoring site NetBlocks said activity had remained at around 10% for more than 48 hours since services were cut Thursday.

CNN_10,She felt lost when she became a widow in her 20s. Then she signed up to grief camp,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/grief-camp-experience-camps-mackenzie-galloway-cole/index.html,2024-07-21 17:00:00,world,"
            When Mackenzie Galloway-Cole saw the reminder in her Google calendar, her first reaction was dread:
    

            Three days, blocked out with two words, in all caps: “GRIEF CAMP.”
    

            Taking a few deep breaths, Galloway-Cole tried to calm her nerves.
    

            Of the two words, it wasn’t the “grief” part that made her panic. The prospect of “camp” was way more daunting.
    

            “I was nowhere near as afraid of talking about grief as I was afraid of being in a new space, doing something new, alone, with new people,” Galloway-Cole tells CNN Travel today.
    

            Galloway-Cole, a New Yorker in her late 20s, is a recent widow. Last November, her wife, Megan, passed away from a sudden cardiac event.
    

            “Losing my wife felt like losing my center of gravity,” says Galloway-Cole. “Everything in the world felt upside down and I felt untethered to reality.”
    

            About a month after Megan’s death, one of Galloway-Cole’s close friends sent her details about Experience Camps, a US-based nonprofit that runs summer camps for grieving kids.


            In recent years, Experience Camps has expanded its program to include an annual adults-only grief retreat. When the organization appeared on Galloway-Cole’s radar, Experience Camps was accepting applications for its summer 2024 adult getaway.
    

            Sitting in her parents’ home in Kansas, Galloway-Cole scrolled through the details. The MO, according to Experience Camps, is that bereaved adults gather to “grieve, connect and play” in the beautiful surroundings of a historic summer camp in the Poconos.
    

            On the agenda: traditional camp activities including campfires, arts and crafts and sports –  interspersed with opportunities for grief-based connection and contemplation.
    

            Galloway-Cole wasn’t a camp kid. She spent her childhood and teenage summers taking extra classes at local colleges rather than sitting around a campfire toasting s’mores.
    

            And while camp as a concept sounded fun – at least if Lindsay Lohan in “The Parent Trap” was anything to go by – Galloway-Cole was unsure of the reality of “sleeping in a cabin in bunks with strangers.”
    

            But in the wake of her wife’s death, Galloway-Cole had adopted what she calls a “kitchen sink” attitude to grieving: She’d try pretty much anything in the quest to adjust to her stark new reality.
    

            “At that point, I was also just looking for any sort of way to form connections with other people in the grief space – trying to just create and build a community,” adds Galloway-Cole. “Being a widow in my 20s, I don’t have as many people around me who relate to that grief experience. So, when I found out about the camp, I signed up the day I found out.”
    

            After a phone call with Experience Camps’ program director, Galloway-Cole paid the requisite $425 fee “and then put the dates in my calendar and didn’t think about it too much.”
    

            Then, suddenly – somehow – it was June 2024. Seven months since Galloway-Cole’s wife passed away. Six months since she’d signed up for grief camp.
    

            In that intervening period, Galloway-Cole had waded through the heavy haze of grief to rebuild something of a routine. She’d left the comfort of her parents’ house in Kansas and returned to the New York City apartment she’d once shared with Megan. She’d gone back to her job working in nonprofit communications. She’d reconnected with friends. She’d gone to therapy. She started blogging about her experiences on her Substack, Good Gay Grief.


            Life wasn’t easy, but there was some semblance of “new normal” that Galloway-Cole embraced as much as possible.
    

            Interrupting this routine to embark on a grief-focused summer camp was daunting, to say the least. But Galloway-Cole put on her favorite T-shirt, packed her suitcase, mapped out the route via GPS, and readied herself to drive two and half hours northwest to Equinunk, Pennsylvania.  


            It was the first time she’d gone on a vacation or trip since her wife died.
    

            “So, that was a big leap of bravery – and a big milestone to pack the car on my own,” says Galloway-Cole.
    

            Galloway-Cole and her wife loved a road trip. (“If it was between a flight or a 10-hour drive, we would usually drive,” she says).
    

            But Galloway-Cole was used to having Megan in the car, by her side.
    

            “There were so many times we would take a 10-hour drive, and we wouldn’t even turn on music, because we would just talk the whole time,” she recalls.
    

            As Galloway-Cole got behind the wheel, she was acutely conscious of the empty passenger seat.
    

            “I got in the car knowing, ‘I don’t have my companion anymore. I don’t have my person. I have to find a way to get through this and do it on my own,’” she says. “And what that looked like for me was I put on a playlist that was high energy, trying to just sing along and keep myself motivated.”
    

            Galloway-Cole sang as loud as she could as she navigated the concrete gridlock of New York City and headed toward the rural greenery of upstate New York. As she crossed the Pennsylvania border and got close to Equinunk, the views out the window got vaster, more verdant.
    

        Being a widow in my 20s, I don’t have as many people around me who relate to that grief experience. So, when I found out about the camp, I signed up the day I found out.
    

            Mackenzie Galloway-Cole
        

            Parking up at Camp Equinunk and Blue Ridge, her home for the weekend, Galloway-Cole felt her heart hammering in her chest. The nerves were in full swing. But almost immediately, Galloway-Cole began chatting to another recent arrival.
    

            “She turned out to be another camper who was also there for the weekend, who had previously been involved with Experience Camps before – so she knew what she was doing,” says Galloway-Cole. “I told her it was my first time and we talked a little bit about it – so I wasn’t confused for long, there was someone helpful there right away to say, ‘Here. Come with me. I’ll take care of you.’”
    

            This first interaction was indicative of what was to come – Galloway-Cole was immediately welcomed into the fray. Only a couple of hours after arriving, she found herself sitting with other campers, making name necklaces to wear for the weekend.
    

            Threading beads onto the string, Galloway-Cole opted for her nickname “Mac” over her full name “Mackenzie.”
    

            She didn’t usually skip straight to the abbreviation, but Gallowy-Cole figured she was about to share some pretty intimate stuff with her fellow campers, so why not skip the niceties?

            In the lead up to the weekend, the campers had been sent a schedule of activities, meals and sharing circles.
    

            “I didn’t memorize the schedule,” says Galloway-Cole. “I looked at it once and said, ‘OK, I guess I’ll figure out what all that means when I get there.’ I think it was just a combination of nerves, but also I was open to letting whatever was supposed to happen, happen – and letting go and releasing a bit of the control. Just saying, ‘I’m here, I’m open. And I’m ready to see what this weekend is all about.’”
    

            That first day, Galloway-Cole found herself in a sharing circle with a handful of other campers and tried to embrace this mantra. She listened as other campers were candid about their bereavement experiences, watched as they oscillated between laughter and tears.
    

            Galloway-Cole stood back at first, taking everything in, feeling “every emotion on the emotional spectrum,” but gradually she felt less daunted about the prospect of opening up herself.
    

            “I was able to see how open everyone else was, in sharing their lives and sharing stories and fun tidbits about the people they love who they’ve lost,” she says. “It really empowered me to realize part of what’s going to make this whole weekend so impactful is sharing, is pushing myself to share the hardest parts of my life with the strangers that I just met, minutes or hours ago.”
    

            So, swallowing her nerves, Galloway-Cole started talking. She spoke about her late wife’s love of basketball, and she was heartened by the reactions of her fellow campers. They were encouraging, nodding along. Afterward, someone suggested a game of pick-up basketball. Galloway-Cole was fighting back tears as she dribbled the ball, but she also felt a sense of lightness, a feeling of joy that had eluded her for a long time.
    

            It helped that everyone was so kind and welcoming. Galloway-Cole’s fears about making friends were proved unfounded. While many of the campers knew each other already – either they’d worked as Experience counselors at a kids’ grief camp or attended previous iterations of the adult grief retreat – others were newbies like Galloway-Cole.
    

            And the old-timers and newbies were equally approachable. There were no cliques at grief camp. The campers ranged in age from early 20s to mid-60s, although the majority were around Galloway-Cole’s age, late 20s to early 30s.
    

            In Galloway-Cole’s everyday life, her grief sometimes feels like a stumbling block to connection with other young people – she doesn’t always know when to mention her loss, can’t predict how her peers might react and she’s always conscious being a 20-something widow is relatively unusual, even shocking.
    

            “‘Do I mention it? Do I not? Do I bring it up? Will other people feel uncomfortable? Will it sour the mood? Will someone say something and then I’ll get annoyed that what they said was not what I needed to hear, because they don’t understand what I’m going through …’ Those are all the different types of thoughts that I unconsciously am filtering through constantly,” explains Galloway-Cole.
    

            But at grief camp, everyone was united by loss, and everyone was there to talk about it. Grief was a fast track to connection, not a hurdle.
    

        Grief is so heavy, but it’s the heaviest when you’re holding it on your own. And when you do get to share parts of it with others, it’s like they’re helping you hold up this boulder.
    

            Mackenzie Galloway-Cole
        

            Over the weekend, Galloway-Cole met other people who’d lost their partners. Others who’d suffered sudden, traumatic loss. Other people in their 20s. Other New Yorkers. Other queer people. She felt a sense of camaraderie and connection that she realized was sometimes lacking in her day-to-day life. While she’s got a great support network of friends and family – who are also grieving the loss of Megan – there was something specifically comforting about meeting people going through the exact same experience.
    

            And while other campers’ stories of loss were heavy, Galloway-Cole says there was also a consolation in knowing they were all supporting one another.
    

            “Grief is so heavy, but it’s the heaviest when you’re holding it on your own,” she says. “And when you do get to share parts of it with others, it’s like they’re helping you hold up this boulder. At grief camp, there were 100 people helping you hold up a boulder, it’s a lot easier to hold than when you’re doing it on your own.”
    

            For the Experience Camps team, this idea of mutual support is at the center of everything they do – as is the idea that a moment of intense sharing could be swiftly followed by a freeing, spontaneous game of basketball.
    

            Experience Camps’ years of operating summer camps for grieving kids mean the team puts joy and grief on equal footing.
    

            “Joy and grief belong together,” says Jesse Moss, Experience Camps’ marketing director. “You can’t be 100 percent sad all the time, because you won’t be able to function and heal and grow and you can’t be 100 percent joyful all the time – because then you’re just pushing your grief down. … But I think joy and play really can get rid of your inhibitions, and kind of break you down in the same way that grief can – and so you’re just your most authentic self.”
    

            Experience Camps’ kids camps have been running since 2009, meaning a whole generation of kids has now grown up with the program. The adults’ retreat launched in 2022, inspired by feedback from the organization’s adult volunteers. Many of them had their own grief stories, but they didn’t have much opportunity to share them with one another, given their responsibilities at the kids camp.
    

            The pilot iteration of the adults retreat was exclusive to Experience Camps volunteers. There were around 30 attendees. In 2023, they extended the remit, opening up the retreat to any adults 21 and over who’d experienced the loss of a parent, caregiver or sibling. Some 60 people signed up.
    

            In 2024, the parameters expanded to include anyone dealing with the death of someone important to them, and more than 100 campers gathered for the weekend. According to Experience Camps, interest continues to grow with many people discovering the program via TikTok. The adult camp is oversubscribed, and Experience Camps are looking at ways of expanding the program.
    

            Experience Camps isn’t the only organization to run grief retreats – take Camp Widow, which hosts conference-style events for people grieving a partner across the country, or the kids-focused Comfort Zone Camp.


            But most of the grief retreat options available for adults don’t include “silly dances and an egg drop competition,” two highlights of Galloway-Cole’s June weekend.
    

            Experience Camps, which relies on donations and volunteers, also prides itself on its relative accessibility. The kids camp is free, and the adults camp costs $425 a person inclusive of all meals and activities, with adult scholarships available on a case-by-case basis.
    

            While some adult grief retreats lean into the luxury, wellness angle, Experience Camps firmly believes the less glamorous structure of summer camp lends itself perfectly to the grief space.
    

            Speaking to CNN Travel, the Experience Camps team suggests that embracing your inner child via games, campfire singalongs, dance competitions and friendship bracelets is the ideal counterpart to heavier moments of reflection and contemplation. These activities are a break from routine – from jobs, adult responsibilities, day-to-day mundanity.
    

            The only real difference between the kids program and the adult version, says Moss, is the adults have more freedom to do their own thing – and don’t have to be told when to brush their teeth or go to bed.
    

            “In your personal life, you don’t get to be silly, and do competitions and make up dances with your friends anymore. That was something 10 year olds did. But at this camp weekend, you’re talking about your grief, but you’re also making up dances with your friends,” says Moss. “It’s a really nice balance of nurturing your grief, nurturing your inner child, playing again and being vulnerable and meeting people who are like you.”

            Michelle Cove, Experience Camps’ director of communications, suggests campers are also better able to navigate their way through tougher moments of reflection and contemplation because they always know “joy and play is going to be on the other side of it.”
    

            “That’s really conducive for having these discussions, which you may or may not have if you’re at a spa retreat with your girlfriends,” Cove tells CNN Travel.
    

            The team suggests traveling is a great way of helping to process trauma, too. And it helps when the surroundings are so beautiful. Galloway-Cole calls the campground a “much needed and wanted change of pace” compared with life in New York City.
    

            “There’s greenery everywhere,” describes Galloway-Cole. “There’s a lake, a big green lawn and there’s a flagpole that we meet around every morning.”
    

            During her time at camp, Galloway-Cole went for a solo walk around the grounds before each day’s activities began.
    

            “I would cross the bridge and head over to the lake. I would sit there, on the docks and just breathe some fresh air, center myself, wake up,” she recalls. “It was really just a beautiful and tranquil way to start my day, every morning, to be alone with myself and my thoughts and try to connect with my wife a little bit before diving into a packed day.”

            Experience Camps’ kids camps have always been places where friendship thrives, and the Experience Camps team are happy to see this reflected in the adult campers’ experiences so far.
    

            “The crossover between the kids camp and the adult camp is the word ‘lonely,’” says Cove. “How lonely it is to be grieving. … And so having this space – whether it’s for kids at camp or adults at camp – just to be with everybody who gets it, that’s the star player.”
    

            Since her wife passed away, one of Galloway-Cole’s struggles is the idea that new people she meets won’t get to meet Megan.
    

            “I feel like they will never know this huge part of me,” she says.
    

            But at grief camp, because she was encouraged to speak about Megan freely, Galloway-Cole felt as though she had introduced her partner to her new friends.
    

            On the last night of the retreat, the campers enjoyed some drinks and dancing. Toward the end of the evening, Chappell Roan’s song “Hot To Go” started blaring out of the speaker.
    

            For Galloway-Cole, this was both a joyous moment and a “gut punch.” The couple went to see the pop artist live last October, not long before Megan passed away.
    

            Since then, Chappell Roan has become a chart-climbing, global star. For Galloway-Cole, it’s surreal and sad that Megan isn’t able to witness one of her favorite artists hit the mainstream.
    

            In her normal life, Galloway-Cole might have swallowed down these thoughts and feelings – might have worried voicing them aloud would kill the vibe, worried about people’s reactions.
    

            But at grief camp, Galloway-Cole didn’t have these hesitations. Instead, she shouted over the music to her new friends: “This was the last concert Megan went to before she died!”
    

            Rather than feeling like she’d brought down the mood of the room, Galloway-Cole felt like she’d just introduced Megan into the room. Her friends hugged her, cheered and the group spontaneously toasted Megan.
    

            It’s a moment Galloway-Cole’s thought about a lot since returning home.
    

            “Megan’s passing doesn’t change the things she loved, it doesn’t change the things we got to do together. And being able to just talk about her and who she was, and who she always will be, openly, I think is something that I will definitely bring more into my life.”
    

            The experience at grief camp led Galloway-Cole to realize she can “continue to introduce people to my wife, even though she’s not with us anymore.”
    

            She loves it when her grief camp friends reach out to mention something that’s made them think of Megan, whether it’s basketball news or pop music updates.
    

            “Those are people that never got to meet her and know her while she was alive. But even they, through what I share with them, feel like they now have a connection to her,” says Galloway-Cole.
    

            “That has been so impactful to hear from other people, and to see that she really does continue to be with me, and I can continue to bring her and introduce her to every person in my life that I come across.”
    

            Galloway-Cole and her fellow campers are already planning future meet-ups and weekend trips together – as well as hopefully reuniting for the 2025 Experience Camps’ adult grief retreat. Next year’s applications aren’t live yet, but those interested can still sign up to be the first to receive information.
    

            Galloway-Cole’s also enjoyed sharing stories of grief camp with her friends and loved ones back home. She wrote a piece called “Grief Camp is My Happy Place,” for her Substack, describing her experiences. She set up a new, public Instagram to document her thoughts and feelings.
    

            “I think a lot of people hear ‘grief camp’ and think it’s going to be sad all the time. They think, ‘Oh, that sounds awful, or how sad.’ Meanwhile, I feel like I came back from grief camp, and I was the happiest and the lightest I had been since my wife passed, because I got to have such a joyous release,” says Galloway-Cole.
    

            “We got to have those hard conversations, but also got to really experience community and connection and joy. And realize that it’s OK for all of these things to coexist, because that’s just what grief and a life with grief looks like.”

CNN_11,"Meet Biniam Girmay, the Black African cyclist making history wherever he rides",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/sport/biniam-girmay-black-african-cyclist-tour-de-france-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-21 16:00:00,world,"
Biniam Girmay made history at this year’s Tour de France and the Eritrean cyclist wants to use his success to inspire others to follow his path.
    

            Earlier this month, the 24-year-old became the first Black African rider ever to win a Tour de France stage.⁠ He has since gone on to win another two stages, with the potential of more to come for the world-class sprinter.
    

            The Intermarche-Wanty rider, who previously became the first Black African to win a stage at the Giro d’Italia, now wants other Black riders to excel in the sport.
    

            “It’s really good for the impact, a good vision for young talent, because if you work on that, especially in the European teams, if they invest a lot in African cycling for sure we can have a more global sport. And that’s always nice to see,” he told Eurosport during this year’s Tour de France.
    

            “This year I’m the only Black rider in the peloton, it’s not nice, to be honest, so I wish there were more Black riders in the peloton.”
    

            Girmay grew up in the Eritrean capital of Asmara, and fell in love with cycling by watching the Tour de France on television every year.
    

            He says he had stickers of his cycling heroes, Mark Cavendish and Peter Sagan, on his bedroom wall and was inspired by the likes of fellow Eritrean Daniel Teklehaimanot, who became the first cyclist to represent his country at the Olympic Games in 2012.
    

            At 18, Girmay moved to the UCI’s World Cycling Centre in the Swiss Alps, according to Cycling Weekly, but took time to adjust to life away from Africa.
    

            “For one year I almost didn’t do anything because I needed to learn,” he said, per Cycling Weekly. “I knew nothing about Europe, it was totally different to Eritrea. I needed to learn English, to learn the cycling language, and that takes a while.”
    

            After a successful junior career, Girmay was soon riding with his heroes and started making a name for himself after joining Intermarche-Wanty in 2021. He now has a contract at the team until 2026.
    

            “I’m convinced that my compatriots will be happy to hear that my future is intertwined with the team who gave me the opportunity to write important pages of African cycling history,” he said after signing his long-term contract.
    

            “It is a winning combination which will hopefully lead to many more unforgettable moments in the next years.”
    

            In 2022, Girmay became the first Black African to win a stage of one of cycling’s Grand Tours when he outsprinted his rivals in the 10th stage of the Giro d’Italia.
    

            It was a moment Girmay will never forget, for both good and bad reasons.
    

            Later that same day, the then 22-year-old had to abandon the race after a prosecco cork exploded into his left eye on the podium.
    

            “I can’t believe for him the success he has had in this short period,” legendary Eritrean cyclist Teklehaimanot said of Girmay earlier this year.
    

            “His sprints with the big riders of the world, in such a short period of time, is his talent, which I think is brilliant.”
    

            Girmay made his debut at the Tour de France last year and wanted to use this year’s race to further increase his experience of competing against a world-class peleton. Winning a stage, he says, was never really the plan.
    

            However, the Eritrean made history on July 1 by surging ahead in a sprint finish at the end of the third stage at this year’s Tour, becoming the first Black African to win a stage.
    

            Only two other African riders, Robbie Hunter and Daryl Impey of South Africa, both White, had previously won stages at the Tour de France, per Reuters.
    

            “To be part of the Tour de France is already incredible. I was dreaming of taking part and now I can’t control my emotions,” an emotional Girmay said after his first win, per Reuters.
    

            “With my first Tour last year, I acquired experience and I manage everything better. Winning today is unbelievable.”
    

            He has since gone on to claim victories in Stages 8 and 12, achievements he hope will blaze a trail for the next generation of young Black riders to follow.
    

            “To be one of the big symbols of Africans, a big pressure I know, but on the other hand, it’s really powerful to push me,” Girmay told Eurosport.
    

            The rider, though, suffered a crash during Stage 16 on Tuesday which opened up the race for the green jersey – worn by the leader of the points classification – which Girmay is currently in possession of.
    

            “Today to be honest my elbow and my knee were really hurting, especially my elbow, because with the stitches I could not move so well,” he said Wednesday.
    

            “Always the next day is the hardest, you feel the pain and it’s not nice to sleep, but mentally I’m highly motivated so that gave me a lot of strength.”

CNN_12,"A history buff bought a piece of a tent from Goodwill for $1,700. It really did belong to George Washington",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/us/george-washington-tent-fragment-goodwill/index.html,2024-07-21 18:58:00,us,"
            As a collector of artifacts, Richard “Dana” Moore makes a habit of scrolling through Goodwill’s online thrift store, and one day in 2022, the history buff came across an item that piqued his interest.
    

             A post in the historical documents section featured the image of a framed item purporting to contain a fragment of George Washington’s tent. It came with a written note saying the tent had been displayed at an exposition commemorating the 300th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown in the Virginia Colony.
    

            “I was like, ‘This can’t be.’ So I was a little bit astonished,” Moore told CNN.
    

            Moore was skeptical of the posting so he initially held off on bidding for two weeks.
    

            “There are a lot of fakes out there,” he added. “There’s always something that’s not real, that looks to be real.”
    

            Moore said he took a closer look at the torn note and determined it looked like it had aged over the years along with the fragment, which is 4 inches wide and over 5 inches long.
    

            “I jumped in with both feet. I said, ‘Hell with it.’ I’m gonna bid on it,” he said.
    

            Moore told CNN that he bid a little over $1,700 on the artifact and won. He initially didn’t tell his wife, Susan Bowen, and hid it in their home. Now, he said, she agrees that he hit it out of the park: The artifact was confirmed to be a piece of Washington’s dining tent, and Moore estimates it to be worth tens of thousands of dollars.
    

            Moore contacted the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia in February last year. He knew the museum held Washington’s sleeping and office tent. 


            Matthew Skic, curator of exhibitions, told CNN the museum was excited but first needed to confirm the fragment was actually a piece of one of Washington’s war tents. Moore agreed to send the artifact to the museum for a conservator to look at the weave of the fabric.
    

            “What’s really fascinating about this particular fragment is it retains some of the red wool trim on the edge of it, and that was telling us that this was likely cut away from the edge of the roof of the dining marquee,” Skic said.
    

            While the museum is still trying to determine which gap the fragment might fill, its binding and hand-stitched linen point to it being the real thing. Also, the note that it came with is appropriate for the time period.
    

            Once the museum confirmed the fabric’s authenticity they were excited to feature it alongside the rest of the planned exhibit around Washington’s sleeping and office war tent.
    

            “This one is a lot of fun because it came from an unlikely spot,” Skic said. “You don’t expect to find these kinds of historical treasures in a place like that, although this is not the first historical treasure that has come up via Goodwill.”
    

            The fragment, on loan from Moore, was put on display for public view in February of this year as part of the museum’s exhibit Witness to Revolution: The Unlikely Travels of Washington’s Tent. The fragment will stay in the museum until January 5, 2025, and then it will be returned to Moore.
    

            The dining tent that Moore’s fragment belongs to is now being held at the Smithsonian. It is not on display for public view.
    

            George Washington’s tents, as explained by the museum, have nearly 250 years of history. The tents, used during the Revolutionary War, held his sleeping and office quarters where he led meetings, planned strategies and wrote letters.
    

            Over the years, the tents became a symbol of Washington’s leadership and the founding of the country following the Revolution.
    

            The fragment was likely cut off the dining tent by a man named John Burns, who saw the tent on display in Norfolk, Virginia, at the exposition commemorating the founding of Jamestown. The tent itself was on loan from Mary Custis Lee, the great-granddaughter of Washington’s wife, Martha.
    

            Lee’s father, George Washington Parke Custis, later owned the Revolutionary War tents and frequently set them up to host events. Two hundred years ago, he started cutting away pieces of George Washington’s tents as souvenirs.
    

            “George Washington Parke Custis was seeing the tent as a way to connect people to the past. And there might have been a similar mindset in 1907 when this, this fragment of the dining marquee, was cut,” Skic said.
    

            There are fragments known to have been cut by Parke Custis.
    

            But Skic said there is still more to be learned from this fragment, especially about who Burns, the note’s author, might be.
    

            Currently, Moore is the only known private owner of a piece of Washington’s tent. All of the others are in the Smithsonian and other museums.
    

            Moore said knowing he bought the fragment gives him chills at night. It isn’t about the money or recognition for him. It’s about “breaking away from British rule and the beginnings of our country.”
    

            “It’s the history behind it. Can you imagine the information and the things that were said within that tent?” Moore asked rhetorically.
    

            Moore and his wife visited the museum earlier this month and said they were filled with emotion at the sight of the artifact.
    

             “I never got chills like that in my entire life,” he said. “We were both over the moon. We still can’t believe it.”

CNN_13,Secret Service says it denied Trump additional resources in recent years even as his team complained,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/secret-service-trump-security-requests/index.html,2024-07-21 19:54:00,politics,"
            Former President Donald Trump’s security detail had complained they were not being given enough resources and personnel by the Secret Service over the past two years, and the agency acknowledged Saturday it denied some requests.
    

            A spokesperson for the Secret Service said in a statement Saturday that the agency has not provided certain resources in the past but has instead provided other security measures including from local partners.
    

            The news comes amid widespread concerns about how a sniper was able to obtain rooftop access roughly 150 meters from Trump’s position at an outdoor rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last week.
    

The Washington Post and The New York Times reported earlier Saturday that the Secret Service denied previous request from Trump’s security team over the past two years.

Investigators believe Trump’s would-be assassin flew a drone over rally site on the day of the shooting


            Some close to the former president felt the decisions, which they believed were personal to Trump, came from the top ranks of the agency.
    

            While Trump holds close relationships with members of his Secret Service detail, the relationship between those agents and the upper ranks of the agency has been tense for some time, according to multiple sources familiar with the dynamic.
    

            In response to questions from CNN over whether the Secret Service had denied additional security requests, a spokesperson told CNN the agency makes “modifications” when certain resources are not provided to protectees.
    

            “In some instances where specific Secret Service specialized units or resources were not provided, the agency made modifications to ensure the security of the protectee,” Anthony Guglielmi, chief of communications for the Secret Service, wrote in a statement. “This may include utilizing state or local partners to provide specialized functions or otherwise identifying alternatives to reduce public exposure of a protectee.”
    

            Guglielmi said in a statement the day after the shooting that claims that Trump was denied additional security requests specifically for the rally in Pennsylvania were untrue.
    

            “This is absolutely false. In fact, we added protective resources & technology & capabilities as part of the increased campaign travel tempo,” Guglielmi wrote on X.
    

            Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle is facing a flurry of questions about how a gunman was able to get a clear line of sight to Trump at the rally site, and there have been calls for her resignation from members of Congress, including House Speaker Mike Johnson.
    

            Cheatle will likely face questions over these issues during her testimony this week before several committees in Congress over the security failures that led to the assassination attempt.

            The US men’s basketball team fought back from a double-digit deficit to edge past South Sudan 101-100 in a dramatic pre-Olympic friendly in London, England on Saturday.

USA Basketball Men’s National Team survives Australia fightback in Olympic warmup contest


            Despite its star power, Team USA has occasionally flattered to deceive recently and has looked unconvincing at times in victory. A late bucket from LeBron James spared the team’s blushes in the final seconds, with head coach Steve Kerr taking responsibility for his team’s complacency.
    

            “South Sudan was amazing, Royal (Ivey) and his staff did a great job of preparing his team for the game, I did not do a great job of preparing our team for the game,” he said postgame.
    

            “The whole team was embarrassed at halftime, to be down 14 and outplayed.”
    

            Ivey, South Sudan head coach, said that there were “no moral victories” after his team came within seconds of a historic upset but praised his squad’s resilience.
    

            “Every possession we battle, every possession we’re on the floor, every possession we competed … we want to take this comradery and togetherness into our first game.Staying together no matter what.”
    

            After playing warmup games in Las Vegas and the United Arab Emirates, the USA Basketball Showcase arrived in the British capital as the team continued its preparations ahead of the Olympic Games in Paris.
    

            South Sudan, the world’s youngest country, is preparing to make its Olympic debut and defeated Great Britain in a friendly game on Thursday. Former NBA All-Star Luol Deng serves as the federation’s president and as an assistant coach.
    

            The matchup also served as a preview for the Games, with the teams scheduled to meet in a Group C clash in Paris.
    

            Fans packed out the O2 Arena and created a sea of color in the stands by wearing NBA jerseys of various teams, a phenomenon frequently seen in the NFL’s international games.
    

            The London crowd was raucous and was sent into a frenzy by a LeBron James dunk on the first scoring play of the game, followed by another thunderous slam two minutes later as the US jumped out to an early 10-2 lead.
    

            South Sudan fought its way back into the game, catching fire from three-point range in the first quarter to grab the lead.
    

            Fueled by scoring from Carlik Jones and Marial Shayok, the advantage quickly ballooned to 14 points in the second as a reeling US side struggled to get anything going offensively and failed to deal with South Sudan’s offensive efficiency. The Bright Stars played at a lightning pace, shot a scorching 61.1% in the first half and made seven triples to the USA’ one.
    

            It was a sloppy first half for the US that was characterized by turnovers and periods of scoring sluggishness.
    

            Kerr’s squad began to turn the tide in the second half, getting better looks from behind the three-point line as the likes of James, Steph Curry and Anthony Edwards began to make their superstar presence known.
    

            South Sudan’s run-and-gun approach seemed to run out of steam late in the third quarter as its shooting stagnated, with Jrue Holiday and Anthony Davis helping to stem the flow with effective defense. It eventually ceded the lead inside the final minute of the period after a deep Curry three.
    

            “They scored 37 points in the third quarter and we couldn’t stop the bleeding,” said Ivey.
    

            Taking an 81-76 lead into the final period, it appeared as though the USA may run away with  things, though Ivey’s side pushed the star-studded group all the way to the buzzer.
    

            Back-to-back triples gave South Sudan a 100-99 lead going into the closing stages, but a tough layup by James pushed the USA ahead by one with eight seconds remaining.
    

            There was controversy on the final play, as South Sudan argued that Wenyen Gabriel was fouled as he went up to the basket but there was no call from the officials.Ivey said that he believed there was contact but was keen for his team to move on.
    

            “Can’t blame it on the zebras. You play the game and at the end of the day you live with the results. No complaining here,” he said.
    

            James, who led the USA in scoring with 25 points, was full of praise for his opponents.
    

            “Don’t take nothing away from South Sudan,” he said. “They played extremely good basketball and that’s why the game is won in between the lines and not all on paper.”
    

            Shayok posted 24 for the Bright Stars while Jones also recorded a triple-double in an impressive performance.
    

            With Games in Paris only a handful of days away, Saturday’s win provided a boost for the USA as it prepares to take on Serbia next Sunday, while South Sudan can take confidence into its opening Olympic game against Puerto Rico.

CNN_15,Bangladesh’s top court rolls back most government job quotas after violent protests,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/asia/bangladesh-supreme-court-rolls-back-job-quotas-intl/index.html,2024-07-21 20:10:00,world,"
            Bangladesh’s Supreme Court on Sunday rolled back most of the controversial quotas on government jobs which sparked violent protests.
    

            Under the quota system, some 30% of sought-after civil service jobs are reserved for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh’s war of independence from Pakistan in 1971 - with many of the country’s contemporary political elite related to that generation.
    

            Since the roles are linked to job security and higher pay, the quota system has angered many in the country, particularly students and young people, as Bangladesh faces high unemployment levels.
    

            Dozens of people have reportedly been killed and hundreds injured in the violence, which saw demonstrators gather on streets and university campuses in the capital Dhaka and other cities.
    

            In 2018, the civil service quota system was scrapped following similar protests but in June the High Court reinstated it, ruling its removal unconstitutional. On July 10, the Supreme Court suspended the quotas for one month while it took up the case.
    

            On Sunday, the country’s top court dismissed the earlier ruling that brought back the quotas, directing that 93% of government jobs will be open to candidates on merit, without quotas.
    

            Speaking to local media in Dhaka following the announcement, Shah Monjurul Hoque, a lawyer representing students said that the Supreme Court “gave a final solution to this quota system.”
    

            “That is 93% quota for general people, 5% quota for freedom fighters and their kin, 1% for ethnic minority community, and 1% for third gender and physically disabled,” he said.
    

            Ahead of the ruling, Bangladesh on Sunday extended a curfew imposed on Friday to try to quell the violence and deployed soldiers to patrol the streets of the capital Dhaka, according to Reuters.
    

            According to local media, the curfew was extended until after the Supreme Court hearing and will continue for an “uncertain time” following a two-hour break for people to gather supplies, Reuters reported.
    

            CNN has tried to reach the prime minister’s office, home affairs ministry, and police, but mobile and internet services appear to remain mostly down across the country after a government-imposed blackout.
    

            As of Saturday, internet monitoring site NetBlocks said activity had remained at around 10% for more than 48 hours since services were cut Thursday.
    

            The US state department raised the travel advisory level for Bangladesh on Saturday, urging people to “not travel” due to “civil unrest, crime and terrorism.”

CNN_16,Arike Ogunbowale sets WNBA All-Star record while Angel Reese and Caitlin Clark set rookie records in win over Team USA,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/sport/wnba-all-star-game-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-21 20:53:00,world,"
            Dallas Wings guard Arike Ogunbowale set a new WNBA All-Star game record of 34 points while Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese set rookie records as they helped lead Team WNBA to a 117-109 win over Team USA on Saturday in Phoenix.
    

            All Ogunbowale’s 34 points came in the second half, with 21 in the third quarter, as Team WNBA overturned a four-point deficit at half time to defeat Team USA as it prepares for the upcoming Paris Olympics.
    

            Ogunbowale’s scoring exploits earned her a second All-Star MVP award in front of 16,407 fans at Footprint Center.
    

            “Coach (Cheryl Miller) actually called me out at halftime in front of everybody was like, just take a deep breath and play your game,” the 27-year-old said after the game. “I guess you guys saw what happened.”
    

            Ogunbowale is the fourth player in league history with multiple All-Star game trophies.
    

            Meanwhile, rookies Chicago Sky forward Reese and Indiana Fever guard Clark played on the same team for the first time and both enjoyed historic games in their All-Star debuts.
    

            Reese, who has already set a WNBA record for the most consecutive double-doubles this season, became the first rookie to record a double-double in an All-Star game after finishing with 12 points and 11 rebounds.
    

            Clark had four points and also set a rookie All-Star game record with 10 assists, one of which went to Reese, to finish just one assist shy of Sue Bird’s overall record in an All-Star game.
    

            “It was a lot of fun, we came in here and we competed hard,” Clark told reporters afterward. “We knew they were going to want to win so we came out with the same mindset … We started the third quarter really strong and that’s what set the tone.”

            Clark was left off the Olympic roster, a decision that was initially met with some shock, but she told reporters that there was “plenty of talent on that team.”
    

            “I think it was the same four years prior, Team WNBA beat Team USA and they were perfectly fine at the Olympics,” she added. “If anything, it shows how good this league is, how much talent there is … I’m going to be supporting them and cheering them on, I love the Olympics … they’re going to win gold and dominate.”
    

            Six-time All-Star and New York Liberty forward Breanna Stewart led Team USA with 31 points and 10 rebounds while six-time All-Star and Las Vegas Aces center A’ja Wilson added 22 points, six rebounds and three assists.

CNN_17,‘I’m just sick of it’: More than a week without power leaves some Houston-area residents feeling hopeless and abandoned,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/us/texas-houston-power-outage/index.html,2024-07-21 21:45:00,us,"
            Theodore Doyle, an 81-year-old retired manager with the former US Customs Service, was waking up in his hot and muggy northeast Houston apartment in a bed soaked in sweat.
    

            Doyle ultimately checked into a $98-a-night hotel room late Tuesday, after enduring a compounding crisis of extreme heat and no power for more than a week with about 200 other seniors at an independent living facility in the Kingwood community.
    

            “There’s no air circulating. It’s just stifling and it’s sort of tough to breathe,” he told CNN before returning to his apartment when power was restored Thursday afternoon. “I just couldn’t take it anymore.”
    

            During the outage, a generator powered one elevator and a large, air-conditioned lounge at the complex – a lifeline for many who are dependent on electric wheelchairs and scooters to get around and oxygen machines for pulmonary disease. At times, as many as 40 residents sought refuge in the lounge. Others remained in their stifling apartments. Some stayed with relatives.
    

            “A friend just turned 95 about a month ago,” Doyle said. “Another friend of mine is over 90 and quite a few of us are all over 80. It’s tough. You’re not as spry as you used to be.”
    

            By Sunday morning, about 1,200 customers of Houston’s main utility, CenterPoint Energy, were without power, according to PowerOutage.us. It’s unclear if those customers have been without power since Beryl hit the Golf Coast July 8 as a hurricane, leaving more than 2 million customers in the dark, mostly in the Houston area. More than 135,000 CenterPoint customers had no power on Monday night.
    

            The embattled utility said in a statement that customers without power were “predominantly isolated instances,” where homes or equipment sustained severe damage from the storm. CenterPoint, which has 2.8 million customers in the Houston area, said some current outages could be related to thunderstorms Saturday morning. “For safety reasons, our crews pause their work when there is lightning,” the statement said.
    

            At least 14 Houston-area deaths were confirmed to be hurricane-related, including seven people – ranging in age from 50 to 110 – who died from “heat exposure due to power loss,” according to the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences. Overall, more than 20 deaths in Harris and nearby counties were attributed to the storm, according to the Houston Chronicle and other local media outlets. Older people were especially vulnerable and, authorities warned, the number of fatalities could grow.
    

            For more than a week, some residents of the nation’s fourth largest city were left to sleep in their cars, shuffle perilously with canes and walkers across dark rooms and corridors, and watch food and medications spoil and critical medical equipment become inoperable. At times, they cried in desperation after discovering the bodies of neighbors who succumbed to the heat following a comparatively mild Category 1 hurricane.
    

            “It is unimaginable this is happening in 2024,” Denise Furlough, who delivered food, batteries and ice to her 86-year-old father during the more than a week without power in his Alameda Plaza home, told CNN Saturday. “I was just frightened I might go over there and he wouldn’t be alive.”
    

            In Houston’s Museum District on Tuesday, Pat Baker arrived at a condo complex to check on a neighbor with health problems who rented out her daughter’s apartment. The neighbor didn’t answer.
    

            “I unlocked the door and found her,” Baker, fighting back tears, told CNN affiliate KHOU. “You know, it’s just been hot and miserable and I’m just sick of this. I’m just sick of it.”
    

            Power was restored at the condo complex later that afternoon after the body was removed from the apartment, the station reported.

            The latest name on the Harris County list of confirmed Beryl-related deaths was Christine Davis, who had turned 110 in May, according to the 110 Club, a site about super-centenarians. She died Tuesday at Memorial Hermann Hospital Northeast from hyperthermia caused by “environmental heat exposure due to power outage,” according to the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences.
    

            Another confirmed storm victim was Pamela Jarrett, 64, who died of hyperthermia on July 11, days after the hurricane, in her home in Spring, Texas, just north of Houston. Relatives told CNN affiliate KTRK on Wednesday that Jarrett relied on a wheelchair and feeding tube.
    

            “It could have been avoided, and she didn’t have to die,” said her sister Janet, who took care of her and struggled to keep the feeding device charged during the outage. She said she tried to keep Jarrett cool with ice and water until she became unresponsive.
    

            “As much as I tried to save her,” Janet Jarrett told the station, “I couldn’t save her.”
    

            Power was restored in the Jarrett home on Tuesday.
    

            In the city of Humble, about 20 miles north of Houston, Christina Bourgeois, her three children – ages 5 through 9 – and their dog Mimosa spent the night after the storm in her Dodge Journey outside their home. She kept the Dodge on, the air conditioner running because of the heat.
    

            “I slept in the driver’s seat,” she told CNN Friday. “It was awful. You know, my younger son, I had to get up and take him inside to use the restroom.”
    

            The children later stayed with relatives and Bourgeois, 32, spent every night in the car until power was restored on Wednesday.
    

            “I would wake up every two or three hours or so to turn the air on and then turn it off,” she said of the nights she spent alone in the Dodge.
    

             “I hadn’t slept. I was exhausted. I was starting to swell. I had bags under my eyes. Any little noise would wake me up because I have the windows down, you know … Any kind of rustle of the leaves or, you know, even cars passing by, I would just wake up.”

Texas Gov. Abbott gives CenterPoint Energy deadline for plan to fix power issues after Beryl slams Houston


            Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last Sunday threatened executive action if CenterPoint Energy did not address concerns over the prolonged outage. And the Public Utilities Commission of Texas said it would investigate the company’s response, according to Chairman Thomas Gleason. He told reporters Monday the utility’s ability to maintain its infrastructure and its communication with customers has been called into question.
    

            CenterPoint Energy told CNN in a statement it was “committed to doing a thorough review of our Hurricane Beryl response.”
    

            “We are engaging with community leaders, elected officials, local clergy leadership and others across the area to learn about how we can be more responsive to their needs and concerns,” the statement said.
    

            Doyle, before he returned to his apartment on Thursday, said he had about $150 worth of food on his refrigerator that went bad. He said he was unsure about the condition of some insulin he had left behind. He blamed the utility company for leaving thousands of Houstonians marooned in a broiling nightmare.
    

            “You have no idea how frustrating this is,” he said. “We should not be subjected to this.”
    

            Furlough, whose father, Julius Gordon, is a cancer survivor and has heart disease, said he – like many Houston residents – felt hopeless and abandoned until power to his home was restored on Tuesday.
    

            Her father told CNN, “You’re just there. You just vegetate.”

            One person was critically injured in a stabbing at Miami International Airport late Saturday evening, according to the Miami-Dade Police Department, prompting the evacuations of two concourses.
    

            Normal airport operations have since resumed, police said in a news release Sunday morning.
    

            The investigation so far indicates the male suspect and the victim were on the fourth floor of Terminal J around 11:30 p.m. when the attack happened, the release said.
    

            “Without provocation, the subject attacked the victim by stabbing her multiple times and attempted to throw her over the railing,” the release said. “The victim was able to escape the attack and ran down the stairs to the 3rd floor level, which is where the officers found her.”

            The suspect was taken into custody at the scene, police said. Authorities also recovered a knife.
    

            Miami-Dade Fire Rescue took the victim to Jackson Memorial Hospital’s Ryder Trauma Center in critical condition, the release said.
    

            Passengers were evacuated from Concourses H and J in the airport’s south terminal as a precaution, and operations resumed after all passengers were rescreened, airport officials said.
    

            “We want to assure the public that the situation is under control and the safety of our passengers, staff, and visitors remains our top priority,” a statement from the airport said. “Authorities responded immediately, and the situation was swiftly contained.”
    

            Miami-Dade Police continue to investigate Saturday’s attack, said the department’s statement, which noted reports of a possible active shooter that emerged in “the midst of the chaos” turned out to be false.
    

The Federal Aviation Administration received more than 2,000 reports of unruly passengers in 2023, a 15% decrease from the previous year. So far in 2024, nearly 900 unruly passenger incidents were reported.
    

            “The rate of unruly passenger incidents steadily dropped by over 80 percent since record highs in early 2021, but recent increases show there remains more work to do,” the administration said.

CNN_20,"At least 6 killed, Houthis say, as Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen day after Tel Aviv drone attack",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/middleeast/yemen-israel-strikes-hodeidah-intl/index.html,2024-07-21 21:06:00,world,"
            At least six people were killed and scores more injured in Israeli airstrikes on a Yemeni port, Houthi rebels have said, a day after the Iran-backed group claimed a deadly attack on the Israeli city of Tel Aviv.
    

            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its fighter jets struck “military targets of the Houthi terrorist regime” in the area of Yemen’s Hodeidah Port on Saturday, in what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said was a direct response to the death of a 50-year-old Israeli in a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv on Friday.
    

            This is the first time Israel has struck Yemen, according to Israeli officials.
    

            The Houthis said at least six people were killed, three are missing while a further 83 people were injured in the strikes, which hit oil facilities.
    

Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam said the strikes had also hit civilian targets and a power station. He slammed what he said was “brutal Israeli aggression” aimed at increasing the “suffering of the people of Yemen” and pressuring the group to stop its support of Gaza.
    

            Houthi army spokesperson Yehya Saree vowed to respond to the strike, saying the Houthis would not hesitate to strike Israel’s “vital targets” and warning that Tel Aviv – a major city home to scores of diplomatic missions – was still not safe.
    

            “We have prepared for a long war with this enemy until the aggression stops and the blockade on the Palestinian people is lifted,” Saree said.
    

            On Sunday Israel said it intercepted a missile launched from Yemen. “The projectile did not cross into Israeli territory. Rocket and missile sirens were sounded following the possibility of falling shrapnel. The incident has concluded,” the IDF said.
    

            Netanyahu said in a statement on Saturday that Hodeidah was “not an innocent port.”
    

            “It was used for military purposes, it was used as an entry point for deadly weapons supplied to the Houthis by Iran,” Netanyahu said, adding that Hodeidah had also been used to attack international shipping in the Red Sea.
    

            Netanyahu also said the operation, which hit targets 1,800 km (1,118 miles) from Israel’s borders, shows the enemy Israel is serious about responding to threats.
    

            “It makes it clear to our enemies that there is no place that the long arm of the state of Israel will not reach,” Netanyahu said.
    

            United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a UN statement he was “deeply concerned” by reports of the strikes.
    

            “The response to the Israeli aggression against our country is inevitably coming and will be huge and great,” Houthi rebels warned in a statement following the attack, adding that they will continue their operations against Israeli, American, and British ships until Israel stops its “siege” on Gaza.
    

            IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said the strikes were also in response to the roughly 200 missiles and drones the rebel group has launched towards Israel since October, when Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza began.

Israel investigates security failures around deadly Tel Aviv drone strike


            Since the start of the war, the Yemeni rebels have regularly targeted the country with drones and missiles, most of which have been intercepted by Israel’s defenses or those of its allies. However, the Houthis have claimed their drone attack in Tel Aviv Friday – which also injured 10 people – was performed by a new drone capable of “bypassing the enemy’s interception systems.”
    

            The Houthis have also regularly attacked US targets and commercial shipping in the Red Sea.
    

            Both the UK and the US have responded to the attacks on shipping by carrying out strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. However, Israel has not taken part in those responses.
    

            An Israeli defense official told CNN that this was a 100% Israeli strike. The official said Israel had previously let the US and UK take the lead on responding to Houthi attacks but decided to respond itself this time because of the death of the Israeli citizen in Tel Aviv.
    

            According to the official, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant informed US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin before the strike was carried out.
    

            The defense official added that Israel was able to strike so quickly because it had been preparing for this scenario for months.
    

            A White House official said US President Joe Biden had been briefed on “developments” in the Middle East. A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said the US had not coordinated with Israel on the airstrikes, but added that the US fully recognizes “Israel’s right to self-defense.”
    

            The Houthi movement, also known as Ansar Allah – Arabic for ‘Supporters of God’ – is a Shi’ite Islamist political and military organization backed by Iran, that emerged in the 1990s.
    

            Similar to chants used by Lebanon-based Iranian proxy Hezbollah, the Houthis’ official slogan reads, “God is the Greatest. Death to America. Death to Israel. Curse the Jews. Victory to Islam.”

            In 2014, Houthi forces allied with former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh took control of Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, from the UN-recognized Yemeni government, sparking a civil war that has afflicted the country ever since.
    

            Since March 2015, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have led a coalition in Yemen against Houthi forces.
    

            More recently, the group has come to be seen in parts of the largely Sunni Muslim world and beyond as champions of the Palestinian cause, defending the people of Gaza against Israel.
    

            Since October 7, Houthi rebels have carried out numerous missile and drone attacks on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, asserting that these vessels are linked to Israel and its allies, which has escalated tensions throughout the Middle East.
    

            In recent weeks Hezbollah has been ramping up cross-border attacks with Israel after months of low-intensity fighting, prompting the Israeli military to warn that it is prepared to launch a large-scale attack on its northern border.
    

            Following the Hodeidah strike, Israel’s Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir congratulated Netanyahu on the operation and said Israel should “adopt the same policy against Hezbollah in Lebanon.”
    

            Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Defense Minister Gallant echoed Ben Gvir’s sentiment. Smotrich said Israel must continue to attack “with all its might even in distant places,” while Gallant said “the blood of Israeli citizens has a price,” and that anywhere Israelis are attacked the “result will be identical.”

            “The fire that is currently burning in Hodeidah, is seen across the Middle East and the significance is clear,” Gallant said.
    

            Hezbollah in Lebanon condemned the attack on Yemen and said “we stand firmly with the Yemeni people in defending themselves, their sovereignty, and their heroic and historic stance alongside Palestine.”
    

            Hamas also condemned the attack, calling it a “dangerous escalation.”
    

            Meanwhile, Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Israel Katz called on the international community to “maximize sanctions on Iran.”
    

            “Iran supports, trains, and finances the Houthi terror organization as part of its regional network of terror organizations aimed at attacking Israel,” he said.
    

            “Iran is the head of the snake – it must be stopped now,” Katz added.
    

            Iran condemned the Israeli strike on Hodeidah. Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Nasser Kanaani warned of the risk of war in the region, saying Israel’s actions in Gaza were the “root” of the escalating tensions.
    

            “The oppressed but powerful people of Yemen are paying the price for their honorable support of the innocent citizens, women and children of Gaza,” Kanaani said.

CNN_21,Israel strikes Yemen for the first time following deadly Houthi drone attack. Here’s what we know,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/middleeast/israel-strikes-houthi-rebels-explainer-intl/index.html,2024-07-21 22:05:00,world,"
            For the first time, Israel has struck inside Yemen, following a deadly drone attack launched by Houthi rebels on Tel Aviv.
    

            Since the October 7 attacks by Hamas on Israel, the Houthis have been targeting shipping in the Red Sea in solidarity - they say - with Gaza. But these direct attacks on each other’s soil between the Israeli military and an Iranian-backed rebel group risk creating a new front in a conflict that already threatened to spill over into the region.
    

            Soon after the Israeli attack, the Houthis said they launched a fresh barrage of missiles towards Israel, promising a response that will be “huge and great.”
    

            Here’s what we know.
    

            The Houthis are an Iran-backed Islamist group based in Yemen.
    

            The Houthi movement, also known as Ansar Allah (Supporters of God), is one side in a civil war that has raged in Yemen for nearly a decade. It emerged in the 1990s, when its leader, Hussein al-Houthi, launched “Believing Youth,” a religious revival movement for a centuries-old subsect of Shia Islam called Zaidism.
    

            Since a ceasefire, the Houthis have consolidated their control over most of northern Yemen. They have also sought an agreement with Saudi Arabia, a major rival of Iran, that would bring the war to a permanent end and cement their role as the country’s rulers.
    

            The Houthis are believed to have been armed and trained by Iran. Since Hamas’s attacks on October 7 attacks and Israel’s subsequent ground and air offenses in Gaza, the Houthis say they have been seeking revenge against Israel for its military campaign by targeting Red Sea shipping.
    

            The US and UK have responded to those attacks by carrying out strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. However, Israel has not taken part in those responses.
    

            In addition, Israel’s army spokesman says the militant group has targeted “Israeli civilians and civilian infrastructure” about 200 times in the same period. Most of those launches were intercepted by US Central Command, the spokesman said, but Israel’s air defenses have also intercepted Houthi drones and missiles inside and outside Israel’s airspace.
    

            A tipping point for Israel appears to have come on Friday, when a drone attack was launched on Tel Aviv, killing one Israeli citizen and injuring several others.
    

            The attack was claimed by the Houthis, with spokesperson Yahya Sare’e saying the operation was performed by a new drone capable of “bypassing the enemy’s interception systems.”
    

            “We will continue to strike these targets in response to the enemy’s massacres and daily crimes against our brothers in the Gaza Strip,” Sare’e said. “Our operations will only cease when the aggression stops and the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted.”
    

            The attack marked the first time Tel Aviv, Israel’s commercial center, has been struck by a drone in an attack claimed by the Houthis. Israel authorities are investigating the circumstances and potential security failures around the deadly drone blast.
    

            Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari said that the military suspects the drone was an Iranian-made Samad-3 model, launched from Yemen, which had been upgraded to extend its range.
    

            A second drone was intercepted outside of Israeli airspace to the east at the same time as the attack, he said, adding that Israel is now upgrading its air defenses and increasing aerial patrols of its borders.
    

            Israel’s response came a day later, when Israeli aircraft hit the Yemeni port of Hodeidah.
    

            The attack, which marked the first time Israel has struck Yemen, killed at least six people and injured scores more, Yemeni officials said. The Houthi-run Al Masirah TV said the strikes targeted oil facilities in the port on Yemen’s west coast.
    

Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam said the strikes had also hit civilian targets and a power station. He slammed what he said was “brutal Israeli aggression” aimed at increasing the “suffering of the people of Yemen” and pressuring the group to stop its support of Gaza.
    

            Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the port was used by Iran to bring arms into Yemen.
    

            “The port we attacked is not an innocent port. It was used for military purposes, it was used as an entry point for deadly weapons supplied to the Houthis by Iran,” he said in a statement on Saturday.
    

            Netanyahu also said the operation, which hit targets 1,800 km (1,118 miles) from Israel’s borders, showed Israel was serious about responding to threats.
    

            “It makes it clear to our enemies that there is no place that the long arm of the State of Israel will not reach,” Netanyahu said.
    

            Neither side have suggested they are ready to back down. “It’s not in the Houthi ‘DNA’ to de-escalate with Israel,” Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute wrote on X.
    

            Houthi army spokesperson Yehya Saree said the Houthis have “prepared for a long war” with Israel and that Tel Aviv is still not safe. Israel’s Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, warned that the “blood of Israeli citizens has a price,” and that if Israelis are attacked, the “result will be identical” to that which has been seen in Lebanon and Gaza.
    

            On Sunday, Israeli military said it had intercepted a missile approaching Israeli territory from Yemen while the Houthis said they launched a “number of ballistic missiles.”
    

            The war in Gaza has already been accompanied by significantly heightened tensions between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. The two sides have been trading cross-border fire since October 8, when Hezbollah fired at three Israeli border posts “in solidarity” with Palestinians.
    

            But while raised tensions with the Houthis undoubtedly creates fresh challenges for Israel, Hezbollah remains the bigger threat given its extensive arsenal and proximity to Israel.
    

            Yoel Guzansky, a senior fellow at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) who has served on Israel’s National Security Council, told CNN he believes Israel has until now been restrained in its response.
    

            He believes Israel was trying to send a signal to the US and the international community that “enough is enough,” and deliberately chose a target with high visibility.
    

            “You have to signal to a rogue actor that is attacking you that there is a price to pay, and I think this is what Israel tried to do.”
    

            Like the Houthis, Hezbollah is also heavily backed by Iran, which makes no secret of its animosity towards Israel.
    

            Any increase in hostilities between Israel and Iran’s proxies is seen as deeply destabilizing in the region because it could push the two countries closer towards open warfare.
    

            Israel and Iran have already traded one direct exchange since October 7. Few in the international community want to see it happen again.

CNN_22,This ‘once in a generation’ Scottish cottage is up for sale. But there’s one key quirk,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/sport/blackrock-house-royal-troon-open-championship-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-21 22:08:00,world,"
            It’s quite a view from the windowsill of Blackrock House; waves gently lapping the shores of the Firth of Clyde, the Isle of Arran towering far beyond, as Tiger Woods taps in for par just a stone’s throw away.
    

            The Open Championship is in full swing at Royal Troon in South Ayrshire, Scotland, and right at its heart is a property that has allowed its owners to marvel at the world’s greatest players without stepping foot outside their front door.
    

            For the golf fanatics of the world, it could soon all be yours – so long as you have a spare £1.5 million ($1.93 million) to part with.
    

            Viewings on the home will begin after the victor of the 152nd edition of the major has been crowned on Sunday, offering prospective buyers “a once in a generation opportunity” to own “one of the best houses in golf,” according to estate agent Strutt and Parker.
    

            “The sale of Blackrock House is one of those rare times where you can safely say there isn’t anything else like this available in the world,” Strutt and Parker selling agent Annabel Blackett told CNN via email.
    

            Originally one of a row of cottages, the four-bedroom, semi-detached property – neighboured by No. 16 Crosbie Road – pre-dates the foundation of fabled links club, established in 1878.
    

            It would be another 45 years before the course hosted its first Open Championship, with this week marking its 10th time staging the major. In that time, the house’s tenants have had an unparalleled view of the drama at the 16th and second hole – the latter par-five known as “Black Rock” as a nod to the home.

            Sightlines extend to the third, 17th and even 18th hole, where greats of the game Arnold Palmer and Tom Watson clinched the Claret Jug in 1962 and 1982 respectively. In 2020, it offered a ticket to a ticketless tournament – as the pandemic meant the first ever Women’s British Open staged at Royal Troon was played behind closed doors.
    

            “You can watch five holes from the comfort of your own home, and of course you also have the club on your doorstep for your own playing,” Blackett said.
    

            “While the views are fantastic year-round – and particularly with the coastal waters in the distance – the position really comes into its own when a championship as prestigious as The Open is in town.”
    

            “It’s little surprise that launching a home as special as this has created the level of buzz and interest that we’ve seen so far,” she added.
    

            The clients selling Black Rock are the children of David and Isabel Kelly, who owned the home for 30 years before they died, a representative for Strutt and Parker told CNN.
    

            The couple watched three Open Championships from their gardens with their sons Andrew and John, culminating with Sweden’s Henrik Stenson besting Phil Mickelson in the storied “High Noon at Troon” showdown of 2016.
    

            “This will be a bittersweet Open for us,” Andrew Kelly told the Associated Press ahead of this week’s tournament.
    

            “We were going to sell it anyway, so we decided to put it on during the Open, as you can imagine it’s probably the best time to do it.”

CNN_23,"More than 1,000 US flights canceled for the third day straight as airlines slowly recover from global tech outage",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/us/tech-outage-flight-cancellations-united-delta-airlines/index.html,2024-07-21 23:38:00,us,"
            More than 1,000 US flights have been canceled for the third day straight, as airlines slowly recover from a global tech outage that left thousands of passengers stranded at airports.
    

            More than 1,500 flights into, within or out of the US were canceled before 11 a.m. Sunday, according to the tracking website FlightAware.com.
    

            Nearly half of Sunday’s cancelations were from Delta Air Lines, with at least 500 flights affected.
    

            “Additional cancellations are expected as some of Delta’s technology continues to recover from Friday morning’s vendor-caused issue,” the airline said in a statement Saturday morning.
    

            On Saturday, 2,136 US flights were canceled, and more than 21,300 flights were delayed, according to FlightAware.

A global tech outage brought many computer systems and businesses to a screeching halt. Here’s what happened


            The issue extended beyond airports, with businesses, government agencies, health and emergency services, banks, schools and universities around the world grinding to a halt or seeing services disrupted due to a flawed software update for Microsoft Windows operating systems issued by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, experts told CNN.
    

            The outage “has basically turned computers into bricks around the world,” Glenn Gerstell, former general counsel of the US National Security Agency, told CNN on Saturday.
    

            “This is probably going to be the biggest single computer incident in terms of overall effect,” Gerstell said. “Maybe not the number of computers, but the impact on people’s lives.”
    

            CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz apologized to customers and said a fix has been deployed, but experts say getting systems back in order will be a lengthy process.
    

            The outage affected an estimated 8.5 million Windows devices, less than 1% of all Windows machines, according to a Saturday blog post from Microsoft. “While the percentage was small, the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services,” Microsoft said.
    

            Major airlines have said services are being restored, but that there could be more delays and disruptions.
    

            A majority of United Airlines systems have recovered from Friday’s outage, the airline said in a statement. More than 400 United flights were canceled Saturday, and over 200 flights were canceled Sunday, according to FlightAware.com.
    

            “While most of our systems have recovered from the worldwide third-party software outage, we may continue to experience some disruption to our operation, including flight delays and cancellations,” United said.
    

            Delta has paused unaccompanied minor travel until Monday due to the outage, the airline announced over the weekend. Unaccompanied children who are already booked on a Delta flight will not be able to travel, and the airline has asked that no new flights be booked for them.
    

            Also impacted was American Airlines, which said in a statement  Friday that “we were able to safely reestablish our operation” and it had “issued a travel waiver for our customers impacted by the vendor technology issue earlier this morning.” Allegiant Air said in a statement Saturday while “normal operations have resumed” after the outage, they’re processing a backlog of customer messages and troubleshooting their programs and platforms.
    

            Even with the flawed computer update rolled back, it’s not a quick fix for airlines, which have computers at thousands of gates that will need to be individually manually rebooted, David Kennedy, cofounder of cybersecurity company Binary Defense, told CNN on Saturday.
    

            “It’s not just as simple as rebooting. There’s a lot more steps and complexities in this that are involved,” Kennedy said. “There’s just not enough people at those airports, at those locations to go and do it.”
    

            The US Department of Transportation on Friday said it determined the flight delays and cancellations resulting from the system outage were “controllable,” meaning they’re “attributable to the airline.” In such cases, the airlines “must adhere to their customer service commitments.”
    

            Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in a social media post Saturday said he received reports of some airlines only offering flight credits to passengers for canceled flights.
    

            “Let me be clear — you are entitled to get your money back promptly if your flight is canceled and you don’t take a rebooking,” Buttigieg said.
    

            Frustrated passengers lined up at airports backed up with flight cancellations and delays, some missing life events like weddings, funerals and birthdays.
    

            At Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, long lines of passengers waited for assistance Saturday, with many flights still canceled or delayed.
    

            Delta passenger Catalina Villareal described the scene: “Mayhem. Chaos. Frustration. Hunger.”
    

            Villareal expressed frustration with what she says is a lack of information from airlines.
    

            “I have had three cancellations. I’ve checked in three times for all of the flights. And now I have two bags some place … in the airport, and nobody knows how long they’ll take to come in,” Villareal said. “So, we’ve been told just to come tomorrow or Monday.”
    

            Thousands of people face the same uncertainty as they cram together in airports across the country, waiting for answers.
    

            “I was supposed to be in California for my mom’s wedding,” Richard Whitfield of Pasco County, Florida, told CNN on Saturday. Whitfield and his partner, Jonathan Shade, left Tampa on Thursday and missed their connecting flight in Atlanta due to poor weather conditions, delaying their landing and forcing the plane to refuel in Tallahassee.

            After their rescheduled flight on Friday was delayed many times, the couple decided to cancel the trip and just head home. But with no available flights back to Tampa on Friday night, they spent their second night in an airport hotel. They were unable to get a voucher from Delta for either of their stays.
    

            “(Richard has) been on hold for 24 hours,” Shade told CNN. “When he eventually got his number in line, it was 2,001.”
    

            Two hours later, Richard’s place in Delta Air Lines’ virtual customer service queue was 2,300 in line, Shade said.
    

            Whitfield told CNN the whole ordeal has had an impact on him.
    

            “For me, it’s been the domino effect that it has on humanity and everything that we need to survive: food, sleep, or water, housing,” he said.
    

            After spending 48 hours in Atlanta, they found a Saturday evening flight back to Tampa they say they can only hope is not delayed or canceled. For now, there is nothing the couple can do but wait and “get a good stiff drink,” Shade and Whitfield said.
    

            Another traveler at Boston Logan International Airport was trying to get to Fort Lauderdale for her father’s 96th Birthday.
    

            “My flight this morning was canceled. I was supposed to fly to Fort Lauderdale, so they rebooked to West Palm Beach and I got here to the airport, it was canceled. They didn’t tell me – I had no notification, nothing,” Charlotte Yeh told CNN affiliate WFXT on Saturday.
    

            Some passengers at the Boston airport were upset that their summer trips and plans were foiled.
    

            “We’ve had this trip booked to Las Vegas for some time now,” Marc Forbes told WFXT. “Straight up cancellation with the next possible flight being Monday at 6 p.m. and we were only going to be in Las Vegas for four nights so that trip is going to have to be rebooked.”
    

            Carol Edwards said her flights on Friday and Saturday were both canceled, and the next available flight isn’t until Monday.
    

            “We have a lot of plans you know visit family, eat, see friends, party – you know, everything – so there’s nothing we can do,” she told WFXT.

            Little over two months ago, Xander Schauffele was regarded as one of the most talented golfers to never win one of the sport’s biggest prizes. On Sunday, the American clinched the Open Championship to claim the second major of his career.
    

            The world No. 3 tore away from a bunched field with a ruthless showing at Royal Troon in Scotland, powering to victory to swiftly add a Claret Jug to the PGA Championship trophy he lifted in May.
    

            Having begun the final round one shot off the lead, a brilliant bogey-free six-under 65 saw Schauffele finish two strokes ahead of compatriot Billy Horschel and England’s Justin Rose at nine-under par overall.
    

            It makes the Californian the first player to win two majors in a single season since Brooks Koepka in 2018, and seals an American clean sweep of the four men’s flagship events for the first time since 1982 following Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau’s triumphs at the Masters and US Open respectively.

            President Joe Biden has thrown his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris to become the next Democratic nominee for president after announcing Sunday he is dropping out of the race.
    

            Should Harris officially become the party’s standard-bearer, she would be the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead the ticket of a major political party.
    

            The historic endorsement comes after weeks of disarray within the Democratic Party, following a disastrous debate performance by Biden that called into question his ability to win a second term and govern for another four years. Biden ended his campaign Sunday amid growing calls from members of his party to step aside.
    

            Logistically, Harris is the natural heir to the ticket as Biden’s running mate. She would inherit the Biden campaign’s massive political operation and war chest. Recent polling has also shown her performing better against former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, than Biden and other potential Democratic contenders.
    

            Should there be efforts to pass over Harris in favor of Democrats seen as likely to run in 2028, there may be backlash from the vice president’s supporters and prominent Black Democrats. But Harris has also experienced something of a renaissance within her party, as Democrats showered her with praise in the days following the debate.
    

            Throughout her vice presidency, Harris has struggled to define herself while juggling an issue portfolio that has included difficult topics such as voting rights and stemming the tide of migrants coming from Central America. On the former, an effort to bolster the Voting Rights Act failed in Congress. On migration, Harris was criticized on the right for not spending enough time on the border and on the left for telling migrants in a speech, “Do not come.”
    

            As recently as last year, some Democrats were worried that negative views of Harris could hurt the ticket, prompting prominent Democrats to urge the party to stop undermining her.
    

            But in the weeks since Biden’s June debate performance, Harris has settled into a groove, becoming a key surrogate for Biden’s reelection campaign on reproductive health as the campaign put it, the threat Trump poses to democracy.
    

            Harris allies have argued that much of the criticism is a result of racism and sexism against the country’s first woman of color in such a position. Now, they say, the country is seeing in Harris what her allies have seen for years.
    

            “Oftentimes Black women are not seen until they’re needed,” said LaTosha Brown, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter, a progressive group that works to boost Black voter turnout. “We’ve seen her constantly berated, marginalized, questioned. I think that the shift is because there’s a need.”

CNN_28,Biden will not seek reelection; endorses Harris,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/joe-biden-drops-out-election/index.html,2024-07-22 02:36:00,politics,"
            President Joe Biden says he is not seeking reelection in a letter posted to his official account on X. In a second post, he endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him.
    

            “It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,” Biden wrote. “And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.”
    

            Biden says he will speak to the nation later this week in more detail.
    

            In his follow-up post, Biden praised Harris and urged Democrats to unite behind her. “My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President,” Biden wrote. “And it’s been the best decision I’ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year.”
    

            Biden’s departure capped off weeks of concern about the 81-year-old president’s stamina and mental capabilities and skepticism of his ability to effectively campaign against former President Donald Trump and govern the country for another four years. Biden’s decision is also likely to raise questions about his ability to fulfill the duties of the presidency for the remainder of his term.
    

            It’s the first time a US president has dropped out of a reelection run in decades, recalling memories of President Lyndon Johnson deciding against seeking a second full term in 1968 – though Biden’s decision comes months later in the campaign than Johnson’s announcement. It’s also the latest shocking development in a highly charged political campaign that has included an attempt on Trump’s life.
    

            But not even the attempted assassination and its tumultuous effect on the race could pause the loss of support Biden was facing among congressional Democrats who became increasingly convinced that a wipeout in November would also drown their down-ballot contests as well.
    

            It sets the stage for the conclusion to a political career that has spanned a half-century, one that saw Biden enter as one of the youngest senators in US history and exit as its oldest president.
    

            Age and questions about the president’s mental faculties had been Biden’s biggest political liability since he first ran against Trump in 2020. Biden’s disastrous performance at a June 27 CNN debate – during which the president spoke softly, carried a glazed-over look and at one point appeared to lose his train of thought mid-sentence while his opponent delivered an animated, while mainly fact-free performance – brought those concerns to the forefront of the political conversation and ultimately doomed his reelection push.
    

            Biden’s campaign had asked for the June debate in the hopes that it would force voters to tune into the race – and what Biden has said is at stake if Trump regained the White House – earlier than usual. But that strategy appeared to backfire as the president solidified what had been the most persistent concern about his candidacy.
    

            The president’s performance shocked his donors, closest allies and the 50 million Americans who saw Biden stumble throughout the 90-minute debate, the most extensive exposure to an unscripted Biden since the last round of general-election debates four years ago. It left the White House and Biden campaign in a frenzied scramble to explain away his condition – at first, blaming it on a cold, before days later saying the president had been jet lagged by his international travel that wrapped up about 12 days prior to the debate.
    

            The president’s surrogates and campaign officials sought to soothe Democratic anxieties, hurriedly calling meetings with donors and top supporters to assure them that Biden’s performance was the product of one bad night and ask them to consider it in the context of his three-and-a-half-year presidency.
    

            The president himself recognized how poorly the night had gone almost immediately; at a campaign rally the next day, he sought to promote an animated and energized image that had largely been absent from the debate stage.
    

            “I don’t walk as easy as I used to,” Biden said. “I don’t speak as smoothly as I used to. I don’t debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. I know how to do this job. I know how to get things done.”
    

            But the damage had already been done.
    

            By the Monday after the debate, murmurs about replacing Biden on the ticket had grown into a full public conversation. The mood in the White House and at Biden’s campaign headquarters in Wilmington had turned sour. Biden, seeking to assert his control over his campaign and the presidency, delivered brief remarks that evening on the Supreme Court’s immunity decision earlier that day, asking voters to “dissent” in a rare political overture from the White House.
    

            The next day, Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas became the first member of Congress from Biden’s own party to ask him to drop out. The fractures in Biden’s support have grown steadily wider every day since. By the time Biden exited the race dozens of lawmakers had asked him to bow out.
    

            So had major donors. Actor George Clooney, who has known Biden for years and was one of Hollywood’s biggest boosters of the president, said in a July 10 New York Times opinion piece that Democrats “are not going to win in November with this president” and called for the party to pick a new nominee.
    

            Biden was initially defiant that he would remain in the race. But as the defections in his base of support continued, and leading Democrats in Congress continued to have difficult conversations with the president about his odds against Trump and the damaging effect he might have on down-ballot Democrats in competitive races, Biden opened himself up more to the idea of dropping out of the race.
    

            In an interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on July 5, Biden laughed off questions about his political future and said only the “Lord Almighty” could convince him to drop from the race.
    

            Days later, Stephanopoulos candidly told a passerby that he also didn’t think Biden could serve another four years.
    

            Biden told reporters at a NATO news conference he would drop out if polls showed he could not win. About a week later, he said he would reevaluate whether to stay in if he had “some medical condition that emerged” and doctors told him that would be an issue. The next day, the White House announced that Biden had Covid-19.
    

            The attempt on Trump’s life July 13 briefly stemmed the flow of congressional Democrats calling for Biden to drop out and pulled the national attention away from his faltering presidential campaign. But the reprieve didn’t last long. Rep. Adam Schiff on July 17 became the first House Democrat to call on Biden to step down since the assassination attempt and more followed in the ensuing days.
    

            Biden’s evolution on his future as the party’s nominee tracked closely with efforts among his biggest allies to convince him the path to victory was narrow. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Biden weeks after his debate that polls showed he could not win.
    

            A senior Democratic adviser told CNN the president was becoming “receptive” to conversations about him stepping aside: “He’s gone from saying, ‘Kamala can’t win,’ to ‘Do you think Kamala can win?”
    

This is a developing story and will be updated.

Biden drops out of presidential race and endorses Harris to be nominee


            Democrats now have an unprecedented challenge given the traditional primary season has long since ended.
    

            Biden on Sunday endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to be the Democrats’ nominee this fall, but he can’t automatically make her the candidate.
    

            As we first wrote back in February, individual delegates will now the party’s nominee on the convention floor (or, potentially, during a virtual roll call).
    

            These delegates aren’t just pledged to vote for Biden; they’re also approved by his campaign. So it will largely be Biden backers who will be picking his replacement.
    

            These delegates aren’t just pledged to vote for Biden; they’re also approved by his campaign. So while a majority of convention delegates could decide to pick a new nominee, doing so would require massive defections from the president’s own supporters. It also means that if Biden dropped out of the race, it would largely be Biden backers who would be responsible for picking his replacement.
    

            The president, in a post on X, endorsed Harris. But there would be other potential candidates who previously argued they could run a more effective campaign against Trump.
    

            Would someone like California Gov. Gavin Newsom – who offered unqualified support for Biden in the wake of Thursday’s debate – challenge Harris at the convention? Settling on a replacement could be divisive and ugly. It would be up to the delegates to decide, in a series of votes after frantic lobbying, who to pick.
    

            On the Democratic side, there is also another group to consider: the “superdelegates,” a group of about 700 senior party leaders and elected officials who are automatically delegates to the convention based on their position. Under normal party rules, they can’t vote on the first ballot if they could swing the nomination, but they’re free to vote on subsequent ballots. However, it isn’t exactly clear how those rules would be applied in the unprecedented event that Biden were to leave the race at this point.
    

            The number of superdelegates can also shift if one dies or resigns. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, the longtime Texas congresswoman, died July 19, reducing the number of superdelegates by one.
    

            It would take a drastic event for a candidate to leave the race in the few months between a party’s nominating convention in the summer and the general election in November.
    

            Democrats and Republicans have slightly different methods of dealing with this possibility. You can imagine the end result would probably be that the running mate stepped up to be on the general election ballot, but that is not necessarily guaranteed.
    

Democrats – The Democratic National Committee is empowered to fill a vacancy on the national ticket after the convention under party rules, after the party chair consults with Democratic governors and congressional leadership.
    

Republicans – If a vacancy occurs on the Republican side, the Republican National Committee can either reconvene the national convention or select a new candidate itself.
    

            An in-depth Congressional Research Service memo also notes that if an incumbent president becomes incapacitated after winning the party’s nomination, the 25th Amendment would elevate the vice president to the presidency, but party rules would determine who rises to become the party’s nominee.
    

            Neither party, according to the CRS, requires that the presidential candidate’s running mate be elevated to the top of the ticket, though that would obviously be the most likely scenario.
    

            In modern times, per the CRS, the Democrat running for vice president in 1972, Sen. Thomas Eagleton, was forced to step aside after the convention after it was discovered that he was treated for mental illness. (1972 was a very different time! Today, thankfully, there is not nearly the stigma attached to mental health.)
    

            The DNC actually needed to convene a meeting to affirm Sargent Shriver as Democratic nominee George McGovern’s second-choice running mate.
    

            If a president-elect was to die, timing is again important.
    

            Under the Constitution, it is electors meeting in state capitols who technically cast votes for the presidency. While some states require that they vote for the winner of the election in their state, in others they have leeway.
    

            The CRS memo, which cites several congressional hearings on the subject, suggests it would clearly make sense for a vice president-elect to simply assume the role of president-elect, but the law itself is murky.
    

            Under the 20th Amendment, if a president-elect dies, his or her running mate, the vice president-elect, becomes president.
    

            There could be some question, for instance, about when exactly a person becomes president-elect. Is it after the electors meet in December, or after Congress meets to count Electoral College votes on January 6?

CNN_30,Tadej Pogačar completes dominant Tour de France victory,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/sport/tadej-pogacar-tour-de-france-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-22 02:05:00,world,"
            A certain nonchalance has marked Tadej Pogačar’s ruthless overall victory at this year’s Tour de France, a race he has dominated from start to finish, accomplishing feats not achieved for more than a quarter of century.
    

            The 26-year-old became the first rider since Marco Pantani in 1998 to achieve the “double,” winning both the Tour de France and Giro d’Italia in the same year, an almost impossible feat in modern cycling  that seemed easy for Pogačar who still had the energy to muster a bow over the finish line when he took his fourth stage victory of the race on Friday or joke in post-race interviews.
    

            His fifth and sixth stage victories of the race followed on Saturday and Sunday, the biggest haul for any rider since 2009 and an enormous amount for a general classification rider like Pogačar. Not since 1948 has a rider won five mountain stages in a single edition of the race like Pogacar did this year.

            Eventually, he finished six minutes and 17 seconds ahead of his great rival Jonas Vingegaard in second place overall, having extended the margin by winning the time trial in the race’s final stage on Sunday in Nice.
    

            Their rivalry has shaped every edition of the Tour de France since 2021 when Denmark’s Vingegaard emerged as an unlikely challenger to a rampant Pogačar. The Slovenian won that year before Vingegaard took the next two editions, cracking his rival in the high mountains, and he lined up on the start line in Florence three weeks ago as the defending champion.
    

            But, this year, Pogačar, reemerged as the dominant rider on almost every terrain, dismantling Vingegaard who arrived at this race diminished, still recovering from a serious crash just three months ago in which he broke his collarbone as well as several ribs and suffered a collapsed lung.
    

            Like almost every other great sporting rivalry, theirs is one that pits two contrasting personalities against one another – the outgoing, flamboyant Pogačar itching to attack at any opportunity versus the more introverted, collected Vingegaard who marshals his efforts more strategically.
    

            Only young Remco Evenepoel, making his Tour de France debut, could remain within touching distance of these two, eventually finishing in third place, 9:18 behind Pogačar.
    

            He stood on the podium wearing the white jersey of the best young rider in the race, alongside Pogačar in the yellow jersey, Richard Carapaz in the polka-dot jersey worn by the race’s best climber and Biniam Girmay, who made history as the first Black African rider to win the green jersey as the leader of the points classification.

CNN_31,What to expect in Venezuela’s presidential election as strongman Maduro faces his biggest test yet,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/americas/venezuela-presidential-election-explainer-intl-latam/index.html,2024-07-22 03:32:00,world,"
            Millions of Venezuelans are expected to cast their ballots on Sunday, July 28, in what many see as the most consequential election in the country since strongman leader Nicolás Maduro came to power more than a decade ago.
    

            The vote pits the authoritarian Maduro – who has overseen unprecedented levels of poverty and emigration from the country – against Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia – a quiet, bird-loving grandfather who has built a strong following despite being the opposition’s third choice after its two preferred candidates were barred from running.
    

            But experts warn that the result of the vote may well be contested. Maduro has a habit for clinging to power, they point out: his government has long been accused of rigging votes and the 2018 election that returned Maduro to office was described as illegitimate by an alliance of 14 Latin American nations, Canada and the United States.
    

            Maduro, who took the mantle of the populist Chavismo movement after his predecessor Hugo Chavez’s death in 2013, is seeking his third consecutive six-year term in office. His last race was largely boycotted by the opposition. The Organization of American States called that vote a “farce,” noting that it was “held with a generalized lack of public freedoms, with outlawed candidates and parties and with electoral authorities lacking any credibility, subject to the executive power.”
    

            At campaign events this year – usually rollicking, dance-filled affairs – Maduro has framed his opponents as “fascist” and “manipulable,” claiming that they would privatize the country’s healthcare and oil industry and “give away our wealth.”
    

            Though under his watch, Venezuela has seen the rapid collapse of its democracy and nearly eight million of its people flee the country. Inflation has soared and food shortages spread as the country underwent “the single largest economic collapse for a non-conflict country in almost half a century,” as the International Monetary Fund put it.
    

            Gonzalez, a former diplomat, is standing for an opposition coalition known as the Democratic Unitary Platform. His priorities include taming inflation, currently running at 64% year on year, and restoring trust in the country’s institutions of power, like its judiciary, which is currently stacked with Maduro sympathizers. However, he has not given a roadmap on how he would convince an authoritarian government to voluntarily give up control and lead a democratic transition.
    

            In recent weeks, his rallies, alongside Maria Corina Machado, the charismatic leader of the opposition coalition who was banned from running for president earlier this year (along with her fellow leader Corina Yoris), have drawn staggering crowd sizes, including parts of the population long devoted to Chavismo. The pair have promised to build a country that can welcome home the millions of Venezuelans who have left in droves in recent years out of economic desperation.
    

            Several other candidates are also running, but they have minimal support and are viewed by the main opposition as government allies.
    

            According to Oswaldo Ramírez, the managing director of ORC Consultores, the opposition has found support in “nearly every corner of the country.”
    

            “The electoral energy is back in the streets of Venezuela,” he said. “Never in the years since this political era began has the opposition had a voting intention that favored it in such a broad way.”
    

            Twenty-five years after Chávez brought his socialist vision to the halls of power in Caracas, the election marks a rare opportunity for Venezuelans to remake the country – if Maduro is willing to relinquish control in a defeat. But analysts point to Maduro’s history of alleged election meddling in suggesting he is unlikely to go down quietly.
    

            “This could be the last best shot for Venezuela for a long time to restore democracy,” said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “The level of fraud that (the Maduro government) is going to necessitate is going to be so obvious to all that there’s no way they can move forward credibly with the election. They’re going to be caught with their hand in the cookie jar.”
    

            The ruling party has already been interfering with the election for months. In January, Machado was barred from holding public office for 15 years by the Maduro-controlled Supreme Court. The US said the decision flew in the face of a 2023 pledge the Venezuelan government had made to hold free and fair elections. Gonzalez was made the candidate after Machado’s designated replacement Yoris was similarly blocked from running.

            Maduro’s government has meanwhile claimed to have thwarted a string of dubious opposition-backed plots to sabotage public infrastructure and interfere with the election. Analysts see those as the seeds of a pretext that Maduro could use to postpone or cancel the election at the last minute.
    

            Experts warn Maduro could also move to provoke a military crisis with neighboring Guyana after he and his supporters scaled up their threats to annex an oil-rich piece of that country’s land.
    

            Some have speculated that Maduro could use the crisis as an excuse to suspend the election.
    

            Maduro’s government has also been accused of trying to sow confusion ahead of election day, including by renaming some 6,000 schools, places that typically serve as polling stations. The government has also created significant impediments for the Venezuelans who left the country to vote, including widely unattainable passport and residency requirements, election experts said.
    

            There are more than 21 million registered voters in Venezuela, including about 17 million people currently living in the country.
    

            A limited group of election observers, including a team from The Carter Center – a non-profit organization set up by former US President Jimmy Carter – will be on the ground to monitor the vote after Venezuelan authorities revoked an invitation in May for the European Union to send a delegation, citing the bloc’s sanctions on the country.
    

            But the options for the opposition and the international community are limited if Maduro refuses to cede power, Berg, of CSIS, said. “The opposition can get out in the streets, they can mobilize, they can demand certain things, but if the regime gets in and they have the firepower behind them to repress as we’ve seen in other instances under Maduro, it could get very ugly,” he said.

            If the opposition does clinch victory, a transition period of six months is likely to include an intense negotiation around amnesty for Maduro and members of his government, which analysts say he is certain to require ahead of any potential handover.
    

            Maduro currently faces drug trafficking and corruption charges in the US and is under investigation for crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court.
    

            Machado has indicated in recent months that the opposition has expressed willingness to the Venezuelan government to establish a “serious negotiation with guarantees” for Maduro and his allies – should Maduro and his ruling Socialist United Party of Venezuela step aside in the face of defeat.
    

            “We know the responsibility we have with history, and if there are feelings that animate this process, it is about reunification, coexistence, and justice, never about revenge and persecution,” Machado said earlier this month.

CNN_32,Harris could be the first Black woman and Asian American to lead a major party ticket,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/kamala-harris-biden-endorsement-democratic-nominee/index.html,2024-07-22 04:18:00,politics,"
            Vice President Kamala Harris has President Joe Biden’s support to become the next Democratic presidential nominee, a mantle that would make her the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead the ticket of a major political party.
    

            Harris said she was “honored” to receive Biden’s endorsement and intends to “earn and win” the nomination.
    

            “I am honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,” she said in a statement.
    

            The historic endorsement came after Biden announced Sunday that he is dropping out of the race following weeks of disarray within the Democratic Party. The president’s disastrous debate called into question his ability to win a second term and govern for another four years.
    

            “My fellow Democrats, I have decided not to accept the nomination and to focus all my energies on my duties as President for the remainder of my term. My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it’s been the best decision I’ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee,” Biden said.
    

            Despite the president’s backing, it remains unclear whether Harris will become the nominee, or what process the Democratic Party would take to select an alternative.
    

            Democratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison said in a statement that in the coming days the party will “undertake a transparent and orderly process to move forward as a united Democratic Party with a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in November.”
    

            Logistically, Harris is the natural heir to the ticket as Biden’s running mate. She would inherit the Biden campaign’s massive political operation and war chest. Recent polling has also shown her performing better against former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, than Biden and other potential Democratic contenders.
    

            Should there be efforts to pass over Harris in favor of Democrats seen as likely to run in 2028, there may be backlash from the vice president’s supporters and prominent Black Democrats. But Harris has also experienced something of a renaissance within her party, as Democrats showered her with praise in the days following the debate.
    

            Throughout her vice presidency, Harris has struggled to define herself while juggling an issue portfolio that has included difficult topics such as voting rights and stemming the tide of migrants coming from Central America. On the former, an effort to bolster the Voting Rights Act failed in Congress. On migration, Harris was criticized on the right for not spending enough time on the border and on the left for telling migrants in a speech, “Do not come.”
    

            As recently as last year, some Democrats were worried that negative views of Harris could hurt the ticket, prompting prominent Democrats to urge the party to stop undermining her.
    

            But in the weeks since Biden’s June debate performance, Harris has settled into a groove, becoming a key surrogate for Biden’s reelection campaign on reproductive health as the campaign put it, the threat Trump poses to democracy.
    

            Harris allies have argued that much of the criticism is a result of racism and sexism against the country’s first woman of color in such a position. Now, they say, the country is seeing in Harris what her allies have seen for years.
    

            “Oftentimes Black women are not seen until they’re needed,” said LaTosha Brown, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter, a progressive group that works to boost Black voter turnout. “We’ve seen her constantly berated, marginalized, questioned. I think that the shift is because there’s a need.”
    

            A growing number of Democratic officials and donors already have rallied behind Harris, including the Congressional Black Caucus PAC, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Democratic Senate candidates including Andy Kim of New Jersey, Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland and incumbent Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin.
    

            Even as Democrats waited for Biden to make his decision, Harris supporters were working behind the scenes for the last week to secure support from delegates -– not to push Biden out, but to be prepared in case he left the race.
    

            “We have been whipping delegates for the last week,” a senior Democratic strategist who worked on Harris’ 2020 campaign told CNN.
    

            Her network of backers includes a number of key Black female Democratic allies who have been quietly organizing for weeks to ensure that she would be well positioned to lead the ticket if Biden stepped aside. Those women will meet in a Zoom call Sunday evening.
    

            “The bottom line is, we are ready to go,” said Brown of Black Voters Matter. “We are grateful for President Biden’s service and that’s why we fought for him until the end. We are ecstatic that he has put his endorsement behind Vice President Kamala Harris. We expect the full Democratic apparatus to do the same and if they don’t, they will lose this election.”
    

            Harris allies are describing this moment as “uncharted territory” but are confident the party will be able to navigate the days ahead because Biden has endorsed her.
    

            For donors, Biden’s decision to exit the race and endorse Harris represents a seismic change for the Democratic party that many are embracing publicly.
    

            Dmitri Mehlhorn, a Democratic political strategist advising several big-money backers, released a statement Sunday following Biden’s withdrawal supporting Harris.
    

            “Kamala Harris is the American dream personified, daughter of immigrants who met at Cal,” Mehlhorn said. “She is also toughness personified, rising from my home town of Oakland California to become the top prosecutor of the state. With Scranton Joe stepping back, I cannot wait to help elect President Harris.”
    

            Other donors were less enthusiastic about the Harris pick. Top Biden donor John Morgan called the president’s endorsement of Harris a “f— you” to people who “pushed him out.”
    

            “Be careful what you wish for,” he wrote on X.
    

            Harris, the daughter of Berkeley political activists and immigrants from India and Jamaica, grew up in Oakland and spent much of her political career in California’s Bay Area. After earning her law degree from the University of California, Hastings College of Law, she became a deputy district attorney for Alameda County. She later served in the San Francisco district attorney and city attorney offices.
    

            In 2003, she was elected district attorney for San Francisco. Seven years later, she was elected California’s attorney general – the first woman, first Black person and first Asian American to hold the position.
    

            Harris’s record in law enforcement would later become both a boon and a burden to her political campaigns for Senate and the White House. Among her more controversial policies was a truancy program she advocated, which allowed parents to be charged with misdemeanors if their children missed too many school days. Harris later said she regretted the “unintended consequences” of the program.
    

            In 2016, Harris won her bid to succeed outgoing California Sen. Barbara Boxer, becoming the second Black woman to ever serve in the US Senate.
    

            As a senator, Harris was known for her prosecutorial questioning style during hearings with Trump administration officials and nominees, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
    

            Three years later, in January 2019, she entered the Democratic presidential primary. From the start, Harris acknowledged the historic nature of her campaign – she launched her bid on the federal holiday marking Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday and held a news conference at Howard University, the historically Black college she graduated from in 1986.
    

            Harris was one of more than a dozen Democrats, including Biden, who sought the 2020 party nomination. One of Biden’s worst debate moments of that cycle came when Harris blasted him over his opposition in the 1970s to court-ordered busing of students to desegregate schools. The dig from Harris, who was close friends with Biden’s son Beau before his death in 2015, came as a surprise to Biden and angered some his allies.
    

            After she dropped out, Harris became a prominent surrogate for Biden before being named his vice presidential pick in August 2020.
    

            “I’ve decided that Kamala Harris is the best person to help me take this fight to Trump and Mike Pence and then to lead this nation starting in January 2021,” Biden told supporters in an email.

CNN_33,Speaker Johnson calls on Biden to resign after the president announces he won’t seek reelection,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/mike-johnson-gop-calls-biden-resign/index.html,2024-07-22 05:54:00,politics,"
            House Speaker Mike Johnson called on President Joe Biden to resign “immediately” in the wake of Biden’s announcement that he will not seek reelection.
    

            “If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President. He must resign the office immediately,” Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, said in a statement Sunday afternoon.
    

Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him on Sunday, in a major and historic move that upends the presidential race.
    

            “Having invalidated the votes of more than 14 million Americans who selected Joe Biden to be the Democrat nominee for president, the self-proclaimed ‘party of democracy’ has proven exactly the opposite,” Johnson said.
    

            As speaker of the House, Johnson is second in the line of presidential succession behind Harris.
    

            The White House said that Biden is “looking forward to finishing his term” when asked about some congressional Republicans who are calling on Biden to step down from the presidency. Biden also said in his initial statement that he will complete his term.
    

            “President Biden inherited an economy in freefall, a skyrocketing violent crime rate, and alliances in tatters from his predecessor. He turned that around to deliver the strongest economic growth in the world and the lowest violent crime rate in nearly 50 years, while making NATO bigger than ever. He looks forward to finishing his term and delivering more historic results for the American people,” White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement to CNN.
    

            Bates continued: “That includes continuing to lower costs, create jobs, and protect Social Security while standing against the MAGAnomics agenda that would worsen inflation and drive us into recession. And he’ll keep fighting to protect Americans’ freedoms from radical abortion bans and attacks on the rule of law.”
    

            Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell in a statement similarly accused the Democratic Party of “trying to upend the expressed will of the American people in primary elections across the country.” In contrast, however, McConnell did not call on Biden to resign the presidency.
    

            While other Republican senators and members of Congress call for Biden to resign and accuse Democrats of disregarding their own primary results, GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska praised the president for his decision.
    

            “I respect President Biden’s decision to act in the best interest of the country by stepping aside in the 2024 presidential election,” she said.
    

            GOP Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina said that she plans to introduce a resolution on Monday that calls on Harris to invoke the 25th Amendment and assume Biden’s duties.
    

            “If Joe Biden does not have the cognitive ability to seek reelection, he does not have the cognitive ability to serve the remainder of his term,” she said.
    

            GOP Rep. Chip Roy introduced a similar amendment the day after the CNN Presidential Debate.

CNN_34,Harris will seek Democratic nomination and could be the first Black woman and Asian American to lead a major party ticket,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/kamala-harris-biden-endorsement-democratic-nominee/index.html,2024-07-22 05:45:00,politics,"
            Vice President Kamala Harris said she plans to seek the Democratic nomination after President Joe Biden stepped aside and endorsed her, setting up a push that could make her the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead the ticket of a major political party.
    

            “I am honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,” she said in a statement.
    

            Biden’s historic endorsement — and Harris’s pledge to unite the party behind her —came Sunday after he announced that he is dropping his reelection bid following weeks of disarray within the Democratic Party. The president’s disastrous debate called into question his ability to win a second term and govern for another four years.
    

            “My fellow Democrats, I have decided not to accept the nomination and to focus all my energies on my duties as President for the remainder of my term. My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it’s been the best decision I’ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee,” Biden said.
    

            Still, despite the president’s backing, it remains unclear if Harris will become the nominee, or what process the Democratic Party would take to select an alternative. It will now be up to the delegates to the party’s national convention to choose their candidate. While Harris allies have sought to secure her path to the nomination, some Democrats have stopped short of backing her or explicitly called for an open nomination process.
    

            Democratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison said in a statement that in the coming days the party will “undertake a transparent and orderly process to move forward as a united Democratic Party with a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in November.”
    

            Logistically, Harris is the natural heir to the ticket as Biden’s running mate.
    

            The Biden-Harris campaign on Sunday formally amended filings with the Federal Election Commission to rename its principal committee “Harris for President,” saying that the committee name is “different than previously reported.”
    

            The committee also filed a letter with the commission stating that “Vice President Harris is now a candidate for United States President in the 2024 election and will henceforth be conducting campaign activities only in pursuit of that office.”
    

            Control of the campaign war chest, however – totaling $95.9 million at the end of June – depends on whether Harris remains on Democrats’ 2024 ticket.
    

            Recent polling has also shown her performing better against former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, than Biden and other potential Democratic contenders.
    

            Should there be efforts to pass over Harris in favor of Democrats seen as likely to run in 2028, there may be backlash from the vice president’s supporters and prominent Black Democrats. But Harris has also experienced something of a renaissance within her party, as Democrats showered her with praise in the days following the debate.
    

            Throughout her vice presidency, Harris has struggled to define herself while juggling an issue portfolio that has included difficult topics such as voting rights and stemming the tide of migrants coming from Central America. On the former, an effort to bolster the Voting Rights Act failed in Congress. On migration, Harris was criticized on the right for not spending enough time on the border and on the left for telling migrants in a speech, “Do not come.”
    

            As recently as last year, some Democrats were worried that negative views of Harris could hurt the ticket, prompting prominent Democrats to urge the party to stop undermining her.
    

            But in the weeks since Biden’s June debate performance, Harris has settled into a groove, becoming a key surrogate for Biden’s reelection campaign on reproductive health as the campaign put it, the threat Trump poses to democracy.
    

            Harris allies have argued that much of the criticism is a result of racism and sexism against the country’s first woman of color in such a position. Now, they say, the country is seeing in Harris what her allies have seen for years.
    

            “Oftentimes Black women are not seen until they’re needed,” said LaTosha Brown, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter, a progressive group that works to boost Black voter turnout. “We’ve seen her constantly berated, marginalized, questioned. I think that the shift is because there’s a need.”
    

            A growing number of Democratic officials and donors already have rallied behind Harris, including the Congressional Black Caucus PAC, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Democratic Senate candidates including Andy Kim of New Jersey, Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland and incumbent Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin.

            Age had been President Joe Biden’s biggest political weakness ever since he launched his first campaign against former President Donald Trump five years ago. But his faltering debate performance on June 27 shocked many Americans in what was their most extensive exposure to the president since the last round of debates in 2020.
    

            Here are the key events that have shaped one of the most crucial months in Biden’s career — and would eventually sunset his half-century life in politics:

CNN_36,"More than 1,500 US flights canceled for the third day straight as airlines slowly recover from global tech outage",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/us/tech-outage-flight-cancellations-united-delta-airlines/index.html,2024-07-22 05:57:00,us,"
            More than 1,500 US flights have been canceled for the third day straight, as airlines struggle to recover from a global tech outage that left thousands of passengers stranded at airports.
    

            Around 1,500 flights into, within or out of the United States were canceled by Sunday evening, while more than 7,400 US flights were delayed, according to the tracking website FlightAware.com.
    

            More than 600 of those cancelations were from Delta Air Lines, the website shows.
    

            The airline is continuing its recovery efforts following “an outside vendor technology issue” resulting in delays and cancelations, Delta said Sunday. The airline is communicating directly with some impacted customers, offering travel vouchers, waivers and SkyMiles Program miles, it said.
    

            On Saturday, 2,136 US flights were canceled, and more than 21,300 flights were delayed, according to FlightAware.

A global tech outage brought many computer systems and businesses to a screeching halt. Here’s what happened


            The issue extended beyond airports, with businesses, government agencies, health and emergency services, banks, schools and universities around the world grinding to a halt or seeing services disrupted due to a flawed software update for Microsoft Windows operating systems issued by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, experts told CNN.
    

            The outage affected an estimated 8.5 million Windows devices, according to Microsoft.
    

            CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz apologized to customers and said a fix has been deployed, but experts say getting systems back in order will be a lengthy process.
    

            Major airlines have said services are being restored, but there could be more delays and disruptions.
    

            A majority of United Airlines systems have recovered from Friday’s outage, though some delays and cancellations are still possible, the airline said in a statement. More than 400 United flights were canceled Saturday, and over 200 flights were canceled Sunday, according to FlightAware.com.
    

            Delta has paused unaccompanied minor travel until Wednesday due to the outage, the airline announced over the weekend. Unaccompanied children who are already booked on a Delta flight will not be able to travel, and the airline has asked that no new flights be booked for them.
    

            Also impacted was American Airlines, which said in a statement  Friday “we were able to safely reestablish our operation” and it had “issued a travel waiver for our customers impacted by the vendor technology issue earlier this morning.” Allegiant Air said in a statement Saturday while “normal operations have resumed” after the outage, they’re processing a backlog of customer messages and troubleshooting their programs and platforms.
    

            Even with the flawed computer update rolled back, it’s not a quick fix for airlines, which have computers at thousands of gates that will need to be individually manually rebooted, David Kennedy, cofounder of cybersecurity company Binary Defense, told CNN on Saturday.
    

            “It’s not just as simple as rebooting. There’s a lot more steps and complexities in this that are involved,” Kennedy said. “There’s just not enough people at those airports, at those locations to go and do it.”
    

            The US Department of Transportation on Friday said it determined the flight delays and cancelations resulting from the system outage were “controllable,” meaning they’re “attributable to the airline.” In such cases, the airlines “must adhere to their customer service commitments.”
    

            Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in a social media post Saturday said he received reports of some airlines only offering flight credits to passengers for canceled flights.
    

            “Let me be clear — you are entitled to get your money back promptly if your flight is canceled and you don’t take a rebooking,” Buttigieg said.
    

            Flight cancelations persist at the world’s busiest airport, Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, where officials have implemented a “concessions crisis plan, ensuring concessions availability while all flights are operating.”
    

            “We’ve provided assistance and guidance to passengers spending the night in the airport, and we’re collaborating with our airlines to create space for luggage reunification areas,” an airport spokesperson told CNN on Sunday.
    

            “It just seems like nobody cares about us. We’re sleeping on the floor. There’s kids sleeping on the floor and no one’s done anything about it,” traveler Anthony Augugliaro told CNN affiliate WSB on Sunday.
    

            Long lines of passengers also waited for assistance at the airport Saturday. Delta passenger Catalina Villareal described the scene: “Mayhem. Chaos. Frustration. Hunger.”
    

            Villareal said she had experienced three flights cancellations.

            Charlotte Yeh, a traveler at Boston Logan International Airport, told CNN affiliate WFXT Saturday she received no notification her flight to Fort Lauderdale for her father’s 96th birthday was canceled.
    

            Thousands of people face the same uncertainty as they cram together in airports across the country, waiting for answers.
    

            “I was supposed to be in California for my mom’s wedding,” Richard Whitfield of Pasco County, Florida, told CNN on Saturday. Whitfield and his partner, Jonathan Shade, left Tampa on Thursday and missed their connecting flight in Atlanta due to poor weather conditions, delaying their landing and forcing the plane to refuel in Tallahassee.
    

            After their rescheduled flight on Friday was delayed many times, the couple decided to cancel the trip and just head home. But with no available flights back to Tampa on Friday night, they spent their second night in an airport hotel. They were unable to get a voucher from Delta for either of their stays.
    

            “(Richard has) been on hold for 24 hours,” Shade told CNN. “When he eventually got his number in line, it was 2,001.”
    

            Two hours later, Richard’s place in Delta Air Lines’ virtual customer service queue was 2,300 in line, Shade said.
    

            Whitfield told CNN the whole ordeal has had an impact on him.
    

            “For me, it’s been the domino effect that it has on humanity and everything that we need to survive: food, sleep, or water, housing,” he said.
    

            After spending 48 hours in Atlanta, they found a Saturday evening flight back to Tampa they say they can only hope is not delayed or canceled. For now, there is nothing the couple can do but wait and “get a good stiff drink,” Shade and Whitfield said.

            Incoming Utah State cornerback Andre Seldon Jr. died Saturday in an apparent cliff-diving accident at a reservoir about 20 miles from the school’s campus, the university said in a statement.


            Deputies were called to the Porcupine Reservoir at around 2:20 p.m. MT following reports that a man dove from the cliffs into the water and didn’t resurface, the Cache County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release.
    

            Search and rescue teams with divers then began searching for the man, the agency’s release said, and his body was found in the reservoir at 9:05 p.m. by the Utah Department of Public Safety dive team.
    

            “Our initial investigation leads us to believe this is a tragic accident as multiple witnesses recount the same information,” the sheriff’s office said.

            The university identified the victim as Seldon, 22, who was joining the football team this year after two seasons at New Mexico State University and two at the University of Michigan.
    

            “Our football program is heartbroken to have to endure the loss of one of our own,” said Utah State interim Head Coach Nate Dreiling, who had joined the program after serving as New Mexico State’s defensive coordinator for two seasons.
    

            Seldon, who played all 15 New Mexico State games in 2023, transferred into the football program over the summer and was set to start classes this fall, according to the university.
    

            “Having had a previous relationship with Andre during our time together at New Mexico State, I can tell you he was an incredible person and teammate,” Dreiling said. “Our condolences and prayers go out to Andre’s family as we grieve with them over this tremendous loss.”
    

            Seldon is survived by his parents, Danielle Smith and Andre Seldon Sr.
    

            “Utah State is working to ensure both Athletics staff and student-athletes have emotional and mental support as they process and grieve,” university officials said.

CNN_38,Kamala Harris formally takes over Biden-Harris campaign account – she’s the only one who could,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/fec-biden-harris-campaign-account/index.html,2024-07-22 06:50:00,politics,"
            The Biden-Harris campaign on Sunday formally amended filings with the Federal Election Commission to rename its principal committee and declare Kamala Harris a candidate for president.
    

            The move means that should she remain on the ticket for the general election, according to the Campaign Legal Center, Harris could assume control of the Biden-Harris campaign account, which had nearly $96 million cash in hand at the end of June.

Biden drops out of presidential race and endorses Harris to be nominee


            “Specifically, because Biden and Harris share a campaign committee, the Vice President and her running mate can continue using the campaign’s existing funds for the general election if she is on the Democratic ticket as either the presidential or vice-presidential nominee,” Trevor Potter, founder and president of Campaign Legal Center, said in a statement.
    

            Just hours after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race, the campaign committee filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission, which noted that the “committee name is different than previously reported,” re-designating the committee as “Harris for President.”
    

            The committee also filed a letter with the commission stating that “Vice President Harris is now a candidate for United States President in the 2024 election and will henceforth be conducting campaign activities only in pursuit of that office.”
    

            The ability to change the FEC filing was one reason why many political observers felt Harris would be practical replacement for Biden since her name was already on the campaign account.
    

            Both a longtime conservative election law expert at the Heritage Foundation, Hans von Spakovsky, and Federal Election Commissioner Dara Lindenbaum have publicly said Harris could access what Biden raised through his principal campaign committee, because it is registered for both the president and vice president.
    

            Lindenbaum, a Democrat seen as a swing vote on the often-deadlocked commission, wrote on X, “If Kamala Harris becomes the Democratic Party nominee, she gets access to the Joe Biden campaign funds.”
    

            A different general election Democratic presidential nominee than Harris wouldn’t be able to access that cash as easily, von Spakovsky wrote on Fox News. He added that there’s no requirement that any donations be returned, although the campaign could always choose to do so.
    

            But in this unprecedented time, there’s no guarantee there won’t be questions over the money that was raised for the general election account since Biden will no longer be at the top of the ticket.

            For instance, Sean Cooksey, the current FEC chairman, who is a Republican appointee, wrote in an X post that a campaign finance regulation says that donations may need to be returned or refunded to donors, but did not elaborate or address the issue of Harris already being on the campaign account.
    

            “It is going to be a challenge,” Craig Engle, a former lawyer for an FEC commissioner who represents Republican candidates and Democratic groups in the 2024 election cycle, said on Sunday. “A campaign cannot keep money for an election the candidate isn’t running in.” Engle said there’s a “gray area” on whether Biden could send money back to his general election donors and encourage them to give it immediately back to Harris.
    

            It’s possible the Biden campaign will need to ask the Federal Election Commission for guidance, in the form of an advisory opinion, in the coming weeks, Engle added.
    

            Another option would be for Biden to transfer the campaign account’s balance to the Democratic National Committee or to a super PAC. That could allow Harris to start a new campaign account, revisit donors who had already maxed out contributions to the Biden-Harris campaign and hit them up again, one election attorney said.
    

            Derek Muller, an election law professor at the University of Notre Dame, said campaigns are often well ahead spending money before the FEC or courts decide what’s allowed, pushing the final answers until after Election Day.
    

            “I think there’s going there’s going to be litigation about it,” Muller told CNN. “I think the general consensus view is, because Harris’s name is already on the paperwork, she can accept it for the general election. [But] it’s not the universal view.”
    

            The FEC hasn’t responded to a request for comment from CNN.

CNN_39,Inside Biden’s unprecedented exit from the presidential race,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/inside-bidens-exit-from-2024-race/index.html,2024-07-22 06:20:00,politics,"
            In the end, President Joe Biden exited the political stage in isolation.
    

            After weeks of fighting for his political life – insisting he wasn’t going anywhere following a disastrous debate performance – the president’s about-face did not come in an Oval Office address or a speech on the campaign trail. Instead, it came in letter posted to social media as he recovered from Covid-19 at his beach house in Delaware.
    

            It was a low-key way to reveal one of the most historic decisions in modern American politics, but time was not on Biden’s side to reach a decision or make an announcement. Never before has a president left a reelection race this close to Election Day – and for 24 days it seemed as if he were stubbornly planning to ride out the storm that followed the June 27 CNN debate in Atlanta.
    

            He spent the three weeks after the debate repeating that he was staying in the race against former President Donald Trump. The president dug in. He insisted he could beat Trump. His inner circle shrank to his closest aides and family. He was forced to retreat to Delaware, where he reached a decision in the last day-and-a-half, finally conceding that a man loyal to the Democratic Party for more than a half-century was seen as a drag on the ticket.

The 25 days that unraveled Biden’s campaign


            But in the end, the pressure on Biden from party leaders, rank-and-file lawmakers and donors – and the polling showing the perilous and potentially insurmountable path Biden faced amid a growing deficit with Trump – ultimately proved too much. Described as being more isolated than he had ever been, Biden could not withstand the push behind the scenes and in public. The blunt reality became a chorus of voices calling for the president to exit the race, like a boulder rolling down a mountain that only picked up momentum with each passing day.
    

            The president’s team wanted the June CNN debate with Trump – months earlier than typical presidential debates – to shake up a race that Biden was trailing. They succeeded, but not in the way they had intended.
    

            Instead, Biden’s campaign unraveled over the course of the next 24 days. Everything the president and his team tried to do to calm Democrats’ fears simply failed to shed the perception that Biden’s age was too advanced, and his health too fragile, for him to stay in the race.
    

            With two posts on X Sunday afternoon, Biden bowed out of the race and threw his support behind his vice president, Kamala Harris, in the hopes of quickly coalescing their party and moving past the chaos that had engulfed Democrats since the debate.
    

            It’s a high-risk, high-reward gamble for Democrats, resetting a campaign Biden was losing with a new nominee just 107 days before the election. It comes as Trump is at his strongest point in the campaign, coming out of a completely unified Republican National Convention with a base rallying around him after the attempt on his life.
    

            Biden’s final decision to leave the race was reached in the last 48 hours, a senior campaign adviser said, as he consulted family and top advisers by telephone while recovering from Covid. A source familiar with the matter said the plans to exit the race began Saturday night and were finalized on Sunday.
    

            The adviser said the president “was not dug in” but was studying all of the data coming in and became convinced he would “weigh down” the ticket and be a distraction and complication to defeat Trump.
    

            Biden asked two of his closest advisers to start the process of drafting the letter and setting the announcement in motion Saturday night, according to another person familiar with the matter.
    

            The president worked with his longtime close adviser and message chief Mike Donilon to draft the letter, the person said. Steve Ricchetti, another longtime adviser dating to his time as vice president, was charged with organizing the mechanics of the announcement.
    

            Still recovering from a Covid diagnosis, Biden remained at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, all weekend with his wife, first lady Dr. Jill Biden. He has spoken to all of his family since making his decision to drop out of the race, and his daughter Ashley and son-in-law Howard drove to Rehoboth earlier Sunday, according to a source.
    

            But Biden consulted only a very small number of close aides on the decision. Some members of his inner circle were left in the dark until minutes before he posted his announcement on social media, including one of his closest communications advisers, Anita Dunn.
    

            Multiple sources told CNN that Dunn and a small group of senior aides became aware of Biden’s announcement in the minutes before the post. Many rank-and-file staff found out when the post came out. Dunn and her husband, Bob Bauer, were among Biden’s debate prep team and had faced the ire of the president’s family in the aftermath of the debate.
    

            Biden and Harris spoke multiple times Sunday ahead of his announcement, according to a source familiar with the matter. But even his vice president and pick to succeed him, didn’t find out until the day he announced his decision.
    

            In the end, Biden was confronting an untenable path forward: More than three dozen Democrats had publicly called for him to exit the race. Party leaders had told him he couldn’t win. And the money was drying up from donors who said they felt betrayed by the lack of disclosure around the condition of Biden’s health.
    

            “I don’t know one big donor who is going to write a check for $100,000 or more. And I know a lot of those guys,” one major Democratic donor told CNN before Biden dropped out.
    

            Biden and his team tried to play off the debate performance as a “bad night.” He and his aides blamed the president’s overseas trip. He said he would debate again and do better. And he returned immediately to the campaign trail, traveling to North Carolina the following day and delivering an energetic speech while acknowledging his debate shortcomings.
    

            “I know I’m not a young man. I don’t walk as easy as I used to. I don’t speak as smoothly as I used to. I don’t debate as well as I used to, but I know what I do know. I know how to tell the truth,” Biden said.
    

            Biden huddled with his family at Camp David the weekend after the debate for a previously scheduled get-together, during which they encouraged him to stay in the race.
    

            But in Democratic circles, panic had already set in. The issue problem was plain as day: Biden’s biggest problem with voters was they didn’t feel he was up to the job for the next four years. The debate had confirmed their fears and brought Biden’s biggest political weakness to the forefront. No policy or statement or criticism of Trump could change that.
    

            Even as Biden insisted there was nothing that could convince him to get out of the race, Democrats began laying the groundwork and keeping the door open to a change. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi went on MSNBC, saying: “I think it’s a legitimate question to say, is this an episode, or is this a condition?”
    

            Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas was the first elected Democrat to call for Biden to withdraw on July 2. The following day, Biden met with a group of Democratic governors, telling them he needed more sleep and should stop scheduling events after 8 p.m.
    

            On July 5, Biden sat down for an interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos, in an attempt to demonstrate he was able to keep campaigning. In the interview, Biden said that only the “Lord Almighty” could convince him to leave the race, a comment that angered many Democrats.
    

            It was the first of several attempts from Biden’s team to put the president in the public eye and quell the growing discontent. All failed to do so.
    

            After July 4, Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, quietly tried to gather a group of Democrats who would hold a meeting with Biden, potentially urging him to exit the race. The idea died, however, when the effort leaked.
    

            House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries held a call with House Democrats over that weekend, during which several lawmakers said that Biden needed to step aside.
    

            On July 8, Biden fired off defiant a letter to congressional Democrats saying he would continue his reelection bid. “I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump,” he wrote.
    

            The calls for Biden to leave soon started coming from outside Washington. On July 10, George Clooney, penned a New York Times op-ed calling for Biden to step aside. Even more devastating for the president, Clooney said the Biden he saw at a June fundraiser was the same Biden the world saw at the June debate and that the president had declined since taking the Oval Office.
    

            Pelosi also continued to raise questions about Biden, declining to endorse him in an MSNBC interview the same day as Clooney’s op-ed. “It’s up to the president to decide if he’s going to run,” she said, even if that was a decision Biden had already seemed to have made.
    

            Several news outlets, including CNN, reported that Pelosi and former President Barack Obama had privately expressed concerns about the future of Biden’s campaign.
    

            On July 11, Biden held a solo news conference on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Washington. He opened the door a bit further to the possibility he could drop out, saying he would consider doing so if data showed he cannot win.
    

            Biden also made several small verbal slip ups, including calling Harris “Vice President Trump.” Earlier in the day, he had referred Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as “President Putin,” before correcting himself.
    

            After Biden’s news conference, a handful more congressional Democrats called for him to drop out, growing the number to 15. The list included Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, who said he deliberately waited until after the NATO meeting.
    

            That weekend, Biden met and held calls with various Democratic caucuses, including the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the moderate New Democrat Coalition. The call with moderate Democrats was tense, as Biden got into it with Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat who bluntly told him that voters are concerned about his vigor and strength, especially as it is perceived on the world stage.
    

            The president responded to Crow — an Army Ranger who served two tours in Afghanistan and one in Iraq — that he knows Crow is a Bronze Star recipient like his late son Beau, but that “he didn’t rebuild NATO.”
    

            At one point, Biden told Crow “I don’t want to hear that crap” in addressing the lawmaker’s concerns.
    

            More Democrats had been expected to publicly call for Biden’s exit that weekend, but the chatter came to a halt in an instant when an attempted assassin’s bullet came within millimeters of killing Trump at his Butler, Pennsylvania, rally.
    

            The assassination attempt turned the political world on its head, draining the public focus on Biden’s ability to govern for a second term and turning it squarely onto the bullet that grazed Trump’s ear, raising a flurry of questions about how a gunman was able to shoot at the Republican nominee for president five days before he was to accept the nomination.
    

            The pause would not last.
    

            Behind the scenes, Democratic pollsters circulated memos showing Biden was on track to lose the election, and – importantly to congressional Democrats – damage candidates in ballot races, too. Some polling showed other Democrats outpacing Biden in battleground states.
    

            “Lose everything,” was how one Democrat described a polling memo Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg had sent to Biden’s inner circle.
    

            The dam reopened on Wednesday when California Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic Senate candidate and leader of Trump’s first impeachment, became the first lawmaker to join the public calls for Biden to withdraw from the campaign after the assassination attempt.
    

            Schiff’s place in the party – as a potential soon-to-be senator and close ally to Pelosi – made his voice among the most significant to that point.
    

            “While the choice to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden’s alone, I believe it is time for him to pass the torch,” Schiff said in a statement.
    

            More voices soon followed. And arguably more importantly, the private pleas for Biden to leave the race became part of a public cacophony of voices urging his withdrawal.
    

            Rep. Jamie Raskin, the Maryland House Democrat who led Trump’s second impeachment, confirmed that he had written a letter to Biden on July 6 encouraging the president that there was “no shame in taking a well-deserved bow” out of the 2024 presidential election – and making his argument with comparisons to George Washington and Red Sox pitching great Pedro Martinez.
    

            CNN reported Wednesday that Pelosi privately told Biden that polling showed he could not defeat Trump and that he could destroy Democrats’ chances of winning the House in November. Biden pushed back, saying he had seen polls indicating he could win. At one point, Pelosi asked Donilon, Biden’s longtime adviser, to get on the line to talk over the data.
    

            That same day, ABC News reported that Schumer told Biden in their Saturday meeting that it would be best if he bowed out of the presidential race. And a person briefed on the meeting between Biden and Jeffries said that the Democratic House leader stopped short of calling on him to step aside — instead pinning the suggestion on his members.
    

            The White House and congressional officers tried to tamp down the reports, issuing statements of denial. But the stories about the party leaders delivering Biden a message had their effect. On Friday, a dozen new Democrats released statements saying Biden should exit the race.
    

            Among them: Another close Pelosi ally, Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California. A source with direct knowledge described Biden on Friday as “seething” at Pelosi, a sentiment that only grew in light of Lofgren’s letter.
    

            The public statements from Democrats illustrated one element of Biden’s challenge to stay in the race – but just as important were the defections from his donors that would have dried up fundraising in the home stretch of the campaign.
    

            Major Democratic donors were skeptical of Biden’s viability, and multiple said their concerns had received an icy reception from Biden campaign officials.
    

            “How do you think we feel?” a Democratic donor close to the Democratic National Committee and the White House told CNN before Biden dropped out, explaining the mood among donors. “We all feel betrayed that they were not honest with us about his health.”
    

            Two sources told CNN on Thursday that furious donors were also telling House and Senate Democratic campaign committees they would freeze contributions unless and until party leaders took stronger steps to get Biden to step aside.
    

            “Yes, that card has been played,” a senior House Democrat told CNN Thursday night.
    

            “They believe if Joe is at the top of the ticket, the House and Senate are gone, too,” said a Democratic strategist intimately involved in big-dollar fundraising. “They don’t want to throw good money after bad.”
    

            Moments after Biden’s announcement, donors abruptly began reaching out to advisers, pouring in money, according to sources involved in the discussions. In the leadup to Biden’s decision to exit the 2024 race, multiple donors had reached out to Harris’ team proactively to signal they would be willing to support her if she ran at the top of the ticket, according to three people familiar with the discussions.
    

            Up until the moment he dropped out, Biden and his team insisted he was staying in.
    

            Biden’s team created a public schedule for the president over the past week that was intended to show his ability to stay in the race.
    

            On Monday, he held another television interview with NBC News’ Lester Holt, where he acknowledged his sub-par debate performance while criticizing the media for focusing on his gaffes instead of Trump’s falsehoods. Biden again said he had no intention of stepping aside.
    

            Biden then traveled to Las Vegas for campaign stops, speeches planned at the NAACP National Convention and the UnidosUS annual conference, and interviews with BET and Univision. Biden told BET News’ Ed Gordon that the only thing that would push him to reconsider his reelection bid would be a “medical condition.”
    

            The president spoke at the NAACP conference, but before he could make his speech Wednesday at UnidosUS, he was dealt another blow: the positive Covid-19 diagnosis.
    

            The president returned to his Rehoboth Beach home that day to isolate, his public schedule shuttered indefinitely while he recovered.
    

            On Friday, Biden issued a statement Friday that he would be back on the campaign trail the following week, while Biden campaign chair Jen O’Malley went on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” Friday morning to say Biden was “absolutely” staying in the race.
    

            The campaign also put out a memo saying there was “no plan for an alternative nominee.”
    

            Even on Sunday, Biden’s team continued to publicly maintain he wasn’t going anywhere. South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, a key Biden ally, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” that Biden and Harris “have received over 14 million votes to be our standard bearers. That’s where we are,” Clyburn. The congressman’s 2020 endorsement of Biden ahead of the South Carolina primary was widely seen as instrumental in Biden’s victory.
    

            Biden spoke to Harris on Sunday before announcing his decision, which came in two messages: The first saying he was dropping out, and the second endorsing his vice president to be the Democratic nominee.
    

            Biden told his senior-most team he was getting out around 1:45 p.m., and the public letter went out right around then, a source familiar with the timing told CNN.
    

            “Before that, it was all steam ahead that he’s running,” the same source said.

CNN_40,There is no historical precedent for Biden dropping out now,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/06/politics/joe-biden-drop-out-precedent-what-matters/index.html,2024-07-22 06:21:00,politics,"
            It is not unprecedented for an incumbent president to abandon his reelection campaign. But it is rare, and no president until President Joe Biden has been pressured out of a reelection campaign out of concerns about his mental fitness.
    

            One warning bell for Democrats who assume that a nominee younger than Biden – he has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris –  would do better against former President Donald Trump: Republicans won the two most recent elections in which presidents eligible for reelection bowed out of their campaigns.
    

            Democrats Harry S. Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson were succeeded by Republicans. A more immediate problem for Democrats is that Biden’s departure is the latest such decision in history.
    

            Comparisons between Biden and any of these presidents are not perfect. Neither Truman nor Johnson faced serious questions about their ability to do the job. Biden does.
    

            Both Johnson and Truman, like Biden, were former lawmakers and former vice presidents. Unlike Biden, both had assumed the presidency after a death or assassination. Both Johnson and Truman then won the White House in their own right.
    

            But both Johnson and Truman faced competition for their party’s nomination in 1952 and 1968 respectively. Both were embarrassed by a subpar showing in the New Hampshire primary, and both announced in the spring that they would not seek reelection.
    

            Truman made the announcement that he would not be running during a speech in Washington that was broadcast nationwide, while Johnson made his announcement in a televised address from the White House.
    

            Biden was never under any real pressure from Democrats to stand down earlier this year, and he faced only token opposition for the Democratic nomination. Nearly all of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention are pledged to him. In other words, Truman and Johnson both avoided a bruising primary by ending their reelection campaigns. Biden had the Democratic nomination sewn up, and he chose to give it up.
    

            Republicans, with help from their war hero nominee Dwight Eisenhower, won the White House, the Senate and the House in 1952, when Truman decided not to run again. Johnson’s decision not to run created a scramble for the Democratic nomination. Ultimately, Vice President Hubert Humphrey won the honor at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Humphrey would go on to lose the White House to Richard Nixon, but Democrats kept control of the House and the Senate.
    

            Theodore Roosevelt and Calvin Coolidge were Republicans who assumed the presidency after an assassination or death, and both chose to leave the presidency after serving one full term and most of another.
    

            Roosevelt later regretted his pledge not to run again in 1908. He left office extremely popular and well respected and handed the White House off to his hand-picked successor, fellow Republican William Howard Taft. But Roosevelt was so aggravated by Taft’s performance and the direction of the GOP that he challenged Taft for the Republican nomination in the next presidential election.﻿ When Roosevelt could not get the nomination at the GOP convention, he ran as a third-party Progressive, or Bull Moose, candidate and beat Taft at the ballot box, although both lost to Democrat Woodrow Wilson.
    

            Coolidge assumed the presidency when Warren G. Harding died of a heart attack in San Francisco. Coolidge then won the White House on his own. Never happy as president, he suffered loss during his time in office when his son died tragically after playing tennis at the White House. Coolidge also handed the presidency off to a fellow Republican, Herbert Hoover.
    

            Coolidge disclosed his decision not to run on handwritten strips of paper given to reporters during his summer vacation the year before the election. The curt statement – “I do not choose to run for President in 1928” – caught everyone by surprise.
    

            Despite an active and successful presidency, James K. Polk’s Democrats lost the White House after he stepped aside from the 1848 election. The Whig Party ran a war hero, Zachary Taylor, and former President Martin Van Buren ran as a third-party candidate. Taylor won, taking the White House from the Democrats.
    

            James Buchanan promised in his inaugural address in 1857 that he would not run again. He said:
    

        Having determined not to become a candidate for reelection, I shall have no motive to influence my conduct in administering the government, except the desire ably and faithfully to serve my country and to live in grateful memory of my countrymen.
    

            Buchanan, who was in office when Southern states protested Abraham Lincoln’s 1860 election victory by seceding, does not live in grateful memory of many historians. He’s viewed as one of the worst American presidents.
    

            Democrats lost control of the White House and the Senate in 1860, and Lincoln became the first Republican president.
    

            Rutherford B. Hayes, a Republican, promised to serve one term and did so after the disputed 1876 presidential election, by which a compromise handed Hayes the White House but also essentially ended Reconstruction.
    

            Reforming the civil service was a major issue of the day, and it played into Hayes’ decision, according to his letter accepting the Republican nomination in 1876.
    

        … believing that the restoration of the civil service, to the system established by Washington and followed by the early Presidents, can best be accomplished by an Executive who is under no temptation to use the patronage of his office, to promote his own re-election, I desire to perform what I regard as a duty, in stating now my inflexible purpose, if elected, not to be a candidate for election to a second term.
    



            Republicans picked James Garfield at their 1880 convention to succeed Hayes, and Garfield not only won the White House but his party gained control of both the House and the Senate.

CNN_41,The delegates will decide the next Democratic nominee as a groundswell forms for Harris,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/delegates-democratic-ticket-harris/index.html,2024-07-22 07:54:00,politics,"
Joe Biden is out and – despite his quick endorsement of Kamala Harris – the fate of the Democratic Party’s presidential ticket is not for him to decide.
    

            The president on Sunday backed Harris to replace him as his successor, but his preference is just that – a preference. The makeup of ticket now rests with the roughly 4,700 delegates who will, in the coming weeks, vote for a new standard-bearer.
    

            Interviews with more than two dozen delegates in the immediate aftermath of Biden’s announcement suggest the vice president is the clear leader. Delegates pledged to Biden are under no obligation to support his choice, but their loyalty to him and his wishes suggests the lion’s share will quickly fall in line behind Harris. Many already have; some are now contacting other delegates, with no input yet from Harris’ campaign, to shore up her support.
    

            “Every one of us (delegates) were vetted and worked for Biden or the Biden campaign in some way, whether we volunteered or donated or something. These are all Biden people,” said Joe Caiazzo, a Biden delegate from Massachusetts who praised the president’s “selfless, patriotic” decision.
    

            What follows is less than certain – and unprecedented in modern political history.
    

            Current party rules were largely designed to pass the nominating process off to primary voters and ahead of an orderly, made-for-TV roll call vote to confirm their choice. But that pro forma process is not set in stone. The Democratic National Committee will likely need to do more work, either through interpretation of their existing rules or by passing new ones, to clarify the next steps.
    

            “In short order, the American people will hear from the Democratic Party on next steps and the path forward for the nomination process,” DNC Chair Jaime Harrison said on Sunday.
    

            Even before Biden’s bolt landed, Democrats were at odds over when and how the nominating vote would take place.
    

            Under a proposed plan outlined Friday to the convention rules committee, it would be up to Harrison and convention chair Minyon Moore to set a specific date for voting to begin, though not before August 1. Delegates would vote via digital ballots, with at least 24 hours’ notice, much like they did in 2020 during the largely remote convention. That year, voting ran for nearly two weeks and, of the 4,747 ballots they sent out, only over a dozen were not returned, according to Andrew Binns, a senior adviser to the convention.
    

            An open letter from more than 75 current and former DNC members, shared with CNN, praised Biden for his decision to give way “to a new generation of public servants” and insisted that Harris is “the only person that can credibly claim the torch from the Biden-Harris Administration.”
    

            “We also firmly believe that Vice President Harris and her Vice Presidential selection will help Democratic candidates for U.S. House, Senate, and in the states we need to win in November, enabling us to enact laws that truly benefit the American people,” the authors said, addressing one of the concerns that led so many Democratic lawmakers to call for Biden to step aside.
    

            In the critical swing state of Michigan, where party chair Lavora Barnes almost immediately endorsed Biden, the leadership of the “uncommitted” movement – which won about 30 delegates during a protest campaign against the president’s handling of Israel’s war in Gaza – opened the door for Harris.
    

            “It’s time to align our actions with our values,” said Layla Elabed in a statement datelined Dearborn, a Detroit suburb where more than half of the population is of Middle Eastern or North African descent. “Vice President Harris can start the process to earn back trust by turning the page from Biden’s horrific policies in Gaza.”
    

            Harris made headlines in March when she called for a ceasefire in Gaza during a speech on the anniversary of “Bloody Sunday” at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama.
    

            One California delegate, who like others spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment in this pivotal moment, said he’s “relieved” and “excited” after hearing Biden stepped down. The delegate, who wanted Biden to quit the race after seeing his shaky performance in last month’s presidential debate, said he hoped Harris would replace Biden at the top of the ticket, calling her the “strongest” candidate.
    

            Another California delegate said she’s “feeling a huge sense of relief.” She had privately been concerned about Biden’s viability following the debate and hoped for weeks he would step aside.
    

            “We couldn’t go on like that any longer,” the delegate said, “without jeopardizing the entire election up and down the ballot.”
    

            A Massachusetts delegate told CNN that while he still strongly supports Biden’s agenda, the president’s “vision has failed to reach Americans.” The delegate said he has not yet decided who to support for the nomination, and believes the party needs a leader who “can help Americans understand what’s at stake.”
    

            Another erstwhile Biden delegate from Colorado said, “It is long overdue that there is a competitive nomination for president” at the Democratic convention. She also told CNN she’s not yet decided on who to support for the nomination. When asked about Harris, the delegate said she’s not convinced the vice president can win in November.
    

            “It is not clear that (Harris) is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump,” she said.
    

            A delegate from Florida told CNN he’s “disappointed” Biden dropped out and said Democrats owe Biden “a debt of gratitude” for winning the 2020 election and “setting up Democrats to defeat Trump again.”
    

            He said he’s taking his cues from Biden and plans to back Harris, who has been making calls to Democratic lawmakers asking for their support as she tries to consolidate the party over the coming days.
    

            In South Carolina, one Democratic delegate told CNN they were “sad” to hear the news, noting that the Palmetto State had been so critical in Biden’s primary victory four years ago.
    

            “We saved and relaunched Biden’s campaign, so it’s sad to see his electoral career – that we take a lot of pride in - come to an end,” the delegate said, while also warning that this affection and loyalty would not necessarily be passed on to Harris.
    

            The delegate told CNN they would prefer Harris “wins in a competitive process,” reasoning that that “she’d be a stronger nominee if she isn’t anointed.” Though getting the support of Rep. Jim Clyburn, the state’s most powerful Democrats and a close Biden ally, could settle the matter,
    

            “He’s still the titan of politics in South Carolina,” the delegate said. “Is he going to put his full shoulder into whipping for Harris? That’s all unanswered,”
    

            In a statement issued shortly after Biden’s, Harris on Sunday confirmed she is running for president and said she was “honored” to receive Biden’s endorsement. Harris said she intends to “earn and win” the presidential nomination in her first public statement since Biden’s stunning announcement.
    

            “Over the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election. And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead,” Harris said, before hinting at the condensed timeframe. “We have 107 days until Election Day. Together, we will fight. And together, we will win.”
    

            Shasti Conrad, chair of the Washington state Democrats, said the party is currently calling all their delegates to get a “temperature check” and make sure everyone has up-to-date information on the process ahead. They have a group call scheduled for later Sunday.
    

            Conrad, who officially endorsed Harris, is the first South Asian women to lead a state party and said she is “thrilled” that Harris is on track to become the nominee.
    

            “It really means that we are fully a part of this American story,” Conrad said, “and that people who look like her and look like myself in this country have a place in leadership.”

CNN_42,Legal experts are dubious of any court challenge to Democrats’ move to put forward new nominee,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/legal-experts-skeptical-court-challenge-democratic-nominee/index.html,2024-07-22 07:19:00,politics,"
            Legal challenges to Democrats’ move to nominate a new presidential candidate in the wake of President Joe Biden’s unprecedented decision to drop out of the 2024 race stand little likelihood of success, election law experts told CNN.
    

            Donald Trump allies have discussed the legal implications of removing Biden from the ballot, and whether or not they have grounds to challenge the issue, one source familiar with the discussions told CNN. It remains unclear whether or not the campaign or outside allies will ultimately bring such a challenge.

            Nevertheless, election law scholars, as well as veterans of campaign litigation, told CNN that courts would be unlikely to go along with lawsuits that sought to challenge the addition of a new name on the top of the Democratic ticket.
    

            “As a legal matter, it is up to the convention to nominate a candidate. And all the legal precedent is on courts deferring to the party’s choice for its nominee and then giving the voters the choice,” said Ben Ginsberg, a Republican campaign attorney who has served as general counsel for several previous GOP nominees.
    

            It may be at least a few more weeks until we see any Hail Mary lawsuits tested. Because Biden dropped out before the formal mechanisms that would have made him the Democratic nominee, there is nothing yet for his opponents to challenge in court and they’ll face an uphill battle once they do.
    

            “The Democratic Party did not have an official nominee yesterday, and the same can be said today,” said David Becker, a former DOJ attorney and election law expert who advises state election officials of both parties. “Until the delegates vote, Democratic Party rules state that there is no official Democratic nominee. There was no one to be ‘replaced’ on the ballot because there is nothing to replace yet.”
    

            Before Biden’s departure from the race Sunday, prominent Republicans were raising the threat of lawsuits – perhaps in the hopes of further exacerbating the chaos that has plagued the Democratic Party since Biden’s poor performance at the CNN presidential debate last month.
    

            “Joe Biden was chosen after a long, small-d democratic process by 14 million people,” House Speaker Mike Johnson told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.” “It will be very interesting to see if the so-called party of democracy, the Democrats, go into a backroom somewhere and switch it out and put someone else on the top of the ticket.”
    

            “It will be litigated, I expect, on the ground there,” Johnson said.
    

            Becker, speaking on a press call Sunday, called attempts to get a court to force Biden’s name on the ballot “less than frivolous.”
    

            “They are not supported by anything in the law whatsoever, and what they amount to is an attempt by a political party to put someone on the ballot who chooses not to run,” Becker said.
    

            There has been an explosion in election litigation in general, especially with Trump’s challenges to his 2020 defeat, and there could be political incentive for conservatives to sue. And as with Trump’s criminal legal troubles, courts have entertained novel and long-shot legal theories.
    

            “There’s different dimensions to this,” said Derek Muller, an election law professor at the University of Notre Dame. “One is what the Trump campaign itself wants to do, versus what third parties or proxies want to do.”
    

            The timing of Biden’s decision is a key factor in what happens next, legally. He made his announcement two weeks before Democrats were set to use a virtual roll call to nominate their candidate and four weeks before the convention itself is scheduled to begin.
    

            There is no longer a presumptive Democratic nominee, though Biden himself has endorsed his Vice President Kamala Harris, boosting the case for putting her on the top of the ticket. The Biden-Harris campaign has also changed its name to “Harris for President.”


            Whoever gets the backing of a majority of convention delegates — whether it’s Harris or someone else — will officially get the party’s nomination.  It’s not clear yet if Harris has that level of support among the thousands of delegates.
    

            “The way that the rules work are they’re pretty loose on the Democratic side,” election law Rick Hasen told Abby Phillip on CNN’s “NewsNight” last month, noting that even if Biden stayed in, the party delegates could have legally voted for someone else.
    

            “The delegates would have the ability to choose a nominee and because this is happening before the convention there would be enough time” for other candidates to campaign to be the nominee, said Hasen, who is a law professor at University of California, Los Angeles.

There is no historical precedent for Biden dropping out now


            If Republicans wanted to sue over the swap-out of Biden for someone else, they’d likely wait until after someone else was formally nominated by the Democratic Party, Muller said.
    

            Under the usual process, after the nomination, state Democratic and Republicans parties send to the top election official in their states the name of their presidential and vice presidential candidates, and those nominees are certified for the state’s ballot.
    

            “Until that happens, there’s really nothing to litigate in any of these states. They haven’t made any decision they haven’t accepted any paperwork. They haven’t filed any names,” Muller said. “So you have to kind of wait until you’ve gone through a nomination process and paperwork gets filed. Somebody might try to sue early, but the courts are going say, ‘What are you suing about?’”
    

            Another key issue is who would meet the legal threshold known as standing to sue and that will likely influence where any longshot lawsuits get filed. Federal courts set a particularly high bar for standing.
    

            In state court, standing rules vary state by state, and that is likely to influence where Democrats’ opponents could seek to bring legal challenges; Colorado, Minnesota, and Michigan have particularly generous approaches to standing, Muller said.
    

            Groups on the right were already looking at the state-by-state intricacies, even before Biden’s announcement Sunday.
    

            However, in most states, according to Hasen, the rules “essentially say, whoever is the nominee of the major party, gets to appear on the ballot.”
    

            The Heritage Foundation – the conservative think tank – wrote a memo in late June through its Oversight Project that pointed to several states like Georgia and Wisconsin where it believed Democrats would run into legal issues.
    

            “The process for substitution and withdrawal presents many election integrity issues,” the memo says. “Adherence to the law in some states may result in that process being unsuccessful for the purposes of another candidate being on the ballot.”
    

            On Sunday, the Heritage’s Oversight Project posted on social media that it had been “preparing for this moment for months.”
    

            “We live in an era where you file a lawsuit and then you simultaneously file a press release and see if you can fundraise off it, so it’s a different set of interests for third party groups,” Muller said.
    

            CNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz, Kristen Holmes, Holmes Lybrand, Marshall Cohen and Sydney Topf contributed to this report.

CNN_43,Biden just made the hardest decision any politician can make,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/biden-ambition-democracy-analysis/index.html,2024-07-22 07:56:00,politics,"
President Joe Biden ran for reelection to save democracy. In the end, he came to the shattering realization he could only do so by ceding power himself.
    

            Biden reached the decision to end his campaign after days in isolation at his Delaware beach house with Covid-19 and after watching many Democrats desert the president who led them to power just four years ago.
    

            In offering to hand over power in service of what he saw as the national interest, he struck a contrast with former President Donald Trump, who fought bitterly against leaving office after loosing a free and fair election to Biden in 2020. It’s ironic that Republicans who whitewashed Trump’s election-stealing effort are now accusing Democrats of crushing the will of primary voters who voted for the president’s reelection bid.

            “It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,” Biden said in a letter he posted to X on Sunday afternoon. “And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.”
    

            Biden quickly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, but his late-in-the campaign decision sets off a potentially chaotic and divisive rush to rally behind a Democratic nominee in the month before the party convention in Chicago and less than four months before the election.
    

            The Biden campaign effectively ended in the 20 first, faltering minutes of his debate against Trump last month, when the president looked confused, exhausted and was unable to take the attack to his foe or to make an effective case for himself.
    

            His struggles validated concerns of majorities of voters that he would be too old for a second term that would have ended when he is 86. His fervent efforts to save his campaign in television interviews and campaign appearances only exacerbated the concerns about his showing in the CNN debate in Atlanta. Three weeks of severe erosion in his political position saw a daily drip of defections from Democratic lawmakers, while party grandees like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed from behind the scenes. The drying up of donor cash also seemed to make Biden’s campaign unsustainable. Even if he wanted to go on, it became clear that he couldn’t.
    

            Still Biden, proud and defiant, resisted every effort to push him out of the race, insisting, along with his loyal inner core of staff, that there was no other Democrat better qualified or more likely to beat Trump, whom the president views as an existential threat to American democracy and the country’s soul.
    

            But in the end, Biden could not find a way to make voters unsee the poignant picture of an 81-year-old commander in chief who appeared to have seriously declined and was stumbling in the debate.
    

            Biden’s impressive legislative record, which bears comparison with any Democratic president since Lyndon Johnson, was one of the reasons why he resisted attempts to push him out of the race, saying he wanted to finish the job.
    

            Becoming the oldest president ever elected, he was 78 when he took office. Biden declared in his inaugural address that the American political system of checks and balances had held and triumphed over Trump’s election lies – not knowing at the time that the ex-president’s threat to democracy would only grow.
    

            The new president immediately set about tackling the Covid-19 pandemic, the worst public health emergency in 100 years, which had been exacerbated by Trump’s mismanagement and politicization of his own government’s public health guidelines.
    

            Biden enacted a $1.9 trillion economic rescue package that the White House credited with helping to drive unemployment to near 50-year lows and spurring a faster rebound for the US economy than for other developed nations. Biden also passed a $750 billion health care, tax and climate bill known as the Inflation Reduction Act and a bipartisan infrastructure package that had eluded other recent presidents.
    

            But Biden badly underestimated the threat from inflation, which rose to 40-year-highs. While the cost of living has eased, many Americans are still feeling the punishing blowback from high grocery prices and elevated interest rates – which offered Trump an opening.
    

            Overseas, Biden responded forcibly to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, becoming the most important leader of the West since the end of the Cold War with his efforts to reinvigorate NATO. But the chaotic US exit from Afghanistan in the summer of 2021 hurt Biden’s self-proclaimed status as a foreign policy expert, and his handling of Israel’s war in Gaza damaged his standing with parts of his base.
    

            The soul searching that Biden endured led to a decision that in some ways represents a humiliating end for a politician who spent years pursuing the highest office and was frequently passed over in his climb to power.
    

            It is not an easy thing for a president — the most powerful person in the world — to separate his personal ambition from the fate of the nation. And the debilitating distancing that took place between top Democrats and Biden in recent weeks was a cruel lesson in the brutality of politics, given that the president had ejected Trump from power after the most tumultuous presidency in modern times. It must be an especially bitter pill for Biden that he will not be able to take the fight to Trump, who has spent the last three years saying he was too infirm and mentally diminished to effectively serve as president.

            The ignominy of being effectively forced to shelve his reelection bid will also be painful for the president since he’s had to abandon two White House campaigns before — in 1987 after he was caught plagiarizing a British politician and in 2008 after he failed to gain traction in a blockbuster race that was dominated by Obama and former first lady Hillary Clinton. Sunday’s denouement was also the latest harrowing turn in a life of tragedy that saw Biden lose his first wife and infant daughter to a car crash when he’d been elected to the Senate from Delaware. He had to bury another child in 2015 when his beloved son Beau died of brain cancer. And in recent years, the president has been dealing with the pressure and pain of helping his other son Hunter through the horror of addiction and a personal crisis that culminated in a criminal conviction on a gun charge earlier this year.
    

            Given his political and personal history, it was no surprise that Biden would dig in his heels as calls mounted from within the Democratic Party for him to quit the race.
    

            But the growing possibility that his legacy would be remembered not for ousting the most aberrant president in modern American history but for paving the way for an even more extreme second Trump term, set in motion the political forces that would extinguish his hopes.
    

            If Biden’s gamble pays off and another Democratic candidate beats Trump, he may go down in history as one of the most successful one-term presidents in history. He will have enabled such a triumph by putting his own ambition on hold for the good of his party and the country. But his late exit will raise questions over whether he has saddled his party — and a Democratic successor — with an impossible task in standing up a campaign in a matter of days against a united Republican Party that emerged from its convention in Milwaukee last week convinced it was on a path to victory.
    

            Seeking a second term at the age of 81 turned out to be an impossible mission — and, despite his efforts, Biden may have saved his party huge problems had he reached the same conclusion before the primary season started.
    

            If history is a guide, Biden’s rock bottom approval ratings will spike in the coming days. When Johnson announced he would not run for a second term in his own right in 1968, he was greeted by massive crowds in subsequent public events around the country. Johnson made his move in March, during the primary campaign, and his departure set off a chaotic chain of events, worsened by the assassination of Democratic primary candidate Robert F. Kennedy, and a violence-plagued convention in Chicago — which will also host this year’s event. In the end, the eventual Democratic nominee, Hubert Humphrey, lost to Republican Richard Nixon. Years earlier, in March 1952, Harry S. Truman, another Democratic president, had decided not to seek his own second term. The Democratic nominee that year, Adlai Stevenson, lost to Republican Dwight Eisenhower.
    

            But if Biden does enjoy a burst of support for his selflessness – and even nostalgia for the successes of what is now a lame duck presidency – it might not translate to his successor.
    

            No modern president has ever bowed out of the presidential race at such a late date. And Harris, or whoever picks up the baton, now faces one of the most daunting missions in electoral history, against an opponent who has already proved there is nothing he will not do to win.

WaPo_1,Gray D.C. Saturday seemed a summer landmark,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/20/weather-washington-heat-rain-summer/,2024-07-21 08:02:02.860575,,"Not to gloat, lest the scorching spirits of summertime be provoked, but on Saturday the mercury in the District failed for a third successive day to reach 90 degrees.In a month of many 90-degree readings, and several in the 100s, D.C.'s high temperature on Saturday climbed only to 87 degrees.That was two degrees cooler than the 89s of Thursday and Friday, and three degrees below the average high for the date of 90.In a way, that below average reading seemed a special sign of defiance of Washington’s heat at its most formidable.Saturday’s 87 came on the 94th anniversary of the date the temperature in Washington reached the fearsome figure of 106 degrees, the highest reading ever recorded in the District.That 106 degree temperature of July 20 in 1930 had been reached in Washington once before; the first time was on Aug. 6, 1918. Saturday’s 87 was 19 degrees cooler.By halting its climb at 87 degrees, Saturday's temperature gave Washington its first string of three successive days in the 80s since the first three days of July.In another seeming break with this summer’s trends, Saturday also provided the city with a predominantly gray and overcast sky, and even a few raindrops.Rain has often been sparse in parts of the Washington region this summer, so even the small amount of rain officially measured for the District might loom large.As of 5 p.m. the official figure was .02 inch. That amount may be nobody’s downpour. But it might at least signal that the mechanisms that produce rainfall have not been scrapped.A sprinkling of raindrops fell on the city for a couple of hours at least, moistening pavements, creating concentric ripples in puddles and giving the sensation, perhaps, that it would amount to more than it actually did.The sensation was enhanced by the thick gray clouds that lumbered across the sky, dark billows that seemed destined to unleash great torrents, but in many places, at least, never quite did.But the very presence of raindrops may have added a distinctive touch to a day that merited recognition on other grounds. For example, Saturday was 30 days since the June 20 solstice, which started astronomical summer.As a result, Saturday was almost one third of the way from the solstice to the Sept. 22 autumn equinox.Saturday gave signs of slow erosion in the luxurious expanse of daylight for which summer is known. According to the timeanddate website, sunrise in the District on Saturday was still before 6 a.m. — but only a minute before.On Sunday, as daylight shrinks by ever larger amounts, sunrise will not be until 6 a.m.Nevertheless it would seem foolhardy at the least not to remain aware that we are far from finished with summer, and it is far from finished with us."

The Americans, who are the odds-on favorites to win their fifth straight Olympic gold medal, were favored by 43½ points over South Sudan, which became an independent nation in 2011 following a lengthy civil war and made its major international basketball tournament debut at the 2023 FIBA World Cup.James hit a go-ahead layup driving to his left with eight seconds remaining, and South Sudan missed three shots to pull off a monumental upset on its final possession. James led the Americans with 25 points to go with six rebounds and seven assists.“I like those ones better than the blowouts,” James said as he walked off the court. “At least we get tested. I like getting tested, baby. I like being tested. Those are the best ones.”For the United States, the narrow win exposed several issues that could prove problematic when it opens group-stage play against Serbia on July 28. The Americans fell behind by 16 points in the first half as their starting lineup, featuring Joel Embiid at center, continued to struggle with slow starts and poor ball movement. South Sudan handily won the outside shooting battle, going 14 for 33 (42.4 percent) on three-pointers compared to the Americans’ 7-for-28 shooting (25 percent). And the Americans’ star-studded roster, led by James and Stephen Curry, committed 12 turnovers, many of them inexplicable.“It was a good reminder that when we play against teams, it’s the biggest game of their lives,” Coach Steve Kerr said. “We have to expect everyone to play like that. We let our guard down as a team and as a staff, for sure. What we’ve learned with USA Basketball is that the gap has closed.”Saturday’s exhibition was the fourth of five showcase games for the Americans before the Olympics. They beat Canada, Australia and Serbia in the first three, but their chemistry wasn’t always sharp as Kerr experimented with starting lineups and unorthodox rotations.If not for a dominant third quarter, which the Americans won 37-18 to erase a 14-point halftime deficit and take a lead into the final period, James never would have had the chance to play hero. Kerr elected to start five bench players to open the third quarter, a decision that paid dividends with a 14-4 run that shifted the momentum.Even so, the Americans, who nearly blew a 24-point second-half lead against Australia on Monday in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, flirted with pain again. They led by seven points with under two minutes to play, but South Sudan’s Marial Shayok made a three-pointer and a jumper to cut the lead to two. JT Thor, a second-round pick in the 2021 NBA draft who played for the Charlotte Hornets last season but is now a free agent, drilled a three-pointer to give South Sudan a 100-99 lead with 20 seconds left.Kerr, who had seen Curry miss two jumpers and Anthony Davis miss a shot near the rim in the closing stretch, put the ball in James’s hands for the Americans’ final possession. He wasted no time driving to the rim for the go-ahead basket, and the U.S. team held on for dear life on the other end.“South Sudan was amazing,” Kerr said. “I did not do a great job preparing our team. We did not focus enough on what [South Sudan was] capable of. That’s on me. That really allowed South Sudan to gain confidence early. ... The ending was good for us, just to feel what it’s going to be like in Paris.”Carlik Jones, a former NBA player who has played for Dallas, Denver and Chicago, missed a pull-up jumper, and Wenyen Gabriel, another former NBA player, couldn’t connect on two putback attempts before time expired. Jones had 15 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists for South Sudan. Shayok added 24 points, including six three-pointers.The U.S. men will face Germany on Monday in London to complete their exhibition schedule. After facing Serbia in its Olympic opener, the Americans get a rematch with South Sudan on July 31."
WaPo_4,Trump and Vance revel in Democratic troubles in first rally together,https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/07/20/trump-vance-michigan-rally-grand-rapids/,2024-07-21 08:00:02.860575,,"GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Former president Donald Trump reveled in Democrats’ turmoil at  his first rally since his attempted assassination at another campaign event, joined by his newly announced running mate, J.D. Vance.Trump and Vance, the Republican senator from Ohio, appeared in Grand Rapids exactly one week after a gunman opened fire at Trump’s rally in Butler, Pa. with an AR-style rifle. The attack killed one audience member, injured others and left Trump with a bloody ear, instantly creating a shocking election-year scene in which Trump pumped his fist and shouted “Fight!” as Secret Service officers rushed him offstage.Now, Trump is coming off his formal nomination at the Republican National Convention in perhaps his strongest political position this campaign cycle, with some Democrats pushing to remove President Biden last-minute from their ticket and Republicans full of optimism. Trump spoke gleefully about Democrats’ disarray Saturday, at one point polling the audience on who they most wanted him to run against.The crowd booed for Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) and Vice President Harris, whose name Trump butchered. But the audience roared loudest when Trump named Biden — reflecting Republicans’ growing confidence that they can beat the incumbent.As Democrats warn that Trump is a threat to democracy, Trump tried to cast his opponents’ wrangling over Biden’s future as undemocratic. The man who tried to overthrow his 2020 loss said that Democratic “bosses” are trying to “overthrow the results of their own party’s primaries” and declared, “last week I took a bullet for democracy.”The Grand Rapids event was Trump and Vance’s first rally as running mates and underscores the Trump team’s hopes that Vance’s Ohio upbringing and populist message will help them win the neighboring swing states of Michigan and Pennsylvania. Speaking for just over 10 minutes Saturday afternoon ahead of Trump’s remarks, Vance highlighted his roots in a “working class family” that struggled with addiction and said he viewed both political parties as “broken” for a long time.He laid out the “America First” and isolationist ideas he has championed in a changing GOP. He rebuked leaders across the political spectrum he said had allowed American jobs to be outsourced and suggested the United States should pick its foreign entanglements more carefully.“There’s nothing radical about having a strong national security that when we go to the war, we punch and we punch hard, but being cautious, and not trying to get America involved in every far-flung corner and conflict of the world,” Vance said. “Sometimes, my friends, it just is none of our business and we oughta stay out of it.” The crowd cheered.Trump took the stage with a small tan bandage on his ear instead of the conspicuous white one he wore at the Republican convention after the assassination attempt left him wounded. On Saturday, he also shared a letter from Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Tex.), a close ally and former White House physician, that said Trump’s wound required no sutures but still bled intermittently, requiring a dressing.At the rally, Trump made some efforts to pivot to a general election audience. He ramped up his attacks on a conservative policy effort called Project 2025, even as its architects include staunch Trump allies and members of his first administration. Trump has tried to distance himself as Democrats increasingly attack Project 2025, and on Saturday, Trump called the effort “seriously extreme” and a product of the “severe right.” But the package also includes many proposals that Trump has endorsed.At the same time, Trump returned to the red-meat issues that amp up his base. He got some of his biggest cheers promising to carry out mass deportations and “shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement.” He repeated his false claims the 2020 election was rigged.He criticized government rules meant to increase electric car production — but also tempered it with praise for Elon Musk, the CEO of electric-car maker Tesla, who recently endorsed Trump and is said to be planning large donations to Trump’s reelection. “I’ve had them, I’ve driven them, they’re incredible but they’re not for everybody,” Trump said of EVs.Trump also doubled down on his praise for leaders that President Biden and other U.S. officials have condemned as dictators. He recounted saying of Chinese President Xi Jinping: “He’s a brilliant man, he controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist,” and riffed on the idea, saying Xi makes people like Biden look like “babies.”“They’re all smart, tough, they love their country,” Trump said of Xi as well as Russian President Vladimir Putin.Despite the violence last week, Trump supporters queued up in long lines early Saturday to hear from their official ticket. Many rally attendees wore shirts with Trump’s words after the assassination attempt — “fight, fight, fight” — or with photos of Trump raising his fist, and a few sported ear bandages meant to mimic the one Trump had at the GOP convention.Saturday’s rally took taking place with extra safety precautions. The event was moved indoors after the shooting at an open-air event because an arena is easier to secure, The Washington Post previously reported, and Trump’s campaign does not expect to hold any more outdoor rallies soon. Secret Service sought additional help from local law enforcement as well.Supporters at the rally said they believed that God saved Trump’s life last week and expressed little fear for their own security.“I feel safe and I don’t feel worried. Security is beefed up as much as it could be,” said Angelic Johnson, 54. “We just have to look to God to protect us like he did that night that Trump got shot.” She said she came to learn more about Vance after only knowing his basic biography.Biden’s campaign held a news conference Saturday ahead of the Grand Rapids rally to assail Trump’s agenda, saying it would hurt workers while giving breaks to the wealthy. Whitmer (D) shared a video with her “welcome” message for Trump and Vance, saying that “here, we protect reproductive freedom” and making other digs at Trump’s policies.But Democrats’ own turmoil has been a growing distraction. A dozen more Democratic lawmakers called on Biden to pull out of the presidential race on Friday alone, indicating a party still deeply unsettled by Biden’s struggle to hold his train of thought at a June 27 debate and other stumbles.A bout of covid-19 has also taken Biden off the campaign trail while Trump and Vance plan a bundle of events coming out of the Republican convention.On Monday afternoon, Vance will hold a rally in his hometown of Middletown, Ohio. Then he will head to a Monday evening rally in Radford, Va. — a signal of the Trump campaign’s continued efforts to expand the map of competitive states to places where Democrats usually prevail in the presidential race. Biden won Virginia by 10 points in 2020.Trump plans to speak at a rally in Charlotte on Wednesday evening.Trump, appearing at the convention with a bandage on his ear, used his speech to call for unity after last week’s rally shooting. “The discord and division in our society must be healed,” he said.But after recounting the assassination attempt and attributing his survival to divine intervention, Trump mostly returned to his usual material. He jabbed at “crazy Nancy Pelosi” and alluded to his false claims the 2020 election was stolen from him — “that horrible, horrible result that we’ll never let happen again.Knowles reported from Washington."

WaPo_6,"FCC slashes cost of phone calls for inmates, capping decades-long effort",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/20/fcc-cut-call-rates-prison/,2024-07-21 09:59:02.967398,,"The cost of phone calls will drop dramatically for incarcerated people under new rules that federal regulators approved Thursday, concluding a decades-long effort to provide relief to the nation’s 2 million inmates and their families.A 15-minute call to or from large jails, which now costs as much as $11.35, will cost 90 cents  beginning next year. In small jails,  the cost will fall from as high as $12.10 to $1.35. Video call rates will decrease to less than one-quarter of current prices, according to rules passed unanimously by the Federal Communications Commission.An FCC draft order estimated the caps would save incarcerated people and their families, friends and legal teams about $386 million.“It is no secret that the market for communication services for incarcerated people has long been plagued by predatory fees and practices,” FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starkssaid in a statement Thursday. “Today’s actions put an end to these abuses.”Advocates for incarcerated people and their families praised the decision, saying it was ending a “cruel” practice.“The FCC’s order is a massive victory for incarcerated people, their families, and their allies who have spent decades fighting the exploitative prison telecom industry,” the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit organization that opposes mass incarceration, wrote in a published briefing.Opponents expressed concern that the rate cuts could prove costly for telecommunications companies serving smaller jails and stress state budgets. FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, who approved the decision, wrote in a statement that he nevertheless worried that the caps weren’t high enough to offset some security costs for the companies and feared some companies might stop serving smaller facilities as a result.The push for lower rates began about two decades ago, when a retired nurse in D.C. filed a petition asking the FCC to address the expense. Martha Wright-Reed, who died in 2015, wrote that she had to spend hundreds of dollars each month to call her incarcerated grandson, Ulandis Forte. She thought it was wrong that Forte had to pay more than non-incarcerated people to keep in touch with family, she told The Washington Post in 2012.“She was right,” FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement celebrating the decision Thursday. “For those who are incarcerated and their loved ones, talk does not come cheap.”Rosenworcel added that the price of one call could cost as much as an unlimited monthly plan for people who are not incarcerated. She also noted that regular contact with relatives can also reduce recidivism among inmates, a conclusion that several studies corroborate.Correctional facilities often have an exclusive agreement with one company, meaning incarcerated people and their relatives must use that provider regardless of how much it charges. Those companies then share a portion of the revenue with the facilities, known as “site commissions,” which some local officials say helps fund staff to monitor the calls. Thursday’s FCC vote also prohibited most of those payments.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit had reversed similar rate caps in 2017, finding that the FCC had exceeded its authority in implementing them. But the bipartisan Martha Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act, signed by President Biden last year, broadened the FCC’s authority to cap call rates, and set the stage for this week’s vote.In statements backing the decision, FCC commissioners recounted stories they had heard from family members of incarcerated people. One father had said he couldn’t afford to call his young children during his first two years in a Colorado correctional facility, a commissioner wrote. An incarcerated mother in Illinois recounted taking a job cleaning bathrooms so she could collect bits of soap to save money on hygiene and use more of her funds to call her children, according to another commissioner.Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), who championed the Martha Wright-Reed Act, applauded the FCC’s decision as one that would “end the predatory status quo.”“For far too long, too many families were forced to spend outrageous amounts of money simply to speak on the phone with their incarcerated loved ones, denying children the comfort of hearing their parents’ voices and preventing spouses from being able to say a simple ‘I’m here for you’ to their partners,” Duckworth said in a statement Thursday.The federal-level change follows the implementation of several state laws slashing the cost of talking to incarcerated family members and friends, including in Connecticut, California and Colorado.In Denver, Colorado state Rep. Mandy Lindsay (D) told a state House committee last year that she learned about the high cost of prison phone calls when one of her relatives became incarcerated. Because of the rates, Lindsay testified, “the amount of time that we talked was based on money.”"
WaPo_7,"Steven Birnbaum, D.C. United’s retiring captain, signs off with a cameo",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/20/dc-united-celtic-steven-birnbaum/,2024-07-21 09:58:02.967398,,"At no point in Steven Birnbaum’s pregame routine did the retiring defender let on that D.C. United’s 4-0 loss to Scottish power Celtic on Saturday night at Audi Field would be the final appearance of a decorated 11-year career in the nation’s capital.Birnbaum led United out of the tunnel, walking hand in hand with his 4-year-old daughter, Colette, and his 3-year-old son, Brooks. He stayed on his toes during the national anthem, bobbing and swaying to loosen his legs. The 33-year-old greeted Celtic captain Matt O’Riley for the coin toss, then stripped off the white No. 15 T-shirt that every D.C. player was donning in Birnbaum’s honor. Taking his customary spot at the heart of United’s back line, Birnbaum zigzagged as if bracing for a game full of quick cuts, then crouched and hopped as if preparing for a long night of contested headers.But as United played the kickoff backward and promptly fired the ball out of bounds, the happy pretense evaporated and reality reigned. For as much as Birnbaum would have loved to roam Audi Field for a final 90 minutes — or 45 or 10 or two — the troublesome hip and knee that brought about his early retirement wouldn’t have it. So Birnbaum made his planned exit seconds into the exhibition, exchanging hearty hugs with his teammates and applauding the fans who propped up a “Thanks Captain” banner in his honor.The No. 2 draft pick out of California in 2014, Birnbaum made 275 appearances for D.C. — good for third in club history — over a career that included a 2016 all-star nod and 11 U.S. national team caps. Having missed the start of the season following February knee surgery, Birnbaum logged just six matches before deciding to hang up his cleats. Irreparable cracks, it turned out, had appeared in the longtime iron man’s armor.After removing the captain’s armband and handing it to his replacement, Lucas Bartlett, Birnbaum embraced Coach Troy Lesesne, hoisted his daughter as she rushed into his arms and disappeared into the D.C. bench. He already was in street clothes by the time he resurfaced to address the fans during a halftime ceremony. “I gave everything I had on the field,” he told the announced 18,590 in attendance. Signing off for good, he exclaimed, “¡Vamos United!”One of us 🖤❤️ pic.twitter.com/qNOYBJ0JabThe friendly arrived three days after United (6-11-8) entered a month-long hiatus from regular season action with a last-gasp 3-2 win at Minnesota. On Wednesday, defender Aaron Herrera and Christian Benteke will participate in the MLS All-Star Game in Columbus, Ohio. United then will open the Leagues Cup — a tournament featuring every team from MLS and Mexico’s Liga MX — with a game at Atlanta on Friday.Lesesne retained just one starter — defender-midfielder Matti Peltola — from the win over Minnesota. Among the starters Saturday: new signings David Schnegg and Dominique Badji and academy player Graham Jones, a University of Virginia commit who spent preseason with United.Despite a slew of lunging saves by third-string goalkeeper Luis Zamudio, the makeshift D.C. squad couldn’t keep up with Celtic. O’Riley opened the scoring with a point-blank strike in the 25th minute. Seven minutes later, he doubled his tally by slotting a Zamudio rebound into an empty net. Mikey Johnston converted a 65th-minute tap-in before James Forrest capped the scoring with a counterattack goal four minutes later.Here’s what else to know about United’s loss:Schnegg, a left back signed from Sturm Graz in his native Austria, and Badji, a Senegalese forward who most recently played in the Turkish second division, logged 58 minutes apiece in their first appearances after the MLS transfer window opened Thursday. The reinforcements are sorely needed for a D.C. team that regularly fails to dress a full 20-player game-day roster because of injuries and a thin squad.Those injury woes resurfaced Saturday. Kristian Fletcher, an attacker playing for the first time in more than a month because of an ankle issue, exited in the fifth minute after suffering an apparent right hamstring injury. And Zamudio gave way to rookie Nathan Crockford — who denied Johnston’s 78th-minute penalty kick — after going down with an apparent leg injury early in the second half.The friendly marked the start of preseason for a Celtic team that won its 54th Scottish league title this past season (and 12th in the past 13 campaigns). Celtic will continue its U.S. tour against Manchester City on Tuesday in Chapel Hill, N.C., and Chelsea next Saturday in South Bend, Ind.Celtic, which played a mix of starters and reserves, held out newly signed Danish goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel and American defender Cameron Carter-Vickers after they played at the European Championship and Copa América."
WaPo_8,Trump releases letter detailing medical care since assassination attempt,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/20/donald-trump-shoot-ear/,2024-07-21 09:09:02.967398,,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump shared a letter signed by Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Tex.) on Saturday detailing the care he has received since last weekend’s assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.The letter, written by a political ally whose actions as a medical provider have come into question over the years, marks the most extensive medical information Trump’s team has shared publicly about the care he received after the assassination attempt.Jackson wrote that he has “evaluated and treated” Trump’s wound on his ear daily. Jackson is a former White House physician who has remained close to Trump since leaving the White House and later successfully running for Congress.Jackson told the New York Times in 2022, that he had allowed his medical license in Florida to expire because he did not have time to see patients. But his medical license remains in “military active” status until early 2025, which the Florida Department of Health states means that “the licensed practitioner, serving in the Armed Forces of the United States, is only authorized to practice in a military facility.”Jackson stated that Trump sustained a 2 cm wide wound from the track of a bullet “that extended down the cartilaginous surface of the ear.” No sutures were required for Trump’s wound, Jackson said, but “there is still intermittent bleeding requiring a dressing to be in place.”That dressing, a white square of gauze, was visible at the top of Trump’s ear throughout the convention. It also became a symbol for Trump supporters who sported makeshift bandages atop their right ears on the convention floor in solidarity with the former president. Most recently, at a campaign rally in Michigan on Saturday, he was wearing a standard, skin-tone bandage.Jackson also noted that the trauma initially caused bleeding and swelling, but that the swelling has since resolved and the wound was beginning to “heal properly.”The memo, written on Jackson’s U.S. Congress letterhead and shared by Trump online on Truth Social, also provides new details about the medical care his team says he received at Butler Memorial Hospital in Butler, Pa., immediately after the assassination attempt.Along with treating his wound, Jackson wrote, medical staff at the hospital “provided a thorough evaluation for additional injuries that included a CT [scan] of his head.”The hospital system where Trump was treated declined to weigh in on the contents of the letter.“Privacy laws and policies preclude us from commenting on care rendered,” said Tom Chakurda, chief communications and marketing officer for Independence Health Systems, which operates Butler Memorial.In a speech Thursday night in Milwaukee accepting the Republican nomination for president, Trump dramatically recounted the experience of narrowly missing a would-be assassin’s bullet at the Pennsylvania rally, saying he would describe what happened only once because it was “too painful to tell.”As he turned his head to the right to see a chart on display at the rally, he recalled, “I started to turn to my right, and was ready to begin a further turn — which I’m lucky I didn’t — when I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me, really hard, on my right ear.”“I said to myself, ‘Wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet,’ — and moved my right hand to my ear, brought it down, and my hand was covered with blood,” he continued. “I immediately knew it was very serious, that we were under attack.”Jackson said in the memo that Trump “will have further evaluations, including a comprehensive hearing exam, as needed.”“He will follow up with his primary care physician, as directed by the doctors that initially evaluated him,” Jackson continued, adding that he will be at the former president’s side “throughout the weekend to provide any medical assistance he needs.”Spokespeople in Jackson’s congressional office did not return requests for comment on Saturday.In Congress, Jackson has been staunchly pro-Trump, and he stated after last Saturday’s rally that members of his family were at the event and that his nephew had been injured.Jackson worked in the White House medical unit under three presidents but drew scrutiny in a Pentagon inspector general’s report, which states that he provided prescription drugs without proper paperwork — a habit that allegedly earned him the nickname “Candyman.” Jackson has denied the report’s claims, describing them as politically motivated.He has also garnered criticism for his glowing praise of Trump’s health in 2018, when he said that Trump had “incredibly good genes.”The Washington Post confirmed earlier this year that the Navy demoted Jackson in July 2022 after the inspector general’s report substantiated allegations about his inappropriate behavior as a White House physician — including making inappropriate sexual comments and erupting into fits of rage.Hannah Knowles contributed to this report."

WaPo_10,Republicans’ June fundraising is party’s strongest month in years,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/20/fundraising-july-election-trump-biden/,2024-07-21 10:41:02.917621,,"The GOP posted another strong fundraising month in June, with the Republican National Committee reporting its best fundraising month in years, as Donald Trump appeared to surpass President Biden’s once-enormous campaign cash advantage.The RNC raised more than $66 million in June, according to filings submitted Saturday night to the Federal Election Commission. That sum marks the highest amount raised for the committee since late 2020, when Donald Trump’s false claims of voter fraud in that year’s election propelled hundreds of millions of dollars of giving in a matter of weeks.The RNC also reported a war chest of $102 million at the end of June, nearly double the amount of cash on hand reported at the end of May. The Democratic National Committee had not yet filed its report late Saturday night.The Republican Party’s fundraising momentum is an ominous sign for Democrats. The June reports only capture a few days of fundraising after Biden struggled through a June 27 debate with Trump, which increased doubts among many Democratic lawmakers about whether he can be effective and defeat the former president if he remains at the top of the ticket.Though the Biden campaign claimed it raised $38 million in the four days after the Atlanta debate faceoff, Biden’s faltering performance sent ripples of panic through the Democratic Party — leading some high-dollar donors to say they were pausing their giving to outside groups that pay for many of the ads to boost Biden’s candidacy and attack Trump. The potential dip in resources for the Biden campaign and its allies will not show up on FEC reports until August.Earlier this month, the Biden campaign said it raised $127 million in June, while the Trump campaign said it had raised $111.8 million over the same period. The Trump campaign’s reports filed Saturday night showed that it has about $285 million in the bank, while the Biden campaign has said it had $240 million in cash on hand across its allied committees, including the Democratic National Committee.Many Democrats are worried that large-dollar donations to Biden’s effort have dropped precipitously as Biden has weighed calls for him to abandon his reelection bid.A dozen Democrats, including two senators, called on Biden to drop out of the presidential race Friday — making it the largest single-day wave of such calls since the debate. Thirty-seven congressional Democrats have said he should step aside.As the number of lawmakers calling on Biden to bow out has risen, the president has also heard directly from allies such as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), who warned him that his candidacy could sink Democratic hopes of taking back the House, as well as former House speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) who urged him to take a more clear-eyed look at his slippage in key swing state polls.Major Democratic donors, who see the possibility of defeating Trump slipping away, are also moving quickly to map out alternative scenarios, including an attempt by some to begin the process of vetting potential vice-presidential candidates who could serve alongside Kamala Harris, should she replace Biden as the party’s nominee."
WaPo_11,Nationals push aside MacKenzie Gore’s dud to rally past the Reds,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/20/nationals-reds-mackenzie-gore/,2024-07-21 10:45:02.917621,,"Once the inning was over, MacKenzie Gore stared at the scoreboard and put his head down. His gray Washington Nationals jersey was a shade darker than when he took the mound 20 minutes earlier, a sign of the labor required to get through a disastrous beginning to his second half of the season.It took 48 pitches — 26 strikes and 22 balls — before Gore’s first inning was complete. If he hadn’t struck out the Cincinnati Reds’ Noelvi Marte to end threat, his Saturday night probably would have ended there. Still, his exit undoubtedly was coming soon. Gore lasted just two innings and departed with his team facing a deficit, but the Nationals rallied to a 5-4 win thanks to Jacob Young’s go-ahead single in the eighth.“I’m just not going deep into games — that’s frustrating for me,” Gore said. “It’s frustrating for the relievers that had to pitch seven innings today. But we won. And it’s a big win for us — a gutsy win.”Saturday was the second time in Washington’s past four games in which its starter threw at least 40 pitches in the first inning. Mitchell Parker didn’t make it out of the first July 13 in Milwaukee, but the bullpen starred as the Nationals rallied to a 6-5 victory on CJ Abrams’s go-ahead homer in the ninth. On Saturday at Nationals Park, the Nationals (46-53) showed their resilience again.This time, the winning rally started thanks to Ildemaro Vargas, who roped a double to lead off the eighth. James Wood grounded out to move him to third before Trey Lipscomb grounded out to pitcher Justin Wilson, setting up a matchup with Young. The scouting report on Young has been to work him in, but he turned on a first-pitch inside cutter from Wilson to drive a single through the left side of the infield and put his arm out in celebration as the Nationals scored a series win against the Reds (47-52).“The boys are going to play hard for 27 outs,” Manager Dave Martinez said. “They’re not going to give up.”Still, the start of the evening was disappointing for Gore. The 25-year-old left-hander allowed two hits, walked four and gave up three runs on his bobblehead night as his rough July continued. He threw 67 pitches; just 37 were strikes.For Gore to take another step forward as a top-of-the-rotation arm, he needs to eliminate bad outings like Saturday’s. He showed his ability to be elite with a 2.91 ERA and a 72-17 strikeout-to-walk ratio in the season’s first two months. Next, he needed to prove he could keep doing that for a full season.Gore’s ERA by month: 3.19 in April, 2.60 in May, 5.13 in June and 6.59 in July entering Saturday. Before the all-star break, he had allowed four runs or more in three of his previous four starts. The frustration was apparent in his deep, exasperated sighs in the clubhouse after each start. That continued Saturday.“We know what the problem is,” he said. “I’m going to stop talking about it, and I’m going to figure out a way — whenever I pitch again — figure out a way to be better. ... Been a good start to the second half in that way, but we saw what happened in the first two innings today.”He opened with seven straight balls before a strike led to sarcastic cheers from the home crowd. His first inning went as follows: four-pitch walk, six-pitch walk, nine-pitch strikeout, four-pitch RBI single, seven-pitch walk, 10-pitch sacrifice fly, eight-pitch strikeout.The Reds fouled off 16 pitches, including 11 fastballs. Gore threw just one first-pitch strike. After all of that, the Nationals trailed 2-0. But in the bottom half, Harold Ramírez hit his first home run as a National, a two-run shot to center that tied the score.Even with a second chance, Gore couldn’t salvage his outing. He recorded the first two outs of the second, then walked Jonathan India for a second time. Elly De La Cruz followed with an RBI double to give the Reds the lead and advanced to third on an error by Wood in left. A groundout kept the Nationals’ deficit at 3-2, but the end of the inning left Gore’s July ERA at 7.47. His struggles have coincided with command issues — he has 13 walks in 15⅔ innings this month.But just like a week earlier, Washington’s bullpen provided needed support. Jordan Weems allowed a solo homer to Tyler Stephenson in the third, but Robert Garcia, Dylan Floro and Derek Law didn’t allow a run over the next five innings. And the Nationals clawed their way back again — Abrams hit an RBI infield single in the fourth and Lane Thomas had a tying double in the seventh before Young delivered in the eighth. All-star Kyle Finnegan retired the side in order in the ninth for his 27th save as the Nationals put Gore’s ugly start behind them.“I think both times, the bullpen has just been unbelievable,” Young said. “For them to be put in that type of situation is [not easy], and for them to keep giving us a chance in those games is great. Both games, we’ve been able to scrap runs throughout the game and get a big hit late. ... It’s just cool to be able to win games like that.”Martinez said right-hander Cade Cavalli (recovering from Tommy John surgery) experienced “dead arm” after his rehab start for high Class A Wilmington on June 21. Then he got the flu before he was scheduled to make his next rehab start in early July, which is why he hasn’t pitched in nearly a month.The team plans to send the 25-year-old back to Florida to ramp up again soon. When Cavalli gets there, Martinez said, he will start from the beginning, throwing from flat ground and building his way back up to game action."

WaPo_13,Asking Eric: No one wants to hear my travel stories,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/07/21/asking-eric-travel-stories-conversations/,2024-07-21 11:59:02.730843,,"Dear Eric: I have been fortunate to have met a number of well-known people and visited many locales worldwide, often, due to my business, places where tourists don’t go.Occasionally, someone in a group I am with mentions reading about a person or place I know something about from personal experience. If I volunteer that I personally am acquainted with said individual or locale, the response is nearly always negative. The conversation dies, the people walk away.Apparently, I come across as a “been there, done that” type. I, for one, would be happy to gain firsthand knowledge about a person or place, but apparently most others don’t think that way. My response now is to remain silent and on the periphery of such conversations.— Lonely TravelerTraveler: While this isn’t your intention, I fear your input may strike some as bragging. Travel isn’t equally accessible to everyone. Many travelers love to bring back knowledge and stories, but those who missed the boat may not relish these souvenirs.When you next find yourself in one of these conversations, take the opportunity to ask those gathered what excites or interests them about an individual or locale. Let them talk about their own connection. It may not be informed in the same way as yours, but that doesn't make it less valuable.If you do want to share that you have firsthand knowledge, make sure you're responding to their story. Speak from your own enthusiasm, rather than your expertise. This makes the conversation a group of people talking about the wonders of the world rather than one person seemingly lecturing, even though that's not your intent.I sense in you a desire to tell your travel story. That's also what these people are trying to do. Take advantage of the chance to keep learning about exotic places, even while here at home.Dear Eric: When I was 16, more than 50 years ago, I had a girlfriend who lived in a nearby city. One day, I brought a joint of marijuana along on a visit. While her parents were away, we smoked it in their garage. Suddenly, we heard a car drive up and stop. In walked her father, a policeman, and her pastor.That is, they were all the same person. Her father was the police department chaplain. He smelled the smoke, took me down to the police station, and then to the bus station, and told me to never come back to their town again. I didn’t. I exchanged one card with the girl, a few months later, not really offering much more than vague regret.Now, 50 years later, I ran into her name in the local paper and she is a county judge!I struggled with alcohol and drugs for a while in my youth, but at age 36 got clean and sober — in part because of a deferred prosecution on a DUI — and I remain so. I was wondering if it would be appropriate for me to drop her a line, letting her know this, and expressing hope that the fallout of our mistake wasn’t too great on her and her family.— Amends Too Late?Amends: Congratulations on your decades of sobriety. I’m happy that you found solutions that worked for you and continue to positively impact your life. I think your former girlfriend, the judge, would be happy to hear about this, as well. An unexpected note from someone from the past who isn’t asking for anything could be a welcome, happy surprise.Amends aren't about changing what happened so much as improving the future's possibilities. We do that by acknowledging harm done and striving to fix what we can. So, don't beat yourself up too much for what happened. You may be thinking about the incident through the lens of all the other substance-related missteps in your past.Bringing the joint to her house wasn't the best strategic choice considering the one-man criminal justice system under her roof, but it may have taken on outsize importance in your mind as the years went by.Telling her the next chapters of your story and making amends, then, could have a positive, right-sizing effect on both of you.One hopes that, as a judge, she’s familiar with the efficacy of alternative sentencing for nonviolent drug offenses. Particularly, that addiction treatment mandated by drug courts, followed by monitoring, showed a recidivism rate 38 percent to 50 percent less than incarceration for drug offenses, according to the Stanford Network on Drug Policy.Your story can help put another human face on the problem of substance abuse for her. It’s something that she may return to as she weighs the law, the figures, and the cases before her. Your story has the power to change a lot more lives than you know.(Send questions to R.

WaPo_14,Carolyn Hax: Sister calls 85-year-old mom ‘selfish’ for not moving closer to her,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/07/21/carolyn-hax-selfish-mom-move-sister/,2024-07-21 11:59:02.730843,,"Dear Carolyn: My sister wants our 85-year-old mother to move closer to her. Our mother, who is in good health, still drives, is active in her church and has lots of friends, wants to remain in her home and not move 600 miles away.I’m supportive of her staying home and have told her I will be available to help her as much as possible. I’m three hours away.My sister is livid that our mother won’t move, is calling her selfish and says she will no longer be available to help her. I think our mom has a right to make her own decisions and don’t understand why my sister is so angry.I really don’t want a family rift at this point in our lives. How can I help my sister understand our mom’s wishes?— Trying to Keep the PeaceTrying to Keep the Peace: The biggest issue I can see here, for you, is that every issue in your letter is more of an issue than you realize. So I’ll take them one at a time in reverse order, in hopes of making some rift-explaining (or mending!) sense.First, your signature: This is not about peace. It is about needs and the ability of all three of you to understand, anticipate and meet one another’s, respectfully and realistically. So if your focus remains on “keep[ing] the peace,” then you will remain as you are now, on the outside helplessly looking in. Bluntly speaking, I’m sorry.Next: The word “rift” is probably accurate, but the bigger issue is frustration. It’s mutual, I’m guessing, between your mom and sister over the mismatched … let’s call it chronology of their thinking.Your mom is in the now. I don’t blame her for this one bit. She is a healthy, competent adult with her own life, and it doesn’t take an oracle to see why she doesn’t want to move. I wouldn’t either.Your sister is in the future. I don’t blame her for this one bit. There is so much I can’t know about your mom’s immediate circumstances, including how valid your sister’s concerns are. Your mom could be a decade or more from needing help from either of you, if ever; her peer group could be multigenerational; her home may have been chosen or adapted for aging in place; one of you could need her before she needs you.But there is something we all can know, just because it’s life we’re talking about here: Whatever her circumstances, her “now” will come to an end. It doesn’t take an oracle, certainly, to see that an 85-year-old and her car keys aren’t in a long-term relationship. And while all of us need a Plan B at every age and your mom could be fine for years, her independence is facing more and more immediate challenges.Next: If she’s A-okay with this reality because she assumes you and your sister — from significant drives away — are her Plan B, then your sister’s frustration starts making sense, doesn’t it?Because even loving, freely given support over a hard distance takes a physical, emotional and economic toll — on caregivers and recipients alike. It can be done, yes. Families wear out airports and highways for one another every day, and maybe the three of you will ultimately choose to do the same if the need arises. But it’s too big and too much just to assume — and it’s too sacred a promise for “available to help … as much as possible” to cover it.It’s a commitment that wants a plan.So, next: Calling your mom “selfish” doesn’t help, for sure, nor does your sister’s petulance — and if your mom doesn’t want to move, then your mom doesn’t want to move, and she may not need you or your sister for years or ever, and all that.Yet: In her regrettable way, whether it was her selfless motive to begin with or not, your sister is making a valid case for some kind of rational communication about What Comes Next, in the hope-it-never-gets-here possible future where Mom’s independence runs out.We know your mom has shut down your sister’s proposal. Did she entertain any larger what-ifs? All of you would benefit from getting everyone’s preferences out there while you can.By backing your mom perhaps naively on her “now,” you unwittingly helped shut down family-wide talks on the future.I’ve worked my way up to the top of your letter, where it’s clear you all love one another and want to stay close, supportive, involved.So don’t “keep the peace”; value communication. You can’t support one another without knowing how to, and that starts with good listening.Both Mom and Sis are speaking without being heard. You can hear your sister’s fear (too far away to help Mom). You can hear your mom’s fear (losing herself). You can ask to talk, when they’ve cooled, about everyone’s Plan B, not just Mom’s — because life has its own ideas. And because you can’t be there for each other when you’re just guessing where “there” might be."
WaPo_15,Stars light up the night as Team WNBA beats Paris-bound U.S. women’s squad,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/20/wnba-all-star-game-caitlin-clark-angel-reese-arike-ogunbowale-diana-taurasi/,2024-07-21 11:22:02.730843,,"PHOENIX — Diana Taurasi received the loudest ovation during player introductions at the WNBA All-Star Game on Saturday night. Nothing else could be heard as Phoenix fans roared in appreciation, realizing the league’s all-time leading scorer — who has spent 20 years with the Mercury — is nearing the end of her Hall of Fame career.So it was appropriate when the five-time gold medalist, a 42-year-old who in Paris is about to play in her sixth Olympics, came out and buried the first shot of the game — a three-pointer for the league’s all-time leader in that category. “Personally, I know that the end is way closer than the beginning,” she said. “So I just try to enjoy every single moment.”This midseason showcase had a spicy feel and a competitive nature typically missing in these sorts of games. Hall of Famer Cheryl Miller, who coached Team WNBA, made that clear Friday, when she said her squad wanted to “beat the brakes” off the U.S. women’s national team. There was something at stake on both sides: Team USA wanted to prepare for the Olympics, and the members of Team WNBA wanted to show they could beat the most accomplished roster in the world.“It is one of the greatest spectacles, I think, in the history of our league, this game today,” Team USA Coach Cheryl Reeve said beforehand. “This is such a great game for USA Basketball because of the level of competition. And we are going to experience adversity in this game.”Reeve was correct: Team WNBA prevailed, 117-109, in front of a sellout crowd at Footprint Center as All-Star Game MVP Arike Ogunbowale led the way with a game record 34 points. Ogunbowale, who was left off the Olympic team and has said politics played a role in the roster selection, erupted in the third quarter with 21 points and five three-pointers after a scoreless first half. Team WNBA’s lead was nine after three quarters and grew to as large as 20 in the fourth before Team USA rallied late. The MVP award was the second for Ogunbowale, who also was honored in 2021 when she faced the Tokyo-bound U.S. Olympians.Breanna Stewart led Team USA with 31 points and 10 rebounds. Taurasi finished with 14 points, six rebounds and five assists in 20 minutes.The storylines ran deep, well beyond Taurasi and Ogunbowale.No. 1 draft pick Caitlin Clark and fellow star rookie Angel Reese not only made their all-star debuts, but their rivalry that began in college was put on hold as they competed as teammates for the first time. Like Taurasi, both received a lot of support from the crowd at the culmination of a hectic weekend.Clark, who was announced as a starter shortly before the game, finished with four points and game-high 10 assists. Reese, who set a WNBA record with 15 consecutive double-doubles, had another in her first all-star appearance, finishing with 12 points and 11 rebounds.“It’s definitely been busy,” Clark said. “... But it’s been fun to get to experience this with other WNBA players, too, and get to know them.”Miller was back in the city where she made her lone WNBA coaching stop. Before the game, she walked to the baseline with another coaching shirt and gave it to fellow Hall of Famer Ann Meyers Drysdale, who headed to the bench as an honorary coach. And this wasn’t just fun and games for Miller, who was animated as she talked to the team during huddles.There were teammate combinations on both squads with A’ja Wilson-Chelsea Gray-Jackie Young-Kelsey Plum (Las Vegas Aces), Stewart-Sabrina Ionescu (New York Liberty) and Taurasi-Brittney Griner-Kahleah Copper (Mercury) on Team USA. Team WNBA featured DeWanna Bonner-Brionna Jones (Connecticut Sun) and Clark-Kelsey Mitchell-Aliyah Boston (Indiana Fever). And Bonner was on the opposite side from Alyssa Thomas, her fiancée and Sun teammate.Speaking of Griner, she is headed to Europe to play for the first time since being released from a Russian prison in December 2022. And Friday night, Allisha Gray became the first player to win both the three-point contest and skills challenge.The stars were not only on the court but in the stands. University of Connecticut guard Paige Bueckers sat courtside next to Hall of Famer Sheryl Swoopes. Sue Bird and former U.S. soccer star Megan Rapinoe were courtside, too. Former NFL tight end and media personality Shannon Sharpe, musicians Fabolous and Ty Dolla Sign, actress Aubrey Plaza and actor Jason Sudeikis were present. Vanessa Bryant, wife of the late Kobe Bryant, and her daughters also sat courtside, and Pitbull performed at halftime."

WaPo_17,GOP’s June fundraising surges as Trump surpasses Biden in cash,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/20/fundraising-july-election-trump-biden/,2024-07-21 11:24:02.730843,,"The GOP posted another strong fundraising month in June, with the Republican National Committee reporting its best fundraising month in years, as Donald Trump surpassed President Biden’s once-enormous campaign cash advantage.The RNC raised more than $66 million in June, according to filings submitted Saturday night to the Federal Election Commission. That sum marks the highest amount raised for the committee since late 2020, when Donald Trump’s false claims of voter fraud in that year’s election propelled hundreds of millions of dollars of giving in a matter of weeks.The RNC also reported a war chest of $102 million at the end of June, nearly double the amount of cash on hand reported at the end of May. The Democratic National Committee reported late Saturday that it had raised $39 million and reported $78 million in cash at the end of June.The Republican Party’s fundraising momentum is an ominous sign for Democrats. The June reports only capture a few days of fundraising after Biden struggled through a June 27 debate with Trump, which increased doubts among many Democratic lawmakers about whether he can be effective and defeat the former president if he remains at the top of the ticket.Though the Biden campaign claimed it raised $38 million in the four days after the Atlanta debate faceoff, Biden’s faltering performance sent ripples of panic through the Democratic Party — leading some high-dollar donors to say they were pausing their giving to outside groups that pay for many of the ads to boost Biden’s candidacy and attack Trump. The potential dip in resources this month for the Biden campaign and its allies will not show up on FEC reports until August.The Biden campaign said it raised $127 million in June, while the Trump campaign said it had raised $111.8 million over the same period. The Trump campaign’s reports filed Saturday night showed that it has about $285 million in the bank, while the Biden campaign had about $240 million in cash on hand across its allied committees, including the Democratic National Committee.Many Democrats are worried that large-dollar donations to Biden’s effort have dropped precipitously as Biden has weighed calls for him to abandon his reelection bid.A dozen Democrats, including two senators, called on Biden to drop out of the presidential race Friday — making it the largest single-day wave of such calls since the debate. Thirty-seven congressional Democrats have said he should step aside.As the number of lawmakers calling on Biden to bow out has risen, the president has also heard directly from allies such as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), who warned him that his candidacy could sink Democratic hopes of taking back the House, as well as former House speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) who urged him to take a more clear-eyed look at his slippage in key swing state polls.Major Democratic donors, who see the possibility of defeating Trump slipping away, are also moving quickly to map out alternative scenarios, including an attempt by some to begin the process of vetting potential vice-presidential candidates who could serve alongside Vice President Harris, should she replace Biden as the party’s nominee.In June, FF PAC — a main super PAC aligned with Biden that intends to spend heavily on ads — raised $33 million, driven by a $15 million influx from a separate Future Forward nonprofit. That outpaced the $23.5 million raised by MAGA Inc., the major super PAC aligned with Trump.Major FF PAC donors in June also included George Soros’s Democracy PAC, which gave $5 million, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Reid Hoffman, who gave $3 million, and James and Kathryn Murdoch, who together gave $1 million.MAGA Inc’s fundraising was driven by gifts of $5 million each from businessman Robert Bigelow, WWE co-founder Linda McMahon and the tobacco company RAI Services."

Spokesman Yahya Saree said the Israeli raids had struck the port, a power station and fuel tank.Those Israeli strikes were a direct response to a rare drone attack on Tel Aviv on Friday for which the Houthis claimed responsibility. The attack killed one person and struck just yards from a U.S. Embassy branch office.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Israeli response to the drone attack made “it clear to our enemies that there is no place that the long arm of the State of Israel will not reach.”Stories to keep you informed

Some states have August deadlines to get on the ballot for the general election, and early voting begins in some places in September. So party leaders probably would try to settle the nomination before the Democratic National Convention begins Aug. 19.Here’s how the process could play out.Biden decides to drop out of the race.
His delegates are free to vote however they would like.
Biden endorses Harris
Biden doesn't
endorse anyone
… or possibly someone else. Biden's delegates aren’t obligated to support the person he endorses, but they may be inclined to do as he wishes, particularly if he chooses the vice president.
Additional candidates may see an opening to jump into the race.
Efforts at unity
Party leaders will try to convince delegates to coalesce around one candidate.
An early vote?
The party has planned a pre-convention virtual vote to officially nominate Biden. It could be delayed or cancelled.

Source: APThere are two types of Democratic delegates.Pledged delegates commit to supporting the candidate state voters chose, although a “good conscience” clause in the party’s rules gives them a bit of wiggle room.The party allocates pledged delegates to each state or territory, and state party officials divvy them out to candidates.Jurisdictions have different criteria, but in general, almost any registered voter deemed to be loyal to the party and the candidate can be a pledged delegate: poll workers, local elected officials, fundraisers, even candidates’ kids.Automatic delegates, often called superdelegates, are the party’s highest-profile leaders. They have the role because of the offices they hold (or held), and the group includes former presidents and vice presidents, Democratic governors, members of Congress and party officials.They are not pledged to any candidate and are not allowed to vote on the first ballot at the convention.Maybe.If the party goes ahead with a long-planned virtual vote, it could officially lock in the nominee before the convention starts on Aug. 19, and the contest would be over.The virtual vote is not a typical part of the process. It was largely set up to confirm Biden as the nominee before Ohio’s ballot deadline, which falls before the Democratic convention this year. Ohio legislators resolved the problem, but Democrats planned to go through with the early vote anyway to avoid any legal challenges that would try to keep Biden off Ohio’s ballot.However, it would allow very little time for the party to coalesce around a new nominee.Even if the virtual vote is canceled, the party could generally agree on a candidate before the convention. In that case, the convention might technically be considered open, but the proceedings could be as drama-free as usual.Democratic leaders would be motivated to settle the question quickly so a new nominee can begin a campaign as soon as possible, said Amy K. Dacey, the executive director of the Sine Institute of Policy and Politics at American University and a former CEO of the Democratic National Committee.“You’re ending a Republican convention where it’s very clear who their nominees are, whose names will appear on the ballot,” Dacey said. “... They now have this moment in time of like 31 days before the Democratic convention, where they have their nominees in place and they’re all campaigning.”Biden could try to tip the scales toward unity by asking his nearly 3,900 delegates to back his preferred candidate. They wouldn’t have to comply, but they were chosen for their loyalty to him and may be inclined to do what he asks.But if there is no consensus before the delegates arrive in Chicago, the Democrats would have their first open and contested convention since 1968. That one, also in Chicago, went so catastrophically awry that the party overhauled the way it chooses candidates.AT THE CONVENTION

A nominee is chosenJust to get their name in the roll call vote, each candidate would need the signatures of at least 300 delegates, and no more than 50 can come from a one state.We would probably know early who the contenders are, Dacey said, citing the short window of time available to drum up wider support. “If I’m somebody who wants to get my name in in a contested convention, the minute I have those 300 names, I’m going to say it,” she said.Behind-the-scenes maneuvering and dealmaking would rev up to warp speed as state party bosses try to corral their delegates into a voting bloc.Once everyone is in Chicago, candidates and their surrogates probably would blanket not just the convention floor but also hotels, bars and other assorted hidey holes looking for delegates to woo.Things have gone off the rails in past open conventions, when candidates clawed for every vote.In a Politico oral history of the 1976 Republican open convention, attendee Tom Korologos, former ambassador to Belgium, recalled a Gerald Ford delegate falling and badly injuring her leg. He said that rather than rushing her to a hospital, other delegates splinted her leg with convention programs and kept her within voting distance because they feared her replacement would cast a ballot for Ronald Reagan. (Ford won the nomination battle but lost the presidency to Democrat Jimmy Carter, who in 1980 lost to Reagan.)Soon enough, the first roll call vote would occur.If a candidate were to get a majority of delegates’ votes on the first ballot, that person would become the nominee, and everyone could finally relax a little.But if no one has a majority, a second vote would take place.At that point, the convention would be considered “brokered,” a term coined in long-ago conventions when party power brokers threw all their dealmaking, arm-twisting might into finagling votes. There hasn’t been one of those since 1952.The toned-down 2024 version of that scenario would be that, starting with the second ballot, the superdelegates enter the voting pool.Voting would continue, round after round, until a candidate got the votes of a majority of all delegates and would be named the party’s nominee.While it probably would make good television, party division playing out on the convention floor is hardly the ideal scenario.In 1924, the Democrats needed 103 rounds of voting to finally settle on compromise candidate John Davis after the two highest vote-getters withdrew. It didn’t work out well. Incumbent president Calvin Coolidge beat Davis in a landslide.Additional sources: Brookings Institution; “2024 Presidential Nominating Process: Frequently Asked Questions” by the Congressional Research Service; Ballotpedia, The Green Papers.Artur Galocha contributed to this report.

WaPo_22,Venezuela’s presidential election: How to run against an autocrat,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/21/venezuelan-election-maduro-machado-gonzalez/,2024-07-21 18:00:03.407578,,"GUANARE, Venezuela — María Corina Machado’s day began at 3 a.m., with the news that the head of her security team had been detained by police.Venezuela’s most popular politician had already seen dozens of campaign staff and volunteers arrested this year, as the government of Nicolás Maduro escalated repression against the opposition ahead of what he pledged would be a free and fair election. Machado’s security chief was her closest aide as she drove across the country. The Venezuelan government, which has blocked Machado from the July 28 vote, has also barred her from getting on a plane.With less than two weeks remaining before the election, Machado and her team pushed ahead. They planned another rally in a pro-government stronghold, where they knew little would go according to plan.Over the course of the day Wednesday, her team was stopped at more than a half-dozen police and military checkpoints. They found the road blocked by asphalt trucks. The local vendor contracted to set up the speakers and stage for her rally in Guanare was detained by police, his trucks and equipment seized.There would be no stage, but there would be an ocean of people — tens of thousands of supporters filling the streets of this city about 270 miles southwest of Caracas to see Machado speak from atop a dump truck.“When I go to an event, I don’t know if I’ll have a stage, I don’t know if I’ll have sound, I don’t know if I’ll have transportation,” Machado told The Washington Post. “We are breaking all the myths of a political campaign.”These are the logistical headaches of running against an autocrat.Machado has been rallying crowds for the opposition since she won a primary last year with more than 92 percent of the vote. Venezuela’s Supreme Court, controlled by Maduro, has barred her from holding public office until 2030. So instead, she’s promoting and campaigning for a stand-in: Edmundo González, a 74-year-old former diplomat.Polls show González leading Maduro by double-digit percentage points. But it’s Machado, the longtime critic of Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, the founder of Venezuela’s socialist state, that the crowds come to see.For the past decade, the authoritarian government has forbidden Machado from leaving the country or traveling by plane. The opposition’s low-budget campaign has little access to government-controlled media. Highways in Caracas are lined with large billboards touting Maduro; not one promotes the opposition. The campaign doesn’t hand out promotional materials or coordinate buses for rallygoers, she said. It depends on volunteers, social media and word-of-mouth outreach.“We don’t have fliers, we don’t have posters,” Machado said. “I don’t offer people anything, but people offer us their things — their car, their house.”Six staffers, including the campaign director and head of communications, have been leading efforts from inside the Argentine embassy in Caracas, where they’ve been holed up for more than four months to avoid arrest warrants. The result is a campaign run on Zoom, on WhatsApp, and on social media.Two other campaign organizers are in prison. Foro Penal, a legal organization that focuses on human rights, has counted 103 detentions in the past year.Many aren’t campaign workers or volunteers. They’re truck drivers, hotel owners, sound technicians. Since the start of the official campaign on July 4, the government has shut down, fined or otherwise penalized at least a dozen restaurants and hotels for hosting González or Machado. González says he now travels with a lunchbox to avoid putting other people at risk for supplying him food.“It’s like the opposite of the Midas touch,” said Alfredo Romero, the president of Foro Penal. Anything Machado touches, it seems, can be shut down or seized.Venezuela’s Ministry of Communications did not respond to a request for comment.Authorities last week detained a businessman in Táchira who had hosted Machado and her team in his home two weeks earlier, his lawyer said. This week in Carabobo, police detained the driver of Machado’s truck.“It’s a pattern being repeated in every state,” said Alby Colmenares, a campaign organizer in Carabobo.On her way to Carabobo, Machado’s team again ran into a checkpoint. Machado stepped out of her vehicle, walked past the police and climbed onto the back of a motorcycle.“We are doing this for you guys,” she told the officers. “You’ll see. In 15 days, Venezuela will change.”The arrest of Machado’s security chief, Melciades Ávila, followed their visit to a restaurant in Aragua state. Two women there began shouting at Machado; Ávila spoke with the women, video of the incident shows, and then quickly moved the candidates to a secure location.Ávila was accused by the government of gender-based violence. He was released late the next day.On Wednesday, Machado prepared to give a rally in Guanare in Portuguesa state, where Chávez once enjoyed one of his highest vote margins.Rafael José Salcedo, the 55-year-old owner of a local company that rents out sound equipment for weddings, graduations and quinceañeras, was sitting parked where Machado planned to speak when more than 20 police officers approached.One officer told him he wasn’t allowed to set up the sound equipment.“I haven’t unloaded anything, I haven’t put anything on the ground yet,” Salcedo responded, he told The Post. “I’m waiting for them to give me the permit.”The officer told him they were taking him to the police station. When he asked why, Salcedo said, he was told “They’re the orders.”Salcedo, his brother and a friend were detained for about six hours, he said, until Machado’s event was expected to end. Officers seized his two trucks and his stage and sound equipment — his livelihood for more than 30 years — and told him he would have to go to Caracas after the election to try to get them back. Without his equipment, Salcedo is now out of work.Machado’s campaign, meanwhile, was left to improvise.“Getting sound in half an hour for an event with more than 50,000 people is very complicated,” said Julio Balza, communications aide. “People are afraid to rent us the sound or the press truck. We work with what we have.”Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people were flooding Guanare’s main avenue to hear Machado.“They always do this, they take away the sound system and she always finds the way,” one woman said. A drone flew overhead; locals suspected the government. Just blocks away, Diosdado Cabello, a lawmaker close to Maduro, was holding his own campaign event.Octavio Zambrano, a 50-year old artisanal craftsman, waited in a wheelchair outside his home for a glimpse of Machado in her caravan.“If she doesn’t stop, that’s okay — we will go to the rally anyway,” he said. “She is very clever. She knows how to dodge what Maduro throws at her.”In the end, Machado needed no stage. At 4:30 p.m., she appeared on top of her van as the crowd waved Venezuelan flags and trumpeted vuvuzelas. She eventually stepped onto the top of a truck and spoke.“They blocked the streets and we overcame all of the obstacles,” she said. “They cut the power and take away our sound, we do it a cappella.”The following morning, Machado woke early to return to Caracas for the funeral of a friend. When she and her team stepped outside, they found their cars had been vandalized, the oil drained from one and the brake hoses cut on the other."

WaPo_24,Have the Olympics lost their luster? Paris will provide the answer.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/21/olympic-viewership-2024-paris-olympics/,2024-07-21 17:27:03.407578,,"For parts of three decades, Bob Costas was the television face of the Olympics in the United States, leading NBC’s coverage of 11 Games and talking Americans through celebration, scandal and even a bomb in Atlanta. Eight years after his last Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Costas believes the Games have lost some of the magic that once made them mandatory viewing.Maybe it’s because the past three Olympics were held in distant Asian time zones while America slept. Or perhaps it’s the sense that the two most recent Games, held in pandemic Tokyo and Beijing, seemed to happen less because of sport and more to meet the contractual obligations of sponsors and television networks. Or it might be the uncomfortable stench of human rights abuse swirling about the Beijing Games in 2022, followed four days later by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The Olympics, he said, need “to get their groove back.”In 1984, the Los Angeles Games saved a bankrupt and demoralized Olympic movement with an innovative self-funded approach that launched a golden era of booming broadcast rights and sponsorships that led to financial successes in cities such as Barcelona, Atlanta and London.But with the Paris Games about to begin, the Olympics appear to be at another crossroads. Global leaders such as Russia’s Vladimir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping have used Olympics to solidify their power, mucking the Games with political quagmires and doping scandals. The costs for host cities have ballooned, and cities have been left with impractical facilities that symbolize wasteful extravagance. And there’s a growing sense that the Olympics don’t carry the same awe with younger generations as they did with those before them.Many in the Olympic world are hoping these Games will do what Los Angeles did 40 years ago.With Paris, Costas said, Olympic leaders “have a chance to do something really unique.”Paris has planned a spectacle like no other Olympics before, with Opening Ceremonies on the Seine and competitions held on or beside the Champs-Élysées. The Eiffel Tower will soar over everything. Organizers have financed most of a manageable budget through private sources, and they’re placing an emphasis on art and scene and elegance.“We need a spectacular Games,” said Terrence Burns, a sports marketing consultant who has worked for the IOC and other entities around the Olympics. “We need Paris to remind us of what it was that persuaded us to watch over the years. I can’t overstate how important Paris is to resetting expectations.”In November, IOC President Thomas Bach stood in the vast U.N. chamber and said the world is in a “dangerous downward spiral.”The “scourge of war and violence is growing,” he told the General Assembly. “Political, social and economic divisions are gaining more ground.”Later, in a hallway, he described his dire summation of society’s decline as an opportunity.“The world is really longing for something unifying among all these tensions and confrontations,” Bach said.The Olympics, he added, can be that something.But can they really? Berlin’s 1936 Games helped galvanize nationalism in a pre-World War II Nazi Germany, five Olympics have been canceled because of world wars, and boycotts led by the United States in 1980 and the Soviet Union in 1984 fractured the notion that sports existed outside of politics.Bach was at the United Nations that day for the ceremonial ratification of the Olympic Truce, a nonbinding vow based on the ancient Greek Olympics and revived in the 1990s under which world leaders agree not to attack other countries from one week before the Olympics until one week after the Paralympics. It’s the kind of document the IOC likes to uphold — and one  Putin has trampled in recent years, launching invasions of Georgia, Crimea and Ukraine during the truce.Russia’s annexation of Crimea was especially humiliating for the IOC because it took place between the 2014 Olympics and Paralympics held in a Russian resort, Sochi, a Games forever tarnished by revelations of the host country’s state-sponsored doping program.Russia “has become the elephant in the room” for the IOC, said Michael Payne, a onetime IOC marketing executive and the author of “Olympic Turnaround,” which describes how the Games revived themselves in the 1980s and 1990s.Putin’s attempt last year to claim athletes from the seized Ukrainian territories gave the IOC an opening to suspend the Russian Olympic Committee for Paris. Still, the attempt to allow a small number of Russians and Belarusians to compete in Paris as what the IOC calls “independent, neutral athletes” has angered many Ukrainians.Russia, though, is far from the Olympics’ lone political problem, even if fears persist of a Russian-led cyberattack on the Paris Games similar to what U.S. officials claim occurred at the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics.In the winter of 2022, Beijing’s zero-Covid bubble, filled with dystopian images of workers in hazmat suits, showed the world a vastly different China than the optimistic one that emerged at the city’s first Olympics in 2008. It was an Olympics of strict quarantines, lockdowns and vigilant policing of dissent.Each day, the IOC held a press briefing that included a representative from Beijing’s Olympic Organizing Committee. Western journalists flooded IOC officials with tough yet pertinent questions, while Chinese reporters directed benign, seemingly scripted queries to Beijing officials. Questions from western reporters about topics such as human rights drew immediate rebuke from the Beijing officials.“Whatever the Olympic ideals are, [Beijing in 2022] was the antithesis of that,” Costas said.Those 2022 Games were in Beijing only because Oslo, the front-runner, dropped its bid in 2015 when public support collapsed as potential costs climbed. That same year, Boston, picked by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee as the American candidate for this summer’s Games, also backed out for similar reasons. Two years ago, British Columbia refused to fund a Vancouver bid for the 2030 Winter Olympics, saying it was too expensive. Brisbane, the 2032 summer host, is overhauling its original plan after construction expenses were higher than estimated.The two most expensive Olympics ever were Sochi, which Russia claims cost $50 billion, and Beijing’s $44 billion Games in 2008. Voters in Western democracies don’t want to throw billions at the Olympics, especially for stadiums that won’t have a purpose afterward. This is how three Games in 15 years came to be in Russia and China.“One of the difficulties when you have a movement that is essentially aspirational is that you have to make the Olympics opportunity available to everyone and not just those with the right principles,” said Richard Pound, a powerful IOC member who, along with Payne, helped the IOC modernize. “You end up with hard countries. You don’t want to award the Olympics to countries based on their policies; you want to award them based on their ability to organize an Olympics.”Heather Dichter, a professor at England’s De Montfort University who studies Olympic bids, agreed costs discourage many countries from showing interest in hosting.“The Olympics is a huge cost, and it comes with the concern of the white elephant venues as a legacy,” Dichter said. “How many sliding venues do you need in the world? Do you need a velodrome?”Games planners are finding out. Organizers of the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics are rushing to build a sliding center in the mountains outside Cortina. The bobsled, luge and skeleton track will be on the site of a historic run abandoned in 2008 because it was too expensive to maintain. A similar fate has befallen the track in the Italian Alps built for the 2006 Turin Olympics because it, too, wasn’t used enough to justify the expense of keeping it online.In recent years, the IOC has attempted to eliminate the elaborate and expensive promises competing cities felt compelled to make by having potential hosts negotiate privately with a small group of IOC leaders until a clear leader emerges. It’s also supposed to cut out the temptation for contending cities to bribe IOC members for their votes.While the new awarding rules might have stopped the bidding wars, it has shrouded the process in secrecy, putting decisions that could have dramatic economic impact on cities in the hands of a tiny group of IOC officials known as the Future Host Commission. This has led to skepticism over a lack of transparency.Still, the new approach has done something much bigger by quietly pushing the next six Olympics (Paris, Milan-Cortina, Los Angeles, French Alps, Brisbane and Salt Lake City) to places with democratically elected governments, possibly adding a seventh in 2038 by announcing extended negotiations with a Swiss bid for those Winter Games.“What [Bach] has done is he’s de-risked the process,” Burns said. “The days are gone when you could see a Sochi or a PyeongChang win. Bids for propaganda purposes are gone.”How much that can hold, however, is a question. Brisbane’s ability to host the 2032 Games remains in some doubt, and India Prime Minister Narendra Modi is widely expected to make a Sochi-style bid for the 2036 Summer Olympics, as are cities in China, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.For years, the IOC has been able to count on robust television rights deals and corporate sponsor programs to keep the money flowing, 90 percent of which it says it distributes among sports federations. But behemoth broadcast rights deals are not guaranteed in perpetuity.NBC, which has the U.S. rights to the Games through 2032, saw ratings for its prime-time telecast in Tokyo drop 27 percent from the Rio Olympics in 2016. Months later, the tumble in Beijing was worse, a 42 percent decline from the 2018 PyeongChang Games.Network executives still don’t know how to assess the drop, unsure whether it’s attributable to the lifelessness of the two pandemic Olympics, a sign of a changing viewership in which streaming services cut into television ratings or a decline in audience interest.Are there enough people under 30 to care about events such as modern pentathlon, dressage and rowing? Or even long jump and swimming? Does the long-running dominance of the U.S. women in water polo matter in a world ruled by clicks and Snaps?“The Olympics is getting a little old; it has the potential for aging out,” said Irwin Kishner, a partner at law firm Herrick Feinstein who negotiates sponsorship deals throughout sports.In 2014, the IOC ran what it called a “sports lab” at that year’s Nanjing Youth Olympics in China to test four sports under consideration for future Olympics. Kit McConnell, the IOC’s sports director, said the goal was to see how a different offering of sports would appeal to younger fans.The experiment was part of a larger mandate the IOC created called Agenda 2020, a Bach initiative that became a series of recommendations to modernize and reform the Olympics. One of the key parts of Agenda 2020 (now known as Agenda 2020 Plus Five) is to make the Games more appealing to future generations.From Nanjing came skateboarding and sport climbing, which along with surfing were added provisionally in Tokyo and formally in the past year, joining another new sport, three-on-three basketball. A similar test four years later at the youth games in Buenos Aires produced squash, which will be added at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.McConnell said he has seen the new sports bring new energy to the Olympics. Skateboarders, he said, were “maybe not fully engaged with the Olympic Games and the Olympic movement prior to skateboarding being in the Olympics,” but the addition means the Games are reaching “a massive global audience.”“We measure that side of things through hard data,” he continued. “And we saw some really positive metrics coming through there.”At the same time, a flood of new sports risks diluting what the Olympics historically have been. Burns cautioned that simply “chasing the red flag of youth culture” risks loading the Games with events that “are fleeting and faddish.”Then there is what Pound callls “the dance with the esports devil”: a series of esports tournaments and now the creation of an Olympic Esports Games that will be held separately from the actual Olympics.“It will be interesting to see if oil and water mix,” Pound grumbled.Weeks after Pound made his comments, the IOC unveiled a partnership with the Saudi Arabia Olympic Committee to host the inaugural Olympic Esports Games in 2025, part of a 12-year deal that calls for Olympic Esports Games to be held regularly.Burns has spent much of his career selling the splendor of an event built on peace and sport, ideals that he still holds dear. But he worries the Olympics are losing some of what he calls their “specialness.”“All the athletes of the world would be in one place,” he said. “Now you have the world all around you. Now the world comes together all the time. It used to be that there was no such thing as seeing a Russian athlete. Now kids see Russians every day in places like the NBA and NHL.”Olympic officials “are perpetually walking on eggshells trying to keep out of the line of fire,” Payne said. Some believe the Games’ problems get amplified without context, overshadowing the stories of inspiration.“There’s certainly a lot of corruption in a lot of societies — it’s not more in the Olympics — but the Olympics draw more attention,” Pound said. “It’s an instant-reaction problem. But if you take a step back, is it really an Olympic problem? Or a perception problem?”So it is up to Paris to make the Olympics special again. Most around the Olympic movement — from IOC officials to advertisers to television broadcasters to social media companies jumping into the Games — are pinning their hopes on these next few weeks. If Paris can’t inspire audiences with its grand boulevards and Renaissance buildings, what will?“I think it can be a reset moment,” said Angela Courtin, YouTube’s vice president for marketing.YouTube is betting big on the Paris Games by sending a fleet of creators to cover the proceedings in ways others can’t. So are TikTok and Snap. All say they are convinced young people are as interested as ever in the Olympics even if they might not watch traditional prime-time network telecasts. Executives from all three platforms say their data indicate that kids want to see and hear about events that unite the world.Paris organizers, reeling after losing the 2012 Games to London, tried to impress the IOC with a proposal that encouraged fans to spend time in the middle of the city, with most of the sports in clusters near Roland Garros and the Stade de France, but not in the city center. Then, after winning the bid in 2017, they decided to go for transcendence.Sitting in his office near the main stadium, with the tip of the Eiffel Tower peeking through the window blinds, Paris 2024 CEO Etienne Thobois  said he and his staff studied building temporary stadiums to cut costs, which led them to ask how they “could make temporary extraordinary?”As the IOC added skateboarding, 3x3 basketball and breaking to the program, 2024 planners came up with the idea of putting them all in Place de la Concorde, the site of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette’s executions  and the fountain from “The Devil Wears Prada.” Then came the most outrageous idea of all: moving the Opening Ceremonies to the Seine.“Paris is a gift that comes at a great time,” said Gary Zenkel, NBC’s president of Olympics. “Having the opening ceremony on the Seine and having the most compelling three hours [of TV] with the world watching? Yeah, bring it on!” he said. “The Olympics are going to soar on the back of that.”The bold plan is also fraught with potential disasters. Such a wide-open ceremony can’t completely be protected. Promises to clean the Seine enough to allow the swimming portion of the triathlon might be too much to deliver, even after Paris and other municipalities have paid a total of $1.5 billion on the Seine project. A heat wave could make the temporary stadiums throughout the center of the city too hot to bear. The city’s public transit might be overwhelmed.Tony Estanguet, the president of Paris 2024, often laments about “the pressure to be audacious.” Delivering what he has promised could become too much. But success, Pound said, could “change the way people experience the Olympics.”Costas can’t imagine the Games fading away. Viewers will always tune in, even if it’s through new devices and apps.Such compelling human drama won’t be “relegated to secondary-viewing status,” he said.He looks at these next three Olympics and imagines people becoming dazzled by the beauty of Paris, the stunning scenes of the Italian mountains and the gauzy ethereal late-day glow of a Los Angeles Games and sees opportunities for the Olympics to enchant the world again.“This is a window of opportunity, starting with Paris, a grand setting in a great historic city,” he said. “How close will [the Olympics] come to be what it once was? We’re about to find out.”"
WaPo_25,The miracle of 1984: How Los Angeles saved the dying Olympics,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/21/1984-olympics-los-angeles-us-summer-games/,2024-07-21 17:23:03.407578,,"When the International Olympic Committee met in 1978 to pick a host for the 1984 Summer Games, it had just one candidate, Los Angeles, after the only other bidder, Tehran, dropped out during the early days of Iran’s Islamic revolution.No one else wanted the Olympics.The costs were seen as prohibitive — and with good reason. Financial problems forced Denver to give back the 1976 Winter Olympics, and Montreal’s 1976 Summer Games left the city a then-astronomical $1.5 billion in debt.The Games’ ideals of peace and unity had frayed as well. Terrorists had attacked the 1972 Munich Olympics, leading to the deaths of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches. Two years after Los Angeles landed the Olympics by default, the United States led a boycott of more than 60 nations at the 1980 Moscow Games to protest the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan. Many of the Soviet countries threatened to do the same in 1984.Two months before the Olympics, a Newsweek cover story asked what then felt like an appropriate question: “Are the Games Dead?”“The general view was that the Olympics had been good for the 20th century but were too big and too costly to continue,” said sports consultant Michael Payne, who had been hired by the IOC in 1983 to revise its marketing strategy.Then came Los Angeles with an Olympics run by a young travel executive named Peter Ueberroth, who brought new funding ideas built on television deals and corporate sponsorships.The success was transformative. For two weeks in the summer of 1984, the Los Angeles Games boomed as a nonstop celebration of the United States. Without the Soviet Union, East Germany and other eastern powers that did indeed boycott, the United States won four times as many gold medals as anyone else, turning the first Summer Games in the country since 1932 into a chest-pounding demonstration of American might.Ueberroth’s financial model was a runaway success, not only covering the costs but yielding a $233 million profit.Other cities around the world watched what happened in Los Angeles and decided they, too, could pay for their own Olympics. Instead of being one of the final editions of a moribund movement, the 1984 Olympics ignited a four-decade explosion that has turned the Games into biennial extravaganzas that only recently have shown signs of flagging, placing this summer’s Paris Olympics at a similar inflection pointCalifornia was in the middle of a tax revolt around the time Los Angeles was awarded the Olympics. In June 1978, the state’s voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 13, a groundbreaking initiative that limited property taxes. Later that year, Los Angeles residents — afraid the Games would be another Montreal — passed their own referendum, Proposition N, that blocked the city from using public funds for the 1984 Olympics.Into this climate walked Ueberroth in March 1979. The newly elected president of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee was 42 and had little experience with sports aside from being a college water polo player. He, too, had voted for Proposition N. Though he ran one of the country’s largest travel companies, most people in the Olympic world had never heard of him. On his first day, he was handed a cardboard box with bills costing $300,000. He used $100 of his own money to open a checking account for the committee.The official Olympic report from 1984 would note that Ueberroth was “disheartened” to learn that 90 percent of the previous two Summer Olympics had been state-funded. But he had one advantage: While much of Montreal’s debt came from the construction of an elaborate Olympic stadium, Athletes’ Village and facilities, Los Angeles already had stadiums, starting with the Coliseum, which had been constructed for the 1932 Summer Games. The LAOOC would have to build only a swimming facility, velodrome and shooting center.Still, without government money, Ueberroth had no traditional way to pay the bills in the cardboard box, let alone for an entire Olympics. It soon became clear to him and his core group of leaders — attorney Harry Usher, marketing director Joel Rubenstein and television executive David Wolper — that they would need to commercialize their Olympics.
To get started, Ueberroth and Wolper attacked the way television rights were sold for the Games. Host cities always had negotiated their own broadcast deals but hadn’t been savvy about it. In 1976, ABC paid just $25 million for the Montreal Games.Certain the American networks would spend far more for the country’s first Summer Olympics in 52 years, Ueberroth and Wolper attempted to stage a bidding war among ABC, CBS, NBC, ESPN (then a fledgling cable channel) and Tandem Productions (a production company co-founded by sitcom creator Norman Lear), requiring each to deposit $750,000 for a seat at the table. This gave the LAOOC more than $3 million that Ueberroth invested in short-term funds that generated nearly $1,000 per day in interest.“Those were the kinds of brains we were working with,” said Rich Perelman, who ran the Los Angeles Games’ media operations. “With the money paid from the TV deposits and [later] ticket deposits, we operated off the interest all the way into 1983.”In the fall of 1979, ABC agreed to pay $225 million for the rights to broadcast the Los Angeles Olympics and another $100 million to handle television production for the rest of the world — a cost host cities had absorbed previously. The $325 million was so far beyond what the IOC had imagined that it had negotiated in advance to take just $33 million of Los Angeles’ TV money.“That was a blockbuster,” Richard Pound, a longtime IOC member who at the time was among a small group trying to modernize the organization.Ultimately, Ueberroth and Wolper got another $61.7 million in rights from the world’s other broadcasters.Ueberroth, now 86 and largely out of public view in recent years, did not respond to multiple interview requests made through intermediaries. But in his memoir, “Made in America,” he writes that he believed he would need at least a half-billion dollars to run the Games, so he looked toward corporate America.Much like with television rights, the IOC had no marketing strategy. To that point, Games organizers cut tiny sponsorship deals with hundreds of companies, who paid almost nothing for the right.Rubenstein came up with an idea: Instead of making small deals with several sponsors pitching similar products, why not seek higher fees for the exclusive rights? He and Ueberroth set a minimum bid of $4 million, far more than the companies were accustomed to spending for Olympic sponsorships. But Coca-Cola and Budweiser quickly agreed to be the official soft drink and beer companies of the Games. McDonald’s soon followed.When others balked, Ueberroth stood firm. In his book, he tells of how Kodak, long affiliated with the Olympics, offered just $2 million, so he gave Japanese rival Fuji three days to present a better offer. Fuji did, eventually agreeing to pay $7 million. Kodak was irate.“Time and time we went back to [sponsors] and asked for more,” Ueberroth writes. “They always gave. We had them. They knew it.”Though Ueberroth was an Olympic outsider, he had a remarkable understanding of exactly what the Los Angeles Games needed. Those who were around him describe a buttoned-up and reserved man whose sharp stare and slightly ajar nose, broken in his water polo days, made him quietly intimidating.“An intense guy,” said Terrence Burns, a sports marketing consultant who has worked for the IOC and has co-written several cities’ bid proposals in recent years. “Very good at eye contact. He’s creative. He’s a very precise guy. He doesn’t have a lot of time, to be honest with you, for chitchat or wasting anyone’s time. He gets right down to business.”“There were people who were absolutely afraid of him,” Perelman adds. “Most people, I think, found him to be demanding.”Ueberroth’s frugality became an obsession. He boasts in his memoir about delaying the first $25 million television rights payment to the IOC for a day to get an extra $9,000 of interest. He pushed corporate sponsors to help pay for upgrades to existing facilities such as the Coliseum and convinced McDonald’s to fund the construction of an outdoor swimming stadium. He convinced 7-Eleven to come up with money for the velodrome. Both companies got to put their names on the new facilities — the kind of naming-rights deals that are now commonplace.Renata Simril, the CEO of the LA 84 Foundation, a nonprofit started with the Games’ surplus, said Ueberroth told her years later that he required Usher to approve any expense more than $1,000.They “were certainly frugal and checking every dollar,” Simril said.But Ueberroth surprised employees with cash rewards when they did something especially well and often walked around the offices chatting with workers at day’s end.Edwin Moses, then the world’s best hurdler and a member of the IOC’s Athletes Commission, said Ueberroth was the first official related to the Olympics who urged athletes to market themselves.Perelman said Ueberroth was “ahead of his time” for believing diverse office staffs make businesses better and actively seeking women and people of color for leadership positions. He also instructed his staff to use contractors and vendors from underserved and often ignored south Los Angeles.“He wanted the Games to look like the city and the surrounding neighborhood,” said David Simon, who ran government relations for the Games.With so much money pouring in, Ueberroth decided to sell the torch relay as well. Ueberroth hoped a circuitous 9,300-mile run from New York to Los Angeles would ignite nationwide enthusiasm for the Games. He convinced AT&T to pay the operational costs and got each runner to donate $3,000 to charity for their one-kilometer segment carrying the torch.Ueberroth’s great plan was actually working.Two hours after the torch relay began, the Soviet Union announced it was boycotting the Olympics.“That was a gut punch,” Simon said.The Soviet government said it was pulling out over security concerns and the threat of anti-Soviet protests in the United States, but the move was understood to be retaliation for the U.S.-led boycott of the Moscow Games four years earlier. Soon, other Soviet-bloc nations joined the boycott. A clause in the ABC deal allowed the network to renegotiate if there was a boycott. Ueberroth was worried.He and Simon worked frantically, even flying to Havana in hopes of convincing Cuba to attend the Games despite Soviet pressure. Ultimately, 14 countries, including Cuba, skipped the Olympics. Romania was the only Soviet-affiliated country to defy Moscow. ABC did not ask for money back.The boycott did a strange thing, however. It didn’t cause Americans to lose interest; it made them want the Games even more. The Cold War was at its peak, and President Ronald Reagan had packed his 1984 reelection campaign with anti-Soviet rhetoric. Movies such as “WarGames,” “Red Dawn” and “The Right Stuff” stoked a patriotic fever. And as the torch began moving across the country, people filled roadsides and highway shoulders just to catch glimpses of it.When the torch finally got to Los Angeles in late July, it seemed as though the whole country was talking about the Olympics. Pound, who carried the torch for a segment in the Los Angeles enclave of Pacific Palisades, was overwhelmed by the size of the crowds, several rows deep on the sidewalks who watched him run. Many held their hands over their hearts. Pound, a Canadian, choked up at the sight.“It was an emotional experience,” he said.The Games began July 28 with Opening Ceremonies, orchestrated by Wolper, designed to show all of America’s technological might. A man in a jetpack flew around the Coliseum, dozens of doves were released, and the more than 101,000 in the stands at one point held up colored cards that turned the stadium’s stands into a sea of flags from the participating countries.Rafer Johnson, the 1960 decathlon gold medalist who had been a college star at UCLA, was the last to carry the torch, running it up a mechanical staircase that rose from the stadium’s east plaza, so he could light the cauldron atop the Coliseum’s gothic peristyle.From the stadium’s press box, Reagan declared the Games open. Later, he told ABC the Soviets “are the losers” for their boycott.American runner Joan Benoit-Samuelson, who a week later would win the first Olympic women’s marathon, remembers many of the world’s athletes rushing to embrace the Romanian athletes as they waited to walk into the Coliseum.“To thank them for coming,” she said.Then the United States started winning. And winning. And winning. Carl Lewis was the biggest star, taking gold in the 100 and 200 meters, the 4x100-meter relay and the long jump. Moses won his 105th consecutive 400-meter hurdles race. Mary Lou Retton became the first non-Eastern European to win the gymnastics all-around competition. Greg Louganis won two diving golds.Most of them probably would have won with the Soviets or East Germans competing, but dozens of other American took golds they might not have otherwise, such as the nine U.S. boxers who won their weight classes, the seven American wrestlers who took gold in a sport usually dominated by the Soviets or even the men’s basketball team, a unit of college stars led by Michael Jordan, who had just been drafted by the Chicago Bulls.Chants of “USA! USA!” filled the venues as American athletes paraded to the top of medal stands.The Los Angeles Olympics were the first to truly benefit from 1972’s Title IX ruling as a generation of girls who had more equitable opportunities to play sports reached adulthood. In addition to Benoit-Samuelson, U.S. women such as cyclist Connie Carpenter-Phinney and swimmer Tracy Caulkins won gold. The U.S. women’s basketball team took the first of its nine golds in 10 Games.When she ran through the Coliseum’s tunnel at the end of the marathon, Benoit-Samuelson was stunned to find more than 77,000 people roaring as they watched on the stadium’s video boards.“I just didn’t think there’d be a lot of people wanting to spend their Sunday morning watching a bunch of women run 26.2 miles,” she said. “And there are a lot of pundits who thought that women really couldn’t handle that distance.”All of it played out as a prime-time television drama in the golden late-afternoon California light known in Hollywood as the “magic hour.”“It was the beginning of the television sports empire, so it was huge [and] live,” Moses said. “People didn’t have to stay up late at night. It was in L.A. Hundreds of thousands of people had the opportunity to go. My family was there. My high school track coach was there; friends were there. And people were just enthusiastic about it.”Many in Los Angeles, including Ueberroth and the Games organizers, had worried the Olympics would be marred by the area’s usual summertime ailments: traffic, smog and heat. But amazingly, most residents stayed home for those two weeks, easing congestion on the freeways. Without so many cars, there was little smog, and the ocean breezes kept the temperature down.“People were just giddy, like, ‘How cool is this?’” said longtime ABC and later NBC broadcaster Al Michaels, who has lived in the Los Angeles area for much of his life and did all the track and field television commentary. “So L.A. looked a little different then, just for those two weeks, and [that] obviously had a lot to do with the spirit of the Games and the enthusiasm and the excitement that surrounded those Games. It was a different time. It was almost like nirvana in Los Angeles.”When the Olympics were over  and the LAOOC determined it had made $232.5 million, Ueberroth took the profits and started what first was called the Amateur Athletic Foundation, known now as the LA84 Foundation. The nonprofit gave 60 percent of the Games’ surplus to the U.S. Olympic Committee and used the remaining $93 million to help fund and expand youth sports in Southern California, something it continues to do today.“I think Ueberroth believed in the city, and he believed he could do it,” Burns said. “The ethos of California in the ’80s was optimism. He ran [the Olympics] like a business. The IOC didn’t understand this; they had no choice but to go along with it.“L.A. basically created Olympic marketing. It became a business — a very professional business.”The $325 million the LAOOC wrangled from ABC had stunned the IOC and its president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, who had been elected in 1981 with the mandate to modernize the Olympics. About a year before the Games, Adidas chairman Horst Dassler told IOC members, “You, the IOC, are the most valuable and sought-after trademark in the world, yet the Olympic rings are the most-exploited trademark in existence.”For IOC officials looking for ways to make the Olympics work financially, Ueberroth essentially gave them a blueprint.“Once we saw the L.A. [television] number, we said, ‘This is the way we can finance the Olympic movement, and we need to take control,’” Pound said. “We had to evolve in the sponsorship business, and we had to figure out what was the Olympics brand? What assets did we have? How do we get ourselves off the companies’ donation budgets and into the C-suite?”Payne later wrote a book about that time called “Olympic Turnaround.” In it, he tells how Samaranch quickly took away the television rights from the host cities and put them in the IOC’s control, overseeing the bidding for the 1988 Winter and Summer Games broadcast rights months before the Los Angeles Games even happened.Samaranch also led the creation of the IOC’s own exclusive corporate sponsorship program, much like Ueberroth did in Los Angeles. The program still exists, guaranteeing the IOC a significant amount of money from a small group of companies, separate from the sponsorships each Games’ host sells as well.The IOC now uses some of this money to help hosts pay for their Olympics. In the ensuing four decades, several cities have held Games that either made money or helped revive their images, including Barcelona, Salt Lake City, London and Beijing, whose 2008 Summer Games were seen as the opening of China to the rest of the world.Ueberroth and his Olympics were the inspiration for all the Games have become.But at what cost?Commercialization might have saved the Olympics and even democratized them by funding sports in countries that might never have been able to afford Olympic teams, yet the costs of the Games have soared, leading to an arms race in which hosts willing to spend heavily have built new facilities that since have been orphaned. The 2014 Sochi Winter Games cost $55 billion. And while Paris 2024 Olympic leaders expect to have raised enough money to cover their bills, the Games still will cost over $9 billion.Though the Los Angeles Games are widely portrayed as uniting the vast and divergent sprawl of communities for two weeks, the city’s police accumulated an arsenal of weapons to secure the Olympics that it would use in those same south Los Angeles neighborhoods that Ueberroth tried to involve in his Games. Some have connected aggressive law enforcement tactics in south Los Angeles to the police department’s preparations for the 1984 Olympics.Ueberroth, himself, was never bigger than in the summer of 1984. Time magazine named him its man of the year, and Major League Baseball hired him as commissioner weeks before the Games started, though he didn’t start until after the Olympics. The frugality that worked so well with the LAOOC didn’t translate to baseball. He urged team owners to spend less on players, a mandate that helped teams become more profitable but also led to sloppy collusion cases designed to suppress free agent markets. A series of arbitration rulings against baseball led to the owners having to pay the players $280 million in damages.Ueberroth resigned as baseball commissioner in 1988, months before the end of his first term. He then served as head of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee’s board for four years and ran unsuccessfully for governor of California. Even his financial savvy drew some criticism in the aftermath. In his book, Payne writes that several of the sponsors whom Ueberroth cajoled to spend heavily were irked when the Games wound up with a profit, saying they felt tricked into writing bigger checks to promote Ueberroth’s image.But at a time when the Olympics looked to be done, the Games that Los Angeles won by default had a transformative effect.“You can’t overestimate how important those Games were to the [Olympic] movement,” Burns said. “They saved it.”"
WaPo_26,Are you a workaholic — or a hard worker? Why it matters for your health.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/07/21/workaholic-addiction-perfectionist-traits-quiz/,2024-07-21 19:00:03.096401,,"An accountant who fills out spreadsheets at the beach, a dog groomer who always has time for one more client, a basketball player who shoots free throws to the point of exhaustion.Every profession has its share of hard chargers and overachievers. But for some people — roughly 15 percent of workers — the job becomes all-consuming. A healthy work ethic develops into an addiction, a shift with far-reaching consequences, says Toon Taris, a behavioral scientist and work researcher at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.Taris stresses that the “workaholic” label doesn’t apply to people who put in long hours because they love their jobs. Those people are considered engaged workers, he says. “That’s fine. No problems there.” People who temporarily put themselves through the grinder to advance their careers or keep up on car or house payments don’t count, either.1/3The growing consensus is that true workaholism encompasses four dimensions: motivations, thoughts, emotions and behaviors, says Malissa Clark, an industrial-organizational psychologist at the University of Georgia in Athens.In 2020, Clark and colleagues proposed a multifaceted framework: Workaholism involves an inner compulsion to work, having persistent thoughts about work, experiencing negative feelings when not working and working beyond what is reasonably expected.Workaholism crosses demographics and can exist in any job.Jack Hassell, a human resources specialist in Christchurch, New Zealand, interviewed 15 self-identified workaholics who came from a variety of backgrounds, including sports, law and human resources. Some of the workaholics grew up in poverty and felt driven to never go back, while others came from wealth but could never shake the feeling that they should be doing more to get ahead and stay ahead. “The patterns of workaholism are essentially the same, but they arrived there in completely different ways,” he says.Yet some personality types are especially likely to fall into the work trap. Perfectionists, extroverts and people with type A (ambitious, aggressive and impatient) personalities in particular are prone to workaholism, Clark and co-authors have found.They expected low self-esteem to be a risk factor, but it wasn’t. Workaholics may put themselves through the wringer, but it’s not necessarily out of a sense of inadequacy.And certain workplaces are more likely than others to foster addictions to the job, Taris and occupational health scientist Jan de Jonge reported in an overview in the 2024 Annual Review of Organizational Psychology and Organizational Behavior. This includes companies that encourage competition and long hours.Managers and self-employed workers also are more at risk than people who work under someone else’s control, a 2016 survey of more than 16,400 workers from Norway found.Workaholism could be on the upswing because of Zoom, Slack and other technological advances that make it easier to work anywhere, anytime. Working from home, which became widespread during the pandemic, probably created a new group of always-on workers who lost sight of the boundaries between work and home life.It’s troubling, Clark says, that “even just your average worker might now start to be more of a workaholic.”Any worker who slips into workaholic habits may notice some gains — more sales, more overtime pay, more words in the document — but those small victories may be fleeting. For all their efforts, the never-stop go-getters aren’t necessarily better at their jobs.In a 2016 meta-analysis, Clark and co-authors found no correlation between workaholism and job performance, meaning workaholics aren’t covering themselves in glory or even separating themselves from the pack.A 2015 study found that people who put in extra-long workdays received roughly the same level of performance reviews as those who only pretended to work similarly long hours. Later investigations — including a 2020 Italian study that tracked evaluations of more than 500 workers over two years — also found little to no correlation between workaholism and performance.In fact, for some workaholics, a mediocre performance review could be considered a best-case scenario.“They create a lot of work for themselves, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re doing good work,” Taris says. “We know that if people work too hard, they spend little time on recovery.” This, he adds, leads to fatigue and exhaustion — and that increases the likelihood they will make errors that are harmful to the organization, their clients or themselves.In certain settings, mistakes on the job are dangerous. A 2018 study of 1,781 nurses in Norway tracked the factors that predicted serious work-related incidents, including harming or nearly harming patients, harming or nearly harming themselves, dozing off at work or breaking equipment. Workaholics were consistently more likely than their co-workers to commit every type of error tracked by the study.Clark’s 2016 analysis, which compiled results from 89 other studies, found that workaholics suffer impacts far beyond the workplace. A 2006 study of 174 white-collar workers in the United States and Canada found a correlation between workaholism and life dissatisfaction. The higher a person scored on a workaholism scale, the less they enjoyed life.A 2004 study separated 5,853 full-time workers in Belgium into eight categories, including work enthusiasts, work addicts, relaxed workers and disenchanted workers. The work addicts reported more health complaints than any other group. Work enthusiasts, in contrast, reported practically no health complaints, a reminder of the vast difference between addiction and enjoyment.In her many interviews with workaholics, Clark has seen how overcommitment to the job can go hand in hand with unhealthy lifestyles, including excessive drinking and failing to get enough exercise or sleep. A former llama rancher, for example, told Clark that she wouldn’t allow herself to eat or relieve herself until her work goals were met, even if that meant hunger and discomfort. “I just had to get that stuff done, or I would feel like I was no good.”Hassell interviewed an academic who got a wake-up call during the massive Christchurch earthquake of 2011. When the earthquake started, they were reluctant to quit working and leave their desk, Hassell says.Finally forced to exit the shaking building, the academic had an epiphany. “They realized, ‘Oh my God, I was so consumed with work I was willing to almost die.’”No interventions have been scientifically proved to reliably cure workaholism, Taris says. Still, there may be ways to blunt the worst consequences.A 2020 study of 400 working adults in the United States found that workaholics who also practiced mindfulness — the ability to be aware of their emotions at any given time — were less likely to suffer from negative moods such as irritation and distress.Built-in recovery opportunities, such as scheduled downtime, are helpful, says Nina Junker, a work psychologist at the University of Oslo in Norway. People who have trouble shutting down from work should try visualizing or memorizing all of the day’s achievements, she says. “That makes it easier to call it a day and enjoy one’s leisure time.”There are also commonsense steps that workplaces can take to help employees find more balance. They include checking on work hours and reaching out to anyone who goes too far for too long; limiting access to work-related materials after work hours; and encouraging upper management to model healthy approaches to work.A 2023 study of nearly 9,300 salaried workers at small-to-medium companies across Europe found that “soft controls” — management practices that encourage autonomy and empowerment — can reduce the incidence of workaholism and burnout.But if workaholics truly want to keep working past the point of no return, Taris says, there’s not much anyone can do to stop them. Friends and family members can make their pleas, and bosses and companies can change their policies, and some workaholics might see the light and scale back. Or they might be too busy writing one more email.This article was published in conjunction with Knowable Magazine."
WaPo_27,Jesse Owens won 4 Olympic golds — then was paid to campaign against FDR,https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2024/07/21/jesse-owens-paid-campaign-fdr-landon/,2024-07-21 18:59:03.096401,,"Adolf Hitler arrived too late to see Jesse Owens blazing down the track in Berlin’s Olympic Stadium on Aug. 3, 1936, winning the 100-meter race in a record-tying 10.3 seconds and edging out fellow Black American Ralph Metcalfe.But the German chancellor witnessed the day’s remaining events, and “with Der Fuehrer stroking his moustache in the royal box and brocaded swastikas flying in the breeze,” the United Press reported, “Old Man Nordic supremacy took an awful kicking around on the first day of competition in the Olympics.”Owens stood on the podium in front of the crowd of 110,000 and saluted. “My eyes blurred as I heard the ‘Star Spangled Banner’ played first faintly and then loudly and then saw the American flag slowly raised for my victory,” he later recalled. On his right, a German Olympic official gave the Nazi salute.Germany’s dictator didn’t shake hands with Owens or most other winners. “Hitler Snubs Owens” was the headline in U.S. newspapers. Owens later had his own version: “Hitler didn’t snub me — it was our president who snubbed me. The president didn’t even send me a telegram.”Owens delivered this verdict while campaigning against Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt and for Republican Gov. Alf Landon of Kansas. To stump for Landon, Owens had been paid $10,000, more than $225,000 today.On Friday in Paris, Olympic athletes will begin competing for the kinds of world records and fame Owens achieved 88 years ago when he won four gold medals. Returning home aboard the Queen Mary, the 22-year-old Owens vowed to turn his gold into money. Contrary to frequent stories that he lived in poverty right after the Olympics, he initially did fantastically well with promotions.But “as the months passed, no one had offered me a job,” Owens recalled later about the racism he faced as a Black American. “When I came back to my native country, after all the stories about Hitler, I couldn’t ride in the front of the bus. I couldn’t live where I wanted.”Owens grew up in Cleveland as one of 10 children of former Alabama sharecroppers. Working odd jobs, he attended Ohio State University, where he gained fame as the “Buckeye Bullet,” winning track competitions. In 1936, he and 17 other Black athletes traveled with the U.S. team to Berlin for the “Nazi Olympics,” overseen by a dictator who preached Aryan racial supremacy.At the Games, Owens won his second gold after the 100-meter with a record broad jump. “Jesse exploded beyond 26 feet as he hurled himself through space,” sportswriter Grantland Rice wrote. “The Negro collegian seemed to be jumping out of Germany. The American cheering started well before Jesse was airborne.” The Washington Post’s Shirley Povich wrote in his column. “Hitler declared Aryan supremacy by decree, but Jesse Owens is proving him a liar by degrees.”Owens took his third gold medal running the 200-meter race in record time, ahead of Mack Robinson, the brother of future baseball great Jackie Robinson. Owens’s running was “a thing of beauty, a joy to behold,” and “one of the most amazing achievements in the ancient art of foot racing,” the New York Times reported. Owens won his fourth gold in a four-man relay race.Back in the United States, after a ticker tape parade in New York City, Owens went to the Harlem apartment of aging vaudeville dancer Bill “Bojangles” Robinson, who introduced him to an agent. The two men, for a cut, arranged for the Olympic hero to appear at exhibitions and events and with a traveling jazz band for thousands of dollars.Both political parties wooed Owens to win Black voters in the election. Democrats offered to buy him a house in Ohio, but a Sun Oil executive paid him a large fee to campaign for Landon, William J. Baker wrote in his 1986 book “Jesse Owens: An American Life.” Owens also was angered that Roosevelt hadn’t congratulated any of the Black Olympic athletes.“The President of this country didn’t even send me a message of congratulations,” Owens told a campaign rally of 10,000 Black people in Baltimore, the Baltimore Sun reported. “People said he was too busy. But Governor Landon sent me one.”Roosevelt crushed Landon, but Owens continued to live high.“I’ve made $65,000 [more than $1.4 million today] since the Olympics, through personal appearances, exhibition runs, political rallies and endorsing various things,” Owens told International News Service in early 1937 as he prepared to take his jazz band on tour. He was a rich American in the Great Depression. He bought a new Buick, an 11-room house in Cleveland for his parents and a house for himself, his wife, Ruth, and the first of their three daughters. He opened the Jesse Owens Dry Cleaning Company with a big sign offering “Speedy 7 Hour Service by the World’s Fastest Runner.”By 1940, the runner’s fame and riches had faded. “The world has changed for the Alabama-born speedster who had started picking cotton at 6 to help out at home,” United Press reported. The “world’s fastest human [has] endured the bitterness of bankruptcy in four short years and now is engaged in quietly building a life for his wife and child in comparative obscurity.”To make money, he sometimes traveled with a Black baseball team and raced against horses in the outfield. “I was no longer a proud man who had won four Olympic gold medals,” Owens said later. “I was a spectacle, a freak who made his living by competing — dishonestly — against dumb animals. I hated it.”In the 1940 election, Owens supported Roosevelt, declaring he “has done more for the advancement of the colored people than any president since emancipation,” the St. Louis Argus reported. He challenged boxing champion Joe Louis, who backed Republican Wendell Willkie, to a debate. FDR won an unprecedented third term, but Owens wasn’t invited to the White House. (Owens finally got presidential recognition in 1955, when Dwight D. Eisenhower named him “Ambassador of Sports.”)Owens was relatively moderate on civil rights. At the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, he supported the removal of sprinters John Carlos and Tommie Smith from the U.S. track team for raising gloved fists in a “Black power” sign while receiving medals. When Owens talked to the team, “the black athletes all but spat in his face,” Jeremy Schapp wrote in his 2014 book “Triumph: The Untold Story of Jesse Owens and the Hitler Olympics.”Owens backed Republican President Richard Nixon and was welcomed at the White House in 1972.

WaPo_28,What to expect from Israel-Gaza war protests during Netanyahu’s visit,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/21/dc-protests-netanyahu-congress-israel-gaza/,2024-07-21 18:59:03.096401,,"Thousands of people plan to protest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Congress this week in several demonstrations with varying demands, including a cease-fire in the war, the release of hostages taken during Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack and an end to U.S. aid to Israel.Brian Becker, the executive director of the ANSWER Coalition, an organizer of a protest on Wednesday, said demonstrators are outraged that Netanyahu has been invited to speak to Congress and are demanding he be arrested, citing the chief International Criminal Court prosecutor’s announcement in May that he was seeking to charge Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yehiya Sinwar with war crimes and crimes against humanity.“We consider it a disgrace that Benjamin Netanyahu has been invited to speak to both houses of Congress,” Becker said. “We will be protesting in the many, many thousands to say that he should not be welcomed.”Organizers estimated 5,000 people will attend that protest — held on the day of Netanyahu’s address — according to a permit application submitted to the National Park Service.On Tuesday, families of hostages — many traveling from Israel — will gather on the National Mall to share the stories of those taken in the Oct. 7 attack and express hope for their release, said Bar Ben Yaakov and Matan Sivek, an Israeli couple living in the District who are leading advocacy efforts in the United States for families of hostages.“Netanyahu’s visit to the U.S. has added a lot of stress and uncertainty for the families,” Yaakov said. “Many of them, including us, were really hoping he would travel to the U.S. with the good news of having sealed the deal.”These protests come after weeks of deadlock over a cease-fire deal.About 45 relatives of hostages will gather on the National Mall at 6 p.m. Tuesday and hold posters of the hostages still being held and demand their release.On Wednesday, there are several demonstrations planned:U.S. Capitol Police have “been working around-the-clock with our federal, state and local partners” to prepare for Netanyahu’s visit, according to a statement. Although Capitol Police declined to share specific measures it is taking to accommodate the expected crowds, the agency did say it plans to add more officers, including those from outside agencies.“We anticipate a large number of demonstrators to show up,” Capitol Police said in the statement.D.C. police spokesman Paris Lewbel said in a statement that while there are no known threats, the agency is working with federal law enforcement partners to monitor the demonstrations.As of Friday evening, D.C. police have not announced any street closures. Follow @DCPoliceTraffic on X for the most up-to-date information. Capitol Police said the agency will provide information about road closures and public access to congressional buildings closer to Netanyahu’s visit.This is a developing story and will be updated."
WaPo_29,A 20-year-old’s perplexing place in the catalogue of American gunmen,https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2024/07/21/thomas-crooks-adam-lanza-shooters-assassins/,2024-07-21 18:59:03.096401,,"In the months after an isolated, deeply troubled 20-year-old took his mother’s AR-style rifle and opened fire inside Sandy Hook Elementary School, gun sales in America exploded, partly fueled by the threat of a fresh ban on the assault weapons that would become the firearm of choice for some of the country’s most infamous killers.Millions of Americans rushed to stock up, and among 2013’s gun buyers, investigators would later learn, was a man in western Pennsylvania whose son was also in elementary school. He purchased an AR-style rifle that fired 5.56mm rounds.A decade later, his son — also isolated, troubled and 20 years old — shouldered that same rifle atop a sloped roof in Butler, Pa., and, according to authorities, fired it eight times in an apparent attempt to assassinate former president Donald Trump.Thomas Matthew Crooks, shot and killed seconds later, remains enigmatic. A registered Republican who’d once given a $15 donation to a progressive group, he was, according to people who knew him, not overtly political or ideological. He did well in school, drew little attention in his middle-class, Bethel Park neighborhood. He didn’t leave behind a significant online presence or manifesto spelling out his motivation. Why he pulled the trigger, investigators still don’t know or, at least, have yet to say publicly.Where he fits into the ever-expanding catalogue of notorious American gunmen could take years to understand, according to experts and historians. He’s hard to categorize, in part because his still-evolving portrait evokes the profile of a mass shooter, at least one of whom he researched. But Crooks wasn’t a mass shooter, instead becoming what some historians believe to be the youngest person to make an attempt on the life of a current or past president.It’s important for investigators to understand what leads to any killing, but it’s essential in this case, at this moment, when some fear the country’s political fissures could lead to more bloodshed, said Jeffrey A. Engel, founding director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University.“If this is an individual who was like a school shooter, disturbed and angry, and found this as a way to lash out, that’s a terrible, terrible social problem we need to deal with, but it’s not a question of our democracy,” Engel said. “It’s important that we know whether or not we need to worry about political violence, more than any other violence.”Three decades ago, the U.S. Secret Service set out to analyze 83 actual or would-be assassins who had acted between 1949 and 1996, eventually publishing a report intended to help law enforcement better understand, and thwart, these attacks.By study’s end, the researchers had come to a stark conclusion: “There are no accurate — or useful — descriptive, demographic, or psychological ‘profiles’ of American assassins, attackers, and near-lethal approachers.”Crooks conforms with some of the report’s broader trends: 86 percent were men, 77 percent White; more than half were single, and three in five had no children; most attempts were on presidents, members of Congress or other public figures being protected by the Secret Service.In other ways, Crooks was anomalous. He was younger than the vast majority, few of whom were students at the time. Just 30 percent used rifles or shotguns, and only one in four traveled elsewhere in their state, or one beside it, in pursuit of their target. There’s little evidence, so far, that Crooks had a “history of resentments or grievances against others,” as 97 percent of those studied did.And then there are the mass killers Crooks conjures. At a briefing with lawmakers, law enforcement officials shared that Crooks had researched Oxford High shooter Ethan Crumbley as well as his mother and father. Earlier this year, James and Jennifer Crumbley became the first parents of a mass shooter ever convicted of homicide. In a rampage that ended the lives of four schoolmates in 2021, Crumbley, like Crooks, used a firearm that had been purchased by his father.Crooks parallels the Sandy Hook Elementary shooter, Adam Lanza, in several obvious ways. Besides their ages, both were gaunt and withdrawn, with limited social circles. Both grew up in homes stocked with firearms and had a clear interest in them: Lanza, who aspired to become a Marine, studied guns and fired them with his mother at a shooting range; Crooks, who, investigators and reporters have learned, belonged to a shooting club and died in a T-shirt adorned with the logo of a popular YouTube channel dedicated to guns, had tried out for his high school rifle team but did not make it because he was a poor marksman. Both 20-year-olds showed signs of rising distress — Crooks researched major depressive disorder on his phone, lawmakers were told — before their violent acts. And Lanza, too, committed his assault with a parent’s semiautomatic rifle.But the similarities end there, said Peter Langman, a psychologist and the author of “Warning Signs: Identifying School Shooters Before They Strike.” With crude explosive devices packed into his car, Crooks traveled to a rally an hour from his home and took aim at a 78-year-old former president, grazing him, killing firefighter Corey Comperatore and gravely wounding two other spectators. In Newtown, Conn., Lanza killed his mother before returning to a school he’d once attended and gunning down six staff members and 20 first-graders.Their personal lives diverge as well. When Langman assesses young shooters, he consistently finds that they faltered in key “life domains”: education, employment, intimacy, family and social network.“If you look at Lanza,” Langman said, “he was failing in, essentially, all five of those domains.”Lanza, who was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, struggled to function in classes, instead attending home school through much of his teens. He suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder and was especially sensitive to light and sound. He stopped speaking to his father two years before the shooting and communicated with his mother, with whom he lived, through email. He was obsessed with death, compiling a detailed spreadsheet of 400 people who’d committed various acts of violence.Crooks, Langman said, appeared to have been succeeding in several of those life domains.He worked at a nursing home and, after graduating from community college with an associate’s degree in engineering science, planned to attend Robert Morris University in Pittsburgh this fall. It’s unclear whether he dated or what his relationship was with his parents — both licensed professional counselors — but he still lived with them. Those who knew him said that, at least in high school, he maintained a small but consistent group of friends.“This is not a case of someone who’s failed in everything and feels like he’s a loser, a nobody, and the only thing he can do with his life is go out in a blaze of glory,” Langman said.Still, he cautioned, it’s early in the investigation. Langman recalled the case of Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people and wounded 53 others at Pulse nightclub in Florida. A cursory look at Mateen would have suggested that he also led a relatively successful life. He had a wife and child and worked as a security guard.“People in those situations are not supposed to throw it all away, because it’s too much to live for, but he did,” Langman said. “When you see that, then you have to really look inside the man. Not look at the externals, but look at the internals.”That look, Langman said, revealed a psychopath.Mateen beat his wife, she later alleged, and while he did hold a job, he failed in his aspiration to make a career in law enforcement, at least in part because of his preoccupation with violence.Who Crooks really was has yet to be revealed, but that doesn’t mean it never will. After the Sandy Hook shooting, many people concluded that Lanza had left behind no online footprint.“It turned out not to be true at all,” Langman said. “He covered his tracks very well.”So well, in fact, that six hours of audio Lanza recorded wasn’t discovered on YouTube until 2021 — nine years after his death.And yet, what drove him to such horrific violence remains unknown.Despite public perception, assassins’ motives can be equally difficult to flesh out.“When the first crack of the bullet is heard, aimed at a political figure, it’s natural for us to presume, logical even, that this is politically motivated,” said Engel, the presidential historian.That, he added, is often not the case.In 1881, President James Garfield’s killer, Charles J. Guiteau, who was delusional, felt slighted over a job he didn’t get. Nearly a century later, Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme tried to shoot President Gerald Ford, at least in part to win the approval of cult leader Charles Manson.“I’m still not sure that we have a great grasp of what was motivating Lee Harvey Oswald,” Engel said of President John F. Kennedy’s killer. “And of course, most famously, John Hinckley, who shot at Ronald Reagan, did it basically to impress a girl” — the actress Jodie Foster.Crooks, it appears, wasn’t only interested in Trump. On his phone, investigators found images of President Biden, Attorney General Merrick Garland and a member of the British royal family. Along with the rally in Butler, Crooks had looked up information on August’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago.Those disparate inquiries, experts say, suggest that Crooks may have largely been driven by a desire for attention and chose his target out of convenience.“This is a person likely trying to make headlines, going out in a final act,” said Jillian Peterson, a forensic psychologist and co-founder of the Violence Prevention Project. “This is the thing that they’re going to be seen for.”Perhaps no school shooter motivated by a quest for fame received more of it than 18-year-old Eric Harris, who, along with a friend, Dylan Klebold, killed 13 people at Columbine High in Colorado in 1999.“I want to leave a lasting impression on the world,” Harris once wrote. Propelled by intense media coverage of his image, backstory and demented world view, Harris’s persona has inspired dozens of gunmen in the 25 years since, including Lanza.Over the past decade, public mass shooters have won far less notoriety as their numbers have multiplied. Even some of the deadliest killers — the ones at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Tex., and the Route 91 Harvest festival in Las Vegas, for example — are not household names.In a single week, Crooks’s name has appeared in thousands of headlines as his image spread across the globe. Peterson fears that other disillusioned fame-seekers who once would have turned to a different sort of violence may now be emboldened to attempt this kind.“It has changed the course of the political conversation. It’s having ripple effects. It’s actually changing politics, and potentially the election in some way,” she said. “So, if one 20-year-old kid with an AR-15 can pull that off, that is something that’s scary.”Peterson also noted there is only one commonality among all isolated, troubled young men who eventually become shooters, and America has struggled to address it since long before Crooks’s father bought that rifle 11 years ago: their access to a gun.Perry Stein and Devlin Barrett contributed to this report."
WaPo_30,Returns of the ‘Amazombies’: Unwanted packages are a retail nightmare,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/21/amazon-prime-day-returns/,2024-07-21 18:59:03.096401,,"PLEASANT HILL, Calif. — Outstretched arms laden with packages, they stagger in from the parking lot and wander the aisles, searching for the returns counter.At Staples, Kohl’s and The UPS Store, they’re known as the “Amazombies” — Amazon customers who show up each day with hundreds of packages to return, turning store associates’ jobs into a retail horror story.When Amazon signed deals to turn brick-and-mortar retail stores into Amazon drop-off points, it was supposed to be a win-win: easier returns would mean happier customers while bringing more foot traffic into ailing retail locations. But store employees say the “Amazombies” have become a plague on their working lives, wasting staff time without increasing revenue while creating long lines, frayed tempers, and mounting piles of boxes and plastic waste. Some UPS Store and Kohl’s locations have had allocate additional staff just to handle the workload.Amazon “makes up about one-tenth of our profits, but it takes up about 90 percent of the working day,” said Jeremy Walker, a store associate who worked at a UPS Store near Dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day.As the de facto human face of Amazon, these retail employees bear the brunt of customer frustration, even though they have no direct line of communication with the company, Walker said. But the reason he ultimately started looking for a new job was to escape the mindless consumption.“What we’re doing with all these returns, all the plastic,” he said. “It eats at me.”The allure of free returns has played a big part in getting consumers addicted to online shopping. UPS Stores have long accepted Amazon returns, and Whole Foods began taking them shortly after Amazon acquired it in 2017. Kohl’s was next, in 2018, with Staples following last year. These deals with the same retailers whose businesses were decimated by the rise of e-commerce made returns even easier: In 2023, Americans racked up $247 billion in online returns, according to the National Retail Federation.Last year, some UPS stores started charging about $1 per package they handle. Staples and Kohl’s stores do it free, however, hoping it will lead to more in-store purchases, according to store employees.But retail workers told The Washington Post that the increased stress, labor hours and cost of materials make that a bad bet, especially during peak periods like Prime Day — which last week saw millions of Amazon Prime members ordering a record number of products from the site.At Staples, the burden of turning “Amazombies” into Staples customers is on the workers, who hand out store coupons, between 15 percent and 20 percent of which they’re expected to turn into sales, two Staples workers told The Post.Joseph Mobley, a former manager of a Staples in Tallahassee, said the company is “counting on that to save the business.” But many shoppers have moved online permanently.“There’s a reason why they shopped on Amazon and went online to begin with: They’re not brick-and-mortar shoppers,” he said. “And having a hot deal for Charmin toilet paper for $18.99 marked down from $21.99 isn’t going to turn them into a Staples shopper.”UPS Store spokeswoman Casey Sorrell said the company has a “productive relationship” with Amazon but does not “discuss the details of our business arrangements.” Kohl’s spokeswoman Jen Johnson said the company values its associates “for creating a great experience” and listens to any feedback.Amazon spokeswoman Maria Boschetti said that Amazon “customers value the convenience of returning products at partner locations, and our partners tell us that operating these programs boosts their businesses.” She added that the company works with each retailer to prepare for the volume of returns and staffing levels. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)While most “Amazombies” bring one or two items, some shuffle in bearing more than a dozen, and a few bring as many as 50, workers said. The returns have to be scanned, sometimes with an individual code for each item, labeled, bagged, and boxed for pickup. Often, customers are returning an item of clothing they ordered in multiple sizes.When Staples stores in Florida started taking Amazon returns last August, Mobley said “it was a flood,” with some stores getting as many as 1,000 a week.The UPS Store in Texas had to add two extra employees to deal with Amazon returns, and the Staples store in Tallahassee recently allotted eight paid hours per week for Amazon returns.During the lunchtime rush on a recent July day at the Kohl’s in Pleasant Hill, customers returning Amazon packages took the escalator to the second floor at a steady clip. The walls of the customer service area were lined with cardboard boxes of Amazon returns that an employee said used to be stored behind the counter, but had to be moved so workers wouldn’t trip.When one customer came in with a shopping cart full of clothes to return, the attendant at the customer service desk called for backup to deal with the growing line. One of those customers, Ashley Sidney, was returning a portable air conditioner. She said she returns Amazon items at Kohl’s all the time, and loves the speed of the refunds. “It’s usually in my account before I get to the front door,” she said.In theory, dropping off an Amazon return at these third-party retailers is easy.“If you have your QR code ready, and if the scanner is working like it should, and if you have your supplies on hand, it takes five minutes, in a perfect world,” said Mobley, the former Staples store manager in Florida. “But the world ain’t perfect, and people’s phones don’t work and they don’t know what a QR code is, and they want you to help them. It prolongs the process.”Often customers haven’t actually started the return process when they get to the front of the line. Multiples times per day, a customer will come in with improper instructions, not know how to navigate the app or choose the wrong location.Increasingly, Amazon returns don’t require customers to bring a box, which means shoppers’ unwanted purchases are on full display, offering retail workers a unique window into their e-commerce habits.A customer once returned nine chairs he was comparing for use in a medical waiting room to a UPS Store in Virginia, said a store associate who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect his job. Customers there also have returned a bicycle, a television and a mattress, he said.At Staples, where Mobley said a single employee is often expected to cover the phone, the cash register, and floor sales at the same time, “if someone walks in with an Amazon return, you have to stop and do it.” And if you don’t convert enough of those Amazon returns coupons to sales, “you can get terminated,” said a Georgia-based Staples employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their job.In December, thousands of anonymous Staples workers signed an online petition asking the company to drop its partnership with Amazon. Staples did not respond to questions about its employment practices. Amazon said its retail partners are responsible for their employees.Meanwhile, activist investors in Kohl’s, a publicly traded company, have been pressuring executives over the retailer’s relationship with Amazon since 2021, questioning in financial filings whether the returns program is actually profitable.In addition to helping Amazon physically process customer returns, retail employees are also doing customer service for the e-commerce behemoth, workers said.At the Staples in Georgia, a customer who was told she couldn’t make a return because her item was too large had to be removed from the store after getting into a verbal altercation, the employee there said. In Virginia, where the UPS Store charges 11 cents to print a return label, an employee remembered “one gentleman throwing a fit.”“We’re the ones who get yelled at and put down,” said Walker, the Dallas UPS store employee.After years of watching the waste incurred by Amazon returns, the UPS Store worker in Virginia said he has started hassling his wife and kids about what they order online.“Every time you order something, someone in a warehouse picked that, the driver had to drive it” he said. “Multiply that by three or four hundred people in our store alone, all the stores across the country. I try not to think about how many man-hours are wasted.”For Walker, the Texas-based UPS employee, the “rampant consumerism” inherent in the rise of the “Amazombies” was underscored by returned Adidas shoeboxes printed with the words “Together we can end plastic waste.”“I probably put 200 or 300 of those things in these huge plastic bags,” he said."
WaPo_31,72-year-old fends off grizzly bear with handgun while picking huckleberries,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/21/grizzly-bear-attack-montana/,2024-07-21 18:44:03.096401,,"A 72-year-old man is in a hospital after he shot and killed a grizzly bear that attacked him while he was picking huckleberries alone in a Montana forest.The adult female grizzly charged the man, the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks agency said Friday, adding that it was a “surprise defensive encounter.”Before killing the bear with a handgun, the man suffered significant injuries and had to be hospitalized, the wildlife agency said in a statement. It did not immediately reply to questions about the man’s identity Sunday morning.The incident occurred in the Flathead National Forest about two miles north of Columbia Falls, a city of 5,500 roughly four hours northwest of Helena, Montana’s capital.Dillon Tabish, a spokesman for the agency, told the Associated Press that wildlife workers set out cameras in the area to look for the presence of cubs. Even if any are found, it’s not certain they would be captured because it’s difficult to find facilities that will take in young grizzlies.“Depending on the age, we might leave them in the wild because they have a better chance of survival, rather than have to euthanize them,” Tabish said.Grizzly bears have protected status in the Lower 48 states as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, according to the Fish, Wildlife and Parks department.They are the official animal of Montana and reside mostly in the western part of the state, FWP said, but are increasingly roaming into areas they have not occupied for decades.The agency said it shot and killed a different grizzly bear Thursday after a month and a half of reports that it was becoming conditioned to obtaining unsecured food and breaking into houses in and around Gardiner, Mont.Authorities said residents and tourists should remember that “Montana is bear country” and that avoiding bears is better than dealing with them.Attacks by bears are uncommon, but if one crosses your path, running away or climbing a tree is not recommended, The Washington Post has previously reported.While traveling in groups and having bear spray at hand are good ways to avoid a confrontation, the National Park Service says that during a brown or grizzly bear attack, playing dead is the best strategy.“Lay ﬂat on your stomach with your hands clasped behind your neck,” the NPS said. “Spread your legs to make it harder for the bear to turn you over. Remain still until the bear leaves the area.”Fighting back usually increases the intensity of an attack, the NPS said, but if the bear persists, “fight back vigorously. Use whatever you have at hand to hit the bear in the face.”When faced with a black bear, the NPS said, instead of playing dead, try to escape by moving slowly and sideways. If an escape is not possible, fight the bear by focusing on its face and muzzle."
WaPo_32,"Domesticated rabbits can ‘rewild’ thanks to feral DNA, study finds",https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2024/07/21/pet-rabbits-feral-dna/,2024-07-21 18:29:03.096401,,"Feral DNA may help domestic rabbits thrive in the wild, a new analysis suggests, shedding new light on the evolution of an animal that can cause major environmental destruction.Publishing in Nature Ecology & Evolution, researchers looked at the relationship between rabbit genetics and “feralization,” an evolutionary process in which the descendants of domestic rabbits that live in the wild shed characteristics that helped them survive in human settings, taking on those of feral animals instead.The researchers sequenced DNA from 297 rabbits in six populations in South America, Europe and Australia, all places where rabbits were introduced within the past 200 years. They compared the genetic information with the DNA of other wild and domestic rabbits.To their surprise, the researchers discovered that all of the rabbits studied had a mixture of wild and domestic DNA.“This was not what we had expected to find,” Leif Andersson, a professor of veterinary integrative biosciences at the Texas A&M University School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences and a co-author of the study, says in a news release. “We expected that feral rabbits were domestic rabbits that have somehow relearned how to live in the wild. But our findings show us that these rabbits already had a portion of wild DNA helping them survive in nature.”The researchers found that the descendants of domestic rabbits quickly shed the docility and coat colors that humans prefer in pet bunnies, trading them for characteristics that help them thrive in the wild.That might explain why rabbits in Australia, a continent now overrun with wild bunnies, didn’t immediately take over when domestic rabbits were first introduced. The rabbit population surged only after 1859, when the introduction of just 24 wild and domestic rabbits began a population boom that continues to this day.Today, there are at least 150 million feral rabbits in Australia. The animals are considered invasive pests, competing with livestock and native animals, destroying native plants and crops, and even affecting groundwater absorption."
WaPo_33,Going ‘boy sober’ is about more than celibacy,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/of-interest/2024/07/21/boy-sober-dating-sex-celibacy/,2024-07-21 19:59:02.906223,,"Let’s talk about not having sex.Some of our hottest celebs are not doing it. Julia Fox, Lenny Kravitz and Khloé Kardashian have all come out as celibate in the past three months.Enough women appeared to stop having sex (or at least, stopped seeking it) that in May, the dating app Bumble launched an anti-celibacy ad campaign aimed at them. One billboard read, “Thou shalt not give up on dating and become a nun.” (Due to intense backlash, the campaign was short-lived. Bumble later acknowledged it had made “a mistake.”)Not even warmer temperatures could shake the chill. In June, New York Magazine proclaimed it “a summer without sex.” The diagnosis: “Women are sick of dating,” Cosmopolitan UK declared.It’s a season of celibacy — but not everyone is calling it that. Instead, young people are embracing going “boy sober.”At first blush, boy sober may appear to be little more than cutesy Gen Z dating jargon — the New York Times deemed it a celibacy “rebrand.”But going boy sober is about a lot more than abstaining from sex, the people who have done it say. Nor is it about assigning men the blame for the soul-sucking horrors of modern dating.By channeling the increasingly popular language of sobriety (and its association with wellness and self-help), “boy sober” helps people assess why they seek out certain kinds of partners or fall into certain kinds of behaviors, its adopters say.
It’s about reprioritizing your time and attention, away from endless swiping and noncommittal DMs and toward activities that are more fulfilling.
It’s about taking accountability for your own bad behavior.
It’s about healing your relationship to, well, relationships.Hope Woodard recoils at the word “celibate.” It conjures up Wednesday night Bible study at her small-town Tennessee church; the spiral prayer journal in which she, at the age of 13, confessed to having sex (“I’m so sorry,” she wrote); the shame catching at the base of her throat. “Celibate” is the toaster Woodard decorated for a church assignment — her teacher cautioning her to keep it clean and new: “Don’t let anyone use your toaster.”“The word ‘celibate,’ it to me does not give empowerment. It gives, like, chastity belt. It gives purity culture,” Woodard said one recent summer afternoon. She had turned to sex and drinking to help cope with the breakup of her family. Over the years, that tangle of shame and escapism continued to characterize her relationship to sex and men, Woodard said — both had become a “vice.”The tipping point came this past fall. Woodard was reeling from her one-sided “situationship” with a man living in London. She had wounded an on-again, off-again ex with her blunt discussion of her dating life on her TikTok. At the same time, she was helping her mom care for her grandmother who, in the midst of her dementia, was constantly texting her grandfather — who was dead.“My mom will try to help her and my grandmother will scream at her, ‘I don’t need anyone to take care of me except for a man,’” Woodard, 28, said. She worried she may be on the same path.“I was like, I think I’m ruining my own life with my sex and dating habits. And also just not taking care of people who I claim to really love and care about,” Woodard said. She was the villain of her own story.Woodard unpacked her fears with her sister, who coined the term “boy sober.” Woodard enthusiastically adopted it. “Boy sober” brought to mind the year in which she gave up drinking: “[It] changed my life. It was the first time I did an open mic. It was the first time I was really able to get to know myself.”Over the next couple of weeks, Woodard announced on TikTok that she was going boy sober, then shared rules she had set for herself: No dating apps. No dates. No exes. No hookups. (A later addendum: Self-pleasure is fine.)Like why would i go back “What I loved about ‘boy sober’ is that it had no baggage. Like, it was such a new and modern and almost silly word,” Woodard said.Sobriety didn’t used to have that kind of appeal, recalls Ruby Warrington, author of the 2018 book “Sober Curious.” Because of its association with alcoholism and addiction, stigma loomed over it: If you were going sober, it was because you were incapable of moderating your drinking.“The only language we had to describe unhealthy attachment to alcohol was ‘addiction’ or ‘alcoholism’ or ‘alcoholic.’ And those terms just weren’t relatable for the vast majority of people who were questioning their drinking,” Warrington said.Just as terms like “sober curious” offered a more nonjudgmental alternative for people who wanted to examine their relationship with drinking, Warrington sees “boy sober” as a more colloquial, “more human” way to talk about people’s personal struggles with sex and relationships.“Having language like that just allows people to kind of open up and feel more comfortable talking about some of these deeper issues they might be grappling with,” Warrington said.Scroll through social media posts about #boysober and you will see its broad, malleable appeal. Queer men and women have embraced the term. So have straight women who have withdrawn from dating and women who yearn to have sex but have never done so. Straight men have even dabbled with going “girl sober” (though that hasn’t quite taken off).Jasper Bickers, a reedy 21-year-old producer and songwriter, recently penned a song called “boy sober,” also the title of his EP, which deals with the breakup of a romantic relationship. “I wanted to at least hint that there was, like, a light at the end of the tunnel,” Bickers said. He felt the song’s chorus, “maybe I’ll go boy sober,” pointed listeners toward that light.Had he been boy sober during the making of the album? Yes, Bickers said — he may not have been able to complete the project without it. Bickers wrote a song “every day,” he said, and learned how to produce his own music. “That’s what really helped me cope with the loss that I was feeling.”For Alexis Doss, a 33-year-old life and business coach with a “tough love” bent, going boy sober was an opportunity to validate herself outside of a romantic relationship. “I want my relationship with myself to be so strong that a man trying to compete with that would be a challenge,” Doss wrote in her journal.Phatima Kabia went through a boy sober period at the start of her freshman year at Alabama A&M. A no-nonsense 18-year-old, Kabia eschewed romantic study dates and hooking up at parties for watercolors and crocheting.Coming off a high school relationship where she felt she had compromised her boundaries, Kabia was wary of the kind of casual dating that many of her peers have come to expect from their college experience. Instead, Kabia wanted to reconnect with her “inner child,” whom she felt she had let down.As a kid, “I loved being creative,” Kabia said. “I wanted to pick up those things I used to enjoy when I was younger, and really just pour into myself.”When Christy Nguyen, a bubbly 26-year-old veterinary technician and content creator, went boy sober earlier this year, she realized how much she was prioritizing other people’s comfort. When Nguyen took herself out on a solo restaurant date, journal in hand, she worried she was making the staff nervous — what if they thought she was a food critic?“I was catering to their feelings,” Nguyen observed. Going boy sober helped her be “okay with taking up space.”Still, when Nguyen shared a video about going boy sober online, she was met with a few derogatory comments from strangers — all men, it seemed.They told her, “You’re only saying that you’re going boy sober because you can’t get anyone,” Nguyen said. “Or they’ll say things like, ‘Well, have fun growing old and dying alone with your cat.’”Tales of love deferred and soured are as old as time — or at least, as old as our ability to tell a story. Still, for many young people, the dating pool seems to have reached new levels of toxicity.Technology has expanded our dating options with its conveyor belt of potential mates. But with that has come a loss of accountability, some young people say, and the normalization of bad behavior. Dating is now a world of ghosting and situationships, breadcrumbing and lovebombing, catfishing and wokefishing. Physical intimacy can be weaponized in the form of revenge porn.Just as young adults are questioning — and turning away from — supposed rites of passage such as binge drinking, Warrington sees a parallel assessment happening with dating culture: “There’s something about this that doesn’t feel right. You know, it doesn’t feel natural. It doesn’t feel good.”Seismic changes in gender and power dynamics over the past several generations have also impacted dating. In the United States, more women have college degrees than men. Young women in cities such as New York and Washington outearn their male peers. As Alice Evans, a social science lecturer at King’s College London, recently told the Atlantic, “demand for male partners has plummeted because of that economic development and cultural liberalization.”In turn, a small but vocal group of men has vilified women for these gains on their social media platforms. Talking heads on Instagram and TikTok complain that women have become too “greedy” or “materialistic.” Male supremacist groups such as Incels (shorthand for “involuntarily celibate”) and “Men Going Their Own Way” stoke feelings of persecution among their members. Influencer Andrew Tate built a millions-strong following by openly embracing misogyny. Elsewhere, people like Elon Musk fret that lower birth rates (a consequence of women’s growing economic power) will lead to “population collapse.”Woodard has been observing this growing rift between men and women. Perusing “boy sober” on Reddit, she stumbled upon men complaining that it was a separatist movement.“Men are feeling like they’re not getting what they deserve and women are literally losing their rights — and everyone’s sort of blaming each other,” Woodard said.Woodard never intended for “boy sober” to be a bullhorn for straight women “telling men to f--- off,” she said. Rather, she wants it to be a bridge for people across the gender and political divide to talk about sex and relationships.She has put together a string of boy sober shows, in which she invites comedians to tell stories about relationships and dating, but she wants to retool the structure a bit — maybe invite more crowd participation.Since publicly sharing that she was not having sex, Woodard said, “everyone would come to me and just be like, ‘This is what’s happening in my sex life.’”“And I loved listening.”They would talk about the sex they weren’t having, even if they were partnered, and why. One girlfriend who was raised religiously shared that she didn’t feel she ever “had the option not to have sex” while dating.She also encountered straight men who were boy-sober-curious, “who maybe felt a bit of relief about it … like, oh, what an interesting way that I can also talk about my dating and sex habits.” Whether it was the nonjudgmental language of sobriety, her disclosure that she wasn’t having sex or both, “their guard came down,” she said.“It was the first time, even for me, where I was like, neither of us have to actually perform in any kind of way,” Woodard said. “Nobody loses if we don’t hook up or date or whatever.”"

More than 35 congressional Democrats have called for Biden to step aside, according to a Washington Post tally. At a rally Saturday in Michigan, former president Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), reveled in the turmoil that has roiled Democrats since Biden’s halting debate performance last month."
WaPo_35,How a Harris presidential campaign would transform the race,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/21/kamala-harris-campaign-2024-biden/,2024-07-21 19:44:02.906223,,"As of this writing, President Biden hasn’t said he would step away from the 2024 campaign. Democrats nevertheless seem poised to move on. In multiple appearances, including TV interviews and meetings with Democratic lawmakers, Biden has not convinced them he is capable of winning the race, in large part because the race has become about him — his age, his health, his capacity. Each appearance becomes a “Perils of Pauline” moment in which supporters gird themselves for a gaffe or stumble. A race that was supposed to be about Donald Trump is now about Biden’s infirmities.So what would the race look like if Biden were not the nominee?As a preliminary matter, the notion that someone without the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris campaign operation — and without foreign policy experience, vetting on the national stage or the advantage of running on an incumbent’s record — could jump the line ahead of the vice president to take the nomination beggars belief.A random White governor with none of those advantages is supposed to be introduced to the American people, galvanize the party and defeat all competitors — all while displacing the first African American and Asian American female vice president? Beltway pundits can spin all the scenarios they like, but if Harris is not the nominee, a Democratic Party meltdown is nearly certain.So let’s assume that Harris would head the ticket. What then? She could make this a very different race in multiple ways.First, the 59-year-old, fit, energetic Harris would shed the party’s burdens of Biden’s age and health. Nearly 20 years younger than Trump (who would be 82 at the end of a second term), she would finally move the country past the baby boomer generation and embody a fresh, younger generation of Americans. Without Biden attracting questions about his physical and mental fitness, perhaps the media might finally focus on Trump’s unhinged rants, compulsive lying and utter lack of policy knowledge.Second, instead of a referendum on Biden personally, Harris would shift the campaign to being about making a choice: between the Biden administration’s successful, economically productive, forward-looking, inclusive record, and the scary, paranoid and authoritarian vision set out in Trump speeches and the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, which might guide a second Trump administration. Harris could ask whether Americans want:Third, Harris is far more articulate and succinct than Biden, as she demonstrated in dissecting the Trump agenda during an appearance in North Carolina on Thursday. In the same vein, the vice president has been a passionate and compelling advocate for reproductive freedom (a topic Biden seems uncomfortable discussing), evidenced in dozens of her speeches and public appearances. She wields her experience as a prosecutor who handled sex crimes to excoriate forced-birth advocates for telling rape and incest victims they “have no right or authority to decide what happens"" to their bodies. (She says flatly: “That’s immoral.”)Fourth, Harris is uniquely capable, given her prosecutorial background and her role on the Senate Judiciary Committee, to run against a radical Supreme Court that is at the lowest level of approval in history. She has the verbal acuity, for example, to denounce the wide grant of criminal immunity to presidents, the evisceration of voting rights and the substitution of a judge’s discretion for experts’ judgments in the administrative state.Fifth, to the extent that Biden saw erosion in his support among younger voters (including non-White voters), Harris offers the energy to engage and excite them, as seen on her college tours, where she has spoken to standing-room-only crowds on issues that affect their generation in particular (e.g., gun violence, climate change, abortion rights).And finally, Harris can inherit the mantle of international leadership (having toured the world, met with leaders and represented the U.S. at international conferences) without Biden’s burden of personal criticism, deserved or not, on some hot-button issues, including the war in Gaza. (On Israel, Harris has been a stalwart supporter of the Jewish state, outspoken along with her Jewish husband about the abuse suffered by Israeli women at the hands of Hamas, and yet willing to draw cautionary lines with Israel’s truculent prime minister.)Yes, it is impossible to gauge how a candidate will fare before she gets into the race. Prospective polls will not tell us definitively whether Harris gains more votes than she loses. But for Democrats despondent about the constant defensive crouch in which they find themselves, she offers excitement, eloquence, effectiveness on key issues and, most of all, the power to turn attention back on Trump’s substantial character flaws, criminal record and disturbing plans for the future. That is more than Biden can do presently."
WaPo_36,‘Call Me Baseball’: Carly Rae Jepsen threw a postgame party at Nats Park,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/21/carly-rae-jepsen-nats-park/,2024-07-21 21:00:02.704246,,"The chants began late in Friday night’s game, a chorus emerging from dozens lined up in the lower concourse of Nationals Park.Kyle Finnegan was on the mound and the Washington Nationals were one strike away from defeating the Cincinnati Reds. But these chants weren’t for him or for the home team.“Carly! Carly!” intoned the group, several clad in crop tops, rainbow jeans and sparkly skirts. For many of them, Washington’s 8-5 win was merely the opening act.The real show came soon after the game ended, when the infield dirt became a dance floor, a black stage replaced second base and the subject of the group’s calls — Carly Rae Jepsen — walked onto the field wearing a yellow, glittering dress and sky blue tights.Jepsen’s postgame performance, the latest in the Nationals’ summer concert series, drew the group of her die-hard fans to one of Washington’s best-attended games of the year. A crowd of 38,402 filled Nationals Park on a pristine summer evening, over 13,000 more than the team’s average attendance entering Friday.The singer-songwriter and a Major League Baseball team made for an unlikely pairing. Country, rock, reggaeton and hip-hop typically dominate clubhouses and stadiums. Jepsen is a Canadian pop star whose breezy hits, including her 2012 viral breakout “Call Me Maybe,” have cultivated an ardent fan base that skews younger, female and LGBTQ.“She is a genius; she’s an icon; she’s a visionary,” said Katherine McCauley, a 30-year-old D.C. resident who watched from Section 227.McCauley and other fans praised the unadulterated joy in Jepsen’s performances. The feeling was evident during a vibrant hour-long show that featured 15 buoyant songs, fireworks erupting from the stage and Jepsen singing through a seemingly ever-present smile. The audience reciprocated. Some waved phone flashlights, others their arms and, in one case, a red Nationals foam finger.The Nationals’ first summer concert of the season, on June 7, featured rapper Flo Rida and drew a crowd of 39,235. Its success prompted Washington to increase the number of field passes available for Jepsen’s show. The passes, which went on sale June 12, sold out just over two weeks later, the team said.“We look at a number of factors when deciding [performers],” Nationals vice president of events Jonathan Stahl said in an email. “We want to make sure that the overall lineup has something for everyone and that we do not over-index in one particular genre.”Additional concerts with singer-songwriter Teddy Swims and country band Lady A are planned for later this season. And the success of the first two shows could lead to more. Stahl said fans “should be on the lookout … for an exciting addition” to the lineup.Maddy Berner, a 32-year-old D.C. native who attended Friday with five friends, grew up with minimal interest in sports. She had been to a few Nationals games before Friday.“They were long; they were arduous; they were hot; there was little shade; there wasn’t a lot going on,” she said. “… None of it was appealing to me.”But Jepsen gave her a reason to return to Nationals Park.“I was really looking at it as just a concert,” she said. “I wasn’t even considering that I would have to attend the game.”Some even traveled to see Jepsen. Aaron Herschlag, 29, drove from New York to attend his fourth baseball game and his 19th Jepsen concert. Renee Jiang, a 21-year-old software engineer who discovered Jepsen’s music during the pandemic, spent nearly $300 — and endured significant travel delays caused by Friday’s mass IT outage — to fly in from Boston.Jiang had never attended a baseball game. She hadn’t even watched one on TV.“When I heard that this was happening, I was like, ‘Oh, maybe this is finally a chance for me to actually experience what [baseball is] like,’” Jiang said. “I feel like it’s something I probably have been missing out on for a while.”While some attendees came primarily for Jepsen, others saw Friday as a perfect blend of their interests.Drew Rivera loves the Nationals and Jepsen. The D.C. native has been a fan of the team since they moved to the city and attended their 2019 World Series parade.He became a Jepsen fan after hearing her music at a house party in college. That made Friday a perfect night, especially because it came a day after his 28th birthday.Eloise Arcurio, a 10-year-old from Bethesda, was another who came to enjoy her dual interests.Arcurio follows the Nationals casually. She likes to come on Sunday afternoons, when kids are allowed to run the bases after the game, and collects ice cream helmets. Her first concert was when she saw Jepsen at a festival last year. She now loves live music and the pop star.“I couldn’t stop speaking with my hand up like a mic,” she said.“She’s electric, kind of giddy excited that we kind of be able to do both of these things,” added her father, Josh.Friday also brought together friends and family members whose disparate interests melded into a shared experience. Page Forrest, 29, bought tickets for her and her boyfriend Feb. 26, the day the Nationals announced Jepsen’s performance.“My bf is a baseball guy becoming a Carly convert and then there’s me, a Carly stan becoming a baseball girly,” she wrote in a Reddit post under the username Yikes_Brigade. “I have never bought tickets to anything so fast.”Multiple Nationals players, including starting pitcher Jake Irvin, outfielder Jesse Winker and relievers Jacob Barnes and Jordan Weems, stayed after the team’s victory and took in the concert from just outside their dugout.They all watched Jepsen perform many of her greatest hits — including “Psychedelic Switch,” “Kollage,” “Run Away With Me” and, of course, “Call Me Maybe,” which drew the loudest cheers from the crowd.Before she performed the megahit, Jepsen joked that she had forgotten the lyrics. She pointed the mic to the assembled throng and invited it to belt out the familiar words.Some members of her band wore white Nationals jerseys, and Jepsen donned one for the last song of the night, “Cut To The Feeling,” which she sang while waving around her customary inflatable sword.A few hours later, the infield had been returned to normal and Nationals Park sat dark and empty. But the memories endured. Jepsen said at one point during the show that this was a night she would never forget. The fans who again chanted her name as they walked out of the ballpark seemed to concur."

And the agency behind them — the Montgomery County Police Department — plans to double its program over the next few months.“They really have made a difference for us,” County Executive Marc Elrich (D) said Wednesday night, speaking at a community meeting in Bethesda, the latest area for coverage. “We’re happy to be expanding.”Across the country, thousands of public safety agencies are using drones in some form, according to drone industry officials. Many do so after an incident is well underway. Montgomery’s program is designed to get its drones to the scene ahead of responding ground units by launching them during the opening seconds of a 911 call.Now nine months old, the program has become a national leader among some 50 programs using drones as “first responders” that are either in development or operating in the United States, according to the officials. Montgomery’s two responder drones are equipped with video cameras that can zoom in on what someone is holding in their hand and can track their movements. Drone operators can also send the video feed to the ground officers’ laptops, tablets or cellphones.The department surpassed 1,000 flights this month, and says the technology has enabled it to not just catch criminals but also to quickly determine which calls do not require a police response, so that cruiser units can be sent elsewhere and officers’ time isn’t wasted. “The name of the game is speed,” said Capt. Jason Cokinos, supervisor of Montgomery’s drone responder operations.Here is a look at the program, the expansion plans and civil liberties concerns."

WaPo_39,ATF traced Trump rally shooter’s gun using records opposed by some in GOP,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/07/21/tracing-trump-rally-gun-atf-closed-business-records/,2024-07-21 20:00:02.704246,,"Soon after a Secret Service sniper killed the man who attempted to assassinate Donald Trump, officers grabbed the AR-style weapon by the shooter’s body and started to record its make, model and any details they could glean.The young man carried no ID. If the gun was purchased legally from a licensed dealer, law enforcement officials hoped to use the serial number etched onto the side of the weapon to figure out who he was.They were able to do so in about 30 minutes, federal law enforcement officials said in a statement. The search used sale records from an out-of-business gun store that the government is required to collect — but which Republican lawmakers and the gun lobby would like to place off-limits.The attempted assassination of a former president and current White House nominee gave the public a glimpse into “the time pressure that law enforcement, the ATF agents and our local police partners are under to solve these cases and advance the investigation,” said Steven Dettelbach, director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. “Having the ability to search the records is absolutely a big part” of that work.The federal government is prohibited from compiling a national database of gun owners. Those who oppose allowing the government to collect records from shuttered gun shops said they are equivalent to such a database, which they believe could be used to track and punish law-abiding gun owners, even though the records cannot be searched by a person’s name.ATF, which is responsible for regulating sales and licensing of firearms, is allowed to keep sale records only from gun stores that have closed. The nation’s 80,000 or so operating licensed gun dealers are required to maintain their own records, with law enforcement agencies contacting the shops directly if they need to identify the buyer of a weapon used in a crime.“They could make a door-to-door confiscation list with these out-of-business records and that’s a huge threat to the Second Amendment,” said Aidan Johnston, director of federal affairs at Gun Owners of America, which has backed legislation that would destroy the types of records that ATF relied on to trace the firearm to the Trump rally shooter.While Trump was receiving medical treatment Saturday, law enforcement officials at the Butler, Pa., rally site called employees of the National Tracing Center in West Virginia, which is open 24 hours a day, to relay the serial number and other details of the shooter’s weapon, according to people briefed on the tracing process who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal details of the probe.That was step one.From there, a West Virginia employee searched the serial number in the ATF computer system, which found the licensed dealer that sold that firearm. The weapon was purchased at a now-closed gun store by a man who lived in Bethel Park, Pa. — about an hour from the rally site. Since the business was no longer operating, the ATF’s West Virginia facility had the federal form the buyer completed.Some of the records at the facility are only in paper form. But the sale records for this closed shop had been digitized, according to people familiar with the investigation. Employees searched through scanned copies until they landed on one that matched the serial number of the gun used in the assassination attempt.Within roughly a half-hour of the tracing center receiving the weapon’s serial number, officials learned that the father of 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks purchased the weapon in 2013. Authorities soon identified the younger Crooks as the gunman in the shooting and later said they have no evidence that the father purchased the gun for his son to use.The identification of Crooks reflects a speeded-up version of the traces that occur hundreds of thousands of times each year when authorities find a gun potentially linked to a crime and discover it was purchased at a store that has since closed. A typical request takes seven or eight days to complete. An urgent request can take up to a day. That’s a dramatic improvement in turnaround from two years ago, according to ATF data.But officials familiar with the tracing of Crooks’s weapon said the request was pushed to the front of the line. It helped that the gun was purchased legally and that Crooks’s father was the original owner. Officials say more and more crimes are linked to “ghost guns” — weapons made from homemade kits that can be assembled into firearms — which typically do not have serial numbers and cannot be traced.Dettelbach says that ATF is well within the bounds of the law and is not maintaining a registry by keeping the records. The West Virginia center, he said, is filled with tons of boxes of records from defunct gun dealers. While most have now been digitized, he said, searching them is still a cumbersome process.The records are organized by the name of the shuttered gun dealer, with officials needing to manually open each of the scanned records to match a weapon’s serial number to a record that identifies the person who purchased the firearm.Rep. Michael Cloud (R-Tex.) introduced legislation last year that would force ATF to discard their closed-business records and prohibit closed gun dealers from turning over their records. The bill has 78 Republican co-sponsors but has not received a committee or full House vote.Cloud declined to comment for this article.Last week, Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.) tacked an amendment onto the appropriations bill for the Justice Department, which oversees ATF, that would prevent the agency from using money to maintain digital copies of its out-of-business records. The amendment passed a committee vote and is now up for a vote on the full House floor.“The ATF is brazenly violating the law by recording out of business records — creating the foundation for a digital gun registry,” Clyde said in a statement. “I’ve long warned that gun registration inevitably leads to gun confiscation.”ATF officials say they receive nearly 7 million pages of records each month from licensed gun dealers that are closing their businesses, representing upward of hundreds of thousands of gun sales. In all, ATF officials say, they processed 7.6 million gun trace requests between 2000 and 2021, with 53 percent of those traces completed using closed-business records. ATF is typically assisting local and federal law enforcement in their investigations and does not track how many crimes have been solved through the traces.Until 2022, closed shops previously had to hand over 20 years of records. Then the Biden administration changed the regulations to require stores to hand over all their records when they go out of business.The agency has received nearly 1 billion pages of records, with more coming each month, much of it in paper form. At one point, officials said, the West Virginia facility held so many paper records that the floors started sagging, prompting them to speed up their digitization process and build temporary structures to store the records in the parking lot.Republican critics of ATF have proposed slashing its $1.6 billion budget by more than 10 percent, which Dettlebach said would impact efforts to maintain the trove of closed-business records and deploy agents to work with federal and local law enforcement agencies investigating gun crimes.""When our partners call us, we go,” Dettlebach said. “But we need the tools to support law enforcement.”"
WaPo_40,What it’s like to be a tornado chaser and how it’s done,https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/21/storm-chasing-reality-twisters-movie-tornadoes/,2024-07-21 20:00:02.704246,,"There are few things as thrilling — and terrifying — as a tornado. It’s a seemingly alien manifestation of power, beauty and chaos. When a tornado is spotted, most (sane) people do everything in their power to get away. Then there are storm chasers.We’re the folks you see racing toward the storms in armored trucks or beat-up rental cars, shouting at the sky with our cameras pointed upward. Some are researchers. Others are adrenaline junkies. Some work for the media, and others are just flat-out yahoos with a cellphone connection and a full tank of gas.But everyone is out there with the same goal: witness one of the most mystical, mesmerizing and damaging pageants of nature’s fury. The movie Twisters, starring Hollywood actors in hot pursuit of tornadoes, isn’t that far off in its portrayal of chasing, but the film glosses over some of the hard work and challenges involved. Here’s what it’s really like to live the life of a storm chaser.Imagine throwing a pot of water on the stove and trying to predict where the first bubble will pop up. Storm chasing is a bit like that — the sun is cooking the lower atmosphere, and we’re trying to figure out how it will convect or transfer heat.But it’s not easy. The Earth is a rotating system with uneven heating, wild topography and bodies of water. Every level of atmosphere behaves differently, with different wind speeds and directions, temperatures and humidity. And we’re trying to predict where a vortex may form that may be only the width of a football field.It’s as much an art as it is a science. New storm chasers, and even inexperienced meteorologists, may hew close to weather models and “official” outlooks, afraid to trust their gut. Veterans can sniff out the atmosphere’s sneaky surprises.No matter what, storm chasing is frustrating and disappointing about 80 percent of the time. There are many long days spent in the car without seeing a tornado while eating gas station food and ending the day smelling like rainwater and sweat. But 20 percent of the time, it’s the most amazing thing in the universe. And that’s what keeps us going out there.Being a good storm chaser means being intimate with the atmosphere at all hours.Days in advance, I’ll begin plotting what region of the country I might need to be in. northern Plains or southern Plains? Ozarks or Corn Belt? About a day or two beforehand, I can usually narrow down what state I’ll target. The night before, what part of the state — central or eastern Nebraska, for example. I drive there, book a cheap motel and start analyzing the latest weather maps.The next morning, I wake up early, scarfing down my complimentary budget breakfast as soon as it opens at 6 a.m. After reviewing weather models — or future simulations — and the latest data (temperature, humidity, winds, etc.), I hit the road by 10 a.m.Around noon, I start narrowing my target to a zone perhaps a few counties wide. Models become less useful, and real time observations — what’s happening now  — matter more. Where will winds near the ground come more from the east, increasing low-level rotation? Where is the humidity — which helps fuel storms — highest? Where is the nearest boundary, where clashing air masses can help the air rise and spin? Once I have completed my analysis and identified a location, I get into position.Then it’s a waiting game. Often, it entails sitting beneath blue skies until the “cap” breaks. That’s a lid of warm air at higher altitudes that prevents warm, moist air from rising. Only once the lower atmosphere is sufficiently sun-baked does that air near the ground have enough buoyancy to rise and shatter the cap.As storms bubble up, it’s a game of using real-time observations to determine which storm will be most primed to intensify and survive the longest.If I am poised to intercept a healthy storm, I drop into position. Many storms move at 30 or 40 mph so failing to keep abreast of a storm can mean falling behind. That can quickly end a chase.I try to position east of storms. Most move northeast, so being to the east offers me an ideal vista. From that position, rain and hail are visible falling to the right of the storm, with warm, moist air spiraling into the updraft. From that updraft, a wall cloud — a long-hanging rugged cloud — emerges. That’s the visible manifestation of the storm’s rotation. It’s where a tornado may eventually sprout.Before long, a cone-shaped lowering may appear from the rugged lowering where scuddy clouds consolidate. It burrows toward the ground. Sometimes dust is kicked up at the surface where the invisible circulation reaches the ground. Once that happens, a tornado is born.How close I dance with danger depends on how quickly and predictably the tornado is moving.If the storm is moving fast, then it is harder to safely keep up with and catch a good view, but its motion is more predictable. For a fast-moving storm, you only get one close pass; after the twister sweeps past you, it usually is hard to get out ahead of it again.If a tornado is moving more slowly, then it’s easier to get close and have time to maneuver carefully — yet slow-moving tornadoes are often more erratic. No matter how enticing a storm is, the end goal is always living to chase another day. Tornadic storms are seemingly sentient at times, throwing the entire fury of the atmosphere at those daring enough to venture close. Bombardments of giant hail and pinpoint lightning strikes make getting close to a tornado perilous — and the tornadoes themselves can quickly become shrouded in rain or make unexpected moves.I always have multiple escape routes in mind as storms close in. That also means planning for routes in the wake of the tornado that may be blocked by debris or falling trees. If I lose radar coverage or a visual of the tornado, I’ll abandon the storm.No storm chase comes without risk. But experienced meteorologists and storm chasers take precautions. By the time I drive to a hotel after a chase, I’m usually soaked in rain and exhausted. Pulling into a hotel parking lot, a weird feeling washes over me. The chaos and beauty of what I have seen seems like a distant memory, replaced by the twinkling stars found in clear night skies behind the storms.Stepping into the crisp night air, crickets chirping, I take a deep breath — before venturing indoors to prepare for the next chase."

He spent his Pakistani childhood feeling like an outsider: gay and overweight, his knowledge of marvel superheroes was eclipsed only by his mastery of Broadway show tunes. His screens had shown him an America where he could be accepted and free to love who he wanted; in reality it turned out to be another place where he felt like an outsider — a brown man from a Muslim country in a post-9/11 world. At once both humorous and heartbreaking, his memoir allows his bubbly personality to shine in a story about letting go of shame and finding self-acceptance.

WaPo_43,Fairfax to review school boundaries every five years under new policy,https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/07/21/fairfax-school-boundary-policy-review/,2024-07-21 21:59:24.136869,,"Fairfax County Public Schools will now review school boundaries every five years under a policy approved at a recent school board meeting. The policy, which has garnered opposition from some community members, does not directly change school boundaries in the division, but sets the stage for the school board to do so.The boundary policy conversation has been happening for years. Board members have said they wanted to see how boundary reviews could help tackle issues such as overcrowding and transportation — as well as look for ways to ensure equitable access to opportunities across the district.“These revisions address long standing community concerns about our schools, including the use of temporary classrooms, overcrowding, facility renovation timelines, and transportation, to name a few,” Fairfax school board Chair Karl Frisch (Providence District) said in a statement. “This long overdue policy update will help ensure every student has access to our world-class instructional programs so they can achieve their full, unique, and limitless potential.”Here’s what to know about the changes that were made.The school district must now conduct a “comprehensive review” of the school division’s boundaries every five years. During the review, the school district will consider criteria such as access to programming, enrollment projections and capacity, proximity, and transportation times.
Under the previous policy, school boundaries were not reviewed districtwide on a regular schedule. Proposed changes could be triggered by issues such as overcrowding, according to the policy.
Other area school districts have similar frameworks. For example, nearby Arlington County Public Schools reviews its boundaries every five years and is looking at a proposal to change that to every two years. DCPS is required under city law to consider its boundaries every 10 years.The school district must now conduct a “comprehensive review” of the school division’s boundaries every five years.

Discussions resumed in February, and board members have been working on the new policy in work sessions, committees and forums since then.
School board members have said the new policy is designed to better address the changing landscape in Fairfax County, including issues involving capacity and enrollment. The boundary policy had not been overhauled since 2013. When the issue came up this year, board members said boundary changes could benefit student well-being and contribute to the financial sustainability of the district, arguing that adjusting where students attend is more cost-effective than building, expanding or renovating schools.The Fairfax school board began reviewing the boundary policy in 2018 and discussions carried into 2019.

The new policy creates a framework for the division to follow when considering future boundary changes. The school board has not yet considered any specific boundary changes. The board said it intends to have many opportunities for community feedback and input when it evaluates the boundaries.Not quite.

The board said it intends to have many opportunities for community feedback and input when it evaluates the boundaries.School boundary changes can be a hotly debated topic. At Thursday’s school board meeting, dozens of parents and community members packed an auditorium to discuss the policy. The group FairFACTS Matter has raised a number of concerns about disrupting existing communities by moving students to different schools. The group called for the school board to hold off the vote and look at more data and community input before moving forward.
Ruth Smyers, 40, of Great Falls, said she has deep concerns about boundaries changing every five years and students potentially being relocated to new schools. With two children enrolled in FCPS elementary schools and a third younger child, she said she didn’t think the proposal was considering the overall well-being of children.
“Everybody I know when they are buying a house, if the school is not the top factor, it’s one of them,” she said. “People made really big life choices under the assumption that their kid would go to that school.”
School board members spent much of Thursday’s meeting debating language about how students would transition into new schools if boundaries change. Board members Ricardy Anderson (Mason District) and Melanie Meren (Hunter Mill) proposed amendments that would allow kids in middle- and high-schoolers to stay at a campus if boundaries were changed after they enrolled there.
Ultimately, the board approved broad language that allows it to decide how to transition kids for each proposed boundary change.School boundary changes can be a hotly debated topic.

WaPo_44,‘Magical’ self-portrait was hidden for decades — until the canvas was flipped,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/21/norman-cornish-bowes-museum/,2024-07-21 21:36:24.136869,,"When a conservator at a British museum removed a board at the back of a prominent Norman Cornish artwork for an upcoming exhibition, he made a “magical” discovery: On the reverse was a self-portrait by the coal miner turned celebrated artist.The newly discovered painting went on display for the first time Saturday as part of an exhibition at Northern England’s Bowes Museum along with dozens of other rare artworks by Cornish and his contemporary L.S. Lowry. The exhibition will run through January 2025.A colleague ran around excitedly shouting, “Jon’s found a painting,” Vicky Sturrs, the museum’s director of programs and collections said, recalling conservator Jon Old’s discovery in April.Renowned for his evocative images of the working lives of miners in northeastern Britain, Cornish was the most famous of a group that came to be known as pit painters. In vivid, definitive strokes and a muted palette, he captured the grit of street life among mining communities as well as the camaraderie of communal gatherings. It was a life he was intimately familiar with: He spent more than three decades working as a coal miner.Stories to keep you informed

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.Old found the self-portrait while handling a painting called “Bar Scene,” depicting miners in caps sitting hunched at a tavern, the Bowes Museum said in a statement. The painting — a loan from the Durham County Council — curiously had a backboard set into the frame, and the work had been stretched over a picture frame, Old said in the statement.“So, I decided to remove the board to see if it was affecting the painting, and to my surprise it revealed this wonderful other painting on the reverse, which was quite magical,” he added.The Cornish family, Sturrs said, has meticulously documented all his works with unfinished elements at the back of canvases: They could be things that he was just trying out or that he abandoned before turning to the other side.“We found something nobody knew about,” she said. “It was an ‘oh my god’ moment.”The 22-by-29-inch “Bar Scene” was acquired by the Durham Council in 1961, Sturrs said, which meant the self-portrait had gone undetected for over 60 years.Describing the work as “remarkable,” Amanda Hopgood, leader of the Durham Council, said in a statement: “It makes a fantastic addition to the wonderful body of work that Norman Cornish is known for.”It is unclear when exactly the discovery was created, the museum said. Painted on a used canvas, the self-portrait shows Cornish in his younger years with a thoughtful gaze. It is the 29th self-portrait in the artist’s body of work, according to the museum.The challenge, Sturrs said, was to display the new work and “Bar Scene” simultaneously. They created a special plinth, she said, to invert the paintings throughout the day so viewers can see both the right way up at different points.Be among the first to see this brand-new work when Kith and Kinship: Norman Cornish and L.

When he turned 15, he joined a social institute that became a breeding ground for creative talent known as the Pitman’s Academy.In 1966, he left the mines and went on to establish himself as one of the most sought-after British artists of the 20th century. He died in 2014.Sturrs described Cornish’s works as warm and intimate, highlighting the claustrophobia, the darkness and the sacrifice of miners’ lives.“There is an intimacy in his stroke and mark that you cannot help but get swept away,” she added."

President Biden is facing mounting pressure from fellow Democrats to withdraw from the presidential race after his faltering performance in the presidential debate raised doubts about his mental acuity and ability to defeat Donald Trump.
Nearly three dozen congressional Democrats have publicly called on Biden to step aside, including Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), a close ally of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). At least three other Democratic lawmakers said during an off-the-record call with House leadership that they believe Biden should not run, according to people familiar with the discussion. The Washington Post is tracking which congressional Democrats call on Biden to drop out as the party weighs whether he belongs at the top of the ticket.

Israeli officials said they didn’t confirm that the prime minister would actually meet with the convalescing president as planned until the day before takeoff; and they weren’t sure that Biden would still be a candidate for reelection by the time they leave town.“No one knows what to expect,” one Israeli official said Saturday, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues.Netanyahu is scheduled to address a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday. But it is the upheaval in the presidential race that is fixating observers, with Biden under swelling pressure to step aside and Donald Trump surging after a failed assassination attempt. The shifting political winds could embolden the Israeli leader, analysts said, at a crucial time in Gaza cease-fire negotiations.U.S.-backed talks in Cairo are reportedly gaining momentum, with the administration pressing a reluctant Netanyahu to accept a deal that would end the fighting in exchange for the release of more than 100 Israeli hostages held by militants.

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.Netanyahu has been accused by critics of prolonging the war for his own political benefit, a charge he denies. He remains adamant that Israel must fight until Hamas has been destroyed, a goal his own generals have said is unachievable.Officially, Netanyahu is neutral in American politics. But he has long been criticized for aligning with Republicans. And he made no secret of his delight with Trump, who tilted U.S. policy significantly in favor of the Israeli right during his term — moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and recognizing Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights.Netanyahu’s tense relationship with Biden has deteriorated greatly in recent months as Israel has defied numerous White House entreaties to increase the flow of humanitarian aid in Gaza and do more to protect civilians. The administration put a hold on 2,000-pound bombs to Israel in May, citing their use in populated areas.More than 38,900 Palestinians have been killed in the war, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians but says the majority of the dead are women and children.Some of the prime minister’s allies have begun cheering Trump more explicitly, framing cease-fire talks as a partisan U.S. issue. Itamar Ben Gvir, Netanyahu’s far-right national security minister, warned colleagues last week that approving a hostage deal would be “a slap for Trump, which would be a victory for Biden,” according to Israeli media reports. Any agreement, he insisted, should wait until November.Some political observers here say Biden’s eroding position is already freeing Netanyahu’s hand in Gaza.Michael Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to Washington, said U.S. pressure on Israel to rein in its military campaign has eased in recent weeks. The administration has offered little public criticism of escalating attacks in areas packed with civilians, including in Mawasi, an area designated by Israel as a humanitarian zone. Massive strikes there last week targeting senior Hamas leader Mohammed Deif killed at least 90 people, according to health officials.“The pressure has gone now,” Oren said. “It’s nothing like it was.”Biden’s team has backed off in part because of signs the attacks are making Hamas more amenable to a deal, Oren said, and what the president “really needs is a diplomatic win to show he can achieve big things internationally.”U.S. administration officials deny that Netanyahu has been significantly emboldened by Biden’s struggles. But they acknowledge that the president’s mounting problems have coincided with a hardening of the prime minister’s position. Netanyahu recently came forward with last-minute demands that U.S. negotiators feared would stymie the Cairo talks, according to diplomats familiar with the discussions.Under the new conditions, Israel would not agree to withdraw its forces from the Philadelphi Corridor along the Egyptian border, said the diplomats, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive and ongoing negotiations. Israel would also not allow unrestricted access for Gazans seeking to return to their homes in the north — insisting that its forces be permitted to establish checkpoints to monitor the movement of the displaced.“The fact that Netanyahu put these conditions out so publicly means he feels more confident,” Oren said.Netanyahu is certainly paying attention to the churning U.S. campaign, Israeli officials say. “Everyone recognizes that Biden is weak,” said one person familiar with deliberations in the prime minister’s office, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.But Netanyahu was far more focused on his own political challenges, this person said.The prime minister is squeezed between the Israeli public, increasingly angry at his failure to reach a hostage-release deal, and his far-right coalition partners, threatening to bring down the government if he agrees to stop fighting Hamas. Eight members of Netanyahu’s own Likud party went public in recent days with a list of “red lines” they could not support in a deal, including Israel’s withdrawal from central Gaza and the Egyptian border.Netanyahu will be feverishly working to keep his coalition partners in line until July 28, when Israel’s parliament begins a three-month recess.“The next weeks will be critical,” said the person familiar with deliberations. “Right now the pressure from the inside is far more significant that pressure from the States.”Netanyahu was unlikely to seek a meeting with Trump during his Washington trip, this source said, or even with Vice President Harris, who has emerged as a possible replacement for Biden at the top of the ticket.The prime minister was fully aware that no matter the outcome of the November election, Israel would be dealing with Biden for the foreseeable future, said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute.Netanyahu is likely to be on his best bipartisan behavior during this visit, unlike his in his controversial address to Congress in 2015 when, at the invitation of Republicans, he slammed the Obama administration’s Iran nuclear deal. Unlike now, that dust-up occurred just weeks before an Israeli election and was designed for domestic political impact, Plesner noted.“It’s a totally different situation now,” he said. “Netanyahu needs President Biden every day.”While many Democrats remain bitter over Netanyahu’s 2015 trip, and scores of them plan on boycotting his address, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Friday that he had received a “broad preview” of Netanyahu’s speech last week and it did not appear partisan in tone — instead focusing on “how the U.S. and Israel are trying together to face down the terrorist threat” and coordinate on “regional challenges.”Sullivan acknowledged, however, that “they’re going to keep working that speech until the very last minute, just like we do on our side.”Netanyahu will be in Washington at the peak of partisan frenzy, between the two party conventions and with Democrats convulsed over their ticket. U.S. officials confided they were nervous about his visit at such a volatile time, worried he may say or do something that scuttles their Gaza diplomacy.“It’s impossible to have confidence in how this plays out,” a U.S. official said.Hudson reported from Washington."

WaPo_51,Biden makes stunning decision to pull out of 2024 race,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/21/joe-biden-drops-out/,2024-07-22 01:55:02.861159,,"President Biden has decided he will end his reelection campaign, he said in a statement released Sunday, a decision certain to send shock waves through the political world, following a stumbling debate performance that widely alarmed Democrats about the 81-year-old president’s fitness for office and ability to defeat former president Donald Trump.“I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the reminder of my term,” Biden said in a statement.Biden’s exit leaves his party in a virtually unprecedented position with months until the Nov. 5 election. Vice President Harris, a former senator from California, would bring her own liabilities to the race if she jumps in. Her approval ratings have largely mirrored the decline of Biden’s since 2021, and her own campaign in the 2020 presidential primary fell apart before voting began.The Democrats’ predicament — a candidate dropping out after sweeping mostly unchallenged through the party primaries to become the presumptive nominee — is unknown in the modern era. It caps weeks of delicate strategizing by party leaders on how to dislodge Biden, a proudly stubborn figure known to bristle at those who write him off. It signals the conclusion of a remarkable half-century political career that began when Biden won election to the Senate in 1972 as one of the youngest-ever senators and will now conclude in January with his service as the oldest-ever president.The Democrats’ process for finalizing their nominee will be hurried, untested and fraught with deep uncertainty and the potential for further intraparty turmoil. The Democratic National Convention is in four weeks in Chicago, although Democrats had initially planned to formally nominate Biden in a “virtual roll call” before the in-person gathering.The president will leave office with notable accomplishments, especially for a one-term president in an era of deep division. He pushed through bills on infrastructure, climate change, health care, gun control and the semiconductor industry. He pulled the U.S. out of Afghanistan, rebuilt American alliances and led a coalition to defend Ukraine against Russia. His staunch support for Israel in the Gaza war, however, sparked condemnation at home and abroad.1/5Many Democrats considered Biden’s June 27 presidential debate against Trump shocking and catastrophic, as Biden sometimes struggled to complete sentences or marshal his thoughts. The president and his aides insisted he was staying in the race, likening the moment to other occasions in his long career when he had been counted out. But a combination of dire polls, skittish fundraisers and Democratic defections ultimately made the president’s position untenable.Undergirding Democrats’ urgency to replace Biden is the fear of another Trump presidency, which many in the party believe would be uniquely destructive.In abandoning his reelection campaign, Biden joins two other incumbent presidents in modern history who chose not to seek reelection: President Harry S. Truman in 1952 and President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968. Those presidents’ announcements, however, came months earlier and gave their party far more time to regroup for the general election. Even so, Democrats lost both elections.Also, Truman and Johnson had both already served more than one term, having come to office upon the death of their predecessor. Truman, taking office after Franklin D. Roosevelt’s death in 1945, had completed nearly two full terms.Voters have long told pollsters they were concerned about Biden’s age — it was even an issue in his 2020 campaign — but the debate was an inflection point, releasing a wave of Democratic anxiety that the Biden campaign had previously been able to keep in check.Biden’s advisers had hoped to use the early debate to focus voters’ attention on Trump’s record and policies, but the plan backfired spectacularly. For much of the roughly 90-minute event, Biden spoke in a raspy voice, struggled to find his words and gave meandering answers on even issues that played to his strengths, such as abortion rights.Biden and his aides quickly acknowledged that the performance was disappointing, but they downplayed it as a “bad night” and said the president had a cold. That did little to appease Democrats who viewed the performance as reflecting a far deeper problem and had already been on edge about his chances against Trump, who has led in many battleground state polls — a remarkable rebound from his disgraced exit from office four years earlier.On July 2, Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.) became the first House Democrat to publicly call on Biden to step aside as the Democratic nominee, invoking Johnson’s decision 56 years earlier. “Under very different circumstances, he made the painful decision to withdraw,” Doggett said. “President Biden should do the same.”That kicked off an agonizing stretch for Democrats when every day or so, another congressional Democrat would issue a statement declaring their affection for Biden and admiration for his accomplishments, but adding that it was time for him to “pass the torch.”A native of Scranton, Pa., Biden entered politics more than five decades ago, winning a seat on the New Castle County Council in Delaware in 1970. He first ran for Senate in 1972, defeating a Republican incumbent, J. Caleb Boggs, in a scrappy, underdog campaign.Tragedy struck Biden’s life within weeks of his Senate election, when his wife, Neilia, and 1-year-old daughter, Naomi, were killed in a car accident while Christmas shopping in Delaware. His two young sons, Beau and Hunter, who were also in the car, were seriously injured. Biden pushed ahead, plunging into life in the Senate, raising his boys and getting remarried to his current wife, Jill — the first chapter in a long biography of tragedy and recovery.In the Senate, Biden built a 36-year career as a self-styled champion of the working class and unapologetic bipartisan dealmaker. He chaired the Judiciary and Foreign Relations committees, rising in stature as he presided over two Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including Justice Clarence Thomas’s contentious confirmation in 1991, and helped write the 1994 crime bill that was a priority of President Bill Clinton.Biden had long harbored White House ambitions. His first bid — in 1988 — flamed out due to a plagiarism scandal, and he did not make it far when he ran again in 2008, vying in a Democratic primary that ultimately produced Barack Obama as the nominee.But Obama, then a freshman senator, tapped Biden to be his running mate, looking to reassure voters that his administration would have deep legislative and foreign policy experience. Biden was happy to fill the role, serving dutifully as a liaison to Capitol Hill and regular visitor to the Middle East, especially Iraq.A rare moment when Biden briefly diverged from Obama’s positions came in 2012, when Biden expressed support for same-sex marriage in a TV interview even though Obama had not embraced that policy. The president did so days later.As Obama’s presidency wrapped up in 2016, Biden agonized over whether to run to succeed him, but he ultimately opted against it as he continued to grieve after another personal tragedy: His elder son, Beau, had been diagnosed with brain cancer and died in 2015 at age 46.Trump then shocked the political world by defeating Hillary Clinton for the presidency, sending the Democrats into a brooding exile and dramatically raising the stakes for the 2020 campaign. Biden later said he was inspired to join that race after watching Trump decline to unequivocally condemn a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, in 2017.Biden stood out in the crowded 2020 Democratic primary as an older, moderate Democrat who spoke fondly of bipartisanship. His campaign initially struggled to match his more charismatic rivals, but Democratic voters ultimately accepted Biden’s argument that he was most likely to defeat Trump — which he did, recapturing the three crucial states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and adding Georgia and Arizona.But Trump refused to admit he had lost, even as Biden took office in 2021 pledging to heal the “soul of the nation.” A country already in the throes of the coronavirus pandemic was further jarred by Trump’s efforts to overturn the results, culminating in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.Running for a second term, Biden pitched himself as uniquely equipped to defeat Trump after doing so in 2020, facing minimal opposition in the Democratic primaries even as voter concerns lingered about his age. His campaign focused heavily on abortion rights, promising to restore the federal right to an abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.While some Democrats were initially concerned that Biden’s reelection campaign was off to a slow start, he earned broad acclaim inside the party for his State of the Union address in February. During the speech, Biden aggressively pitched his record, drew sharp contrasts with Trump and pushed back after some GOP lawmakers interrupted him.It was the kind of vigorous performance that Democrats had hoped to see months later in his first debate against Trump. Instead, the standoff in Atlanta marked the beginning of the end for Biden’s reelection campaign."
WaPo_52,"At an Olivia Rodrigo concert, the screams are existential",https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/2024/07/21/olivia-rodrigo-concert-review-dc/,2024-07-22 01:48:02.861159,,"If there’s a through line between Beatlemania and the Eras Tour, it resides in the throats of the young, who, after spending so much of their days practicing obedient silence, are suddenly given a chance to see if God can hear them. At a screamy pop concert, that sense of possibility is literally in the air — an opportunity to add your own decibels to the sound-space you’re now sharing with your favorite singer, a potentiality that doesn’t exist behind the vacuum seal of digital streaming or social media fandom. Dismiss it as kid stuff at your own risk. It is absolutely holy.Olivia Rodrigo fans know all about this, either explicitly or intuitively, probably because Rodrigo’s sharpest pop songs feel mutually instinctive and self-aware, visceral and alert, and when she sang them on the latest stop of her “Guts” tour at Capital One Arena in Washington on Saturday, thousands of voices knew exactly how to join in. It wasn’t a singalong so much as a shout-behind, which felt almost shocking during the show’s more delicate moments — “Traitor,” “Making the Bed,” “Favorite Crime” — with Rodrigo’s voice melting into a syrupy pout while her devout Greek chorus amplified whatever emotional pain their hero had chosen to steep in. Over and over, Rodrigo seemed to be smothering a blaring hurt inside her head, transposing it into mumbly melody. If you wanted to sing along in real life, you had to voice the blare.The entire show toggled between those wounded ballads and much punkier punches — and without whiplash. She was a natural in both modes, drawing on an anger that felt sincere, then sincerely blowing it off, skipping across the stage in sequins and combat boots, occasionally widening her eyes before a big refrain, as if she’d just spotted an apocalyptic meteor falling out of the sky. At 21, Rodrigo contains multitudes, and she isn’t shy about her politics. She gave a shout-out to the Baltimore Abortion Fund, having invited the organization to set up an info table on the arena concourse, and when it came time to funnel her feminism directly into song, she delivered “All-American Bitch,” a dynamite stick concealed in a bubble gum wrapper that rejects the roles young women are expected to play in this patriarchal, fascism-curious country we all share. “All the time, I’m grateful all the time,” Rodrigo sang, her voice turned sticky with mock-sweetness. “I’m sexy and I’m kind, I’m pretty when I cry.”Somehow, that moment paled in comparison to another lyric from the song — “I scream inside to deal with it” — being turned inside out. During a breakdown, Rodrigo issued instructions to everyone in the room: Think about something that makes you angry, and then, when the lights go down, scream it out. After a four count, her band went silent, the room went black, and the air filled with something deafening and mysterious.Please understand that this was not a festive Saturday night huzzah, or a big roller coaster whoop, or an intensified horror movie multiplex shriek, or even the wailing veneration of an entirely worthy pop star. This was an omni-scream with its own timbre, totally beautiful and half-terrifying. It came from a crowd that skewed young, but spanned generations, which means it contained contempt for school bus bullies, and national election agita, and countless fears over the future of our species, plus every variant of private hurt otherwise sealed inside the hearts of the assembled. It was hard to remember — or even imagine — a sound more cleansing, more total, more real."
WaPo_53,Biden’s crisis deepens as both parties plan for his potential exit,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/21/biden-manchin-pelosi-drop-out/,2024-07-22 01:26:02.861159,,"REHOBOTH BEACH, Del. — President Biden faced new signs of waning confidence in his candidacy on Sunday, as a fifth senator called for him to step aside and top Democratic leaders accelerated their efforts to plan for his withdrawal from the race.“I came to the decision with a heavy heart that I think it’s time to pass the torch to a new generation,” Sen. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.) told Jake Tapper on CNN’s “State of the Union.”Manchin, who in May switched his party affiliation from Democrat to independent, spoke just hours after news reports highlighted that Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) did not address the future of Biden’s candidacy during remarks at a “unity dinner” Democratic fundraiser in Raleigh, N.C., on Saturday.“Are you ready for a great Democratic victory?” the influential former House speaker said, wrapping up remarks that omitted a Biden endorsement. “I thought so.”While the weekend has proceeded more quietly than Friday, when a dozen Democrats called for Biden to bow out, the continued rumbles of discontent foreshadowed a showdown between the president and his own party in the coming week. Biden, who has been behind closed doors recovering from covid at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., said he intends to return to the campaign trail this week. But elected Democrats and donors — and even Republicans — are planning for the aftermath of his withdrawal as if it is a given.With less than a month before the beginning of the Democratic National Convention, some Democratic leaders feel they have no choice but to begin preparing for a post-Biden presidential campaign. Lawmakers and delegates are gaming out alternative scenarios, including a “mini primary,” an open convention and a coronation of Vice President Harris.Manchin forcefully advocated for the Democratic Party to hold an open convention to choose a presidential nominee, implicitly arguing that Harris should not be anointed as Biden’s replacement.He expressed hesitation about Harris leading the Democratic ticket, arguing that the party has moved too far to the left, alienating more moderate voters.“I’d have to see, basically — that’s why I want an open process,” said Manchin, in a brief interview with The Washington Post on Sunday morning. “How do you win over 51 percent — a majority, 51 percent — to be victorious in the general election. That’s what they have to worry about. You can’t stay to the hard left.”Pelosi has told allies that she also supports a kind of condensed primary, even if Harris ultimately emerges as the party’s nominee. Some Democrats have said that allowing Harris to earn the nomination rather than receive it by default would strengthen her campaign and energize voters.The open speculation about what might happen if Biden withdraws has become exasperating for his campaign, particularly because the president has repeatedly stated that he has no intention of leaving the race.“It is a privilege to sit around and play games with what is going on right now,” Biden principal deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said Sunday on MSNBC’s “The Weekend.” “Joe Biden said he’s staying in. Our campaign has said he’s staying in. I don’t know how many more times we can say it.”The campaign also pointed to endorsements that Biden has received from other elected Democrats, some of whom appeared on television Sunday to voice their continued support for the president.“I believe he is as good as they get,” Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) said on CNN when asked if Biden was the best positioned to defeat Republican nominee Donald Trump in November. “Is he the only one? No, he’s not the only one. And he is among the best that we can put forward. And I stand with him until he changes his mind, if he should change his mind.”But Clyburn also mused aloud about what Democrats might do if Biden decides to step down, saying that a “mini-primary” could take place but that if the party proceeds to an open convention, it could lead to chaos.“If you go to the convention, have an open process in the convention, it will come out the same way it came out in 1968, 1972 and 1980,” he said, mentioning previous elections in which Democrats lost general elections after contentious party confabs.Republicans are also preparing for what they would do if Biden were to withdraw from the race, and several have suggested that if he ends his campaign, they would call for him to resign from the presidency altogether.“If he’s incapable of running for president, how is he capable of governing?” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said Sunday on CNN. “We’re projecting weakness on the world stage.”Speaking on ABC’s “This Week,” Johnson suggested that any changes to the Democratic ticket would be met with legal challenges. “I think they would run into some legal impediments in at least a few of these jurisdictions,” he said.Some Republicans have also ramped up their attacks on Harris, and Trump himself added a line to his speech during a rally Saturday slamming the vice president as “crazy.”Harris, who defended Biden on Saturday during a fundraiser and in a private call with donors, did not have any events scheduled Sunday.The vice president has found herself in an especially awkward position as calls for Biden to exit the race have grown louder. She has not been able to take steps to prepare for a national presidential campaign should she be suddenly catapulted to the top of the ticket. She has been careful to not give any public or private indications that she is thinking about her own future beyond Biden.Major Democratic donors are funding a preliminary vetting process for potential vice-presidential nominees should Biden exit the race. Vetters have contacted aides to top Democratic figures, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, according to people familiar with the effort.Manchin floated both Beshear and Shapiro as potential options for the top of the ticket.Beshear has effectively governed in a red state because he “doesn’t villainize; he doesn’t demean anybody; he doesn’t pick a side,” Manchin told The Post. Similarly, he said, Shapiro has found common ground with Republicans while working with a narrowly divided legislature in his state.Biden is hoping to quash such talk by returning to the campaign trail in the coming days. His doctor said his symptoms were improving, though he continued to suffer from a loose cough and hoarseness.The White House indicated Sunday morning that Biden would not have any public activity before Monday. The president was last seen in public Wednesday, when he traveled to his Rehoboth Beach home to isolate after testing positive for covid-19.Biden’s campaign has scheduled at least 10 fundraising events over the last 10 days of July, including a July 29 event with comedian David Letterman and Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, according to a person familiar with the planning. The fundraising push is particularly important because new filings for June showed Republicans with a robust cash haul that helped Trump surpass Biden’s once enormous campaign cash advantage.Biden is also preparing for a critical visit to Washington by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who plans to address a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday. The two leaders have had a tense relationship, and Netanyahu’s handling of the war in Gaza has further soured things between them.Some Democrats have drawn a distinction between Biden’s handling of the presidency and his ability to perform as a candidate. He has been almost universally praised for the former while facing rising doubt about the latter.“Whether he’s the strongest candidate to win the election in November is an open question,” Rep. Jake Auchincloss (D-Mass.) said in an interview Sunday on Fox News. “I also think he is fully fit to be commander in chief right now. And frankly, his track record over the last 3½ years shows that.”Reston and Vazquez contributed from Washington. Yasmeen Abutaleb in Washington contributed to this report."

WaPo_58,"Biden’s 50 years in politics defined by triumph, tragedy and a reluctant exit",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/21/biden-50-years-politics-legacy/,2024-07-22 02:25:02.831781,,"President Biden’s momentous decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential race marks the sunset of a consequential career in public service that spanned more than 50 years, during which he traversed the thrills and troughs of American politics while also navigating personal tragedy.Biden, whose quest for the presidency began three decades before he finally fulfilled it in 2021, becoming the oldest ever to hold the office, is bowing out of politics reluctantly and under pressure, at a moment he has called a critical “inflection point” for America.The move caps a turbulent journey in Washington for a self-described “great respecter of fate” who tried to protect his legacy by bowing to the conclusion drawn by many Democratic leaders and allies that, at 81 and showing increasing signs of aging, he did not have a viable path to defeating Donald Trump.“It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,” Biden wrote in a letter he posted to social media Sunday. “And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.”In the end, the doubts that emerged from his halting and politically disastrous performance in the June 27 debate with Trump proved too great for Biden to overcome. Leaving the race just months before voters cast ballots, Biden becomes the first incumbent president since Lyndon B. Johnson 56 years ago to voluntarily step aside rather than seek reelection. He will go down in history as a one-term president, the final chapter of his career marked by his failure to put to rest persistent concerns about his mental acuity and physical strength.Biden ascended from humble roots in Scranton, Pa., a working-class Catholic upbringing that has been central to his political appeal. One of the longest-serving statesmen to occupy the Oval Office, Biden spent 36 years as a U.S. senator from Delaware and eight years as vice president before ousting Trump from the presidency in 2020. But the time it took to amass that kind of experience contributed to his most existential challenge as president: an advanced age that increasingly dominated the public consciousness as he tried to manage the rigors of the office and of campaigning for reelection.As questions over his mental fitness and perceived frailty grew, Biden faced low approval ratings and sustained public doubt over his pursuit of a second term that would have ended when he is 86. While he occasionally was able to quiet those doubts — with strong showings at State of the Union addresses or during daring impromptu visits to war zones — they lingered and burst into the open at last month’s debate. He struggled to complete his sentences and at times appeared confused onstage, throwing Democrats into a tailspin, with lawmakers, donors and strategists openly warning that Biden would lose in November — and potentially tarnish both his party and his legacy in the process.Biden was initially defiant, calling his performance at the debate simply a “bad night” and declaring that his cognitive functions remained strong even if his gait and speech had slowed with age. He spoke of his history of defying doubters, turned to the political base of Black voters and union members that had long propelled his political career, and sought to reframe the battle as one between the middle class and the “millionaires.”“I’ve got to finish this job,” Biden said at a July 11 news conference. “Because there’s so much at stake.”With each move, the president drew on the themes of a political career in which he often embraced the role of the odd man out — from boasting of being the “poorest man in Congress” to regularly pitching himself as an avatar for the working class fighting against the elite.Over the years, Biden developed immense self-confidence by beating odds and overcoming adversities, which helps explain why he insisted in the days since the debate that he would stay in the race and win.Biden’s career in Washington began after he defeated an incumbent two-term senator and former Republican governor in 1972, two weeks before turning 30 and becoming constitutionally eligible to serve in the Senate. He won by about 3,000 votes out of fewer than 230,000 cast, but would never face another close race and would go on to serve six six-year terms.As he was preparing to be sworn into the Senate after his first election, Biden confronted devastating family trauma that would come to shape his public image. His wife, Neilia, and infant daughter, Naomi, were instantly killed when a large truck slammed into the Chevy they were riding in. Biden’s toddler-aged sons — Joseph III, known as Beau, and Hunter — were severely injured and had to be hospitalized.The senator-elect left Washington and returned to Delaware, making up his mind that he would give up the Senate seat to tend to his young boys. But some sitting senators urged him to take the job temporarily — “just stay six months,” one said — and he agreed. He was sworn in standing next to Beau’s hospital bed. He ultimately stayed for over 3½ decades, rising to chair the prestigious Foreign Relations Committee, until Barack Obama chose him to be his running mate in 2008.Perseverance and empathy forged by overcoming personal tragedy became a key part of Biden’s political brand as he ascended and set his sights on the White House. He often told audiences about a childhood in which he was bullied because of a stutter. He largely conquered the impediment as he came of age in Scranton and Claymont, Del., though it occasionally reemerged as an adult in politics.“He is someone who has faced and overcome a lot of adversity,” said David Greenberg, a presidential historian at Rutgers University. “The thought of losing his wife and daughter in a crash that young, I think it’s hard for any of us to imagine, and yet he got himself together.”Despite being the youngest senator in the country, Biden coveted the presidency from an early age, telling Washingtonian magazine in 1974 that his family expected him to be in the White House “one of these days.” It would take the better part of five decades for Biden to reach his goal, a pursuit aided by a close-knit family that had long served as his political brain trust, including first lady Jill Biden, whom he married in 1977.Biden first ran for president in 1988 and early on was considered a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination. But his bid was rocked by a plagiarism scandal. The firestorm over news reports that his campaign speeches had lifted passages from other politicians without crediting them was a preview of the kind of frenzy Biden would face as president nearly 37 years later after a faltering debate performance.Similar to his modern-day response to a campaign in crisis, Biden held a pivotal news conference in 1987 in which he admitted making a “stupid” mistake and tried to turn the page to other matters. But Biden failed to quiet the tumult, and his family and close advisers agreed that he should withdraw.“There’s only one way to stop the sharks, and that’s pull out,” Ted Kaufman, his friend and chief of staff, told him at the time.After dropping out of the 1988 race, Biden shifted his focus back to the Senate, where his chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee placed him in a critical position to oversee contentious Supreme Court nominations and shepherd pivotal legislation dealing with crime, guns and domestic violence.Biden’s next run for the presidency, some 20 years later, would also embody the kind of turbulence that has dominated his political career. He struggled to overcome a series of early gaffes and faltered in the 2008 Iowa caucuses, receiving less than 1 percent of the vote. Biden immediately withdrew from the race, which was being dominated by two more famous Senate colleagues, Obama and Hillary Clinton. But his goals of getting to the White House were resurrected months later when Obama secured the nomination and asked him to become the vice-presidential nominee.Biden initially declined the offer, but Obama asked him to talk it over with his family, Biden recounted in a 2023 interview with comedian Conan O’Brien.“Let me get this straight, honey,” Biden recalled his mother saying when he told her about the offer. “The first Black man has a chance to be president, he says he needs you, and you told him no?”Biden found the argument convincing. He joined the ticket with Obama, who went on to defeat Republican Sen. John McCain that November.During eight years as vice president, Biden played a crucial role as a liaison to Congress and as the last adviser in the room ahead of crucial decisions, particularly on foreign policy. He celebrated Obama’s highest moments — famously declaring the passage of a landmark health care bill a “big f---ing deal” — while also commiserating after Republicans captured both the House and Senate in devastating midterm elections for Democrats.Near the end of his second term as vice president, Biden faced another family tragedy when his son, Beau, then Delaware’s attorney general who was celebrated as a potential future candidate for national office, died of brain cancer in 2015 at age 46. Beau’s death would loom large over Biden’s political future, as he faced multiple decisions about whether to run for president in the ensuing years.Biden considered mounting a bid for the nomination in 2016, but ultimately decided against it, publicly citing his grief over Beau’s death and privately grousing over the fact that Obama and other Democratic leaders had sidelined him in favor of Clinton.Trump defeated Clinton that November, leading Biden to conclude he would have fared better and regret his decision not to run. This increased his resolve to rely on his own instincts going forward and motivated him to run to defeat Trump in 2020. That “inner confidence” came into play as Biden faced a wave of calls to drop out of the 2024 race in the aftermath of the debate, Kaufman said.“He’s been president of the United States and vice president, and spent 36 years as United States senator,” Kaufman said in an interview weeks before Biden dropped out. “He doesn’t get flummoxed by what individual people say about what he should do.”Biden was initially reluctant to believe polls and pundits suggesting he would lose to Trump this November in part because of his experience in the 2020 election. He had begun the Democratic primaries that year with brutal losses, placing fourth in Iowa and fifth in New Hampshire. But he continued on to more diverse states, winning a resounding victory in South Carolina thanks to broad support from Black voters that breathed new life into his candidacy.“He developed a narrative of himself as someone who people count out and to then comes back,” said Greenberg.Biden went on win the Democratic nomination and defeat Trump in the general election to become the nation’s 46th president. His vice president, Kamala D. Harris, made history as the first woman, Black person and Asian American to hold the role. He received more than 81.2 million votes, the most of any presidential candidate ever, though the electoral college was so closely contested that a shift of fewer than 45,000 votes across three states would’ve swung the election to Trump.Biden was reluctant to leave the race this summer because he had “spent his whole life trying to get there,” said Chris Whipple, author of “The Fight of His Life: Inside Joe Biden’s White House.Like much of his political career, Biden’s presidency has been a study of contrasts. He successfully advanced major legislation on infrastructure, climate change and economic recovery. He oversaw the creation of 15 million jobs and helped restore vital global alliances.At the same time, however, he suffered historically low poll numbers, driven by a chaotic 2021 withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, stubbornly high inflation, record migration at the southern border and lingering concerns over his age.Biden had ascended into office declaring himself a transitional leader of the party and pledging to be a “bridge” to the next generation of Democratic leaders. But he put any doubts about whether he would serve a single term to rest when he announced a bid for reelection after his party performed well in the 2022 midterm elections.His decision to drop out of the race so late in the campaign cycle ensures that his presidency will be remembered as transitional — though the outcome of the election could determine what that transition ultimately leads to.Biden’s decision conjures up memories of Johnson, a Democrat who opted against running for a full second term in 1968, stepping aside after achieving successes on domestic policies but under pressure over his handling of the Vietnam War. Johnson’s vice president, Hubert Humphrey, ended up losing to Republican Richard M. Nixon in an electoral college landslide, an outcome Biden is now working to avoid in the race to stop  Trump.With his legacy hanging in the balance, Biden must turn his energy toward bolstering another candidate against a man he has called an existential threat to democracy.Before leaving the race and stepping aside from a lifetime of public service, Biden was asked what it would mean if he stayed in and lost to Trump.“I’m not in this for my legacy,” Biden said at the July 11 news conference. “I’m in this to complete the job I started.”"

Here’s a look at his long career, from being elected as one of the nation’s youngest senators in 1972 to becoming the nation’s oldest president in 2021.Nov. 3, 1970: As a young lawyer recruited by local Democrats, Biden wins a seat on the New Castle County Council. It is his first stint in elected office, and even before being sworn in to the county seat, he quickly sets his sights toward higher office.Nov. 7, 1972: Biden wins narrowly in a major upset over popular Republican incumbent Sen. J. Caleb Boggs. He had struggled to raise money, was down significantly in the polls, but campaigned aggressively by driving around the small state, and on election night won by just over 3,000 votes. He turned 30, the minimum age for a U.S. senator, less than two weeks after Election Day.Dec. 18, 1972: While in Washington setting up his Senate office, Biden’s wife and children are in a car accident in Hockessin, Del. His wife, Neilia, and his daughter, Naomi, are killed; his two boys, Beau and Hunter, are hospitalized. He is sworn in from his sons’ hospital bedside.January 1975: Biden is appointed as a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. His work on foreign affairs will be a defining aspect of his Senate career, and he later becomes chairman of the committee.1975: Biden becomes the most prominent Democrat opposing court-ordered busing as a way to integrate schools. “It’s an asinine concept, the utility of which has never been proven to me,” he says in one interview. He files and supports several pieces of legislation on the issue, in some cases working with segregationist senators.June 17, 1977: He weds Jill, a marriage that he says came in part at the urging of his sons, Beau and Hunter. Four years later, he and Jill have a daughter, Ashley.Nov. 7, 1978: Biden wins reelection. Unlike his first win, this race is not close and will solidify his grip on a Senate seat he will hold for 36 years.June 9, 1987: Biden, who had been rumored in past years as a presidential candidate, announces his first run for the presidency. He gets off to a quick and promising start, running as a new generation who could take over after Ronald Reagan left office, but his campaign collapses over a plagiarism scandal and he drops out on Sept. 23, 1987.February 1988: Biden has emergency surgery and is treated for two brain aneurysms. The situation is so dire that a Catholic priest is called to his bedside to administer last rites. He will return to work in the Senate later in the year.Oct. 11, 1991: Anita Hill is called to testify about sexual harassment allegations related to Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden oversees the hearings.Sept. 13, 1994: President Bill Clinton signs into law the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. It is a sweeping crime bill that Biden helps push through Congress and it includes the Violence Against Women Act, one of Biden’s signature pieces of legislation.Oct. 11, 2002: Biden, a longtime member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, supports the resolution authorizing military force in Iraq and, as the committee chairman, helps ensure its passage. It is a vote he later regrets.Jan. 31, 2007: Biden announces his second presidential campaign, this one focused on his long record of experience. But he struggles against the higher wattage, history-making candidacies of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and, after a dismal fifth-place finish in the Iowa caucuses, drops out of the race on Jan. 3, 2008.Aug. 22, 2008: Biden is named as Obama’s running mate, bringing to a ticket a longer record in Washington and an ability to reach the White working-class voters in the industrial Midwestern swing states. He debates against GOP vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin, and campaigns against his longtime friend and Senate colleague John McCain.Jan. 20, 2009: Biden is sworn in to office as the 47th vice president. A few days earlier, in a farewell address to the U.S. Senate, where he was one of the longest-serving senators in history, he said, “Every good thing I have seen happen here, every bold step taken in the 36-plus years I have been here, came not from the application of pressure by interest groups, but through the maturation of personal relationships.”March 23, 2010: During a ceremony signing the Affordable Care Act into law, Biden leans over and whispers into Obama’s ear a comment that the microphones caught, calling the accomplishment “a big f---ing deal.” It is a symbol of Biden’s role with Obama, one that is a little more blunt and a lot more off-script.May 6, 2012: During an interview on NBC News’s “Meet the Press,” Biden says he is “absolutely comfortable” with same-sex marriage. He becomes one of the highest-profile politicians to take the stance, which irks some aides to Obama, who had been moving in that direction but hadn’t stated so publicly.Oct. 11, 2012: Biden debates Republican vice-presidential nominee Sen. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). The exchange happens five days after Obama’s widely panned first debate with former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney and Biden’s strong performance boosts Democrats who had grown concerned about their reelection chances.Oct. 21, 2015: In remarks delivered in the Rose Garden, Biden announces that he will not run for president in 2016, ending months of speculation about whether he would get into the race. The announcement comes amid a time of family grief, about five months after his son Beau died of brain cancer.April 25, 2019: Biden announces he will launch his third presidential campaign. He enters as a front-runner in a crowded Democratic field, but his lead will dwindle. After losing the first three nominating contests, he uses a resounding win in South Carolina to gain what becomes unstoppable momentum that carries him to the nomination.Jan. 20, 2021: Biden will be sworn in to office as the nation’s 46th president."
WaPo_60,Netanyahu comes to Washington as Biden withdraws from presidential race,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/21/israel-netanyahu-dc-visit-biden-trump/,2024-07-22 02:51:02.831781,,"JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to land Monday in a Washington consumed by political turmoil, creating further uncertainty about U.S.-Israeli relations at a crucial moment in the Gaza war.President Biden — who announced the end of his reelection bid on the eve of Netanyahu’s departure — has both championed Israel’s right to wage war against Hamas and chided the prime minister for his management of the conflict. Israeli officials didn’t confirm that the prime minister would meet with the president as planned until the day before takeoff; they now don’t know what the dramatic campaign upheaval will mean for the future.Immediately after Biden’s announcement, a person familiar with deliberations in Netanyahu’s office said it was “too early” to say how the trip, and Israel’s war effort, might be affected. Like others in this story, they spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive topics.Netanyahu is scheduled to address a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday. But it is the chaos of the presidential race that has transfixed observers, with Biden bowing to pressure to step aside and Donald Trump surging after a failed assassination attempt. The fast-shifting political winds could embolden the Israeli leader, analysts said, at a crucial time in Gaza cease-fire negotiations.U.S.-backed talks in Cairo are reportedly gaining momentum, with the administration pressing a reluctant Netanyahu to accept a deal that would end the fighting in exchange for the release of more than 100 Israeli hostages held by militants. Dozens of the captives are still alive, Israeli officials believe.Stories to keep you informed

‘Magical’ self-portrait was hidden for decades — until the canvas was flipped
How can I get healthier hair? Here’s what the science says. 
Two dead in listeria outbreak linked to deli meat. Here’s what to know.Netanyahu has been accused by critics of prolonging the war for his own political benefit, a charge he denies. He remains adamant that Israel must fight until Hamas has been destroyed, a goal his own generals have said is unachievable.Officially, Netanyahu is neutral in American politics. But he has long been criticized for aligning with Republicans. And he made no secret of his delight with Trump, who tilted U.S. policy significantly in favor of the Israeli right during his term — moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and recognizing Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights.Netanyahu’s tense relationship with Biden has deteriorated greatly in recent months as Israel has defied numerous White House entreaties to increase the flow of humanitarian aid in Gaza and do more to protect civilians. The administration put a hold on 2,000-pound bombs to Israel in May, citing their use in populated areas.More than 38,900 Palestinians have been killed in the war, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians but says the majority of the dead are women and children.Netanyahu told reporters as he was preparing to depart Monday that he still expected to meet with Biden and to thank the president for supporting Israel throughout his long career. The prime minister said he intended “to tell our friends on both sides that regardless of who is elected to lead the American people after the presidential elections, Israel is its most important ally in the Middle East.”But some of the prime minister’s allies had begun cheering Trump more explicitly, framing cease-fire talks as a partisan U.S. issue. Itamar Ben Gvir, Netanyahu’s far-right national security minister, warned colleagues last week that approving a hostage deal would be “a slap for Trump, which would be a victory for Biden,” according to Israeli media reports. Any agreement, he insisted, should wait until November.Some political observers here say Biden’s eroding position in recent weeks had already begun to free Netanyahu’s hand in Gaza.Michael Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to Washington, said U.S. pressure on Israel to rein in its military campaign has eased in recent weeks. The administration has offered little public criticism of escalating attacks in areas packed with civilians, including in Mawasi, an area designated by Israel as a humanitarian zone. Massive strikes there this month targeting senior Hamas leader Mohammed Deif killed at least 90 people, according to health officials.“The pressure has gone now,” Oren said before Biden’s announcement. “It’s nothing like it was.”Biden’s team has backed off in part because of signs the attacks are making Hamas more amenable to a deal, Oren said, and what the president “really needs is a diplomatic win to show he can achieve big things internationally.”U.S. administration officials denied, before the president dropped out, that Netanyahu had been significantly emboldened by Biden’s struggles. But they acknowledged that the president’s mounting problems have coincided with a hardening of the prime minister’s position. Netanyahu recently came forward with last-minute demands that U.S. negotiators feared would stymie the Cairo talks, according to diplomats familiar with the discussions.Under the new conditions, Israel would not agree to withdraw its forces from the Philadelphi Corridor along the Egyptian border, said the diplomats, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive and ongoing negotiations. Israel would also not allow unrestricted access for Gazans seeking to return to their homes in the north — insisting that its forces be permitted to establish checkpoints to monitor the movement of the displaced.“The fact that Netanyahu put these conditions out so publicly means he feels more confident,” Oren said.Netanyahu was certainly paying attention to the churning U.S. campaign, Israeli officials say. “Everyone recognizes that Biden is weak,” said the person familiar with deliberations in the prime minister’s office.But Netanyahu was far more focused on his own political challenges, they said.The prime minister is squeezed between the Israeli public, increasingly angry at his failure to reach a hostage-release deal, and his far-right coalition partners, threatening to bring down the government if he agrees to stop fighting Hamas. Eight members of Netanyahu’s own Likud party went public in recent days with a list of “red lines” they could not support in a deal, including Israel’s withdrawal from central Gaza and the Egyptian border.Netanyahu will be feverishly working to keep his coalition partners in line until July 28, when Israel’s parliament begins a three-month recess.“The next weeks will be critical,” said the person familiar with deliberations. “Right now the pressure from the inside is far more significant than pressure from the States.”Before Biden’s move, Netanyahu had no plans to seek a meeting with Trump during his Washington trip, officials said, or even with Vice President Harris, whom Biden quickly endorsed Sunday to take his place at the top of the ticket.The prime minister was fully aware that no matter the outcome of the November election, Israel would be dealing with Biden for the remainder of his term, said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute.Netanyahu is likely to be on his best bipartisan behavior during this visit, unlike in his controversial address to Congress in 2015 when, at the invitation of Republicans, he slammed the Barack Obama administration’s Iran nuclear deal. Unlike now, that dust-up occurred just weeks before an Israeli election and was designed for domestic political impact, Plesner noted.“It’s a totally different situation now,” he said. “Netanyahu needs President Biden every day.”While many Democrats remain bitter over Netanyahu’s 2015 trip, and scores of them plan on boycotting his address, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Friday that he had received a “broad preview” of Netanyahu’s speech last week and it did not appear partisan in tone — instead focusing on “how the U.S. and Israel are trying together to face down the terrorist threat” and coordinate on “regional challenges.”Sullivan acknowledged, however, that “they’re going to keep working that speech until the very last minute, just like we do on our side.”Netanyahu will be in Washington at the peak of partisan frenzy, between the two party conventions and with Democrats scrambling to figure out their next steps. U.S. officials confided they were nervous about his visit at such a volatile time, worried he may say or do something that scuttles their Gaza diplomacy.“It’s impossible to have confidence in how this plays out,” a U.S. official said.Hudson reported from Washington."

Some states have August deadlines to get on the ballot for the general election, and early voting begins in some places in September.

Source: APThere are two types of Democratic delegates.Pledged delegates commit to supporting the candidate state voters chose, although a “good conscience” clause in the party’s rules gives them a bit of wiggle room.The party allocates pledged delegates to each state or territory, and state party officials divvy them out to candidates.Jurisdictions have different criteria, but in general, almost any registered voter deemed to be loyal to the party and the candidate can be a pledged delegate: poll workers, local elected officials, fundraisers, even candidates’ kids.Automatic delegates, often called superdelegates, are the party’s highest-profile leaders. They have the role because of the offices they hold (or held), and the group includes former presidents and vice presidents, Democratic governors, members of Congress and party officials.They are not pledged to any candidate and are not allowed to vote on the first ballot at the convention.We could.If the party goes ahead with a long-planned virtual vote, it could officially lock in the nominee before the convention starts on Aug. 19, and the contest would be over.Biden has endorsed Vice President Harris, which could strongly tip the scales toward unity. His nearly 3,900 delegates wouldn’t be required to back Harris, but they were chosen for their loyalty to him and may be inclined to do what he asks, especially because she was already on the ticket that the primary voters chose.The virtual vote is not a typical part of the process. It was largely set up to confirm Biden as the nominee before Ohio’s ballot deadline, which falls before the Democratic convention this year. Ohio legislators resolved the problem, but Democrats had planned to go through with the early vote anyway to avoid any legal challenges that would try to keep Biden off Ohio’s ballot.However, that allows very little time for the party to coalesce around a new nominee.Even if the virtual vote is canceled, the party could agree on Harris (or, much less likely, another candidate) before the convention. In that case, the convention might technically be considered open, but the proceedings could be as drama-free as usual.Democratic leaders would be motivated to settle the question quickly so a new nominee can begin a campaign as soon as possible, said Amy K. Dacey, the executive director of the Sine Institute of Policy and Politics at American University and a former CEO of the Democratic National Committee.“You’re ending a Republican convention where it’s very clear who their nominees are, whose names will appear on the ballot,” Dacey said. “... They now have this moment in time of like 31 days before the Democratic convention, where they have their nominees in place and they’re all campaigning.”But if there is no consensus before the delegates arrive in Chicago, the Democrats would have their first open and contested convention since 1968. That one, also in Chicago, went so catastrophically awry that the party overhauled the way it chooses candidates.AT THE CONVENTION

A nominee is chosenJust to get their name in the roll call vote, each candidate would need the signatures of at least 300 delegates, and no more than 50 can come from any one state.We would probably know early if anyone plans to challenge Harris, Dacey said, citing the short window of time available to drum up wider support. “If I’m somebody who wants to get my name in in a contested convention, the minute I have those 300 names, I’m going to say it,” she said.If there are challengers, behind-the-scenes maneuvering and dealmaking would rev up to warp speed as state party bosses try to corral their delegates into a voting bloc.Once everyone is in Chicago, candidates and their surrogates probably would blanket not just the convention floor but also hotels, bars and other assorted hidey holes looking for delegates to woo.Things have gone off the rails in past open conventions, when candidates clawed for every vote.In a Politico oral history of the 1976 Republican open convention, attendee Tom Korologos, former ambassador to Belgium, recalled a Gerald Ford delegate falling and badly injuring her leg. He said that rather than rushing her to a hospital, other delegates splinted her leg with convention programs and kept her within voting distance because they feared her replacement would cast a ballot for Ronald Reagan. (Ford won the nomination battle but lost the presidency to Democrat Jimmy Carter, who in 1980 lost to Reagan.)Soon enough, the first roll call vote would occur.If a candidate were to get a majority of delegates’ votes on the first ballot, that person would become the nominee, and everyone could finally relax a little.But if no one has a majority, a second vote would take place.At that point, the convention would be considered “brokered,” a term coined in long-ago conventions when party power brokers threw all their deal-making, arm-twisting might into finagling votes. There hasn’t been one of those since 1952.The toned-down 2024 version of that scenario would be that, starting with the second ballot, the superdelegates enter the voting pool.Voting would continue, round after round, until a candidate gets the votes of a majority of all delegates and would be named the party’s nominee.While it probably would make good television, party division playing out on the convention floor is hardly the ideal scenario.In 1924, the Democrats needed 103 rounds of voting to finally settle on compromise candidate John Davis after the two highest vote-getters withdrew. It didn’t work out well. Incumbent president Calvin Coolidge beat Davis in a landslide.Additional sources: Brookings Institution; “2024 Presidential Nominating Process: Frequently Asked Questions” by the Congressional Research Service; Ballotpedia, The Green Papers.Artur Galocha and Dan Balz contributed to this report.

WaPo_63,"For Joe Biden, who never gave up",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/21/biden-decision-end-reelection-career-political-resilience/,2024-07-22 02:03:02.831781,,"President Biden has always had trouble letting go, even if it was something as simple as a handshake in a receiving line. He might be tired and stressed at the end of a workday, but he would clasp each guest’s palm, maybe a pat on the back, too, or a hug, reminiscing and cajoling as the minutes ticked by and the line backed up.​Biden seemed to love all his jobs in government, especially this last one. The whole world was waiting in line to shake his hand. He could be irascible and demanding with his staff, but in his public role as president he was nearly always the genial patriarch. After a lifetime of being underestimated, he liked being in charge. And it was hard to give that up.​The country has watched Biden’s agonizing path toward Sunday’s  announcement that he won’t run for a second term. By the end, he seemed nearly alone in resisting this decision. Three-quarters of the country told pollsters a year ago that he was too old to serve another term as president. But perhaps Biden saw that long receiving line stretching toward the horizon, and he didn’t want to step away.​Biden’s decision will allow a relieved country to applaud his success as president. Much of the Republican critique of Biden is pure nonsense. In fact, he helped steward sustained economic growth. He made critical investments in technology and infrastructure. He rebuilt America’s foreign alliances. And he was steadfast in the great moral challenge of our time, which was resistance to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s dark designs on Ukraine and the world.​It’s often said that if we could see ourselves through others’ eyes, we would make better decisions about our weaknesses. But Biden for many months resisted recognizing what television viewers could plainly see: that he was aging and increasingly unsteady in ways that made another term as commander in chief problematic.Simply raising the question drew the wrath of Biden and his inner circle, as I discovered when I wrote a column in September arguing that despite my admiration for him and his policies, he shouldn’t run for reelection.In Biden-world, retirement was unmentionable, and his team quickly closed off any real discussion last year of his age and fitness for office. It wasn’t the best moment for his party, or for some members of the news media, who were so focused on the threat they saw in former president Donald Trump that they deflected any real discussion of Biden’s weaknesses.Why was Biden so resistant? Part of it surely was the pride and vanity everyone feels as they age. Older people don’t want to give up the keys to their cars even as they become a danger to others. They insist they can do everything as well as they could decades earlier, even when they can’t. It’s human to resist the signs of aging. I’m 74 myself, and I am deep into denial.But it’s different when you’re commander in chief. You can’t talk about getting to bed earlier when you’re the person who could receive the ominous phone call at 2 a.m. warning that an adversary has launched a missile strike. “I just got to pace myself a little more, pace myself,” Biden said in a July 11 news conference. That’s good advice for most people, but if you hold the fate of the world in your hands, it’s not enough. Covering over your infirmities can be an act of recklessness.Biden’s stubbornness has in some ways been one of his superpowers. He was the guy who was always undervalued. Others might be sharper debaters or more innovative thinkers, but Biden stayed in the fight, through personal tragedies and political reversals. That bred a self-confidence that could be downright ornery at times. One of Biden’s close advisers likened the Biden White House to a sentimental but sometimes dysfunctional Irish family. You did not want to make the boss angry.The public Biden conveyed the common sense of a normal person. He was the guy from Scranton, Pa., who had grown up in the middle of the middle. He prized the “regular order” of the Senate. After spending more than half his life as a legislator, he knew how to compromise. He was the scrappy come-from-behind guy. People didn’t think he could win the White House in 2020 or be a good president. But he proved them wrong, twice over, and that reinforced his belief in his own judgment and resistance to others.​Biden’s mission, as he so often said, was to defeat Trump, who he thought was genuinely dangerous to the country. If Trump hadn’t cruised toward the nomination, Biden might have stepped back months ago, one of his close friends told me. Biden truly felt an obligation to halt the MAGA menace again, as he had in the 2020 presidential race and the 2022 midterm elections.​“I think I’m the most qualified person to run for president. I beat him once, and I will beat him again,” he said at that July 11 news conference. “I got more work to do. We’ve got more work to finish.” Really, it was as simple as that.​I hope Biden will preside over a competitive race to choose a successor, rather than anoint Vice President Harris. She will be a better candidate and potential president if she goes through a tumultuous one-month barnstorming campaign that should energize the Democrats and the country.​When President Lyndon B. Johnson stepped back from reelection in March 1968, he had a kind of rebirth. Doris Kearns Goodwin writes in a new book that “the lame duck rose like a phoenix from the ashes.” Johnson’s poll ratings reversed from 57 percent disapproval to 57 percent approval. An editorial in the Washington Post said he had made “a personal sacrifice in the name of national unity that entitles him to a very special place in the annals of American history.”​A similar wave of public admiration should follow Biden’s decision. He did the right things as president for America and the world, even when it hurt. He put the country back together after a bruising Trump presidency. And in the end, he understood it was time to go."
WaPo_64,"With Biden stepping aside, Democrats must now embrace an open process",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/21/biden-drop-out-dnc-convention-harris/,2024-07-22 02:27:02.831781,,"President Biden took one of the most consequential steps imaginable: He ended his bid for a second term. After more than half a century of public service, Mr. Biden learned that relinquishing power isn’t easy. It required a push from the Democratic establishment but also the sort of selflessness that is too often absent from U.S. politics.Mr. Biden campaigned in 2020 as a “bridge” to the next generation of Democratic leaders. Passing the torch now — four years earlier than he had hoped — increases the odds that his party can hold the White House. But Democrats need to proceed carefully.Vice President Harris is the heavy favorite to emerge as the party’s standard-bearer at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month. Delegates likely will not want to deny the nomination to the first female vice president. That’s why many potential top-tier contenders signaled that they will not challenge her.An open process for picking Mr. Biden’s replacement as Democratic nominee, as well as that person’s running mate, risks becoming messy and chaotic. It could draw attention to Democratic divisions over hot-button issues such as U.S. support for Israel. The Democratic convention was already shaping up to be contentious before Mr. Biden’s exit, with the possibility of large protests outside the venue.Yet Mr. Biden’s decision creates an opportunity for a reset, not only for his party but also for U.S. politics generally, through a competitive nomination process among future national leaders. Barack Obama was a stronger candidate in 2008, and maybe even a better president, because Hillary Clinton competed so fiercely with him during a marathon primary season. Though this sort of vetting process isn’t replicable, there is time for Democrats to scrutinize the top of the ticket.The logistics of a compressed nominating contest would not be hard. France just held snap elections without a hitch. All the delegates and superdelegates are already selected and set to convene in Chicago. Democrats would not even have to schedule primaries: Debates among the top contenders would do.Polls show Ms. Harris is the best known among the potential Democratic nominees, but, by the same token, she has a record in the Biden administration — including her validation of Mr. Biden’s fitness for a second term — that people have a right to examine. She did not succeed in addressing the root causes of illegal immigration, an assignment the president gave her, but she excelled as a messenger decrying the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade.Perhaps more important, she is not the only option. Governors include Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer, North Carolina’s Roy Cooper and Kentucky’s Andy Beshear. Two Democratic governors elected in 2022 could have bright futures on the national stage: Maryland’s Wes Moore and Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro. There are talented Cabinet secretaries, especially Commerce’s Gina Raimondo and Transportation’s Pete Buttigieg. Senators made of presidential timber include Arizona’s Mark Kelly and Colorado’s Michael Bennet.At each decision point, Democrats should err on the side of transparency. Even if Ms. Harris quickly locks down the nomination, her running mate should still be decided at the convention. State delegations and superdelegates could play a vital role during nationally televised proceedings that would grip the country and shine the spotlight on Democrats.Even though he’s not seeking another term, Mr. Biden can still help his party campaign against Mr. Trump this fall. By far his most important assignment now, though, is to work on getting the country in the best possible shape for his successor. Unburdened from the rigors of the campaign trail, Mr. Biden can help bring a long-sought conclusion to the war in Gaza and the release of hostages as well as pilot the U.S. economy to a soft landing from inflation that will be made likelier if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates.The United States just celebrated the Fourth of July for the 248th time. Mr. Biden has been alive for nearly one-third of that history. His selfless and prudent decision to stand down improves his party’s prospects today, and, undoubtedly, retrospective assessments of his presidency tomorrow."
WaPo_65,Melting on Minnesota Ave.: A relentless struggle against record heat,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/21/minnesota-ave-heat-wave-dc-fire-ems/,2024-07-22 03:34:03.108204,,"It was 87 degrees in the ambulance. D.C. firefighter Joseph Arias fiddled with the thermostat to try to drop the temperature a few notches. His partner and a paramedic encouraged their patient to relax and chill for a few minutes. Outside, D.C. baked in triple digits during a record heat wave.“Someone said you passed out,” paramedic Lt. Brian Perry told the man. “We’re going to spend a couple of minutes in this nice AC while we check you out.”Minutes before, the firefighters and Perry had gently lifted the man in his 60s onto a stretcher after he fell on a sidewalk in the 3700 block of Minnesota Avenue NE.During a brief examination, they ticked off boxes of what might have taken him down: Diabetes, prescription medication, blood pressure. They even took pictures of his heart.A likely culprit? That day, last Tuesday, D.C. hit 104 degrees.Firefighter/EMT Sheena Sanders helped the patient to stay calm during the examination. “It’s really hot, it’s too hot to be out here,” Sanders told him. “It’s too hot for us to be out here, mister man.”This call, along this block of Minnesota Avenue, is familiar territory for D.C. first responders. The working-class area features commercial stretches, interspersed with a mix of apartments, rowhouses and redeveloped housing.Despite the dangerous conditions, the city seemingly avoided any reported heat-related deaths last week as officials directed residents to cooling centers, splash pads and pools, and canceled other outdoor activities.For many working Washingtonians — and many without work — staying inside wasn’t an option, particularly along high-traffic stretches such as Minnesota Avenue between the Deanwood and Anacostia neighborhoods. Many people here buckled in the heat, and while some needed medical help, others needed a seat in the shade.D.C. fire officials reported being dispatched for 29 heat emergency calls citywide from Monday to Thursday, but often discovered heat as a contributing factor for dispatches related to patients reported unconscious, sick and with difficulty breathing.City officials said a cooling center was set up in Ward 7 at the Department of Aging and Community Living’s Washington Seniors Wellness Center. The city also deployed cooling buses at Minnesota Avenue and T Street SE nearly a dozen times between  June 21 and Thursday.By Thursday, residents caught a break from the blistering heat, with temperatures under 90 degrees for the first time all week.But even at 85 degrees at a bus stop at Minnesota Avenue and Benning Road, construction worker Cliff Villagram was drenched in sweat and needed to wipe his forehead with a gray wash cloth after finishing a shift that began at 5 a.m.“There’s no way to keep cool but drink water. I drink ice water all day,” said the 53-year-old as he waited for a bus to his mother’s place in NOMA for his second job as her home aide.Sweat towels and cool drinks served as essential tools to weather the heat.Vendor Diego Cunningham eats lots of fruit and takes the bus for any trip more than a few blocks. The 36-year-old Texas native stashed a bottle of generic Pedialyte in his bag Thursday and admitted that the heat has been unbearable even for him.“It’s almost Houston hot!” Cunningham said. “Between drinking electrolytes and eating fruit bars I stay cool.”Up and down Minnesota Avenue, people found pockets of shade under trees, bus stop shelters and vendor tents.At lunchtime, office workers zoomed in and out of their buildings to grab their lunches as quickly as possible to avoid the heat.“I literally just walked down to Popeyes because Popeyes is right here, and it’s too hot,” said 30-year-old Nadiia Hernandez.It was just two minutes — 400 feet — from her building, but it was enough for the business owner to break a sweat in her blazer.Activist Jay Brown, who runs Community Shoulders, said some residents tell him that the closest cooling center, the Benning/Dorothy I. Height Library, doesn’t stay open long enough and that more resources would help them to better endure the heat.“The D.C. government’s disconnect or intentional neglect of sustainable lifesaving resources on Minnesota Avenue is a reflection of how [communities’] members of certain races and backgrounds are treated all over the city,” Brown said. “The city cannot expect a positive functioning ecosystem if all of its citizens are not included in the input of the problems and solutions.”Asked about these criticisms, city officials  said they partnered with the East River Family Strengthening Collaborative to distribute air purifiers, fans, surge protectors and smart outlets to seniors in Ward 7. In addition, some families received financial help to pay outstanding utility bills to ensure they had electricity to fuel air conditioning.“Each year, we review and evaluate the District’s Heat Emergency Plan to expand our resources and guidance for residents and visitors to remain safe during periods of extreme heat,” Clint Osborn, director of the District’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency said in a statement. “DC Government stands ready to support our most vulnerable communities with resources and information on how they can protect themselves from extreme weather and stay safe, cool, and healthy.”On Wednesday near Minnesota Avenue and Naylor Road, Rich Gibson camped in a folding chair all day — a pair of gold-framed prints of African art leaned against a tree.The licensed clinical social worker has been unhoused for the past two months, and as afternoon temperatures climbed to 101 degrees the shady spot brought the best relief he could manage.Gibson had two hopes: a cool breeze and a customer for the art that might fund his next meal and a sweet tea with tons of ice.“I’ll sell you the whole thing for $15,” Gibson pitched.Low on cash and out of favors from family and friends, Gibson perched on the sidewalk with his wares.The unhoused often seek shelter in vacant apartment buildings nearby but not during the heat wave, Gibson said. Indoors was simply too hot.“If you come by at night, you’ll see people sleeping under these trees, brother. For real, nowhere to go,” Gibson said.By midafternoon, he hadn’t made a sale, and cool breezes were nearly as rare as customers. A friend offered Gibson a place for a few days, but there was no air conditioning.He shifted to a new quest: a cheap box fan."
WaPo_66,"Trump slams Biden as he departs race, while advisers prepare to face Harris",https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/07/21/trump-response-biden-dropping-out/,2024-07-22 03:08:03.108204,,"Donald Trump lashed out Sunday at President Biden after the incumbent said he was ending his campaign, as his advisers mapped out a new strategy to adapt to a decision that upended the race less than four months before the election.The Republican nominee, whose campaign had hoped Biden would stay in the contest, wrote on his social media website that Biden was “never” fit to serve or run for reelection and vowed to “remedy the damage he has done very quickly.” In private, his aides were advancing preparations to run against Vice President Harris, anticipating that their main argument against her would focus on her role in Biden’s border policy, according to people familiar with the situation, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy.Aides to the former president had hoped that Biden would stay in because they viewed him as easiest to beat, but they began preparing for other possibilities well before Biden left the race and have ramped up their attacks on Harris. Privately, Trump allies have worried that a Democrat besides Biden or Harris could be a tougher opponent.Biden endorsed Harris as his successor Sunday.Multiple Trump advisers said the main argument against Harris will be her role addressing the root causes of migration to the U.S. — which Republicans have used to brand her the “border czar” — and what has happened at the southern border under her watch.Trump posted his reaction on Truth Social, his social media site, about 45 minutes after Biden shared a letter announcing his withdrawal.“Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve — And never was!” Trump wrote. “He only attained the position of President by lies, Fake News, and not leaving his Basement.”  He added, “We will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly.”Biden ended his campaign after weeks of growing pressure to do so from fellow Democrats after a widely criticized debate performance in which he repeatedly appeared to lose his train of thought.Other Republican leaders started coalescing behind a clear message: If Biden couldn’t run for reelection, then he should not continue serving as president. In a flood of statements, they accused Democrats of covering up Biden’s condition and said voters should remember it in November.“Voters will neither forgive nor forget the ultimate betrayal of their trust,” said National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Richard Hudson (R-N.C.). “Judgment day is coming in November, when Americans will hand down Democrats’ ultimate punishment: Donald Trump in the White House and a larger House Republican majority.”House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) echoed the Trump team’s suggestions that Democrats were acting undemocratically in pushing for Biden’s removal from the ticket.“The party’s prospects are no better now with Vice President Kamala Harris, who co-owns the disastrous policy failures of the Biden Administration,” Johnson said in a statement, tying her to Biden’s border policies in particular.At a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Saturday, Trump ridiculed Harris’s laugh, mispronounced her first name — which many Republicans routinely butcher — and called the vice president “crazy,” “nuts” and “crazy as Nancy Pelosi.”Sen J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), Trump’s running mate, attacked Harris as well, drawing loud boos when he mentioned her name.“Kamala Harris said something to the effect that I have no loyalty to this country,” Vance said. “Well, I don’t know, Kamala. I did serve in the United States Marine Corps and built a business, what the hell have you done, other than collect a check?”"
WaPo_67,"Kamala Harris’s life, career and firsts from AG to the vice presidency",https://www.washingtonpost.com/photography/2020/08/14/amp-stories/moments-kamala-harriss-career-captured-photos-2/,2024-07-22 03:01:03.108204,,"President Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race Sunday, endorsing his running mate, Vice President Harris, to take his place.In a statement posted on X, Biden wrote, “Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year.”The historic move comes after Biden faced growing calls from within the Democratic Party to step aside after his halting performance at his first presidential debate against former president Donald Trump last month.Harris is the first woman, first Black person and first Asian American to ascend to the vice presidency. Now, Biden’s endorsement could put her on track to become the first female president.Here is what you should know about Harris, including her history of barrier-breaking firsts.Harris was born in Oakland, Calif., in 1964. Her parents, Shyamala Gopalan, a cancer researcher from India, and Donald Harris, an economist from Jamaica, immigrated to the United States and met while pursuing advanced degrees at the University of California at Berkeley. Harris has one sister, Maya.Her parents were involved in activism, taking Harris to civil rights marches when she was  still in a stroller, according to her White House biography. Harris’s parents divorced when she was seven, and she has credited her mother, who became her primary caregiver, for immersing her and her sister in both their Indian and African American cultures while they were growing up.“My mother understood very well that she was raising two Black daughters,” Harris wrote in her 2019 autobiography, “and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud Black women.”Harris moved to Canada with her mother and sister when she was 12, and after high school in Quebec, she returned to the United States to study at Howard University, a historically Black school in Washington, D.C.Harris has said that after attending majority-White schools since elementary school, she was ready for a different experience in college.The “beauty of Howard,” Harris wrote in her memoir, was that ""every signal told students that we could be anything — that we were young, gifted, and black, and we shouldn’t let anything get in the way of our success.”She majored in political science and economics, spending many weekends protesting against apartheid in South Africa on the National Mall. She also participated in a 1983 sit-in of an administration building to protest the expulsion of the student newspaper’s editor.After graduating from Howard, she earned a law degree in 1989 from the University of California at Hastings. She was admitted to the State Bar of California in 1990, and  joined the Alameda County prosecutor’s office in Oakland as an assistant district attorney specializing in prosecuting child sexual assault cases.Harris has said she became a prosecutor because she wanted to work from the inside to change a criminal justice system that disproportionately  affects minorities. She went on to serve in the San Francisco District Attorney’s Office, where she prosecuted serial felony offenders as the office’s managing attorney for its Career Criminal Unit. She subsequently led the San Francisco City Attorney’s Division on Families and Children.Harris ran for San Francisco district attorney in 2003 against an incumbent for whom she had worked. During the campaign, her opponents questioned the propriety of her previous acceptance of two state board positions. She had been appointed to the roles by the former speaker of the California State Assembly and San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, with whom she previously had a romantic relationship. Candidates in the race also raised doubts about whether she could fairly investigate Brown’s mayoral administration.She won the race in 2003, becoming the first African American woman and South Asian American woman in California to hold the office. Seven years later, in her second term as district attorney, she earned the same superlatives when she was elected California’s attorney general.Harris’s tenure as district attorney helped her in her statewide attorney general bid, and her later Senate bid, but some of her record has been controversial. In her 2020 presidential run, her decision as attorney general to threaten criminal charges against parents of truant students was criticized as some jurisdictions sent parents to jail while enforcing the policy. Harris has called those jailings “unintended consequences"" and said that she never sent any parents to jail under the policy.A more liberal policy from her record as a prosecutor is Harris’s challenge of California’s Three Strikes law, which allowed sentences of 25 years to life for a third felony conviction. When she was San Francisco’s chief prosecutor, Harris enforced the sentences only if the third offense was serious or violent. A half-dozen years after Harris began advocating against the law, voters overturned it.In 2010, Harris defied the odds by winning the race for California attorney general, beating Steve Cooley, a popular Republican Los Angeles County prosecutor, by a narrow margin.As attorney general, Harris’s track record on criminal justice was also mixed. She preserved, for instance, local jurisdictions’ authority to use police body cameras and investigate police shootings. She supported the use of body cameras, but she did not implement statewide standards for the use of those cameras, and she opposed a bill that would have required the attorney general’s office to investigate police shootings.Harris, however, opposed capital punishment as district attorney. She refused in San Francisco to prosecute death penalty cases — even in a high-profile case involving the killing of a police officer, a decision that drew the ire of local police unions. But as attorney general, she also appealed a California court ruling that declared the death penalty unconstitutional.While serving as attorney general in California in 2014, Harris married Doug Emhoff, a lawyer in Los Angeles, at a small ceremony officiated by her sister, Maya. Emhoff’s two children from a prior marriage — Ella and Cole — gave Harris the nickname “Momala.”In 2016, Harris ran for the U.S. Senate with the backing of then-President Obama and then-Vice President Biden. She handily beat Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D)  the other Senate candidate on the general election ballot in California.Upon her victory — a bright spot for Democrats as they saw Trump secure the presidency — she became only the second Black woman to join the upper chamber.During her time in the Senate, Harris distinguished herself by applying her prosecutorial skills to grill Trump’s nominees and appointees during committee hearings.Harris, who served on the Senate Judiciary Committee, pressed then-U. S. Supreme Court  nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh on whether he knew of any laws that tell a man what to do with his body, as abortion laws do for women, flustering him and prompting him to say he did not. She also pushed him on whether he had discussed the Mueller investigation with anyone at a law firm linked to Trump.And in May 2019, Attorney General William P. Barr appeared before the Judiciary Committee, and Harris asked whether Trump — or anyone else at the White House — had ever suggested he open an investigation of someone.Barr hesitated and then asked her to repeat the question. As he searched for an answer, Harris remarked, “Seems you’d remember something like that.”Ultimately, Barr said he could not answer the question, and Democrats cheered the exchange as revealing potential ethical concerns and what they considered Barr’s inappropriate closeness with the White House.In 2019, two years after being sworn into the Senate, Harris announced her run for president. And during the first Democratic presidential primary debate, Harris’s breakout moment came when she went after Biden.Harris, the only Black candidate on the stage, called out Biden for comments he had recently made at a fundraiser. Biden suggested that he’s good at bringing people together — citing his relationships with segregationists in the Senate in the 1970s as proof.Harris said during the debate that Biden’s comments were “hurtful to hear.”She also criticized Biden over his opposition to busing in the 1970s in personal terms, pointing out that she was part of only the second class of students at her school in California that was racially integrated through a policy that transported Black students to mostly White schools.While Harris was seen within the Democratic Party as a rising female star, she ultimately struggled to garner sustained support in the polls during her presidential run. Harris dropped out of the presidential race in December 2019 — two months before the first primary votes were cast. In a note to her supporters, Harris stressed her campaign’s financial struggles as the driving force behind her exit.In the summer of 2020, Biden announced he had selected her to be his running mate, delivering on his promise to put a woman on the ticket.“This morning, all across this nation, little girls woke up, especially little Black and Brown girls who so often may feel overlooked and undervalued in our society,” Biden said. “But today, maybe, just maybe, they’re seeing themselves for the first time in a new way.”When Biden declared victory in November 2020, Harris became the first vice president-elect in recent history to deliver a victory speech along with the president-elect. In all white, a tribute to the suffragists who secured the vote for women only a century earlier, Harris acknowledged that she was doing something no one like her had ever done.“Tonight, I reflect on their struggle, their determination and the strength of their vision — to see what can be, unburdened by what has been. And I stand on their shoulders,” she said. “And what a testament it is to Joe’s character that he had the audacity to break one of the most substantial barriers that exists in our country and select a woman as his vice president.”Early on in her tenure as vice president, Biden assigned Harris a politically thorny portfolio issue for the administration — addressing the underlying causes of immigration. She also took up the mantle of voting rights, an issue that continues to divide Washington along partisan lines and where no major legislation was passed despite multiple attempts. After her first year as vice president, her office also sustained several high-profile departures, with staff churn leading to questions about Harris’s management style.The Supreme Court’s decision in 2022 to overturn the fundamental right to abortion established in 1973 in Roe v. Wade was a turning point for Harris. She had been the administration’s voice on maternal health and then expanded further into reproductive rights. Harris has spoken in more explicit terms about restrictions to abortion access than Biden has.

WaPo_70,The case for Kamala Harris — and for a Republican VP,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/21/kamala-harris-haley-cheney-biden/,2024-07-22 03:00:03.108204,,"President Biden announced on Sunday that he would not accept the Democratic nomination for president. Since the first presidential debate, readers have written to The Post to make the case that Vice President Harris should be the nominee if Mr. Biden stepped aside.Monica Hesse’s July 4 Style column, “Finally time for Kamala to fall into the race?,” discussed the suggestion that Vice President Harris might be a possible Democratic candidate if President Biden drops out.The vice president is well qualified. She was attorney general of the most populous state in the union, has several years’ experience as a successful senator and her time as vice president would be invaluable in equipping her to get off to a fast start as head of the executive branch.Ms. Harris is in many respects the “natural” successor to President Biden and her nomination could avoid a contentious and messy open convention. Could one seriously consider ignoring Ms. Harris’s obvious claim to succeed Mr. Biden, without provoking immense anger among large segments of the Democratic voters?Finally, among the very large number of voters who dislike both the current leading candidates as being too old, too White or both, Ms. Harris could be a very attractive alternative. And those who voted for Nikki Haley in the Republican primaries might find Ms. Harris an acceptable choice for them, too.Arnold J. Clift, Brattleboro, Vt.I’m a Democrat and a democrat and I’m ready to pull my hair out with all these primarily White and male politicians (most recently Rep. Adam Schiff,) and pundits calling for President Biden to drop out of the race without simultaneously endorsing Vice President Harris, especially since Mr. Biden tested positive for the coronavirus.This fantastical mini- or blitz-primary idea subverts the will of the primary voters who voted for Mr. Biden — regardless of what polls might show they thought then or think now about the president’s age. Realists among us recognize that we voted for Mr. Biden and that means he’s our nominee. However, if we must entertain the idea of replacing him, I would like us all to recognize that voters also voted for Ms. Harris, by name, on the same ticket, with the same punched chad or fingertip to touch screen or old-fashioned black-ink-filled bubble. Any elected or campaigning Democrat should recognize that fact and endorse Ms. Harris in the same breath they used to call for Mr. Biden to drop out.The American people voted four years ago, and the Democratic primary voters voted this year, for Ms. Harris to replace Mr. Biden should that be necessary. Anything else is skulduggery. It sidesteps not just one, but two choices made by the Democratic primary voters. My perception of this moment is that many of my fellow White Democrats want to skip over and ignore the first successful Black and Asian female vice president in this country’s history to put up someone who looks more like Donald Trump’s vice-presidential pick, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio).I support the Democratic Party, the core of which is Black women. And fancy that: Our only plausible, legitimate replacement for Mr. Biden is also a Black woman. Likewise, I support our democracy and am committed to recognizing who among our citizens would be most harmed by a second Trump term. It’s not me, and it’s not the people ignoring Mr. Biden’s obvious replacement: It is the actual base of our party! Why are we always courting the wishy-washy, low-information voters instead of the people who brought us to the White House in the first place? Constitutionally, Ms. Harris would replace Mr. Biden if something were to happen to him between now and Jan. 20. It seems absurd to suggest that she is not our most viable, but our only, alternative to Mr. Biden.Barbara Torrey Workman, Atascadero, Calif.There have been instances where individuals who were affiliated with different parties formed a unity ticket or coalition. One notable example occurred in the 1864 presidential election during the Civil War, when President Abraham Lincoln, a Republican, chose Andrew Johnson, a Democrat, as his running mate. This decision was part of Lincoln’s strategy to promote national unity during a time of deep division.We are divided today, as then. Why not a Democratic ticket with Vice President Harris (or a moderate Democrat) for president and a conscientious Republican such as Chris Christie, Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger or Asa Hutchinson for vice president? We would get each of them working together with policy that makes sense for a majority of America, without the chaos of Donald Trump. The vice-presidential nominee’s followers and independents would swing the election for the country’s good.Alan B. Scharf, Boynton Beach, Fla.If Vice President Harris should become the Democratic nominee for president, the perfect running mate for her on the Democratic ticket would be former representative Liz Cheney. This choice would be historic because it would be not only bipartisan but also feature two women as a team for the first time. Ms. Cheney would bring to the ticket the most effective advocacy against a second Trump presidency that no other vice-presidential candidate could match.The biggest weakness in our two-party system has been become its tribal nature. This keeps people from thinking independently and choosing the two best candidates for our highest offices. A Harris-Cheney ticket, if accepted, would energize segments of the electorate that have all but given up on being represented in this upcoming election. The threat to our democracy is very real with Donald Trump, and the Democratic Party needs the strongest crusader against Mr. Trump that they can muster.That is Ms. Cheney.Donald Collins, WashingtonWe suggest that the Democratic Party adopt a “Unite for Democracy” platform and nominate Kamala D. Harris for president and former Illinois Republican representative Adam Kinzinger (or another anti-Trump traditional conservative) as vice president.As a former prosecutor and abortion rights advocate, Ms. Harris stands in stark contrast with Mr. Trump, given  his criminal convictions, his support for attempts to overthrow the 2020 election and his alleged mishandling of national security documents. She would also be able to stand strongly against the Supreme Court decision invalidating Roe v. Wade and upsetting the balance of power by creating broad presidential immunity.Adding Mr. Kinzinger, or a similar politician, to a Unite for Democracy ticket will expand the coalition by placing commitment to the preservation of American democracy above all other partisan considerations. His national security credentials are impeccable, especially when viewed against the the isolationist and pro-authoritarian policies of Mr. Trump and his running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance. All other policy positions (e.g., education, health care, national security, gun control) must be secondary to our commitment to preserve democracy and can be negotiated within the “big tent.”We appreciate that adding a former Republican to the ticket might be seen as radical and run counter to party leaders and loyalists, but “out of the box” solutions are essential to building and fortifying a coalition to defend our democracy. Moreover, this innovative solution will generate a media frenzy, further energizing the campaign.Let’s all “Unite for Democracy” and preserve the American Dream for ourselves, our children and our grandchildren.Robert A. Linett and Janice C. Linett, BurkeI am a PBS-watching, NPR-listening, get-out-the-vote, door-knocking Democrat who has bled Biden blue for the last four years.It is time for a change.President Biden selected a brilliant running mate in Vice President Harris. Now is her moment.Ms. Harris is a woman — who better to bring home Democrats’ strongest pro-choice arguments? Ms. Harris has nearly four years’ experience being “in the room where it happens” witnessing Mr. Biden work — who better to carry that work forward? Ms. Harris has the schedule to campaign endlessly without the daily demands of the being the president. Why not let her do that while Mr. Biden finishes the job? And most important, she has Mr. Biden’s imprimatur; he should not deny her now. Mr. Biden should given voters the opportunity to support the vice president.Voters like me are not the voters the Democratic Party needs right now. The party has us and always will. Instead, Democrats need votes they aren’t getting: the votes of those who feel they have “no choice” but to vote for Donald Trump because they cannot imagine voting for the Democrat who showed up for the debate and demonstrated their greatest fears.Democrats need the votes of the young people protesting the war in Gaza. Right or wrong, they will not vote for Mr. Biden — but they can be persuaded to vote for Ms. Harris.Democrats need the votes of those who will come out to vote because they have been waiting their whole lives to vote for a Black woman for president.And the party needs the votes of people who are just so weary of the current choices that they will not vote at all.Mr. Biden has said if God Almighty came down from Heaven and asked him to step aside, he would do so. There are many paths to God. I think it’s time to take the Harris Path.Carole Maslin, BethesdaWhat do you think President Biden should do with the rest of his time in office?

WaPo_71,"In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson’s election exit stunned Americans",https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2024/07/11/lyndon-johnson-presidential-race-exit/,2024-07-22 03:35:03.108204,,"In March 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson was nearly 40 minutes into a speech on the Vietnam War when he closed with a stunning announcement: He would not seek another term.From the Oval Office, Johnson said he would not “devote an hour or a day of my time” to any duties beyond his current presidency or accept the Democratic Party’s nomination again.Johnson’s decision, known only to immediate family and a few close advisers beforehand, shocked Americans who heard his speech that night. Now, experts say some of the forces at play during that race — Johnson’s concerns about his own health, discontent over his handling of the war and competition from fellow Democrats — mirror pressures surrounding President Biden as allies publicly questioned his fitness to serve another term. On Sunday, he announced that he would end his campaign for reelection.After sailing to victory in 1964 to win his first full term, Johnson realized he would likely experience “a difficult primary” four years later, said Kent Germany, a history professor at the University of South Carolina. He faced formidable challengers from within his own party, and a significant portion of the public disapproved of his policies in Vietnam.“The immediate message that he was receiving was that there’s not going to be a coronation once again,” Germany said.Johnson, who had a heart attack in 1955, had considered dropping out of a presidential race at least once before.During the 1964 Democratic National Convention where he would receive his party’s nomination, Johnson told one of his aides he wanted to withdraw. In a reference to former president Woodrow Wilson’s 1919 stroke, Johnson said he did not “want to be in this place like Wilson,” according to a recording from the LBJ Presidential Library.“Now, there are younger men and better-prepared men and better-trained men and Harvard-educated men, and I know my own limitations,” Johnson told his aide. “I just don’t believe that I have the physical and mental strength to carry them.”Johnson’s doubts appear to have been short-lived. Two days after the conversation with his aide, he accepted the Democratic nomination. He went on to defeat Republican Barry Goldwater in a landslide victory.But Johnson’s concerns became more pronounced in 1968 as he considered a second full term. For years, Johnson had been discussing the prospect of not running again with his wife, Lady Bird. As the election drew closer, he considered his health and the contenders he would face for the Democratic nomination — including Sen. Eugene McCarthy (D-Minn.), who had received 42 percent of the vote to Johnson’s 50 percent in New Hampshire’s Democratic primary.His health also weighed on him. “He was also, I think, concerned that men in the Johnson family didn’t live very long,” said Fredrik Logevall, a history professor at Harvard University.In the years leading up to the next election cycle, Johnson’s approval rating drastically declined. Historians say Americans’ dissatisfaction with Johnson’s handling of the Vietnam War was the driving factor behind his decision to exit the race.“He had committed to this policy of escalation in Vietnam several years before and had literally put the blood of Americans into the soil of Southeast Asia,” Germany said.Ahead of his March 31, 1968, address about de-escalating the conflict, Johnson had written two versions of his speech — one that included his exit announcement and another that didn’t.In the end, he told Americans that he had decided he “should not permit the presidency to become involved in the partisan divisions that are developing in this political year.”“With America’s sons in the fields far away, with America’s future under challenge right here at home, with our hopes and the world’s hopes for peace in the balance every day, I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office — the presidency of your country,” Johnson said.Until that moment, many Americans expected Johnson to continue seeking a second term. After he withdrew, his vice president, Hubert Humphrey, announced his candidacy and won the support of enough delegates to become the Democratic nominee at that year’s convention. Republican Richard M. Nixon ultimately defeated Humphrey and George Wallace, a former Alabama governor who ran as an independent, that November to capture the presidency.The discussions around Biden’s fitness to serve a second term have been far more public than the conversations about Johnson, Logevall said before Biden’s Sunday announcement.After Johnson’s speech, Logevall said: “I think people said to each other in their living rooms, ‘Did he just say what I think he just said?’ I think there was a degree of shock that, of course, is very different from today.”The primary concerns are also different for Biden than they were for Johnson. As he debated former president Trump on June 27, Biden at times struggled to complete sentences, spoke haltingly and appeared confused. Democrats responded with alarm about the 81-year-old president’s mental acuity and ability to serve a second term.“He can’t do anything to make himself more popular by being younger, right?” Germany said after the debate, more than a week before Biden left the race. “Johnson could have changed policies in Vietnam to make himself more popular, but instead he made the decision to withdraw from the race.”Still, Johnson’s exit appears to have been a game-time decision, an indicator of his ambivalence toward reelection, Logevall said. Earlier on the day of his address, a former aide recalled in a memoir, Johnson still wasn’t sure what he would do.“I won’t know whether I’m going to do this until I get to the last line of my speech,” the president said, according to the book."

This page shows the lawmakers who called for him to step aside as of Sunday morning. The page is no longer updating.
President Biden is facing mounting pressure from fellow Democrats to withdraw from the presidential race after his faltering performance in the presidential debate raised doubts about his mental acuity and ability to defeat Donald Trump.
Nearly three dozen congressional Democrats have publicly called on Biden to step aside, including Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), a close ally of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). At least three other Democratic lawmakers said during an off-the-record call with House leadership that they believe Biden should not run, according to people familiar with the discussion. The Washington Post is tracking which congressional Democrats call on Biden to drop out as the party weighs whether he belongs at the top of the ticket.

The Post is no longer updating this page with comments from Democrats who have been critical of Biden, focusing instead on those who have explicitly said Biden should not be the nominee.
Biden has said he has every intention of staying in the race.

WaPo_73,"Biden wasn’t the nominee, so replacing him isn’t illegal",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/21/replacing-biden-democratic-party-nominee/,2024-07-22 04:53:02.826426,,"As rumblings on the left for President Biden to end his reelection bid grew louder, Republicans became more overt in trying to keep the incumbent as their opponent. Former president Donald Trump’s campaign manager described the calls for Biden to stand aside as a “coup.”House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), during an interview Sunday, suggested that such a move would somehow be illegal.“Every state has its own system, and in some of these, it’s not possible to simply just switch out a candidate who has been chosen through the democratic, small D, democratic process over such a long period of time,” Johnson said on ABC News’s “This Week.”“Fourteen million Democrats voted to make Joe Biden the nominee,” Johnson continued. “So it would be wrong and, I think, unlawful in accordance to some of these state rules for a handful of people to go in the backroom and switch it out because they’re — they don’t like the candidate any longer.”In June — even before the presidential debate that accelerated calls for Biden to withdraw from consideration — the Heritage Foundation went so far as to draft a memo making a legal case against Biden being replaced. It argued, for example, that Wisconsin “does not allow withdrawal [from the ballot] for any reason besides death.”But as election law expert Rick Hasen noted this month, there’s a huge asterisk here — one that applies to any effort to suggest that Biden is the party’s committed candidate for president.Biden isn’t the Democratic nominee at all, in Wisconsin or anywhere else. He’s not being removed from the ballot because he isn’t on the ballot. The party has no nominee until its delegates vote at the Democratic convention in August, and now they will not vote for Biden.Remember that the party decides how it wants to settle its nomination. If the Democratic Party wanted in future years to make primary votes merely advisory, it could. It would be a bad idea, but it could. As recently as 2008, the party’s nominee could be (and nearly was) determined by so-called “superdelegates,” convention attendees who were allowed to vote for whatever candidate they wanted. Even now, the party could (and may) adopt rule changes that shift the process for identifying who appears on the ballot.Joe Biden, as any rote article from a traditional media outlet will remind you, is the party’s presumptive nominee, just as Trump was the Republican Party’s presumptive nominee until last Thursday. Biden has, as Trump had, a majority of delegates committed to backing him at the convention. That Republican majority voted for Trump when the time came. Biden’s majority will not, so he won’t be the nominee after all.Johnson’s argument is that this is somehow illegal because it runs contrary to the will of the electorate. (This is an ironic argument to make in support of Donald Trump’s position, given how he fared in the 2016 election, but that’s neither here nor there.) And while it is true that Biden won the most votes over the course of the Democratic primary process, it is not as though he triumphed over a crowded field of well-positioned contenders. Major candidates chose not to challenge him in part because none wanted to be blamed for helping Trump return to the White House.Nor were Democrats thrilled about Biden. Back in April, after many of the primaries had been completed and well before his disastrous debate on June 27, Pew Research Center found that more than 6 in 10 Biden supporters wanted to see him off the ballot. In several polls, a majority of those who planned to vote for Biden said they were doing so primarily because they wanted Trump to lose. It is safe to say their loyalties will transition easily to another candidate — whichever one (presumably Vice President Harris at this point) gets the majority of delegate votes.A few motivations are at play here for Republicans. One is to cast Biden’s replacement as the product of an anti-democratic process, thus muddying criticisms of Trump’s hostility to American democracy. Another is to simply make the transition as painful as possible, launching lawsuits and rhetoric that keep Democrats from consolidating for as long as possible.It seems safe to assume, too, that the GOP is aware that a long-shot legal challenge landing at the Supreme Court might yield a victory. Many legal experts, for example, assumed that the court would quickly reject Trump’s request for broad immunity from criminal prosecution. Then he got it.A challenge to the determination of the Democratic Party's nominee centered on a shift that unfolds before there is a nominee would have an ever higher legal bar to clear. Republicans would be arguing that anyone who got the most votes in the other party's nominating process had to appear on the general-election ballot — even though what was assigned by those elections was delegates. Delegates who have no power until the convention and whose actions are bound by malleable rules that the party itself sets.It’s a silly and unserious argument. But faced with a candidate whom Republicans clearly see as more threatening to Trump, it’s not hard to see why they’re making it."

Planned trial date: Indictment dismissed.
Last week: For months, Cannon’s antipathy for the prosecution case was clear but confined to skirmishes that rarely led to resolution. That all changed Monday when she wheeled out the proverbial big guns — a 93-page ruling declaring the job of the prosecutor pursuing the case was illegitimate, and therefore so was the indictment.
The decision came hours before the Republican convention began in Milwaukee. In accepting the GOP’s presidential nomination Thursday night, Trump praised Cannon by name, calling her “highly respected” for finding the case was “totally unconstitutional.” If Democrats want to unify the country, Trump said, all the cases against him should be dropped.
But it’s not dead yet. Smith is appealing, and other judges have found the special counsel appointment authority is legal — including the Supreme Court. Cannon may well be overruled, and according to our colleague Ann E. Marimow, could even be yanked off the case. The judge’s decision does, however, mean, that it will probably take months at a minimum for the case to be revived by a higher court.

Judges can disagree on which parts of which decisions constitute dicta.
Cannon acknowledged that the seminal 1974 Supreme Court decision in U.S. v. Nixon said Congress gave the attorney general the authority to appoint a special prosecutor — an earlier iteration of a special counsel — to handle key duties of the department. However, she characterized that part of the decision as dicta, and said she was not bound to follow it. The 1974 opinion forced President Richard M. Nixon to hand over court tape recordings and other subpoenaed materials related to the Watergate scandal.Dicta: A statement or remark in a judicial opinion that is unnecessary to the crux of the decision and therefore not binding on other courts.

Last week: There’s been so much going on that you may have forgotten the Supreme Court’s explosive July 1 decision saying presidents cannot be prosecuted for their official acts, but may be prosecuted for private or unofficial ones. The conservative court majority took a broad view, suggesting that a president could be considered to be acting in his official capacity when carrying out his constitutional powers in pursuit of committing a crime. The justices left it to the lower courts to hash out the specifics of what is considered an official act and what is considered a private one.
The immunity ruling was in response to the D.C. case. Judge Tanya S. Chutkan must now determine which actions laid out in the indictment should be considered official or unofficial. The whole thing could have somewhat of a boomerang effect, with Trump and prosecutors likely appealing whatever Chutkan decides — eventually sending portions of the case right back to the Supreme Court. It’ll be a slow process that will make it nearly impossible for the case to go to trial before the presidential election. And like the Florida case, if Trump becomes president, this one probably ends.
One part of the case is definitely off the table: The Supreme Court ruled Trump’s alleged efforts to pressure the Justice Department to back his claims of massive voter fraud was an official act and cannot be admitted at trial.The details: Four counts related to conspiring to obstruct the 2020 election results.Planned trial date: UnclearLast week: There’s been so much going on that you may have forgotten the Supreme Court’s explosive July 1 decision saying presidents cannot be prosecuted for their official acts, but may be prosecuted for private or unofficial ones.

Shouldn’t the immunity ruling only impact cases going forward?
A. This is essentially asking why the Supreme Court decision matters for Trump’s New York conviction. The high court ruled in 1965 that its decisions generally applied to criminal cases in which the judgment was not final — which would include the hush money case because Trump has not been sentenced yet. Since that 1965 decision, the Supreme Court has said some of its rulings may not be applied retroactively to all past cases; however, in a case involving immunity — the possibility that a prosecution should never have occurred at all — any decision would almost certainly be retroactive.

WaPo_75,Election 2024 live updates: Harris says she’ll ‘earn’ nomination as Biden steps aside,https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/07/21/election-2024-biden-trump-campaign-updates/,2024-07-22 04:59:02.826426,,Vice President Harris said Sunday that she intends to “earn and win” the Democratic presidential nomination after President Biden’s announcement that he is stepping aside as the party’s nominee. Harris vowed in a statement to defeat Donald  Trump. Biden said in a letter to fellow Americans on Sunday that “it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President.”
WaPo_76,Kamala Harris’s first presidential campaign was a failure. Has she changed?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/20/harris-campaign-president-2020-2024/,2024-07-22 04:38:02.826426,,"Kamala D. Harris, who was heralded as the inheritor to Barack Obama’s coalition when she launched her presidential campaign in January 2019, exited the race 10 months later, her aspirations asphyxiated by declining cash, an inability to articulate a cohesive campaign message and a steady patter of departing staffers.With President Biden’s withdrawal from the presidential race Sunday, she now faces an abrupt launch to a surprise second presidential campaign whose success will hinge on her ability to overcome the problems that bedeviled the first one.Biden endorsed Harris on Sunday to be the Democratic nominee for president and Harris, in a statement, said she intends to “earn and win” the nomination. Still, the first Black, Asian American and female vice president will likely have to answer questions about her last campaign for the top job, an effort that collapsed before a single ballot was cast. Critics say Harris squandered her considerable potential by mismanaging her 2020 campaign, struggling to project authenticity and stumbling as a candidate.“She was always the dream for us, of the next phase beyond Obama, but she didn’t live up to it because she ran a terrible campaign,” said one Democratic strategist who spoke on the condition of anonymity, referring to 2019.Five years later, Harris’s allies argue, she has improved as a politician and manager. Her boosters say that her 3½ years as Biden’s No. 2 would help her quickly adjust to being thrust atop the ticket, if she finds herself there. They say Democrats should no longer be worried about Harris’s initial stumbles because she has improved how she communicates and shifted how she is perceived.Now, her defenders say, she is a bright spot during a dark moment for Democrats.“You see her becoming more comfortable with being a vice president,” said Bakari Sellers, a former South Carolina state representative and longtime Harris supporter who has also defended Biden as the nominee. “And she now has a team of people around her that have strengthened her, and the stories that are coming out of D.C. are changing. The narrative has changed.”This story is based on interviews with nearly a dozen of Harris’s veteran supporters and aides, who argue that the sour taste left from her presidential campaign has faded, evidenced by a growing number of Democrats who see her as a viable Plan B if Biden exits. Some of these supporters spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly at a critical moment.Harris, through a spokesperson, declined to be interviewed.She has championed Biden since the night of the debate, declaring repeatedly that he is the nominee and she is his running mate and encouraging others to “fight for him.” Harris’s official events attracted more of a spotlight as doubts about Biden grew, and Harris has increasingly leaned into more of her own biography in her speeches and anecdotes. But she has also stuck closely to scripted remarks, avoiding even routine informal and off-the-record exchanges with the increasing number of reporters who travel with her.President @JoeBiden has devoted his life to fighting for the people of our country. In this moment, I know all of us are ready to fight for him. https://t.co/kDUS4AmjYCBiden stepping aside does not mean an easy coronation for Harris. Some Democratic power brokers are mulling an “open convention,” in which the presidential nominee is chosen on the fly. If she’s the nominee after the convention, Harris would face an impassioned GOP that has already intensified its attacks against her.But even with those hurdles, she would be closer to winning the presidency than she ever was in 2019.Harris’s stumbles began shortly after she announced she was seeking the White House.In April 2019, she expressed regret over a policy she championed that prosecutors used to bring charges against the parents of truant children. Prosecutors took parents across the state to court, and some were jailed, though never directly by Harris. The moment highlighted concerns by some Democrats that Harris was a product of an inequitable criminal justice system.By June, as primary opponents like Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) had staked out their positions on a broad range of economic and social policies, Harris struggled to articulate what, exactly, her administration would look like, instead hewing to long-held (and mostly safe) mainstream Democratic positions.During a debate that month, Harris was one of two who raised her hand when moderators asked which candidates would abolish private health insurance. A day later, Harris changed that answer, saying she had misheard the question.In July, her campaign put 35 additional staffers in Iowa and 25 in New Hampshire, following months of criticism that she had not made the two early-voting states a priority. Two months later, she adopted an Iowa-first strategy, hiring 60 more staffers in the state as she dropped behind other candidates in polls.By November, dwindling funds had forced her to retreat at a point when her campaign advisers expected her to be surging. By the next month, her presidential bid was over.Still, supporters say it showcased her potential as a campaigner and her ability to energize a younger, more diverse party powered by women. Biden selected her as his running mate in August 2020, making good on a promise to put a woman on his ticket. In doing so, he anointed Harris as the future of the party.Biden referred to his presidency as the “Biden-Harris” administration from the outset, instead of using solely his name, as previous presidents had done — a vote of confidence in his decades-younger vice president.Still, in her first year in the White House, Harris struggled at times to communicate, including in a Lester Holt interview from Guatemala, where she was dispatched to try to address the root causes of migration. During the interview, she ended up committing to go to America’s southern border, giving oxygen to Republican efforts to tie her to migrant crossings.Harris’s supporters say she is under a more intense microscope than most politicians and certainly most vice presidents, who have often been footnotes in presidential history. Harris entered the history books the moment she was inaugurated as the first woman and the first person of Black and Asian descent to win a nationally elected office.“People expected her to make history every time she walked into a room,” one former staffer said, adding that many of the attacks appeared to be rooted in racism and misogyny. “It was an impossible standard.”Major news organizations carved out lines of coverage centered on the vice president. The Los Angeles Times, her home-state newspaper, tracked her vice-presidential approval ratings. But former staffers say she eventually adjusted to the sometimes searing scrutiny.“Part of (it) is getting comfortable with all the cameras on you all the time,” said one former aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to give a candid analysis. “Even people at that level of the stratosphere have to learn how to get comfortable with it — that everything they say is going to get scrutinized. That people will not be forgiving about the time of day that they’re doing an event. You say something, and suddenly it gets scrutinized at a very high level, in terms of the number of cameras, in terms of the reach.”That scrutiny was perhaps most intense at the end of Harris’s first year as vice president, amid several high-profile staff departures, including her chief spokesperson, her communications director and her chief of staff. The resignations reignited questions about why Harris churns through top-level Democratic employees, an issue that has dogged her for almost all of her time in public service.The drumbeat of unflattering anecdotes took a toll. Some Democrats found her tenure as vice president underwhelming, marked by the messaging struggles and, at one point, near invisibility. It left many uncertain whether she had the force, charisma and skill to win the White House on her own. And some cast about for alternatives to lead the party into the future.Then the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, and Harris’s strategy — and reputation — shifted. She took dozens of trips to Democratic strongholds and battleground states, warning that the Supreme Court decision was an example of Republican overreach that would intensify if voters didn’t send them a message at the ballot box. And Biden’s team increasingly saw her as an important electoral asset, particularly in reaching younger voters and people of color, whose enthusiasm for the president appeared to be slipping.“The highest court in our land — the court of Thurgood and RBG — right? — took a constitutional right that had been recognized from the people of America, from the women of America. And now, we must speak of Roe in the past tense,” she said during a February event in Savannah, in the battleground state of Georgia.Other weaknesses that limited Harris in the 2020 primary have also been addressed, her supporters argue.One attack Biden used against Harris and other Democrats in 2020 was his personal relationships with a wide swath of world leaders, often name-checking them in debates and campaign appearances. But since becoming vice president, Harris has been the keynote speaker at the Munich Security Conference three times, rallying the European continent as Russia invaded Ukraine. She has sought to fortify allies in South Korea, Tokyo and Southeast Asia and to improve conditions in Northern Triangle countries, from which a vast number of immigrants to the United States come.She’s also shaken up her team. The vice president has a new chief of staff, Lorraine Voles, who was the director of communications for then-Vice President Al Gore and former senator Hillary Clinton. There have also been changes among staffers who help shape the vice president’s public image. And Anita Dunn, one of Biden’s closest political strategists, has focused more intensively on the vice president’s schedule and public events.But while supporters say Harris’s handling of the job has improved, she is also benefiting from a changed political landscape — one that is more favorable to her.In 2019, Harris was one of two dozen Democrats who vied for the presidential nomination — jockeying for top talent on their campaigns, cash from donors and, most importantly, voters’ attention. Harris’s story and her role as one of few Black women who have the reached the Senate were powerful symbols. But she was largely unknown nationally. Her campaign staff was filled with California politicos trying to make inroads in communities far removed culturally and geographically from the Golden State.If Harris becomes the Democrats’ 2024 nominee, she would have the support of the Democratic campaign establishment, which is desperate to beat Trump a second time. Several politicians expressed their support for her in the hours after Biden announced he was stepping aside. She has name recognition on par with any national politician, and the Biden-Harris campaign has already raised nearly a quarter-billion dollars that would flow to her.“The party and the structure of the party will all do the same to get behind her,” the Democratic strategist said. “So it’s not going to be about her, really. There’s no time for her to decide what the campaign looks like. That’s not going to happen. What is going to happen in this campaign for five months — it’s already been laid out.”Abbie Cheeseman, Chelsea Janes, Isaac Arnsdorf and Paul Kane contributed to this report."
WaPo_77,Xander Schauffele shouts his versatility by soaring above at the British Open,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/21/xander-schauffele-british-open-champion/,2024-07-22 05:58:02.803849,,"TROON, Scotland — On a course adjacent to an airport, a 30-year-old golfer from San Diego seemed to leave the ground Sunday and commence gliding above as if oblivious to the fray below. His back nine, so artful and tranquil, felt almost as if he had used the runway just behind No. 10 to start floating overhead like one of those lazy-day planes, the engine barely audible but its hum clearly untouchable. In a callous sport with a furious week of weather, the clear winner wound up looking downright pristine.Among the many paths to winning golf majors, there’s the one where the mastery looks just about spotless, and that’s the one Xander Schauffele took to his deeply calm win at the 152nd British Open. It’s not just that his final-round 65 and his back-nine 31 stood as the best numbers of the 80 players at Royal Troon or that they provided a two-shot win at 9 under par after he started one shot back. It’s how it looked and felt, and it looked and felt like something even the imagination wouldn’t dare entertain. Schauffele wound up disconnected from a bunched leader board, from his bygone image as a chronic contender who couldn’t quite reign and from all known reasonable limitations going forward.“A wonderful next 10 years,” his father and first coach, Stefan, predicted without committing hubris or nonsense.The hard facts said Xander Schauffele, who couldn’t snare any of his first 27 tries at majors despite 12 top-10 finishes, went and snared two of the past three. They said he became the first male player since Brooks Koepka in 2018 to win two majors in one season and the first since Rory McIlroy in 2014 to win the PGA Championship and the British Open. They said he joined with a dizzying haste those in this era with two major titles — from No. 1 Scottie Scheffler to Jon Rahm to Collin Morikawa to Bryson DeChambeau to Justin Thomas, among others — but, better than that, he has joined players such as Morikawa and Zach Johnson among those whose two major titles include one here on the links, shouting his versatility.They said all that, but Sunday’s round said something else with its outlying cleanliness. It told of a guy whose breakthrough in May in Louisville had taken his trademark calm from considerable to mighty. With his game in the clouds on a gray day featuring cool air ideal for a long walk on the beach by the course, he found his way to No. 18, where he saw the “yellow leader boards” of his prior dreams, asked caddie Austin Kaiser to join him in his walk and said to himself, “You’re about to have your moment here.”He led by three. Two groups behind him still had to finish. This did not seem all that relevant. Asked later to rank his round, Schauffele said: “At the very tiptop. Best round I’ve played.”“Oh, my God,” Kaiser said. “It just keeps coming. Wow. He played unbelievably. This is probably the best round he’s ever played.”The back-nine birdies Sunday on Nos. 11, 13, 14 and 16, separating him from playing partner Justin Rose, third-round leader Billy Horschel, upstart Thriston Lawrence, a fading Scheffler and the rest, looked almost light and airy even from 16 feet (No. 13) and 13 feet (No. 14). They looked as if they were designed to ratify a post-win conversation Kaiser recalled from May among his buddies just after the PGA Championship, when one said to Schauffele, “Do you feel lighter?” Schauffele replied, “Yeah, I do.” His chip over a bunker to No. 16 looked frightening as he began it and gorgeous as he fashioned it. It said hello to the hole and cuddled four feet away.Even Rose’s caddie, Mark Fulcher, found it “nice to be able to not pay for a ticket and to watch it because it was fantastic.” He said of Schauffele: “He’s also quite nice, too. You’d almost like him to be a bit of a wanker,” but he’s “a top-notch guy.”“He seemed he was in control of everything,” Kaiser said of an event at which the wind off the Firth of Clyde left nobody in control of anything until it eased Sunday at last.“I thought [the breakthrough win] would help me,” Schauffele said in an on-course interview, “and it actually did. I had this sense of calm, a calm I didn’t have when I played the PGA.” He said at his news conference, “I kind of grabbed on to it, and there was no chance I was going to let go of it.”Rose shot a fine 67 to finish tied for second at 7 under, then said of Schauffele, “He plays with a freedom, which kind of tells you as a competitor that he’s probably not feeling a ton of the bad stuff.” Horschel shot a fine 68 to tie Rose, then said of Schauffele, “He’s the second-best player in the world.” As Schauffele lifted off, it almost became a secondary tournament as Lawrence impressed with a 68 to end up at 6 under, Russell Henley had a 69 to make 5 under, Shane Lowry recovered from his aching 77 of Saturday to shoot a 68 and get to 4 under, and Scheffler menaced one or two strokes back until he reached No. 9 and three-putted from 6 feet 7 inches to draw a double bogey and commiserating groans from the crowd bunched around.He wound up tied for seventh at 1 under as even he — the first player since Arnold Palmer in 1962 to win an unthinkable six events by this point of the year, one of those the Masters — became a muffled sideshow set against Schauffele’s undisturbed excellence. Suddenly, the subject went from Scheffler’s dominance to Schauffele’s completeness.“I don’t know if that’s true or not,” Schauffele said of the “complete” part, “but I’m definitely going to believe that’s true because here we are. ... It’s a completely different style of golf. It makes you play shots and have different ball positions. There’s so much risk-reward when the wind’s blowing 20 miles an hour and it starts raining [as it did Saturday]. There’s so many different variables that come into play. It truly is an honor to win this. To me, it’s big. To me, winning the Scottish Open [in 2022] was big because it meant my game could travel. So to double that up and win a major in Scotland is even cooler.”He had gone and won two majors of completely different tenor, one so sick with birdies in the sun that it required a score of 21 under to conquer and one so rife with windy inconvenience that it told something about sturdiness. He had done one with an admirable quash of trembling and one with an enviable depth of calm. “We knew that, though,” his father said. “See, that we knew because he had seconds in everything. So we knew the versatility, right?” He concluded: “Who is the greatest threat or potential for the next career Grand Slam? I would say, ‘Just look at the numbers.’”One of the numbers showed “65” on that dreamy yellow leader board late Sunday, its hand-placed letters carried the message “WELL PLAYED XANDER,” and a young man known as shy and affable held the claret jug before a phalanx of photographers. He kept smiling calmly, rather than his electric grins of Louisville. It appeared that, technically, he had come back to earth."
WaPo_78,"Ahead of Monday hearing, more lawmakers call on Secret Service director to resign",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/07/21/secret-service-congress-trump-rally/,2024-07-22 05:35:02.803849,,"The embattled director of the U.S. Secret Service, Kimberly Cheatle, is facing new calls to resign from what’s become a bipartisan group of lawmakers after news that top agency officials repeatedly denied requests for additional resources and personnel sought by former president Donald Trump’s security detail.The Washington Post first reported on Saturday the news about the rejected requests — several times made in writing — as well as the agency’s acknowledgment that it had indeed denied some requests for additional security for Trump’s detail in the two years leading up to his attempted assassination at a rally in Pennsylvania after a spokesman had several days earlier insisted otherwise.Cheatle is scheduled to appear Monday morning at a House oversight committee hearing. Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), who chairs the committee, said on Fox News on Sunday morning that the hearing “will serve as the beginning of that process to get answers for the American people as to what went wrong with an agency that has a no-fail mission.”Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.) on Saturday became the first Democrat in Congress to call for Cheatle’s resignation. In a statement shared on social media, he wrote, “The evidence coming to light has shown unacceptable operational failures.”A gunman was able to fire rounds from an AR-15-style rifle from a rooftop about 150 yards from the former president at the rally last Saturday. Trump was injured, a man in the crowd was killed, and two more were wounded. Cheatle has said several times that she will not resign but said she takes responsibility for her agency’s failure to prevent the attack.Cheatle has been in extensive hearing preparation for the past two days and is not planning to resign immediately, according to two U.S. officials with knowledge of her preparation.House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) called on Biden to fire her.“We absolutely must ensure accountability so the American people can trust that this job will be done, that we will protect our presidents and former presidents. That’s the number one job of the Secret Service, not anything else. And I think Director Cheatle has shown the world that she has different priorities,” he said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” “She needs to go.”The chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Michael R. Turner (R-Ohio), on Sunday described the security failures as “absolutely outrageous and incredible.”“Is this a failure of resources? Is this a failure of protocols or a failure of management? It appears that now we know that it’s all three,” Turner, who is also calling on Biden to fire Cheatle, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”On Fox, Comer said the Secret Service has a budget of more than $3 billion, contending that it was “more than enough to provide adequate protection, for the presidential candidate. So we have a lot of questions as to how they’re managing their money.”Other congressional committees are investigating the shooting as well. Rep. Mark Green (R-Tenn.), chair of the House Committee on Homeland Security, has requested documents, details and a briefing of the security plan for Trump’s Pennsylvania rally. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, announced a separate investigation.Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told Fox News’s “Sunday Morning Futures” that he plans to issue a preliminary report on his work as the top Republican on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.Ron Johnson said his Democratic counterpart on the subcommittee, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) “completely agrees with me that we must start doing transcribed interviews with all the witnesses now while memories are fresh.”Some Republicans gave oxygen to unfounded theories surrounding the assassination attempt.Ron Johnson raised the possibility of a second shooter, a theory that originated online and conflicts with information released by law enforcement about the shooting.“I’m not an expert … but we can’t trust the FBI and Secret Service to do an honest and open, transparent investigation,” he said.Eric Trump, one of the sons of the former president, said in an interview on “Sunday Morning Futures” that he has said “several times” that there should be more security for his father.There was “no politics involved,” he said, in the issue of growing concerns about Cheatle’s competence in leading the agency. But he then suggested without evidence that Democrats were somehow involved in the assassination attempt.Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Tex.) said on “Sunday Morning Futures” that he had spoken to Trump’s detail “months and months ago” who told him they were unsatisfied with the resources being provided by their agency and thought it was “politically motivated.”Trump advisers’ anger deepened after the agency publicly denied that any requests for additional security requested by Trump or his detail had ever been rejected.“I was in the meeting with the Secret Service director with the president this [past] week, and she has a lot to answer for,” Jackson said. “She lied to me in the meeting. I asked her specifically if they had backed down or denied resources to the president at any point, and she said no.”Josh Dawsey contributed to this report."
WaPo_79,The top 10 options to replace Biden on the ballot,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/21/replace-biden/,2024-07-22 05:35:02.803849,,"Democrats entered uncharted and uncertain territory Sunday after President Biden announced that he is ending his reelection campaign just weeks before the Democratic Party was set to formally nominate him.On the one hand, they got what many in the party wanted: Biden out. On the other, the process for what comes next is a big question — and a potentially difficult one.An avalanche of Democrats expressing concerns about Biden’s ability to defeat former president Donald Trump, as he did in 2020, caused Biden to act. The push began after his stumbling debate performance June 27 and amid a series of continued uneven public appearances and polls that showed Biden losing ground in key swing states and about half of Democrats wanting a different nominee.As for where we go from here?The most likely outcome is that the next in line — Vice President Harris — steps up. Democrats, including Biden, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and the Congressional Black Caucus, quickly sought to close ranks around her as the party’s nominee.But not everyone is convinced that clearing the field for Harris is the best course, both because it would look like a coronation and because of uncertainty about the unpopular Harris’s own prospects. (Harris, for her part, says she intends to “earn” the nomination, without specifying what that means.)Beyond that, Democrats will need to slot in at least one additional candidate on the ticket, even if it’s just for vice president. Many names will probably circulate for both spots.Let’s run through the options, adapted from our previous list, in rough order of plausibility.It’s difficult to see how Harris wouldn’t be the top contender for the Democratic nomination unless she, too, voluntarily steps aside. She is, after all, the vice president. Skipping over the first female and first Black vice president would also be dicey for a party struggling to maintain its normally huge margins with Black voters — a major part of its base. And she would have the easiest access to Biden’s campaign war chest.
The problem is that Harris, like Biden, is unpopular. Americans disapprove of her by double digits in most polls. That’s not quite as bad as Biden, but it’s not good, either. She performs similarly against Trump in recent polls — though she has perhaps inched ahead of him lately — and an AP-NORC poll last week showed just 3 in 10 Americans thought she’d make a good president. Harris’s 2020 Democratic presidential primary campaign failed to gain traction.
The big decision Democrats face right now is less whether they should turn to Harris next than whether there should be some process to validate her selection. There’s an argument to be made that having a “mini-primary,” or at least leaving it up to delegates, would force Harris to prove she’s up to the task.

There’s an argument to be made that having a “mini-primary,” or at least leaving it up to delegates, would force Harris to prove she’s up to the task.Biggest pro: By far the easiest optionBiggest con: Hardly the ideal optionThe Michigan governor said she wasn’t interested, at least when this was in the realm of the hypothetical. But pressure might be brought to bear, given how many boxes she checks for the party.
She’s a female governor who hails from a crucial state where a poll Sunday showed Biden trailing by seven points. (Democrats probably need to hold Midwestern swing states, given their problems in other swing states). She has won both of her races there by around 10 points. Polling this year has shown her approval rating in Michigan between 54 percent and 61 percent. And she’s more experienced and has more of a national profile than a lot of other rising-star Democratic governors, such as Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore.
Harris aside, she probably makes more sense than anybody else — at least on paper.
Biggest pro: Swing-state popularity and experience
Biggest con: Lack of apparent interest — at least yet

If there’s a big drawback with Buttigieg, it’s that he appears to be the wrong candidate to try to arrest the Democratic ticket’s budding problem with diverse — and especially Black — voters.

Obama is the most popular recent former first lady in America, dating back to Lady Bird Johnson, according to a late-2023 YouGov poll. She has also consistently been liked by a clear majority of Americans, which we can’t say for many political figures. And unlike other Biden alternatives that have been polled head-to-head with Trump, she actually performs significantly better — as in leading-by-double-digits better, in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll.
It’s tough to know how she would perform as an actual candidate, because she’s never done it. But she’s got the kind of strong personal brand and a large national profile — probably bigger even than Harris’s. And if you’re Democrats, how do you not at least try to convince her? She would also solve the potential problem of skipping over another Black woman.
But Obama has effectively expressed negative interest in ever running in her own right; going from that to waging a presidential campaign with just a few months to go is a huge stretch. It’s truly a break-glass-in-case-of-emergency option. And the glass appears to be shatterproof.

WaPo_80,Congressional Republicans call for Biden to resign,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/21/congressional-republicans-biden-resign-mike-johnson/,2024-07-22 05:22:02.803849,,"Almost as soon as President Biden announced his decision not to seek the Democratic presidential nomination, congressional Republicans began calling for him to resign from office in what appeared to be a coordinated effort.Biden, when announcing his decision to step away from the presidential race, made clear that he intends to finish his term.“If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said in a statement. “He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough.”Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said that, if Biden “is no longer capable of running for reelection, he is no longer capable of serving as President.”“It is out of concern for our country’s national security that I am formally calling on President Biden to resign from office,” Daines said.House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) accused Democrats of “trashing the primary choice of 14 million of their own voters.”“Democrat party bosses just proved that they have absolutely no respect for their own voters,” Scalise said in a statement. “After lecturing others about democracy, they just forced Joe Biden off the ticket.”Like Scalise, Rep. Elise Stefanik (N.Y.), the No. 3 House Republican, went further, baselessly accusing the Democratic Party of pushing a “blatantly corrupt and desperate attempt to cover up the fact that Joe Biden is unfit for office.”“They are disenfranchising the votes of 14 million voters in the Democrat primary — all because they hid Joe Biden’s unfitness for office and now are reaping the deserved plummeting polls,” she said in a post on X.A White House spokesman immediately pushed back on the notion that the president wouldn’t serve out his term.Andrew Bates said Biden “looks forward to finishing his term and delivering more historic results for the American people.”“President Biden inherited an economy in free fall and a skyrocketing violent crime rate from his predecessor, and turned both around to deliver the strongest economic growth in the world and the lowest violent crime rate in nearly 50 years,” Bates said. “He’ll keep fighting to protect Americans’ freedoms from radical abortion bans and attacks on the rule of law.”But that didn’t stop the chorus of Republican leaders from insisting Biden do otherwise.Other rank-and-file Republicans, including Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (N.Y.) and Sens. Mike Braun (Ind.), and Rick Scott (Fla.), also called for Biden to immediately vacate the Oval Office.“For the same reason Joe Biden is unfit to run, he is unfit to continue serving and should resign immediately,” Malliotakis said in a statement.“If Joe Biden can’t run for reelection, he is not capable of serving as president for the next six months and needs to resign NOW!” Scott posted on X.Biden, in his letter announcing he would no longer seek the Democratic presidential nomination, said he will “focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.”And while Johnson, Scalise and Stefanik accused Democrats of disenfranchising primary voters, the three were among the more than 100 House Republicans who voted against the certification of the results of the 2020 election in the House on Jan. 6, 2021, in an affront to millions of American voters.Notably, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) — who, at 82, is older than Biden — did not call for the president to step down from office. Instead, McConnell focused on criticizing Democrats for ignoring the will of their primary voters.“Unfortunately, the Democratic Party has been busy in recent weeks trying to upend the expressed will of the American people in primary elections across the country,” he said in a statement reacting to Biden’s announcement. “Washington Democrats have not proven themselves any more capable than the President of delivering the secure borders, safe streets, and stable prices that working families deserve.”Congressional Republicans’ call for Biden to resign echoed messaging from the Trump campaign and the larger GOP. In a statement issued a couple of hours after Biden made his announcement, Trump campaign senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles said Biden “cannot take himself out of a campaign for President because he is too mentally incompetent and still remain in the White House.”And Richard Hudson, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said that if Biden is “mentally unfit to campaign, he is mentally unfit to have the nuclear codes.”“Every House Democrat must now answer: is the president fit to serve the rest of his term?” he said in a statement.Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), co-chair of the Biden-Harris campaign, told CNN that Republican calls for Biden to leave the White House are “ridiculous.”“I think President Biden has shown in recent weeks his ability to handle and manage complex international matters to continue his lifelong record of service and his legacy of leadership in foreign policy, and to make hard calls and tough choices that helped make us stronger and safer here at home,” Coons said on Sunday. “I expect President Biden will finish out his term this year, and there are things that remain to be done.”To ask Biden to step aside now, Coons added, “would be a grave disservice to our nation and a profound disrespect to his legacy and his lifetime of service.”Congressional Republicans, in their reactions to Biden’s announcement, also pointed the finger at Vice President Harris, arguing that she “co-signed” the president’s policies and decision to run for reelection.“Joe Biden has been the worst President in my lifetime and Kamala Harris has been right there with him every step of the way,” said Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), former president Donald Trump’s running mate. “She owns all of these failures, and she lied for nearly four years about Biden’s mental capacity — saddling the nation with a president who can’t do the job.”But while Republicans last week publicly lambasted Harris, who Biden endorsed to be the next Democratic presidential nominee, Johnson told The Washington Post that having Harris atop the Democratic ticket would not change Republicans’ congressional campaign strategy. Republicans are seeking to keep and potentially expand their razor-thin majority in the House, and they’re also aiming to take back the Senate from Democrats.“We’ve been encouraging our members to go out and message on policy, not personality, because it doesn’t really matter if they change the top of the ticket on the other side,” Johnson said. “If Kamala runs, she owns the same policies, you know, or whomever they put there.”When asked last week by The Post how Republicans would react if Harris became the nominee, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) said: “That would be awesome.”“She’s horrible. She had one job to do: The border. How did she do on that?” he said, referring to Harris’s role addressing the root causes of migration to the United States.Republicans have repeatedly branded Harris as the “border czar,” a label she and members of the administration have rejected. Harris’s mission, as directed by Biden in the early days of the administration, was to meet with heads of state and other officials to tackle enduring problems that lead to migration to the U.S. border, including poverty and violence.Emmer said Democrats are currently in a “romance stage” with Harris, but claimed that voters will grow disillusioned with the vice president once she starts “trying to string sentences together.”“It’s only going to help the Trump-Vance ticket,” Emmer said. “Her against Trump would be very interesting.”"

WaPo_82,James Wood’s big moment blasts the Nationals to a sweep of the Reds,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/21/james-wood-home-run-nationals-sweep-reds/,2024-07-22 06:49:02.583471,,"Circumstance decided James Wood would bat with two outs and two on in the eighth inning of a tie game Sunday afternoon against the Cincinnati Reds. In a rare turn of events, Wood decided to swing at the first pitch.Before tension could build amid the patience typical of the rookie’s at-bats with the Washington Nationals, Wood cracked a go-ahead, three-run homer that never stood a chance of doing anything but clearing the wall in left field at Nationals Park — a fact exemplified by the stare Wood gave from outside the batter’s box as he admired it, his bat still in his hand as the ball landed. That opposite-field thump, which defined Wood’s rapid rise through the minor leagues, joined by seven solid innings from Jake Irvin gave the Nationals a 5-2 win and their first sweep since mid-June.“I just felt comfortable going up there — I had seen the guy yesterday,” Wood said of Reds left-hander Justin Wilson. “Sometimes, [the first pitch] is the best one you’re going to see all day. Just got to be ready for it.”As Wood rounded the bases, his mind went blank. The teams’ proximity in the wild-card standings, though, was on his mind in the clubhouse. With five wins in their past six games, the Nationals have the same record as the Reds — 47-53.“We’re right there with them,” Wood said. “We’re trying to make a push, too, and every game is important.”“This is the time now where things can go two ways,” Manager Dave Martinez said. “Come out flat and you try to work your way to do something special, or you come out with a good running start. I’m glad the boys chose to get a good running start.”To call the moment by Baseball America’s top prospect a given, though, understates the jump he is making from Class AAA. In just his first three weeks in the big leagues, Wood has had plenty that could have derailed his season.Take that the 21-year-old was hitting seventh Sunday, under the guise that it might relax the ever-relaxed Wood at the plate. Or that, since his first big league homer, he entered the eighth-inning at-bat 9 for his past 44 (.205). Or that, between Class AAA Rochester and Washington, Wood has shown a patient approach that benefited him in the minors but has resulted in a bunch of two-strike counts in the majors.Martinez spoke with Wood before the game and told him to be aggressive.“Teams come in, they’ve got a game plan, they find your weaknesses,” the manager said. “But you talk to him? He’s really smart. He understands what he wants to do. Today, it showed.”It didn’t matter that Wood had hit into two hard outs earlier Sunday — he has done so often enough in his young career to have an automated response of “That’s baseball.” In the second inning, the first ball he put in play left his bat at 107.2 mph, and he narrowly reached for an infield single after it ricocheted off Reds starter Andrew Abbott. In the fourth, he hit the ball even harder, a 109-mph laser to left field that, with Wood’s speed, could have gone for three bases if not for a diving catch by Will Benson. And in the sixth, Wood fell victim to another highlight when center fielder Stuart Fairchild leaped against the wall to rob him again.He sauntered back toward the dugout, expressionless. At least he was hitting the ball in the air — and swinging at the right pitches, connecting on fastballs. The first pitch Wilson threw was a high heater, delivered at 94.2 mph. Wood sent it out at 105.9 mph, 404 feet into the seats. As he walked into the dugout, he high-fived shortstop CJ Abrams, the motion knocking the “Uncle Slam” home run hat off his head.The Nationals were only in that position because of Irvin’s excellence; he allowed two earned runs in seven innings with seven strikeouts and no walks. After allowing six earned runs in each of his last two starts before the all-star break, he was back to his old self.“I think the break served as a nice little refresher,” Irvin said. “A reminder to stay grounded, be where your feet are and live in attack mode.”Irvin is used to running into trouble early, so a second-inning solo homer by Noelvi Marte didn’t stress him. Neither did the pressure of trying to hold up with a depleted bullpen, nor the usual lack of run support he has received, nor a brief visit from head athletic trainer Paul Lessard in the third inning after he appeared to tweak something in his right leg while fielding a groundball. He got into better counts and used his four-seamer more than usual, generating weak contact.The Nationals struck back in the third, when a two-out double off the left field wall by Juan Yepez (1.007 OPS since arriving July 5) pushed Jacob Young to third. A few pitches later, Reds catcher Austin Wynns tried to catch Young between third and home but overthrew Marte at third base, allowing Young to score; Marte was charged with the error. Harold Ramírez, another midseason addition, singled Yepez home to give the Nationals a 2-1 lead before Irvin allowed another solo shot to Fairchild in the fifth. Wood accounted for the final three runs.“Electric,” Irvin said of his homer. “He’s something special.”"
WaPo_83,Biden’s historic move sets Democrats and the country on an uncertain path,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/21/biden-decision-analysis-democrats/,2024-07-22 06:45:02.583471,,"The words “unprecedented” and “historic” have been used so often to describe the state of American politics in recent years that they have become a devalued currency — until Sunday that is, when President Biden sent a lightning bolt through the country with his decision to stand down from the 2024 campaign.This milestone will stand indelibly in the annals of politics, a sitting president pressured by fellow leaders of his party to give up his candidacy. The script for 2024 continues to be rewritten at warp speed, an election year of twists and turns that seem never ending. This has left the electorate fearful and reeling, from Donald Trump becoming the first former president convicted of a felony to the assassination attempt against him and now, just eight days later, the decision by Biden to withdraw. What next?Biden’s shock announcement marks the end of a remarkable personal story, a nearly 52-year career in national politics that saw him rise from being elected to the Senate at age 29, through multiple family tragedies, through two failed campaigns for the White House, eventually to the vice presidency and ultimately to the prize he had set his sights on as a young man with his victory over Trump in 2020. Now almost in an instant, it is over. He will go out with praise and thanks from his fellow Democrats, the same ones who forced this moment upon him, but he has denied himself a chance at winning a second term.Biden’s statement, coupled with his endorsement of Vice President Harris to lead the party into the fall election, sets the Democrats on an uncertain course, even if it is one that many of them were almost demanding. The party has rules to guide them to making Harris — or perhaps someone else — the nominee. But there are no rules for a candidate to go from playing the secondary role, loyally promoting and defending Biden, to suddenly being the leader, making a case for herself. Harris has to have been thinking about this, but this pivot will test her in ways nothing else in her life has tested her.No person or party is ever fully prepared for a moment like this. What might have looked simple and sensible in the abstract — swapping out Biden for someone new — now becomes a series of concrete challenges, for Harris, for what has been the Biden-Harris campaign staff, for party leaders who quietly and not so quietly called on Biden to quit the race, and, not least, for rank-and-file Democrats who will be called upon to marshal their efforts on behalf of the ticket with more strength and enthusiasm than they have shown for Biden.Democrats had pressed Biden to step aside ever since his faltering performance in the June 27 debate in Atlanta. They feared he could not defeat Trump and that his weakened candidacy could lead to Republicans controlling the House and Senate as well. After last week’s Republican convention, where a party remade in Trump’s image fully united behind their nominee, those worries only increased, as did the pressure on the president.So, Biden yielded and took the decision so many wanted, painful as that must have been for someone as proud, stubborn and resilient as he has been. Now the big questions are whether Harris, whose 2020 campaign for the White House collapsed before the starting line in Iowa, can fully consolidate Democrats behind her, and more critically, whether she will prove to be a more compelling leader and effective candidate than Biden against Trump.On this, there is no guarantee, only the nervous aspirations of a party that seems to have gotten its wish and now must live with the consequences. Preliminary polling on Harris vs. Trump suggests she runs slightly better than Biden did, but she has not been through the rigors of a campaign in which she is the principal actor or the kinds of criticism that will be heaped on her by Trump’s operation, all in a compressed time frame never seen in the modern era.There are other questions for Harris, too. For obvious reasons, she has not yet been able to suggest any deviation from Biden. On policies and politics, she has had to be in lockstep throughout. What might be different about a Harris presidency, other than that she would be the first woman elected, which is no small thing to consider? Will she come forward with a fresh vision, or will her calling card simply be that she is younger and more vigorous than the man who selected her as his running mate four years ago?The Democratic National Convention, which begins Aug. 19 in Chicago, will be her moment to define herself as standing on her own. But much is still to be determined before delegates get there. Will there be any challengers to her for the nomination? Many prominent Democrats, led by Biden, are doing as much as they can to anoint her, but it takes only 300 signatures from the roughly 3,900 delegates for others to offer themselves as potential nominees. Conversations will be ongoing this week in some state capitals about whether to challenge Harris.The dilemma for the Democrats now is how they elevate Harris in a process that is seen as open and fair, rather than a railroading, but does not devolve into chaos and division. Already Republicans are accusing Democrats of undemocratically forcing Biden to the sidelines — ignoring the will of the voters in the primaries who overwhelmingly said they wanted Biden as the nominee, though no one of stature stood up to oppose him. Meanwhile, Trump slammed Biden in the wake of the announcement.The convention’s rules committee will meet again soon to decide whether to proceed with a virtual roll call in early August, which some Democratic National Committee officials believe is necessary to assure that the nominee qualifies for all state ballots. If that virtual roll call is held Harris could be the nominee weeks before the Chicago convention.Harris also will have to select a running mate, a process that normally takes months of careful vetting, the winnowing of a long list to a short list, and then the agonies for the nominee to pick from a few finalists the person they want as their closest confidant. Harris must do that in a matter of weeks, along with everything else involved in accepted the baton from Biden and moving the campaign against Trump forward. Some people she will be considering, mainly Democratic governors, could be among those who could challenge her for the nomination, if they dare take the risk.Biden’s statement carried echoes of the surprise Sunday night announcement by then-President Lyndon B. Johnson in March 1968 in which he said he would not seek or accept the Democratic nomination for another term. Both Johnson and Biden said they did so to concentrate their full energies on the duties and responsibilities of being president for the duration of their term.Johnson’s decision came in the middle of the Vietnam War, with student protests gaining power and Johnson’s position politically weakened. Biden’s came in a year in which the already deep divisions in America’s politics have intensified. The year of 1968 was marked by violence, including the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. This year, just a week ago, was marked by an assassination attempt against Trump, who was injured but survived.When Democrats met in Chicago in August 1968 to pick then-Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey as their nominee, the convention was spoiled by violence and discord. No one expects quite that to happen next month when Democrats convene ironically again in Chicago, but Biden’s withdrawal will make for a convention unlike any other in the modern era and for a fall campaign that no one a year ago, even a few months ago, had any expectation of coming to pass.Summer Sundays are supposed to be for quiet time, for outdoor activity and family gatherings, for relaxation and time away from the news. Not this Sunday. On this Sunday, politics intruded into the life of the country, dealing another shock to the system and rerouting the path of the presidential campaign. No matter how this campaign ends, this day will be remembered as both unprecedented and historic."
WaPo_84,World leaders hail Biden’s ‘brave’ decision to end his 2024 campaign,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/21/biden-drops-out-election-world-reactions/,2024-07-22 06:26:02.583471,,"LONDON — World leaders expressed respect and admiration for President Biden on Sunday after he announced he was ending his reelection campaign, a momentous decision that reshapes the race for the White House and resonated far beyond Washington.Biden, a longtime member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee before ascending to higher office, developed and nurtured relationships with many world leaders over the course of decades.Israeli officials were among the first to offer their praise, with President Isaac Herzog thanking Biden for his “friendship and steadfast support” and hailing the 81-year-old as “a true ally of the Jewish people” in a post on X.1/4Since the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, Biden has been a staunch supporter of Israel’s war in Gaza, though he has also clashed repeatedly with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over humanitarian aid deliveries and the toll of the conflict on Palestinian civilians. Netanyahu, who is scheduled to land in Washington on Monday and address Congress on Wednesday, had no immediate reaction to Biden’s announcement.Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant thanked Biden for his “unwavering support” and said the president’s “steadfast backing” in the war against Hamas has been “invaluable.”Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid kept his response brief, posting an image of himself grinning and fist-bumping Biden alongside the caption: “Thank you.”Biden has also been a firm backer of Ukraine and its efforts to repel Russia’s 2022 invasion, supplying Kyiv with American weapons and diplomatic support despite mounting opposition from congressional Republicans.“He supported our country during the most dramatic moment in history, assisted us in preventing Putin from occupying our country, and has continued to support us throughout this terrible war,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was circumspect, noting that “a lot can change” in the four months until voters go to the polls in November. Russia will “pay attention and watch what happens next,” he added.In the United Kingdom, new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he respected Biden’s decision.Stories to keep you informed

Here’s what to know.“I know that, as he has done throughout his remarkable career, President Biden will have made his decision based on what he believes is in the best interests of the American people,” Starmer said.Starmer, who met with Biden earlier this month in Washington, said he looked forward to working with him during the final months of his presidency.Former British prime minister Rishi Sunak applauded Biden’s “love for America and dedication to service.”Nigel Farage, a member of Britain’s Parliament and leader of the right-wing party Reform UK, took a different tone: “Whoever they pick, Trump will win in November,” he posted on X.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz thanked Biden for strengthening NATO and supporting “transatlantic cooperation,” writing on X that Biden’s decision to withdraw from the race “deserves recognition.”Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called Biden “a partner to Canadians — and a true friend”; Anthony Albanese, the prime minister of Australia, noted that under Biden, his country’s relationship with the United States had “never been stronger.” New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, who met Biden on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Washington this month, said the president “has dedicated his life to public service, and that is something that deserves much respect.”Ireland’s prime minister, Simon Harris, called Biden “a voice for reason, effective multilateralism and shared solutions,” in a statement posted to X.Biden, whose family has roots in Ireland, visited the country last year. One of his final stops was at Mayo Roscommon Hospice, where a plaque commemorates his late son Beau Biden, who died of brain cancer in 2015.“Mr President, Ireland will protect the piece of your son Beau’s legacy that you left in County Mayo,” Harris wrote Sunday.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called Biden’s decision “brave and dignified” and credited him for supporting Ukraine against Russian aggression. “A great gesture from a great president who has always fought for democracy and freedom,” Sánchez tweeted on Sunday.Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala described Biden’s move as a “difficult step” and expressed hope that a “good president” will emerge from a race between two “strong and equal candidates” in November.Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, commended Biden for another difficult decision in a long career of them and for making “democracy stronger.”Kosovo Deputy Prime Minister Donika Gërvalla-Schwarz, meanwhile, singled out Biden’s “leadership of the West.”As Biden endorsed Vice President Harris to take his place at the top of the ticket, and Washington wrestled with the sweeping implications of his decision to step aside from the race, Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics summed up the reaction of many: “Politics has never been so interesting,” he wrote on X.Seth reported from New York.

WaPo_85,Biden dropped out. This is how it happened.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/21/biden-drop-out-how-it-happened/,2024-07-22 06:08:02.583471,,"President Biden called Vice President Harris on Sunday to tell her directly.He spoke one-on-one with Jeff Zients, his White House chief of staff, and Jen O’Malley Dillon, his campaign chair.Zients then convened Biden’s White House and campaign senior staff for a 1:45 p.m. call, so that Biden could tell those who had worked closest with him he was abandoning his dream of a second term.As Biden spoke on that call, a letter announcing his intentions went live online. The chief of staff followed up with Zoom calls for the Cabinet and those in the White House with the rank of assistant to the president.“There is so much more to do — and as President Biden says, ‘there is nothing America can’t do — when we do it together,’” Zients wrote the entire White House team at 2:26 p.m.1/4There were mutterings that it was coming. But until it was done, many of the people who work for the campaign and the White House only assumed something had to happen — some pivot, some admission of reality — but they did not know what, when or how. The map was expanding in the wrong direction. The party had turned. The money was drying up. The polls in must-win states had gone from bad to worse.This story is based on interviews with more than a dozen Democratic insiders from the campaign, the White House and Capitol Hill, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.Biden huddled through the weekend with a small crew of family and advisers in Rehoboth Beach, Del.: White House counselor Steve Ricchetti, senior campaign adviser Mike Donilon, deputy chief of staff Annie Tomasini and senior adviser to the first lady Anthony Bernal, all of whom were up at the president’s vacation house.Everyone else plowed forward, swearing publicly that none of that was happening, telling those that worked for them to not stop. Dillon had laid down that marker Friday, when she went on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” and abruptly silenced the growing speculation that his exit was imminent. The feedback from door-knocks by campaign workers was good, she said. The campaign was humming. The president was determined.“He’s not going anywhere,” she said.That was followed by a tense high-dollar donor call Friday afternoon that left many of the party’s top money people fuming. Calling from the road, Harris joined the Zoom late for just a few minutes — boasted of the campaign’s efforts in Michigan and Wisconsin, expressed confidence in victory and then signed off, according to a person on the call. All the donor questions were left unasked and unanswered.Donors left frustrated because “it was like we didn’t have eyes and couldn’t see what was going on,” one person on the call said.It was a bold and definitive posture. Yet it was read by many inside the Democratic political world less as a final word, more like an extension of respect that the president was owed. This decision was always Biden’s to make. From the earliest days of the crisis, people close to Biden would reach out to those who went public with their dismay.He deserved “grace,” was their message. Give him his space.That created weeks of mixed signals, amid clearly deteriorating conditions. Ricchetti and Donilon were both full-stream ahead during the Republican convention all the way through Friday, said one person familiar with the conversations. Ricchetti got to the house Friday. Donilon arrived Saturday. They met together Saturday evening, according to another person familiar with the events. Inside the campaign, the polls late last week had deteriorated further. The president, suffering from covid, was briefed on the data.“The poll numbers they got recently were very sobering for them,” this person said. “They wanted to stop the bleeding, to give him time to think about what he wants to say. … It was so relentless. Every day it was a new person.”Biden all but made up his mind Saturday night, said the person briefed on the events, and went to bed. When he awoke, he did one more gut check before moving forward.Among much of the senior campaign leadership, the harsh reality had long ago been accepted. But people continued to speak on his behalf, routinely denouncing the anonymous sources describing what was happening.A congresswoman said he had “honest talks” with his team this weekend about the polling, which was seemingly getting worse by the day. Democrats on Capitol Hill were also restless. Dozens of lawmakers had held off on going public, both out of respect for the president and in fear of the political risks of doing so. But many were discussing the best way to come forward in the coming week if Biden did not exit the race by the weekend, according to several people familiar with the discussions.They were not, however, willing to bend to his will. Democrats in the Senate — where Biden served for 36 years — were being especially careful but had begun discussing whether to come out as a group or one after another, to arrange a number of senators to meet with Biden privately and urge him to exit or else warn that they would go public if he did not respond to their concerns, according to the people.A number of his aides said on Sunday they were upset by being kept in the dark, having been told Friday and Saturday to keep fighting for his candidacy. Some were even working on Sunday morning, preparing for the morning shows, and heading back to Wilmington for the week.As of Sunday afternoon, it was still unclear when exactly Biden would address the nation directly. He was still suffering from covid symptoms, including a hoarse voice, said one person familiar with the situation, and they suspected Biden and his team would wait until he sounded better for any public remarks.Among Democratic lawmakers, there is disagreement about the best path forward. Biden’s endorsement of Harris is likely to stymie discussion over whether another candidate would be better positioned to beat Trump. But before his endorsement, many lawmakers had concerns over Harris’s ability to take on Trump — in part because of mixed internal polling data, according to two Democratic senators — and were interested in exploring the possibility of an open convention.Others in Biden’s inner circle believe there is no option, no time to restart and restaff a campaign, which Harris will likely be able to inherit directly barring some legal challenges. One donor said there would be a push for an open process, and that Biden’s announcement of his endorsement of Harris had been a let down.“People were thrilled for that brief period between the first Biden announcement and the second,” this person said.But that was tomorrow’s worry. Enough had already changed.“I need a drink,” one campaign staffer wrote in a text message, just after 2 p.m."
WaPo_86,"As Biden ends campaign, focus shifts to health for remainder of his term",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/21/biden-campaign-health-presidency/,2024-07-22 06:04:02.583471,,"President Biden’s withdrawal from his reelection campaign Sunday ended weeks of speculation about his political future. But continued questions about his health have given rise to a new question: Should he resign from the White House, too?The 81-year-old president wrote on social media that he would “focus all my energies on my duties as President for the remainder of my term.” There are about six months — 183 days — until Biden’s term would end.The White House has reiterated for weeks that Biden’s high-profile debate flop was an outlier and that the president remains fit to serve. But administration officials, lawmakers from both parties and Democratic donors have raised questions about the president’s cognitive fitness, pointing to alarming moments in private in which Biden seemed distant or confused, and his repeated flubs in public.Republicans on Sunday demanded that Biden step down.“If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said in a statement. “He must resign the office immediately.”Democratic leaders generally don’t share that view. Lawmakers showered Biden with appreciation Sunday, and several said they remain confident in his leadership as president. Biden, who is recovering from a bout of covid, had repeatedly said he was up to the job of both running the country and campaigning for reelection.“I’m good,” Biden said during a July 11 news conference following the NATO summit, adding that age “creates a little bit of wisdom if you pay attention.”Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said Sunday that Biden would continue to focus on priorities such as creating jobs and fighting abortion bans for the rest of his term. “He looks forward to finishing his term and delivering more historic results for the American people,” Bates wrote in an email.Some Democratic officials and allies have privately argued that Biden stepping down from the presidency — and immediately elevating Vice President Harris into the Oval Office — would confer additional political benefits in a challenge against Donald Trump.Outside medical and policy experts said that the job of campaigning — which required Biden to energize voters, engage with donors and give stump speeches around the country — calls on a different set of physical and cognitive skills than serving as president, where Biden is presented with decisions and surrounded by advisers. Biden, some say, is equipped to serve out his term.“The presidency is not a one-man show,” said Ezekiel Emanuel, a University of Pennsylvania bioethicist who advised the Biden administration on its covid response and other health issues. “It is an administration with the president as boss and ultimate decision-maker … and he has a very effective team around him that he knows, and they know him.”David Grabowski, a Harvard Medical School professor who specializes in the study of aging, emphasized the distinction between Biden’s ability to finish out the remaining months of his presidency versus his capacity to do so for another term as an octogenarian.“President Biden’s decision to end his candidacy relates to carrying out his duties over the next four and half years,” Grabowski wrote in an email. “From an aging and health perspective, that is different from his fitness to serve today through the end of his current term. The two must be evaluated independently.”Some of Biden’s aides and allies had insisted — as recently as Sunday morning — that he would not drop out of the 2024 presidential race. But the shifting political reality had complicated his reelection bid: The president had been lagging Trump in polls across key battleground states, even as other Democrats fared better in hypothetical matchups against Trump.While the 78-year-old Trump has had his own struggles — such as confusing names, misstating facts and delivering often meandering speeches — voters have generally expressed more concern about Biden’s age than Trump’s. A CBS News/YouGov poll conducted last month found that 72 percent of registered voters believed Biden lacked the mental and cognitive health to serve as president, compared with 49 percent who felt the same of Trump.Biden was last examined by a team of medical specialists earlier this year, according to a summary released in February by Kevin O’Connor, Biden’s longtime physician. The physicians concluded that Biden was “a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency,” O’Connor wrote.The specialists ruled out neurological disorders such as stroke and Parkinson’s, although noted that Biden had developed an increasingly stiff gait and appeared to suffer from peripheral neuropathy — a type of weakness or nerve damage — in both of his feet. Kevin Cannard, a neurologist who specializes in movement disorders such as Parkinson’s, was among the physicians who examined Biden as part of that review.Biden’s performance in his June 27 debate against Trump — during which the president struggled to explain some of his core policies and repeatedly tripped over his words — prompted worries from Democrats but also health experts who feared a deeper medical problem. Three former members of the White House medical unit who had previously cared for Biden told The Washington Post that they believed the president should undergo cognitive screening, given his rocky debate performance.Biden had repeatedly declined to seek a cognitive test, telling reporters that he is “tested every single day” on his fitness by the duties of the presidency, but showed signs of relaxing his position at the July 11 news conference.“I am not opposed,” Biden said at the news conference. “If my doctors tell me they should — I should have another neurological exam, I’ll do it.”Biden’s physical and verbal stumbles have worried lawmakers, administration staff and high-level donors who have privately interacted with him in recent months. They said he has become more visibly frail, sometimes in need of physical assistance as he takes the stairs or moves around a room. The lifelong politician known for uncorking long, freewheeling speeches has become increasingly difficult to hear and understand.Biden has occasionally appeared to briefly freeze up or suddenly veer off topic, instances some said they easily dismissed before the debate but caused them to question his ability to do the job for another four years.The campaign trail exposed these weaknesses. Donors in recent weeks — including actor George Clooney — have said Biden seemed feeble, tired or confused in their small sessions, fueling calls for him to withdraw his reelection bid.One Democratic donor, who met with Biden in small meetings at the White House early in his presidency and spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the president’s fitness to serve, recalled an encounter with Biden at a fundraiser this year.“He was different than I’d experienced him in the White House,” the donor said, adding that Biden’s affect in a private meeting at the fundraiser was similar to his performance in the debate. The president was “quieter,” with his remarks trailing off, and engaged in some “staring into space.”“He felt like an elderly person,” the donor said.White House aides who work with the president regularly and accompany him on foreign trips said that while Biden may move slower and look older, they do not see signs he is mentally diminished and say his physical aging has no bearing on his ability to continue the job of president.“I think two things can be true — that he’s fully capable of finishing this term as president but it’s not realistic to expect him to vigorously serve another four years,” said Jonathan Reiner, a cardiologist and professor of medicine and surgery at the George Washington School of Medicine & Health Sciences. “I do think it would be appropriate for a formal statement from the White House Medical Team attesting to Presidential capacity.”"

WaPo_88,"A new Field of Dreams rises in Oakland, the city major sports abandoned",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/21/oakland-ballers-minor-league-baseball/,2024-07-22 07:41:02.749294,,"OAKLAND, Calif. — In a city famously forsaken by professional sports, Opening Day could not come soon enough.Sure, it was just minor league baseball, but what were the majors good for anyway? Lately, all they did was break Oakland’s heart. And the city badly needed a win, on the diamond and off.Enter the Oakland Ballers, a team founded by a pair of Oaklanders who vowed to make something radically different from the succession of clubs that had abandoned the city in recent years. Aching for a fresh start, some of the country’s most passionate sports fans embraced the upstart squad, and they were counting down the days until its sold-out home opener.But before the first pitch could be thrown, the Field of Dreams needed finishing — the team’s rollout had gone so fast that its stadium, a renovated public park, was still under construction just 48 hours before the scheduled debut. The locker rooms had no lockers.Residents — fans — came to the rescue. Responding to a public plea for help, dozens of volunteers flocked to an industrial district in West Oakland to spend their weekend hammering and sweeping, practically willing the team and its park over the finish line.This is what it’s all about, thought Paul Freedman, a Ballers co-founder. The last-minute scramble, which took place over two days in June, was chaotic, but it captured the team’s community-first ethos. Those turncoats from the NFL, the NBA and MLB would never invite their supporters in to build the team’s clubhouse, and their billionaire owners definitely wouldn’t be working alongside them.“This was literally built by Oakland,” Freedman said, walking through the converted warehouse that now serves as team headquarters across from the field.For a place once called “America’s most abused sports city,” where the trust between fans and pro team management has been at an all-time low, this stuff matters.When the major league Athletics made their departure official earlier this year, it capped a painful years-long saga that alienated even the team’s most die-hard fans. The exodus also dealt a blow to the city’s psyche.Oakland, across the bay from San Francisco and perpetually in its shadow, was already having a hard year. With its political establishment in crisis, the budget a mess and concern over crime widespread, the city desperately needed something to rally around.Like the Oakland Roots and Soul, the city’s recently launched men’s and women’s soccer clubs, the Ballers aim to use sport as a salve, a way to heal wounds old and new. That might sound like a lofty goal for a team still finding its footing in the independent Pioneer League, and perhaps it is. But like all fans, Freedman is a true believer.“You count Oakland out at your own risk,” he said. “It’s always been a city that’s been second-guessed. Yet, somehow, this is the place where comebacks start.”Of all the teams to turn their back on Oakland, the A’s hurt the most.The Golden State Warriors, who decamped for San Francisco in 2019, always spanned the Bay Area, aligned with the region more than a city. The Raiders, who left for Las Vegas one year later, had already fled the city once before.But the A’s have played in Oakland — and worn the city’s name on their chests — since 1968, when the club arrived from Kansas City, Mo. They won legions of fans in the 70s and 80s, propelled by legendary players like Reggie Jackson and Rollie Fingers, Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire.And even as success became more elusive, the team still retained its charm. The “Moneyball” era, when the A’s found ways to win despite a limited budget, resonated in a city where so many are under economic pressure, trying to do the most with what they’ve got. And even the decrepit, possum-infested home field, the Coliseum, inspired devotion among a proudly blue-collar fan base.But the team announced in April that it would play its final game in Oakland later this year, before relocating to Sacramento for a few seasons while they await an eventual — although perhaps not definite — move to Las Vegas.“If it was a boxing match, the official was signaling for medical help” after the Warriors and Raiders departed, said Andy Dolich, a former longtime A’s executive and co-author of the book “Goodbye, Oakland,” which documents the city’s history of sports heartbreak.When the A’s move became official, Dolich said, it was “the ultimate K.O.: Knockout Oakland.”The team still has dozens of home games to play, but for hardcore fans, they might as well already be gone.“I was a lifelong A’s fan — until this year,” said Jorge Leon, president of the Oakland ’68s, the first-ever MLB nonprofit supporters group, which organizes events and promotes fan engagement.Leon and the ’68s, once a flag-waving drumbeating staple of the Coliseum’s bleachers, decided to boycott home games this season. Attendance, which had been dropping for years, hit a record low.Meanwhile, the team’s owner, John Fisher — whose quest for maximum profit has driven the relocation campaign, fans say — has become Public Enemy No. 1. Fisher has blamed Oakland officials for not forking over enough public funding to build the team a new stadium, but city leaders say he has been negotiating in bad faith.“It’s just greedy ownership,” said Leon, who helped popularize the “Sell the team” chants that became ubiquitous at A’s games last year.“They don’t see what they’ve got” in the fervent fan base, he said.Team supporters — or former supporters — talk about the move in strikingly intimate terms.“Have you ever lost anybody you’ve ever loved? Someone really close to you?” asked Bryan Johansen, a founder of the Last Dive Bar, a brand that celebrates the Coliseum fan community and is named after a loving moniker once used to describe the stadium.“I’ve got my wife and my son and outside of that, the A’s are the next thing in life,” said Johansen, who has a green and gold Athletics tattoo on his right forearm. “That’s how close emotionally I feel to that team. Them leaving is like losing a family member.”Freedman and his co-founder Bryan Carmel felt this pain, too. But they also saw an opportunity. Suddenly, here was a bona fide major league city, home to thousands of baseball-crazy residents, without a team to cheer for.“Bryan, I’ve got a crazy idea,” Freedman texted his longtime friend last year. “I love crazy ideas,” Carmel responded.And the Ballers were born.Freedman, an entrepreneur, and Carmel, a TV producer, attended high school together in Oakland in the 90s and bonded over sports. They saw a chance to reimagine the way a sports team is run — not as a money machine, but as an important civic institution.This vision helped them raise more than $4 million from local organizations and residents, a tiny fraction of what it costs to buy a team or a stadium in the big leagues, but it was enough to get the Ballers off the ground.“The Ballers is a baseball team, but it’s not a baseball team first,” said Casey Pratt, a Bay Area journalist who has spent his career covering the local sports scene. “It’s a community asset. It’s a way to bring people together.”The Ballers’ hastily-renovated home field sums up that spirit. If the Coliseum was baseball’s last dive bar, Raimondi Park is baseball’s best block party.It all came together improbably fast: The city approved the Ballers’ renovations of the historic municipal park in April, construction began in May and it hosted the first game in June. The team transformed the park from a field unfit for Little Leaguers, across from one of the state’s largest homeless encampments, into what could be a boon for a West Oakland neighborhood that has long suffered from disinvestment.“What I love about the Ballers is they embrace everything about Oakland,” said Anson Casanares, who was born and raised in the city and swapped his A’s fandom for the B’s this year. “They built this whole park so fast, and that’s really hard to do, especially in California and the Bay Area. It shows if you actually care, you can make it happen.”The 4,000-seat stadium is still a work in progress, but for now it has a DIY feel, with pop-up vendors and port-a-potties that even the players use. Eventually, the team envisions a mini Wrigley Field, a community gathering place that brings baseball back to its roots.The best seats in the house are $35 and it costs less than half that to sit in the bleachers, much cheaper than even the lowly A’s. Attendance so far has been uneven but a stream of special promotions continues to win new fans.“It’s essentially a street fair wrapped around a professional baseball game,” said Mike Shapiro, the president of the Pioneer League, which welcomed the Ballers into its lineup of mostly mountain state teams in small towns and cities. “It’s Americana. A lot of things in this country seem to be dissipating, but it’s one of those cultural icons that still exists.”The Ballers have found early success in the league, hovering near the top of the standings all season and seeing several of their newly-recruited players scooped up by MLB teams. Another, pitcher Kelsie Whitmore, made history when she became the first woman to play in the league.And the team itself recently made a historic announcement, unveiling a new ownership model that will give fans the opportunity to invest in the Ballers and receive in return voting rights on key organizational decisions — changes to logos, some front office hires and, crucially, any relocation plans.Freedman calls it “a real seat at the table” for baseball fans who have been mistreated for too long. So far, more than 3,000 people have reserved shares, ranging from less than $500 to more than $10,000. At the end of the day, he said, it’s fan buy-in that matters more than anything.As he spoke, on a recent warm evening, the Ballers were down big to the Northern Colorado Owlz, trailing 15-3 entering the bottom of the 9th inning. Still, fans beat their drums and chanted “Let’s go Oakland,” pushing the city of underdogs to pull off an impossible comeback.The Ballers batters responded with a hit, another hit and a homer, scoring four runs fast. Despite the surge, they came up short. But in a way, it didn’t matter.It was a summer night in West Oakland, and thousands had just watched a pro baseball game — and not for the last time, either. If the Ballers experiment works out, it would mean many, many more seasons of this. And that was victory enough."

WaPo_90,"Biden tweets instead of talks, as Elon Musk seizes on chaotic election",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/21/elon-musk-biden-x-instagram/,2024-07-22 07:03:02.749294,,"President Biden bypassed traditional media in making his stunning announcement that he won’t be on the 2024 ticket, instead posting a letter on X. Elon Musk immediately took a victory lap.“White House aides learned Biden was dropping out by reading X,” tweeted the billionaire social network owner. In a series of further posts in the hours after Biden’s announcement, Musk stressed the social network’s role as a direct channel to convey world events more nimbly than cable news and news sites.The digital delivery of Biden’s historic decision, which was simultaneously posted on Instagram, underscores how social media has reshaped the presidential bully pulpit, becoming the chief news vector for American voters in the most chaotic election cycle of the modern era.X, which has struggled since the world’s richest man bought it in October 2022, has reemerged as a primary source for an American public hungry for swift news updates — especially in the last tumultuous eight days, which included the assassination attempt on Donald Trump, a groundswell of prominent Democrats calling for Biden to drop out of the race, and a pageant-like Republican National Convention where Trump’s nomination was secured.In the almost 21 months since the Tesla CEO took over X, he has introduced changes to the platform that have effectively made it more difficult to separate fact from fiction online. Musk personally endorsed Trump in the hours after the shooting at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, raising questions about the neutrality of the platform as a source for news. Even though X had added custom icons for MAGA adherents to display their support of Trump during the Republican National Convention, the network was essential for Biden in seeking to get the word out on social media.“The last week has solidified the dominant role social media has for political communications and breaking news,” said Katie Harbath, a former Facebook public policy director who is now chief global affairs officer at Duco Experts, a tech consulting firm. “It comes with costs but it is the most efficient way to get news to the most number of people as fast as possible.”Biden was hardly alone in prioritizing social media to share news in recent days. Trump gave his first public response to his assassination attempt on his right-wing platform, Truth Social, where he also announced his choice of Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio as his running mate.Biden’s missive found a large audience online, amassing more than 180 million views and more than 700,000 likes in the first two hours it was online. His Instagram post gained over 1.1 million “likes,” and simultaneous posts on other Meta-owned social networks saw high engagement. Stories to keep you informed

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.In news coverage immediately after Biden’s announcement, journalists including CNN’s Wolf Blitzer remarked on the significance of the president making the announcement directly to his social media following rather than in a televised address from the Oval Office. Biden, who is recovering from covid, said he would “speak to the Nation later this week in more detail about my decision.” X CEO Linda Yaccarino posted that her social network is “where history happens,” in a tweet that was panned by some critics who noted it was also happening on Instagram, Facebook and other platforms. Musk called on leaders to “post directly” on X and “not hand the role to intermediaries.”“Mistakes will be made, but that’s what proves it’s real,” he wrote. “People want authenticity.”The risks of that approach were immediately evident, as conspiracy theories quickly ricocheted on X and other social media platforms immediately after the announcement. Trump’s allies stoked claims that the Democratic Party had staged a coup and questioned whether Biden authorized the post from his X account.“One candidate survived assassination,” tweeted venture capitalist David Sacks, who has organized a San Francisco fundraiser on Trump’s behalf and spoke on behalf of him at the RNC. “The other staged a coup. Your choice, America.”Misinformation researchers warned that Vice President Harris, whom Biden swiftly endorsed to become the Democratic nominee, was uniquely vulnerable to online attacks. Women of color running for office face higher rates of violent threats online, according to a study from the Center for Democracy and Technology.Other social media users posted silly, humorous and irreverent reactions to the news. Video clips of Harris saying “You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?” tore across X — a reference to a 2023 speech Harris gave urging young people to remember their parents and grandparents. Other coconut-themed content took off on social media, including amateur-created political spots for Harris and a post from a D.C.-based nightclub advertising “$5 Piña Kamala Coconut Shots all night long.” Others joked about the need for Harris to pick a White person to be her vice-presidential candidate.Even as social media increasingly shapes the election, top tech companies have made drastic changes to the ways their platforms handle news and politics. Social media platforms are becoming increasingly fractured and decentralized as liberals and conservatives flock to partisan corners of the internet to share and react to current events. X has made the most dramatic transformation, as Musk used the platform to espouse right-wing missives and shaped it into a destination in GOP politics, including for a chorus of powerful business and tech leaders who have also been using the platform to stump for the former president.The result is a platform where conspiracy theories and foreign disinformation spreads with fewer guardrails. After buying it, Musk removed all legacy check marks — Twitter’s years-old way to verify the identity of users — and also began selling the blue marks to anyone willing to pay $8 a month. He also fired Twitter’s trust and safety team, making it easier for harassment and abuse to spread across the platform without accountability.Musk also leverages X as a slingshot against his perceived opponents, and Sunday’s announcement was no exception as he directly taunted other Silicon Valley leaders who hadn’t endorsed Trump, including Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings.After the attempted assassination of Trump last weekend, liberals and conservatives alike flooded social media with partisan conspiracies. Such misinformation may only grow in the wake of Biden’s endorsement of Harris, said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel of the digital rights group Free Press.“In moments this hot and wild, misinfo will surge,” she posted on X."

NBC_1,'Litigation is a certainty': Trump's call to end birthright citizenship would face a mountain of opposition,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/litigation-certainty-trumps-call-end-birthright-citizenship-face-mount-rcna162314,2024-07-28 19:00:02.957222,,"WASHINGTON — When Donald Trump took office in 2017, he immediately issued a provocative executive order banning travel from Muslim-majority countries that led to chaos, confusion and a flurry of lawsuits that ended up at the Supreme Court.
If he wins the election in November, he has pledged to follow a similar course on another contentious policy proposal: ending birthright citizenship.
In May of last year, Trump released a campaign video renewing his call to end the long-standing constitutional right, saying he would sign an executive order on day one of his presidency that would ensure that children born to parents who do not have legal status in the U.S. will not be considered U.S. citizens.
“The United States is among the only countries in the world that says even if neither parent is a citizen or even lawfully in the country, their future children are automatic citizens the moment the parents trespass onto our soil,” Trump said in the video.
Birthright citizenship has long been understood to be required under the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which states: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.” The language was included in the constitutional amendment enacted after the Civil War to ensure that Black former slaves and their children were recognized as citizens.
The phrase has been generally understood by legal scholars of all ideological stripes to be self-explanatory, but that has not stopped some anti-immigration advocates from pressing an alternative interpretation.
“Litigation is a certainty,” said Omar Jadwat, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union who was also involved in the travel ban challenge.
“It’s directly in the teeth of the 14th Amendment,” he added. “It would essentially be an attempt to tear down one of the core constitutional protections that has been a key part of our country.”
The Supreme Court ultimately upheld a watered-down version of Trump’s travel ban, deferring to the president’s authority on national security issues, but even supporters of birthright citizenship accept Trump’s plan would face a potentially insurmountable uphill battle.
“It’s something that the Supreme Court may well decide against the president if he were to take this step,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, who supports the idea.
If Trump loses that case, then the next step is clear, he added: There would need to be an effort to start the difficult process of amending the Constitution.
A Trump campaign spokesman declined to comment on the plan, pointing to the former president’s original announcement.
Under Trump’s proposal, at least one parent would need to be a citizen or legal resident for a child to receive birthright citizenship. He indicated in his video that the policy would not apply retroactively.
The order, Trump said, would also address so-called “birth tourism,” a situation in which Republicans claim people visit the U.S. toward the end of a pregnancy in order to ensure the child is born a U.S. citizen.
It is unclear exactly how many children a year are born in the U.S. to parents who are both undocumented or how many of them could be described as “birth tourists” under Trump’s formulation.
Krikorian’s group has previously said that there could be up to 400,000 children born a year to undocumented parents and thousands of children born as a result of birth tourism every year.
The American Immigration Council, an immigrant rights group, said it does not have exact numbers but noted that there are currently an estimated 3.7 million U.S.-born children who have at least one parent who is undocumented, a number derived from U.S. census data.
A spokesperson for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency that handles citizenship issues, declined to comment.
Trump had pledged to end birthright citizenship when first running for president in 2015 and he raised it again in 2018. But he never issued an executive order.
At the time, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a fellow Republican, dismissed the idea, saying: “You can’t do something like this via executive order.”
Despite Trump’s pledge, the plan to end birthright citizenship is not specifically mentioned in the 2024 Republican platform document, which includes a chapter titled “Seal the Border and Stop the Migrant Invasion.”
The platform does include language pledging to “prioritize merit-based immigration” and end chain migration, a term used to refer to people who have U.S. citizenship and then use their status to help other family members enter the country.
Ken Cuccinelli, who held a senior Department of Homeland Security position in the first Trump administration, said the proposal is “appropriate and manageable from a policy perspective” but did not respond to further questions on how it could be lawfully implemented.
Cuccinelli wrote the chapter on immigration-related issues that was included in Project 2025, a proposed road map for a second Trump administration issued by the conservative Heritage Foundation. His section did not mention birthright citizenship.
“As has been laid out by many scholars, this current policy is based on a historical myth and a willful misinterpretation of the law by the open borders advocate,” Trump said of birthright citizenship in his announcement video.
Few people agree with that assessment.
The legal argument, fleshed out by anti-immigration advocates, focuses on the language in the 14th Amendment saying that birthright citizenship is awarded to those “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States.
Opponents of birthright citizenship say that language means citizenship is denied to anyone whose parents are not legally in the country.
“Illegal aliens can hardly be said to be under the protection of the United States,” said Christopher Hajec, a lawyer at the Immigration Reform Law Institute, another anti-immigration group.
But most legal experts say the jurisdiction language only refers to people not bound by U.S. law, most notably foreign diplomats.
Even James Ho, a conservative lawyer whom Trump appointed to the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals where he has built a reputation as a judicial firebrand, backs that view.
He wrote in a 2009 article that the 14th Amendment citizenship language applies to “most U.S.-born children of aliens, including illegal aliens.”
Being within the jurisdiction of the U.S. merely means people who are required to obey U.S. laws, Ho said. “And obedience, of course, does not turn on immigration status,” he added.
The Supreme Court has never directly ruled on the issue, but the one case that is frequently mentioned in any discussion of the issue suggested that it was assumed people born in the U.S. have citizenship, whatever the status of their parents.
In that 1898 case, called United States v. Wong Kim Ark, the court ruled that a man born in San Francisco to parents who were both from China was a U.S. citizen.
Birthright citizenship critics argue that the ruling did not address whether the children of people who entered the country illegally are U.S. citizens, as the parents in that case had been lawfully admitted.
In fact, they suggest the ruling assumes that the children of people who enter the country illegally do not have citizenship, although they concede that the argument can be difficult to follow.
“You really have to tease it out,” Hajec said. “It’s a pretty complicated argument.”
If Trump were to follow through on his plan to issue an executive order on day one, the impact could be felt immediately.
The Trump campaign has said the president would order the Social Security Administration to refuse to issue Social Security numbers to newborn children without proof of the parents’ immigration status. He would issue a similar order to the State Department regarding passports.
Krikorian, who said he has not discussed the policy with the Trump campaign, favors that approach as it would not require any action from Congress and would immediately prompt a lawsuit that would get the legal issue before the Supreme Court in short order.
In the unlikely event that Trump’s plan were to go fully into effect, it could be tricky to implement because federal agencies do not necessarily have immigration status at their fingertips and would need to access information not just on the newly born child but also data on both parents. Sometimes relevant information could be hard to determine, such as if the immigration status of an absent parent is not known to the other.
A Social Security Administration spokeswoman noted that the agency does not hold data on immigration status, which it has to verify with the Department of Homeland Security before issuing immigrants a Social Security number.
Currently, a U.S. birth certificate is all that is needed to obtain a Social Security number or passport.
Emma Winger, a lawyer at the American Immigration Council, said that Trump’s proposal would affect any child born in the United States, as every parent would now need to take an additional bureaucratic step to ensure that their baby is registered as a citizen. 
“Everybody relies on the fact that if they are born here they just need to show proof of birth,” she said. “It would be a radical shift.”Lawrence Hurley is a senior Supreme Court reporter for NBC News. "
NBC_2,Israel retaliates in Lebanon after strike on Golan Heights soccer field kills at least 12,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-retaliates-lebanon-strike-soccer-field-golan-heights-rcna163953,2024-07-28 21:02:02.818667,,"The Israel Defense Forces said they have hit seven targets “deep inside Lebanese territory” on Sunday in retaliation for a strike on a soccer field that killed at least 12, mostly children and teenagers, in an Israeli-controlled town in the Golan Heights.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rushed back to Tel Aviv from the United States as outrage built in Israel over the deadly strike, which the Israeli military has blamed on Hezbollah, the Iran-backed group in Lebanon.
“Israel is approaching the moment of an all-out war against Hezbollah,” the Israeli military said. “The IDF is prepared and ready to protect Israel’s security.”
Israel’s strikes in Lebanon hit as far as the Bekaa Valley, about 60 miles from the southern border with Israel, where hostilities have so far largely been confined. The retaliatory strikes heighten tensions between two heavily armed forces already locked in conflict.
Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the strike. It is unusual for the militant group to deny an attack.
Israel’s spokesperson Daniel Hagari said in a statement that the rocket was an Iranian-made Falaq-1 “owned exclusively by Hezbollah.” Hagari called Saturday’s strike the deadliest attack in Israel since Oct. 7. “We are in an escalating war,” Hagari said Saturday, “children have been targeted and those children are Druze Israeli citizens.”
The strike landed just before sunset, and footage on Israel’s Channel 12 showed a large blast and a plume of smoke in one of the valleys in Majdal Shams, a town populated by the Druze, an Arabic-speaking ethnic and religious minority.
Sheikh Muafak Tarif, the spiritual leader of the Druze in Israel, decried “the brutal and murderous attack.”
“It’s impossible to imagine and describe the horrific images of children and their smashed [body] parts strewn on the grass,” he said in a statement.
The Druze, who practice a distinct religion, are unique among Israel’s Arab population in their support for the state, including by joining the Israeli military. About 25,000 Druze live in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967.
The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has so far been subdued compared to the war in Gaza. But Hezbollah’s promises of continued support for Palestinians has meant sustained attacks against Israel. Hundreds have died, mostly from Israeli fire in Lebanon, and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes on both sides of the border.
The latest strikes have renewed fears of escalation.
“This is exactly the kind of thing that can send us into a spiral,” said Gershon Baskin, Middle East director of the International Communities Organisation based in Israel.
“Hezbollah is not going to take this sitting down, and their ability to do damage to Israel is 100 times bigger than Hamas,” Baskin said. “The amount of firepower that both sides have can do an enormous amount of damage and kill a lot of people.”
“Escalation is never planned. It spins out of control,” Baskin said.
The White House National Security Council said in a statement that support for Israel’s security “is iron-clad and unwavering against all Iranian-backed terrorist groups, including Lebanese Hezbollah.” 
The U.S. has previously worked to prevent a greater war between Israel and Hezbollah from unfolding. On a trip to Lebanon in June, White House envoy Amos Hochstein said that the U.S. was urgently seeking to calm the conflict.
Despite pressure from the Biden administration, Israeli officials have remained firm in their desire to go after Hezbollah in Lebanon, according to U.S. officials familiar with the conversations, as previously reported by NBC News.
Netanyahu cut his trip to the U.S. short by several hours following the strike on the Golan Heights. He immediately vowed retaliation against Hezbollah and said the group would “pay a heavy price, one that it has not paid so far.”
The latest violence comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing a cease-fire proposal that could bring an end to the nearly 10-month conflict. On Friday, Netanyahu said he would send a delegation to Rome for talks aimed at ending the war with Hamas. The U.S. is sending the head of the CIA, Bill Burns, to meet representatives from Qatar, Egypt and Israel.
Hezbollah has said it will continue its attacks as long as Israel’s offensive in Gaza continues, and Fawaz Gerges, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics, believes ending the war in Gaza would be the quickest way to put an end to any escalating conflict between Israel and Lebanon.
“Hezbollah has the capacity to resist Israel for years, not just months,” he said “It could bleed Israel in ways that it has never experienced before.”
“Once the guns fall silent in Gaza,” Gerges said, “the clashes between Hezbollah, the Houthis and Israel will stop.”Freddie Clayton is a freelance journalist based in London. "
NBC_3,"Simone Biles pushes through calf pain to qualify for five finals, U.S. women's team sits in first",https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/olympics/simone-biles-calf-pain-team-usa-womens-team-rcna163942,2024-07-28 23:13:02.663312,,"The U.S. women’s gymnastics team had some precarious moments in Sunday’s qualifying round, but they will enter the team final as the overwhelming favorites for gold.
Simone Biles topped the all-around standings after the second of five subdivisions, flanked by Suni Lee, and is well-positioned to qualify for the floor, vault and beam apparatus finals.
For the first time, two Olympic all-around champions will go head-to-head in the all-around final when Biles and Lee go for gold on Thursday.
Follow along for live coverage
Biles’ Paris prospects were suddenly in peril after she appeared to suffer a rough landing during floor warmups.
Her coach, Cecile Landi, said after the competition that Biles “felt a little pain in her calf,” but she never considered pulling out.
The apparent injury was also bothering Biles in training a couple of weeks ago, according to Landi, but had improved until today’s flare-up. She had her ankle wrapped by medical staff and intends to compete as planned for the rest of the Games.
The U.S. women had the daunting task of starting on the balance beam, where adrenaline can make staying on the 4-inch apparatus difficult. They did their jobs despite some hiccups, and Biles anchored the U.S. beam effort with one of the best routines of her career. She earned a huge 14.733 and will expect to join Lee in the beam finals.
Team USA’s toughest moment came in the second rotation when reigning Olympic floor champion Jade Carey fumbled her last tumbling pass. She appeared to get lost in the air on her double tuck, doing only a full tuck and rolling backward, out of bounds.
Carey earned a 10.633 on floor, which will prevent her from defending her title.
After the competition, Carey said in a post on X that she “hasn’t been feeling the best” while in Paris.
Her coach and father, Brian, was absent from Thursday’s podium training after USA Gymnastics said he was not feeling well. He returned for today’s qualification round.
On the next event, she got her redemption.
Carey scored a 14.433 average on vault with a Cheng and a double-twisting Yurchenko, which she is capable of upgrading to an Amanar (2.5 twists), in the final. Biles, who nailed her eponymous Yurchenko double pike, or “Biles II” vault, is expected to join Carey in pursuit of an Olympic vault medal.
“I think they rallied together,” Chellsie Memmel, the squad’s technical lead coach, said of Team USA’s resilience. “I think that says the strength of their team bond, just that they came together, they turned the page after floor and rallied around each other.”
Lee secured her all-around final berth on bars, where she is the reigning Olympic bronze medalist. She needed a 14.800 to beat Jordan Chiles, a tall order, but Lee clinched it by less than a tenth. She opted for a slightly safer routine, taking out a difficult connection and earning a 14.866. That secured her a presumptive spot in the bars final as well.
Like Gabby Douglas and Jordyn Wieber before her, Chiles found herself in the bittersweet position of being the third-best gymnast on the most dominant women’s gymnastics team in the world. Despite finishing third in the all-around standings after the second subdivision, Chiles will not advance to the all-around finals due to the two-gymnast-per-country rule.
She did not go down with out a fight, though.
Chiles excelled in all four events in her return to the Olympics — a massive improvement from a discouraging qualifying performance in Tokyo. Chiles is poised to join Biles, who is also her training mate, in the floor final. She won a silver medal in the event at the 2022 world championships.
Hezly Rivera, 16, is not only the youngest member of the U.S. gymnastics team, but also of the entire Team USA delegation. She battled some nerves in her Olympic debut on the balance beam and scored below her potential, but Rivera will be satisfied with the 13.900 she earned in the last rotation on bars.

NBC_4,Apple has reached its first-ever union contract with store employees in Maryland,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/apple-union-towson-maryland-rcna163978,2024-07-29 02:00:02.864245,,"Apple has reached a tentative collective bargaining contract with the first unionized company store in the country.
The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers’ Coalition of Organized Retail Employees, which represents the employees at a retail location in Maryland, announced Friday evening that it struck a three-year deal with the company that will increase pay by an average of 10% and offer other benefits to workers.
The agreement must be approved by roughly 85 employees at the store, which is located in the Baltimore suburb of Towson. A vote is scheduled for Aug. 6.
“By reaching a tentative agreement with Apple, we are giving our members a voice in their futures and a strong first step toward further gains,” the union’s negotiating committee said in a statement. “Together, we can build on this success in store after store.”
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The deal came after workers at the store authorized a strike in May, saying talks with management for more than a year hadn’t yielded “satisfactory outcomes.”
The Maryland store is one of only two unionized Apple sites in the country. Employees there voted in favor of the union in June 2022, a few months before workers at a second Apple location in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, unionized with the Communications Workers of America. The second store has not secured a contract with the tech company.
Unions have scored headline-grabbing election wins in recent years, including at an Amazon warehouse in New York City, a Chipotle store in Michigan and hundreds of Starbucks stores across the country. But many of them have not secured contracts.The Associated Press"
NBC_5,Fans share emotional reactions to Céline Dion's comeback at Paris Olympics,https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/olympics/fans-share-emotional-reactions-celine-dions-comeback-paris-olympics-rcna163971,2024-07-29 02:00:02.864245,,"Céline Dion promised herself she would return to the stage. On Friday, her first live performance in more than four years drew an outpouring of emotional support in Paris and around the world.
Closing out the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics, Dion belted her powerful rendition of French singer Édith Piaf’s “Hymne à l’amour” from a sparkling Eiffel Tower.
Dion has been open about her battle with stiff-person syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that causes muscle rigidity and spasms that sometimes affect Dion’s control over her vocal cords.
But the singer’s performance Friday left the audience in awe as fans rushed to share their adulation.
Videos online showed Dion exiting the Eiffel Tower to applause and cheers, accepting flowers from fans as she left, and receiving praise — which evolved into chants of “Céline” — from a crowd outside her hotel.
Some viewers — whether watching from the audience like Canadian high diver Molly Carlson, or from elsewhere — shared videos of themselves tearing up and sobbing.
Fans shared their reactions from home, making viral posts online about how Dion’s performance stirred their emotions. One X user wrote that watching it “made me get up out of bed. after I wiped the ocean of tears off my face.”
Another user noted that her performance “could have been a 4/10 and we’d have been cheering Celine on just the same… but the fact that at 56, after years of a debilitating chronic illness that has affected her voice to such a degree, she just gave probably the performance of her career… I’m truly in awe.”
After revealing her stiff-person diagnosis in 2022, the singer postponed and ultimately canceled all 2023 and 2024 dates for a scheduled European tour.
In an interview with “TODAY’s” Hoda Kotb last month, Dion described herself as having been trapped in a “bunker” for four years.
“I’m going to go back onstage even if I have to crawl,” she told Kotb. “Even if I have to talk with my hands, I will. I will.”
Kelly Clarkson, who is covering this year’s Olympics as a co-host alongside Peyton Manning and Mike Tirico, was also seemingly speechless after witnessing Dion's comeback.
“If you know anything just about Celine right now ... this is her purpose. And if you know anything about what she’s going through right now and — I’m so sorry, I’m trying to hold it together — but that she got through that, that was incredible,” Clarkson said after the performance. “And in my field, she is the gold winner for vocal athletes.”Angela Yang is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News."

Kevin Durant led the way for USA, scoring 23 points on 8-of-9 shooting. Durant, who missed all of exhibition play leading up to Paris, looked dominant coming off the bench. LeBron James, playing in the Olympics for the first time since 2012, recorded 21 points, 8 rebounds and 9 assists, picking up where he left off in London 12 years ago.
Follow along for live coverage here 
Nikola Jokić, a three-time NBA MVP, led Serbia with 20 points and 8 assists, adding 5 rebounds for good measure. But the Serbians were overwhelmed by the talent on the USA side. After a back-and-forth first quarter, the United States took the lead late in the opening 10 minutes and never gave it up the rest of the way.
USA’s shooting was off the charts in its opener. The U.S. shot 62.3% from the field, including 56.3% from three. Moving players like Devin Booker and Stephen Curry around off the ball proved problematic for the Serbian defense, and the States’ other perimeter stars were able to take advantage of their screens and movement. Meanwhile, the front-court rotation of Joel Embiid, Bam Adebayo and Anthony Davis was stout defensively, walling off the paint for practically every Serbian player outside of Jokić.
Contributions came from all over the U.S. roster. Jrue Holiday scored 15 points in addition to his on-ball defensive prowess. Booker had 12, while Curry and Anthony Edwards each added 11. Edwards brought his trademark attitude as well, inviting some Serbian defenders to dance on a couple of his buckets.
While Durant’s return beefed up the USA attack, it also tightened the rotation. Durant came off the bench and seemingly put Jayson Tatum on ice — for now. Tatum, a reigning NBA champ, didn’t see any action in the opening game. With plenty of firepower on the wing between James, Durant, Booker and Davis, coach Steve Kerr opted for more defensive-minded players next to them, ironically in Tatum’s Celtics teammates Holiday and Derrick White.
Though the U.S. is a heavy favorite to win its fourth-straight gold medal, Sunday’s win was impressive. What Serbia lacks in NBA depth it makes up for in cohesion. Serbia won silver during last year’s FIBA World Cup, and also features current NBA stars Nikola Jović and Bogdan Bogdanović.
USA’s next group game is against South Sudan on Wednesday. The two teams played recently, with the U.S. eking out a 101-100 win on July 20.Rohan Nadkarni is a sports reporter for NBC News. "
NBC_7,Léon Marchand wins Olympic gold in 400 IM and the admiration of France,https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/olympics/le-marchand-wins-olympic-gold-400-im-admiration-france-rcna163996,2024-07-29 06:08:02.721535,,"NANTERRE, France — Frenchman Léon Marchand electrified a partisan crowd Sunday with an Olympic record time in the swimming 400-meter individual medley before American Torri Huske and Italian Nicolo Martinenghi also won their first gold medals.
A capacity crowd filled Paris La Défense Arena, with thousands of fans decked out in bleu, blanc et rouge in hope of crowning a new national hero. Marchand did not disappoint.
His time of 4:02.95 broke the Olympic record of all-time great Michael Phelps and fell just short of the world record held by Marchand himself.
“I think it’s a dream for every one of us,” he told NBC, wearing the gold around his neck. “I got the chance to do it today. That was amazing. I don’t know how to describe it.”
About 13 minutes before the race started, fans spontaneously broke out in song with “La Marseillaise” and chanted “Léon, Léon, Léon!”
And once the race started, the deafening cheers got through to Marchand. As he pulled away from the field in the breaststroke, fans rhythmically cheered each time his head popped out of the water.
“The breaststroke was insane, because I could hear whole stadium, so that was amazing to do,” said Marchand, who won France's first swimming gold since 2012.
Japan’s Tomoyuki Matsushita, who stayed close to Marchand during the butterfly, took silver, and Cincinnati native Carson Foster secured bronze.
Marchand, 22, who swam at Arizona State under the guidance of Phelps’ coach, Bob Bowman, isn’t done yet. He’s expected to compete in the 200 IM, the 200 butterfly and the 200 breaststroke later in these Games.
Later in the evening, Huske, of Arlington, Virginia, won the women’s 100-meter butterfly, erasing heartbreak from three years ago when she finished in fourth place by a hundredth of a second.
“Like you said, I just missed the podium last time by a hundredth, so I’m so thankful to be here, and to do it with Gretchen is just amazing,” Huske said. “I’ve had a long road, but I have a lot of support, and I’m so thankful for all of it.”
She went 1-2 with fellow American Gretchen Walsh as China’s Zhang Yufei won bronze.
“I feel like I’m in shock right now,” Huske said. “Like I don’t even know how to process it, like I feel like I’m going to cry but, like, I’m also smiling. It’s really surreal.”
Before “The Star-Spangled Banner” played and the American flag was raised, Huske made sure Walsh joined her on the podium’s top step. They joyously clasped and raised hands moments after “home of the brave.”
Walsh said there was pressure on her as both the world and Olympic record holder in the event.
“Seeing the one-two up there, though, was amazing. I’m so proud of Torri, and I’m proud of myself,” she said. “I think that was what America needed and wanted, and it was a really special moment that we shared out there on the podium.”
In the men’s 100 breaststroke, American Nic Fink and Great Britain’s Adam Peaty tied for silver as Martinenghi took gold.
Fink finished fifth in the 200 breaststroke in Tokyo and still has the sweatsuit he was hoping to wear to the podium.
""One of my least favorite feelings was bringing podium sweats and never getting a chance to wear them, so that was definitely a bummer in Tokyo,"" he said after he won silver Sunday. ""The fact that I was able to make that next step here is a lot more fun."" 
Fink, who has a master’s degree in electrical and computer engineering from Georgia Tech, works a full-time job while training for the Olympics. He said the 9-to-5 routine helps him be ""well rounded"" and ""balanced."" 
At the advanced swimming age of 31, Fink wouldn't rule out another attempt at glory in Los Angeles in 2028.
""As for my future, you know, I could've probably closed the door a couple of times on my career, and it's only gotten better and better,"" Fink said. ""So I don't want to say anything definitive. And you know, L.A. is four years away, but a home Olympics would be pretty cool. So we'll see.""David K. Li is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital."

A prominent conservative writer warned Republicans that Vice President Kamala Harris could win the presidency despite being a ""tragically flawed candidate."" 
""She’s a tragically flawed candidate, but so is Trump, who doesn’t have the media cheering for him from here to November,"" National Review's Charles C. W. Cooke wrote in a column published Thursday titled ""Kamala Harris could actually win.""
Harris has succeeded her boss, President Biden, as the presumptive Democratic Party nominee after Biden withdrew under pressure from the race and endorsed her on Sunday. She has rapidly consolidated support and endorsements, and also brought in huge fundraising hauls, to effectively clinch the nomination ahead of next month's Democratic convention.

Cooke argued that ""small shifts in sentiment"" brought on by positive press coverage for Harris can ""quickly add up"" in a divided country.
""If the question in play here were solely, ‘Is Kamala Harris a good candidate?’ my answer would be an emphatic, unalloyed ‘No[,]’"" the columnist said.
""But that’s not the sole question — or even the material question,"" Cooke continued. ""The material question is whether Kamala Harris and her as-yet-unappointed VP aspirant can win an election against Donald Trump and JD Vance. And I absolutely, unquestionably, categorically think that she can."" 
""The Biden-Harris administration is by no means loved,"" he wrote. ""Joe Biden is the most unpopular president in modern history, Kamala Harris is the most unpopular vice president since polling began, and, in the minds of the average voter, the years that those two have been in charge of the executive branch have been stained with inflation, waste, incompetence, a tornado of illegal immigration, a series of crises abroad, and, most recently, a dastardly conspiracy to cover up the president’s senility.""

Despite the unpopularity of the Biden administration, Cooke also said that voters ""still do not like"" the leading Republican ticket, Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance.
""Donald Trump is unpopular,"" Cooke wrote. ""JD Vance is unpopular. In every Senate contest other than West Virginia and (perhaps) Montana, the Democrat is running away with the race. Insofar as the GOP has a good shot at the presidency this year, it is because much of the electorate dislikes the incumbents marginally more than it dislikes the GOP. That, though, could change.""
""If, as it ought, the Republican Party wishes to prove me wrong in my suspicion, it’s going to have to escape from its post-convention jubilation — and work like hell,"" Cooke wrote.

(White House) 
A video of Vice President Kamala Harris arguing that young people are experiencing ""climate anxiety"" that causes them to rethink major future plans like buying a house or having a family is making the rounds, despite it being nearly a year old.
Donald Trump Jr. shared the resurfaced video from September 2023, showing the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate making the statements during her national ""Fight for Our Freedoms"" college tour.
""WATCH: Resurfaced video shows Kamala Harris suggesting that young people should not have children due to climate change,"" Trump said in a post on X. ""She calls climate anxiety ‘the fear of the future and the unknown of whether it makes sense for you to even think about children.’""
When Harris made the college tour stop on Sept. 19, 2023, she was speaking to an audience at the Reading Area Community College in Berks County, Pennsylvania.
HARRIS CLAIMS ‘CLIMATE ANXIETY’ HAS YOUNG PEOPLE DOUBTING THE ‘SENSE' OF HAVING CHILDREN, BUYING HOME
She told the crowd the Biden-Harris ticket saw a record turnout of young voters during the 2020 election, inspiring the administration’s initiative toward student loan forgiveness, which recently hit a roadblock in court.
""We're not going to stop fighting for that. Because young people said, we're not leaving it to other people to decide how we're dealing with the climate crisis. You know, I've heard young leaders talk with me about a term they've coined, ‘climate anxiety,’"" Harris said, pivoting, ""Which is fear of the future and the unknown of whether it makes sense for you to even think about having children, whether it makes sense for you to think about aspiring to buy a home because what will this climate be?""

At the time, critics on social media erupted against Harris’ ""climate anxiety"" claim, arguing Americans are more likely to consider the rising costs of energy, food and housing when making the decision to have children. The Republican-led House Budget Committee has blamed the Biden administration’s economic policies for leading to the most rapid increase in mortgage rates since 1981. A Gallup poll from May found a record low 21% of Americans think it is a good time to buy a home. 
Despite the original video being nearly a year old, Trump’s repost gained some attention, including from X owner Elon Musk.

Sunday marks one week since President Biden's political landscape-altering announcement that he was suspending his re-election rematch against former President Trump and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him as the Democrats' 2024 presidential nominee.
And early Sunday morning, the Harris campaign showcased that the vice president has hauled in a stunning $200 million in fundraising in just under a week since Biden bowed out.
In a release, the campaign touted what they called a ""record-shattering haul"" and noted that two-thirds of the contributions came from first-time donors, which they argued was ""further proof of the tremendous grassroots support for the Vice President.""

Biden made his move last weekend amid mounting pressure from within the Democratic Party for him to drop out after a disastrous performance in last month's first presidential debate with Trump.
The embattled president's immediate backing of Vice President Kamala Harris last Sunday ignited a surge of endorsements for the vice president by Democratic governors, senators, House members and other party leaders. Within 36 hours, Harris announced that she had locked up her party's nomination by landing the verbal backing of a majority of the nearly 4,000 delegates to next month's Democratic National Convention.

FOX_5,The one characteristic of Reagan and Trump that sets them apart from other presidents,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/one-characteristic-reagan-trump-sets-them-apart-from-other-presidents,2024-07-28 18:01:02.861000,politics,"WARNING: Graphic imagery—Fox News national correspondent Bryan Llenas has the latest on the assassination attempt on former President Trump on 'Your World.'
Former President Donald Trump is on his way. President Joe Biden has collapsed and been pushed out of office before our very eyes.  The first man in history to be bluffed out of a pot when he was holding four aces. He had money in the bank. He was the incumbent. He was competitive in the polls. Who’d want to go to the mattresses with this quitter? 
Now he is replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris, who is so light, she’d float away if she was not tied down by DEI blimp lines. 
Let’s not buy the dishonesties that Biden stepped down from power like George Washington or Cincinnatus. That is just another liberal canard. Biden was pushed and he panicked and jumped. His fundraising had dried up, his internal polls had gotten shaky, and he was revealed to all the American people to be a decrepit and frail old man with memory issues in his one debate with Trump.

Politics is motion and Trump has been in motion for months while Biden has been as stalled as his EV charger mandate. Trump has broken free, running to daylight as Vince Lombardi used to say. 
We all know the phrase Make America Great Again started with the 1980 Reagan campaign, but Trump has done a good job stamping it indelibly as his own to great effect. 
And Trump, like Reagan, is running a joyous and fun campaign. They both enjoy and enjoyed the crowds. They both know the seriousness of their movements, but both have conveyed a deft sense of humor all the while making their case to the American people. 
Both have the sun in their faces. Reagan used to tweak Carter by telling crowds, ""A man who tells you he enjoys a cold shower in the morning will lie about other things."" Trump tweaks his opponents likewise. 
Both have shown public bravery after being shot and nearly killed. President John F. Kennedy called it, ""grace under pressure."" He got it from a book by Ernest Hemingway, ""The Old Man and the Sea."" When Reagan was shot, he was cracking jokes in the operating theater. When Robert Kennedy was shot in the head and lay dying, he whispered to an attending aide, ""Is everyone all right?"" Trump, after being shot in the head, looked at the massive crowd and raised his right fist shouting, ""Fight! Fight! Fight!"" 
All showed their own grace under pressure. 
Reagan was his own man too, but both he and Trump ran and are running from the same issue cluster, a gift to the Republican Party by Reagan in 1980. Before the 1980 campaign, the GOP had been all over the lot as a sometimes-big-government party, a sometimes-high-tariffs party, as a sometimes-high-tax party. That all changed after 1980.

Both men believe in federalism, who want to send power and authority back to the states. Both are prolife. Both support the Strategic Defense Initiative as now embodied by Israel’s Iron Dome. Both are populists, suspicious of the concentration of power by corporations or governments.

Both are confronted by an out-of-control Kremlin, bent on power, ready to invade Afghanistan or Ukraine.  
Both Trump and Reagan are pro-Israel. Both their opponents, Presidents Jimmy Carter and Biden were dour Arabists who were not trusted by Israel. Both were confronted by high inflation and national malaise. 
Tax cuts are and were important to both men. For Reagan, tax cuts were important as a means to lessen people's dependence on government. For Trump, because they stimulate the economy. Both are commendable reasons.

In the most important sense though, both Reagan and Trump are their own men. Biden has often implied over the years, ""I want to be like FDR,"" or ""I want to govern like JFK."" This screams self-doubt. 
Not Reagan or Trump. Both were too inner-directed, both too centered, too secure to ever be so self-doubting as to want to be other men rather than just themselves.

FOX_7,An American education partnership in Qatar brings surprising benefits to the Middle East,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/qatar-american-education-surprisingly-successful-combination,2024-07-28 20:01:02.791245,opinion,"Former Education Secretary Bill Bennett reacts to ongoing protests on college campuses and statements from Biden’s education secretary on the unrest.
I have been a vocal critic of university administrators who seem unable or unwilling to maintain order on their campuses, and particularly those who struggle to use plain language about the difference between right and wrong. I have also questioned whether our ""elite"" universities really earned or deserve that status when, increasingly, they have become engines for indoctrination on only one side of the political spectrum. It remains to be seen whether their latest time in the spotlight with the vitriol of anti-Americanism and antisemitism will produce needed change.
But while acknowledging that these are real problems that demand attention, it would be very wrong to let this moment devolve into the ugliness of anti-intellectualism or a crude attack on American higher education generally and its mostly positive history. 
It is a fact that America’s global dominance in the 20th Century was powered in very significant part by our universities. From the Manhattan Project to the eight million veterans who were educated under the GI Bill, America’s universities led the way. Today, American universities are without equal in science and technology research, and the fruits of that ripple across our society and economy. For example, if you or one of your loved ones ever received lifesaving medical treatment or medicine, you can bet that it emerged from a laboratory at an American university.
Consider also the importance and influence of American higher education on our export economy. To paraphrase a recent Forbes article, America’s two greatest exports are Hollywood and higher education. International students contribute about $40 billion in annual revenue to the U.S. economy, not far behind pharmaceutical exports. More than a million international students are enrolled in our universities. And for those who believe, as I do, that sharing and spreading American values globally is important, almost nothing is more influential than the experience of a young person spending four years at a U.S. university and then returning home to their communities in Europe, Africa or Asia. But that positive influence depends on whether that university experience overall is an embrace of American values and is not contemptuous of them.
COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AGREES TO DO MORE TO PROTECT STUDENTS IN SETTLEMENT WITH JEWISH STUDENT
I thought about this recently while watching some of the Congressional hearings about campus unrest, and the disturbing evidence of antisemitic messages and other hate speech. This deserves the attention it is receiving, and university administrators must be called to account for inaction or worse. But I was surprised to see some of the hearing testimony go off-topic into unfounded, conspiratorial speculation that ""foreign funding"" was fueling campus unrest. A frequent target was Qatar, which was accused of being the ""largest foreign donor"" to U.S. universities. I was curious, and after looking into it, was surprised at what I found.
Based on data compiled by the Department of Education, which distinguishes clearly between university receipts from foreign ""gifts"" and ""contracts,"" Qatar is not the largest foreign donor, and is not anywhere near the top of that list. But Qatar spends about $500 million annually in contract payments, virtually all of which are expended in Qatar to fund the operation of branch campuses of six prominent American universities – Weill Cornell Medical School, Texas A&M, Carnegie Mellon, Virginia Commonwealth, Georgetown, and Northwestern. These payments are not donations.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
The six campuses have operated in Qatar for more than 20 years, awarding degrees to Qatari women and men, and to others who wish to study there. The idea originated with an impressive Qatari woman, Sheikha Moza Bint Nasser, who was determined to expand education opportunities for women, and to elevate the standards of education in Qatar and the region. It was wildly successful. Since its first graduating class in 2018, Weill Cornell-Qatar has graduated 596 medical doctors, now practicing globally. The 2024 class included 26 women and 24 men. Texas A&M Qatar has graduated 1,656 engineers. The 2024 class included 73 women and 63 men.

Education City contains numerous buildings designed by famous architects. (Photo by Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post via Getty Images) 
When these campuses were established, the universities demanded and received firm commitments to total academic freedom and governance by the main campus administrators in the United States, without interference from Qatar. The universities control admissions, curriculum and everything else related to an academic institution. There is no Qatari influence campaign at these universities or their home campuses. When asked about this at a May 2, 2024, hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Avril Haines, Director of National Intelligence, said flatly there was no evidence that Qatar played any role in recent campus unrest in the United States.

Qataris are justifiably proud of what these universities have accomplished. Americans should be too. In fact, there is a long tradition of higher education in this region. Before the Civil War, American missionaries in the Middle East secured a charter to establish the Syrian Protestant College, which became the American University of Beirut, perhaps the most influential university in that region in the past 100 years. When the United Nations Charter was signed in 1945, 20 of the 50 delegates were AUB alumni.

(Photo by Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post via Getty Images) 
The irony of the false accusations about Qatar’s supposed influence at American universities is that the real foreign influence runs in the opposite direction. Certainly, generations of young Qataris are profoundly influenced by the six American universities operating in Qatar. And at the Qatari branches of these six American universities there have been no reports of anti-American or antisemitic protests. Some of the main campuses of American universities could learn from their Qatari branches. That would be a better course and a wiser one than denigrating Qatar as it seeks to strengthen its relationship with the United States.

JERUSALEM – Pressure has been mounting in recent weeks on UNRWA, the United Nations agency tasked with aiding Palestinian refugees, over its failure to condemn armed terror groups in the Gaza Strip that have openly used its internationally funded facilities, including health clinics, schools and even its main headquarters, to conduct a brutal war against Israel. 
This week, Israeli lawmakers approved the first reading of a bill that would cut ties with the controversial U.N. agency and declare it a terrorist entity. Speaking in the Knesset last week, Yulia Malinovsky, the bill’s sponsor, called UNRWA ""a fifth column within the State of Israel"" and said it was high time that the agency was outlawed in the country. 
Meanwhile, earlier this month, Congress’ House Foreign Affairs Committee also passed initial legislation that would build on an already existing funding freeze of the multimillion-dollar organization and direct the State Department to recover previously donated monies.
""The U.S. has sufficient evidence at this point to impose terrorism sanctions on UNRWA,"" Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser at the Washington, D.C., think tank, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital. 
ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER: 'DOZENS' OF UNRWA STAFF TOOK PART IN HAMAS’ OCT 7 MASSACRE
Photos released by the Israel Defense Forces show three individuals they claim are Hamas combatants inside the UNRWA compound in Rafah. (IDF)
Goldberg, a former Trump National Security Council staff member, said the controversial organization ""must be disqualified from any future role in Gaza,"" pointing out that ""UNRWA’s existence – to incite violence and hate toward Jews and Israel – is inherently antithetical to the goal of de-radicalizing Palestinian society and moving Palestinians to self-sufficiency.""
""If you keep UNRWA around for what comes next in Gaza, you are condemning both Palestinians and Israelis to a future of violence and instability,"" he said.
The pushback against UNRWA, which according to its website carries out critical life-saving work for some 5.9 million Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, comes after Israel provided evidence that UNRWA employees actively participated in the Hamas-led Oct. 7 terror attacks in southern Israel. More than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were murdered in the surprise attack, and a further 240, including a 9-month-old infant, were taken hostage back to Gaza.

In February, Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Fox News Digital that ""dozens"" of UNRWA employees took part in the shocking attack and, following the release of more than 100 hostages, mainly women and children, during a cease-fire deal last November, it has been revealed that some were held captive by teachers and medical staff employed by the agency.
Israel has long accused UNRWA, short for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, of perpetuating the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It points out that Palestinian refugees are the only group afforded their own separate aid agency, while refugees from almost every other global conflict – past and present – are cared for under the broader umbrella of the U.N.’s High Commissioner for Refugees. It further notes that UNRWA, established in 1949 to provide services for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced when Israel was created, continues to recognize the descendants of those refugees regardless of where they were born or their current status – rather than attempting to settle them as other refugee agencies do.

According to UNRWA's website, its pledged budget for 2023 was $1.46 billion, with the U.S. Germany, EU and France as its biggest donors, but after Israel presented evidence that employees participated in the Oct. 7 attacks, the U.S., along with 17 other countries decided to pause funding. 
In March, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Congress moved to extend the funding freeze through March 2025, even as most of the other countries decided to resume their support. Last week, under the newly installed Labor government, the U.K. said it would soon ""release £21 million [$21.2 m] to support [UNRWA’s] lifesaving work in Gaza.""

The resumption of funds comes even as the U.N.’s Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) continues to investigate Israel’s claims against UNRWA employees, according to an April announcement; and even as the Israeli military reports almost daily of its battles with armed terror groups in and around UNRWA-owned complexes, including buildings where Gaza civilians are sheltering. 
Additionally, while UNRWA’s Commissioner General Philipe Lazzarini has been quick to condemn the fighting in his organization’s facilities – as well as the deaths of civilians, which the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry says stands at some 38,000 – he has failed to call out Hamas, and other terror factions, for purposely drawing the fighting to its centers.

Juliette Touma, director of communications for UNRWA, told Fox News Digital that the organization had ""condemned all parties to the conflict over the misuse of UNRWA facilities, including Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups.""
""We have made such comments repeatedly in our public statements, speeches, remarks and media interviews, including at the level of the Commissioner General,"" she said.

""We have also reminded all parties to the conflict that U.N. facilities must never be used for military or fighting purposes,"" said Touma, adding that UNRWA had ""called for investigations and independent inquiries of all violations of international humanitarian law.""
However, the condemnations appear not to have been forceful enough.
The legislation that passed its first reading in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, on Monday, drew the support of lawmakers from across the political spectrum. If passed into law, UNRWA would be prevented from operating inside Israeli territory and its personnel stripped of diplomatic privileges afforded to other U.N. staff.

UNRWA is also facing heat in Congress, with some members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee steadfast on maintaining the prohibition against funding – and now even seeking to rescind U.S. monies previously transferred to the agency. 
On July 12, the committee voted on a bipartisan bill introduced by Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., and Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., directing the secretary of state to recover any federal funds already distributed to UNRWA. Passing in the committee, 24-22, Mast posted a lengthy video on X accusing those who voted against it of ""willfully ignoring anything that doesn't fit into their narrative that Palestinians are victims in this war – that is what they want to put forward – instead of [recognizing that] they started this war, they started a genocide, and now this war is what's taking place.""
He criticized Democrats who claim that ""UNRWA was doing God’s work,"" noting that individuals educated in schools run by the agency were ""indoctrinated… with hate for the Jews."" 
""For way too long, UNRWA has masqueraded as a relief organization, while in reality serving as an incubator for Palestinian terrorists,"" he said, adding, ""Intelligence reports indicate that as many as ten percent of UNRWA workers have direct links to Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihadists. It’s ludicrous that our hard-earned American tax dollars were going to fund this crap. The State Department needs to do everything it can to recoup this money.""
Anne Bayefsky, director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust and president of Human Rights Voices, told Fox News Digital that denying American funds for UNRWA made sense for Americans ""because UNRWA is a body that fuels the hatred of Jews and the violence that results from that gross intolerance.""

""This isn't conjecture. It's undeniable fact,"" she said, pointing out that ""UNRWA employees participated in the Oct. 7 atrocities, sizable numbers of UNRWA employees are members of Hamas and other Palestinian terror organizations and UNRWA facilities have been used as Hamas command and control centers and as weapons storage depots."" 
""It makes sense for Americans to deny funds to UNRWA because it's the right thing to do,"" she said. ""Terrorism, rape, and antisemitism – not on our dime!""

FOX_9,'What if something bad happens?' Why we shouldn't give in to fear and wait to celebrate,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/what-something-bad-happens-why-shouldnt-give-fear-wait-celebrate,2024-07-28 21:00:02.818667,opinion,"Christian musician Brandon Lake joins ‘Fox & Friends’ to discuss extending his ‘TEAR OFF THE ROOF’ tour and his book with co-author Brittany Lake, ‘Little Lion Lungs.’
What if I dream and I’m disappointed? What if my hope only leads me to heartache? What if I give it my best effort and I fail? What if I pursue a deep connection and I’m rejected? These are just a few of the ""what-if"" questions that can plague our minds as we stand on the precipice of a new year or new season.
Part of our apprehension as we stare into the expansive unknown of the future is wondering whether or not we will be given a reason to feel joy or whether or not circumstances will grant us permission to celebrate in the coming year.
We tend to associate celebrations with endings, viewing celebration as a reaction to good news or a reward for an accomplishment. We think we need a reason to celebrate. As a result, we see our joy sitting on the far side of a dream realized, a goal achieved, or some sort of change in circumstances. And often, this supposed finish line is merely a mirage. When we come to this place of arrival, we find that our joy has moved to the other side of another goal or a different dream.
I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME AND YOU DON'T EITHER. BUT HERE'S THE TRUTH
Sometimes, celebration does look like a reaction to good news or a reward for a job well done. But at its best, celebration is not limited to a reaction or a reward, but practiced as a rhythm that helps us experience more joy in the lives we already have. Celebration is a practice that is available to us right now.
What does this look like? Here are three practices that you can begin incorporating into your life today, regardless of what your life looks like right now or what pain and joy awaits you in the future.
Savoring celebrates the ordinary, expanding our awareness of what is good and deepening our connection to our present joy. It extracts joy from the moments that our brain would be tempted to overlook or discard. Our brains are efficient and will readily dismiss memories it considers insignificant—including those everyday moments of joy—unless we savor them. You don’t need anything other than 30 seconds of your time. 
I SURVIVED HAVING FIVE MISCARRIAGES. THIS IS WHAT ALL THAT PAIN TAUGHT ME ABOUT HOPE
To begin, choose one moment from your day…it can be the present moment or select a picture of joy you experienced earlier in the day. It might be the look on a friend’s face when you gave them a compliment, a lovely scene in nature, the sound of your child’s laugh as they played in the backyard. Imagine that you are taking a photograph of that moment with your brain. 
Instead of stepping into a new season feeling anxious, wondering if you’ll have a reason to feel joy or worrying about whether or not circumstances will grant you permission to celebrate your life, embrace celebration as a practice you can begin right here, right now. 
Next, ask all five of your traditional senses what they are going to remember about this moment. What do you see? What do you smell? What do you hear? What do you taste? What do you feel? In savoring the ordinary moments, you celebrate your life and experience more joy in the life you are already living.
We often talk about gratitude’s impact on joy. And the research is clear that the practice of gratitude does indeed increase our joy as it helps us notice and name what is good, shaping our perspective and putting language to what we feel. But what we don’t often discuss is that the practice of thanksgiving—expressing the gratitude that we feel out loud to other people or to God in our prayers—doubles the joy we would have experienced had we simply felt grateful in our hearts. 
At its best, celebration is not limited to a reaction or a reward, but practiced as a rhythm that helps us experience more joy in the lives we already have. (iStock)

Thanksgiving is the avenue we’ve been given to celebrate the gift with the giver. Joy multiplies when it’s shared. This is true of our prayers too. Through thanksgiving, we can celebrate our gifts with God and double our joy.
Fun is not frivolous, but a homemade gift from God and one of our best defenses against burnout. Often, we consider celebration to be superfluous, and not essential to our lives. Sometimes we are hesitant to celebrate in this way because we fear it’s simply numbing the pain—an unhealthy reaction to life’s hardships. Celebration helps us process our experience and emotions, while escape presses pause on our emotions. Celebration is not a means of escaping the reality that our hearts are brutally bruised, but rather keeps us grounded in the truth that both our heartache and our hope are true and offers a means of processing both.

Instead of stepping into a new season feeling anxious, wondering if you’ll have a reason to feel joy or worrying about whether or not circumstances will grant you permission to celebrate your life, embrace celebration as a practice you can begin right here, right now. 
We are much more empowered over our joy than we tend to believe. Don’t wait to celebrate.

FIRST ON FOX: Former President Trump's campaign has mapped out its general election strategy with just 100 days until voters cast their ballots in November, launching a social media blitz and urging supporters to join its ""Trump Force 47"" grassroots effort to recruit new voters. 
The program, which the campaign says is focused on mobilizing ""highly-targeted voters in critical precincts across the battleground states and districts,"" has already engaged tens of thousands of volunteers. 
""Trump Force 47 is highly effective because it takes traditional voter contact tactics a step further by equipping voters with the skills to persuade their neighbors to vote for President Trump,"" Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital. ""100 days out from Election Day, Team Trump is ready to turn the historic enthusiasm behind President Trump into action by signing up thousands of new volunteers who are ready to Make America Great Again.""

The campaign told Fox News Digital that ""Trump Force 47"" builds on its early-state primary strategy of organizing volunteers at the precinct level, where each volunteer works to attract several specifically-targeted voters. 
The ""Trump Force 47"" website says it is ""the official army of volunteer neighborhood organizers working together to defeat Kamala Harris and the far-left liberal democrats."" 
Potential volunteers can sign up to target voter outreach in their own neighborhoods; call targeted voters; sign up for poll watching; be a ""Trump Captain; host a ""Trump House Party;"" or deliver yard signs to neighbors.

""Securing these votes are critical to ensuring President Trump and other Republicans win in November,"" the Trump campaign said. 
Meanwhile, the campaign is focusing on themes echoed throughout the Republican National Committee earlier this month, including ""Make America Safe Again,"" ""Make America Strong Again"" and ""Make America Great Again."" 
TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYS IT'S 'WELL-POSITIONED TO PROSECUTE THE CASE' AGAINST KAMALA HARRIS
The Trump campaign is releasing new graphics and ads, touting the former president's record and his plans to ""win, win, win"" against Vice President Harris. 
The new voter strategy comes after former Trump officially became the Republican presidential nominee, and Sen. JD Vance became his running mate, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at the Republican National Convention earlier this month. 
It also comes after President Biden suspended his re-election campaign. Harris landed endorsements from Biden, along with other top Democrats like former President Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and more.

Harris has also landed endorsements from the majority of delegates needed to secure the Democratic nomination. 
The official Democratic nominee, though, will not be named until Aug. 1. 
The change at the top of the Democratic ticket does not concern the Trump campaign, according to sources familiar. 
The campaign told Fox News Digital it ""has been wholly prepared for every scenario"" and said it completed its ""gameplanning months in advance.""
""The campaign leaves nothing to chance and is well-positioned to prosecute the case against a weak, failed, incompetent, and dangerously liberal in Kamala Harris,"" a Trump campaign adviser told Fox News Digital.

Political commentators and liberal media hosts are hailing President Biden for choosing to withdraw from the presidential campaign, with multiple broadcasters comparing him to George Washington. 
Biden faced increasing pressure from members of the media to step aside as the nominee for the good of the Democratic Party in the weeks after he debated former President Trump. 
The president's announcement on Sunday that he would drop out of the race ended weeks of debate within the Democratic Party, with multiple members of Congress and even actor George Clooney requesting that Biden give up his presidential ambitions.

""If you cannot appreciate the dignity, the grace, the selflessness, the patriotism of that speech – akin to Washington's farewell – but instead feel compelled to denigrate him, nitpick or return to petty partisan politics I pity you,"" Washington Post columnist Jen Rubin wrote Wednesday. ""You're denying yourself the majesty, the inspiration of America and of a great president. Go self-reflect.""

Biden's first wife, Neilia, and his young daughter, Naomi, were both killed in a car accident in 1972, an event that the president has spoken about on multiple occasions in the years since and on the campaign trail. 
HAVE BATTLEGROUNDS SHIFTED WITH HARRIS AT TOP OF TICKET?
MSNBC’s Joy Reid said Wednesday that Biden showed the country the extent to which he would sacrifice his own personal ambitions. 
""This was selfless on a level, I think, that's important in a way that we talk about George Washington being selfless,"" Reid said. ""In saying, ‘I could keep doing this, for me, because I think I can, but I’m going to stop doing it because I think there are choices,"" she said. 
MSNBC host Joe Scarborough read from a guest essay by historian Jon Meacham that was published on Monday in The New York Times.
""His decision is one of the most remarkable acts of leadership in our history, an act of self-sacrifice that places him in the company of George Washington, who also stepped away from the presidency,"" Meacham wrote. 
Meacham was fired as an MSNBC contributor in 2020 for failing to disclose that he served as a speechwriter for Biden during the campaign. 
CNN host Abby Phillip said that the president would be a much more ""powerful"" national figure if he continued to lean into the decision he made by dropping out of his presidential campaign. 
""This moment puts [Biden], you know, with a bunch of American greats, you know, the sort of George Washingtons of the world,"" Phillip said. ""He's stepping away from power. If he stays in that lane, I think that will be so much powerful and impactful."" 
""The View"" co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin said Thursday that Biden reminded Americans that presidents were not in power for life, but served as temporary representatives of the people.

The ""failure"" of President Biden and Vice President Harris could lead to Iran producing a nuclear weapon in the months ahead of the U.S. presidential election, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., warned on Sunday.
Graham, appearing on CBS’ ""Face the Nation,"" said the Senate last week received a ""stunning"" report from the Director of National Intelligence about the status of the Iranian nuclear program.
""What I worry the most about is a sprint to a nuclear weapon,"" Graham said. ""I am very worried that not only you could open up a second front [in Israel's war], but they could use these three or four months before our election to sprint to a nuclear weapon, and we have to put them on notice.

Vice President Kamala Harris has gained significant ground on former President Trump in the election betting markets in the week since taking over at the top of the Democratic ticket.
Trump entered Sunday with a 54.6% to win the election, while Harris came in at 39.2%, according to the Real Clear Politics betting average, a spread of a little over 15.2 percentage points.
While the market still favors Trump, the 15-point gap represents a significant shift over the last week. On July 20, the days before President Biden announced his decision to drop out of the race, Trump had a 61% chance to win the election, the Real Clear Politics average showed, while Harris came in with an 18.2% chance and Biden had a 9.5% chance, an almost 43-point gap between Trump and his closest competitor.

A similar trend has played out on PredictIt, a New Zealand-based prediction market that offers ""shares"" of political outcomes, with Trump shares currently selling for 54 cents on the site and Harris shares selling for 48 cents. Since shares on the platform are priced between $0.01 and $0.99, the price of the share is essentially the percentage chance an outcome will happen, meaning Trump has a 54% chance to win the election.
Harris has gained significant ground on Trump over the last week on PredictIt, the platform’s historical trends show. On July 20, Trump shares were selling for 64 cents, Harris, 27 cents, and Biden 15 cents, meaning the price to bet on Harris has closed from 37 cents to six cents over the last week.

On July 24, 2024, during his fourth historic speech at a joint session of the U.S. Congress, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu exposed the Islamic regime of Iran as the greatest threat to civilization – an existential danger that the Obama and Biden-Harris administrations have not only ignored but also enabled, making the regime even more dangerous. 
The most significant point of Netanyahu’s speech was his candid labeling of the mullahs’ regime for what it truly is: ""We meet today at a crossroads of history. Our world is in upheaval. In the Middle East, Iran’s axis of terror confronts America, Israel, and our Arab friends. This is not a clash of civilizations. It’s a clash between barbarism and civilization.""
Iran, one of the birthplaces of human civilization, has been described by President Trump’s State Department as ""home to a proud and ancient culture whose ideals of freedom and democracy under Cyrus the Great helped form some of the foundations of the U.S. Constitution.""

However, this nation is now occupied by a small group of fanatical Islamic clerics who came to power through a Russian-backed coup in 1979 and have since become the largest state sponsor of terrorism and the headquarters of barbarism in modern history. Montesquieu clearly and rightfully described in his masterpiece, ""The Spirit of the Laws,"" how ""a flourishing"" empire of Persia, also known as Iran, was ""destroyed"" by Islam.
IRAN 'ONE TO TWO WEEKS AWAY' FROM WEAPONS-GRADE NUCLEAR MATERIAL AS US CONTINUES SANCTIONS RELIEF
Netanyahu, known as the Churchill of the Middle East, possesses the remarkable ability to simplify the most complex international problems and propose straightforward solutions. The first step is to acknowledge the problem, something almost every Democratic administration has chosen to ignore or pretend doesn't exist. This problem is the barbaric Islamic regime of Iran. 
The regime understands the weaknesses of the free world, which lie at the core of its values of freedom and democracy. They exploit these democratic values to attack the free world. For instance, using Islamic centers under the guise of ""religious tolerance"" in Western democracies to plan their terror attacks. It is encouraging to see that some of these centers, such as the Hamburg Islamic Center, which has caused damage to Europe and the Middle East for more than 70 years, are being shut down.
This regime began its journey in 1979 by torturing and killing millions of Iranian people and then exporting its bloody ideology to the Middle East and the world. It has created hundreds of terrorist organizations in the Mideast, South America and Africa, attacked Muslim and Jewish nations with thousands of missiles and drones, and orchestrated hundreds of terror attacks and plots in Europe, South America and the United States. 
Not to mention their ambition to build a nuclear bomb with the help of Russia, China and North Korea, aiming to wipe Israel off the map, blackmail Europe, and attack America. As Netanyahu reminded all U.S. representatives and senators in his speech:
HOW I WENT FROM CHANTING ‘DEATH TO AMERICA’ TO ‘GOD BLESS AMERICA’
""When Israel acts to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons that could destroy Israel and threaten every American city, every city that you come from, we’re not only protecting ourselves. We’re protecting you.""
How is it possible that all these barbaric activities have been ignored, and how can this regime still be welcomed as part of the civilized world? In the name of diplomacy, negotiations, international relations, and political correctness, the free world ignored the giant elephant in the room: the mullahs. They feel comfortable lounging on the couch of the United Nations, eating popcorn and spending billions of petrodollars they stole from the people of Iran to destroy the world.
President Trump didn't ignore them. He killed Gen. Qasem Soleimani, the world's number one terrorist organizer, tore apart the disastrous nuclear deal (JCPOA), sanctioned Iran's oil and bankrupted the regime. The policy was working until President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris took office and tried to undo all those successful measures.

It's wrong to ignore the destructive activities of a terrorist regime in the hope of bringing them to the negotiation table. Even if by some miracle this goal were achieved, it would be as foolish as playing chess with a killer monkey. The term ""useful idiots,"" which Netanyahu used to describe the anti-American and anti-Israel protesters, could be applied to all those politicians who are ignoring the extremely dangerous regime of Iran.
Western democracies must take Netanyahu’s warning seriously and understand that while you gather as civilized nations to enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness with your friends and family – watching football and baseball games, discussing politics, and gossiping around dinner tables – there are malevolent mullahs who control a very wealthy country. 
These mullahs use all their power, the nation's wealth, and the protection of international laws to plan death and destruction around the free world. Their terror plots are not aimed at Russia and China; their target is the free and democratic world. You may have seen similar scenarios in Hollywood movies and thought they were fiction, but this is our reality.

The most important allies of the United States, and Israel, in the fight against the ""axis of terror,"" are Iranian people who oppose the regime and mostly have even rejected Islam as their religion. The Iranians, as the first victims of this barbaric Islamic system, have suffered for the past 1,400 years since the Muslim conquest of Iran.

FOX_15,Harris’ favorability sees dramatic spike after Biden drops out: poll,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-favorability-sees-dramatic-spike-after-biden-drops-out-poll,2024-07-29 02:38:02.864245,politics,"Politico congressional reporter Olivia Beavers, Fox News contributor Mollie Hemingway, Fox News senior political analyst Juan Williams and Bloomberg managing editor Mario Parker discuss if VP Kamala Harris and former president Trump will debate. 
Vice President Kamala Harris has seen her favorability among American voters rise dramatically in the aftermath of President Biden dropping out of the race, a new poll shows.
Harris’ overall favorability rose from 35% to 43% compared to a week earlier, while the vice president’s unfavorability rating fell from 46% to 42%, according to the results of an ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted on Friday and Saturday.
The poll comes just a week after Biden made the decision to drop out of the 2024 race and endorse Harris, who quickly consolidated support among her fellow Democrats to essentially lock up the nomination by the middle of last week.

The news brought a jolt of enthusiasm to Democrats, who donated record-setting fundraising numbers to the Harris campaign in the aftermath of her taking over at the top of the ticket, enthusiasm that was reflected in the new poll.
Among Democrats, 88% indicated that they were enthusiastic about Harris (63% very and 25% somewhat) becoming the party’s nominee. The level of enthusiasm for Harris in her own party outstrips that of former President Trump among Republicans, with 82% of those respondents indicating that they were enthusiastic about him being the nominee.
Trump also saw his favorability rating drop in the poll, falling from 40% last week to 36% in the most recent poll. The former president’s unfavorable rating also ticked up slightly in the new poll, rising from 51% to 52%.

The poll also tackled the ongoing ""veepstakes"" for Harris, who has yet to choose a running mate. While Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg (54%) and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (54%) enjoy the highest name recognition among respondents, candidates such as Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., (22% favorable) and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (17% favorable) have the highest favorability rating among respondents who were familiar with them.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Sunday said former President Trump should swap out his ""incredibly bad choice"" of Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, as his running mate.During an appearance on CBS’s ""Face the Nation,"" Schumer was discussing the upcoming presidential election when he decided to address ""the addition of JD Vance"" to the GOP ticket.
 ""It’s an incredibly bad choice,"" Schumer said. ""I think Donald Trump, I know him, and he's probably sitting and watching the TV, and every day, Vance, it comes out Vance has done something more extreme, more weird, more erratic. Vance seems to be more erratic and more extreme than President Trump."" 
""And I'll bet President Trump is sitting there scratching his head and wondering, ‘Why did I pick this guy?’ The choice may be one of the best things he ever did for Democrats,"" Schumer said.

Referring to Trump, the former president and 2024 Republican presidential nominee, Schumer said ""the president has about 10 days – 10 days before the Ohio ballot is locked in."" 
""And he has a choice: does he keep Vance on the ticket?"" Schumer said. ""He already has a whole lot of baggage, he's probably going to be more baggage over the weeks because we'll hear more things about him, or does he pick someone new? What's his choice?"" 
The left has gone after Vance in recent days over a 2021 interview in which the Ohio senator appeared to disparage ""childless cat ladies"" in the Democratic Party.
""We are effectively run in this country, via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made, and so they wanna make the rest of the country miserable, too,"" Vance said three years ago, specifically calling out Vice President Harris and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., as being part of that group. On an episode of Fox News’ ""The Brian Kilmeade Show,"" Trump 2024 senior campaign adviser Chris LaCivita said Vance's interview is being ""blatantly taken out of context,"" adding that the Trump-Vance campaign is not against ""childless women"" as the liberal media is saying.
Vance, the author of ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" a memoir adapted into a Netflix film about his time as a Yale Law School student reflecting on growing up in Appalachia, was propelled into national headlines when Trump announced him as vice presidential running mate at the start of the Republican National Convention.

REPUBLICANS SAY SCHUMER MUST ACT ON VOTER PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP BILL IF DEMOCRAT 'REALLY CARES ABOUT DEMOCRACY'
Republicans have billed Vance, whose mother is 10 years sober, as speaking to forgotten working class Americans. 
But the Harris campaign has attempted to counter that messaging. 
In a video shared weeks ago, Harris claimed Vance would be ""loyal only to Trump, not to our country"" and a ""rubber stamp for [Trump's] extreme agenda.""
But Vance, a Marine veteran who served in Iraq, shot back during a campaign rally with Trump in Minnesota Saturday.

""Now, I saw the other day Kamala Harris questioned my loyalty to this country. That's the word she used, loyalty. And it's an interesting word. Semper Fi, because there is no greater sign of disloyalty to this country than what Kamala Harris has done at our southern border,"" Vance said. ""And I'd like to ask the vice president, what has she done to question my loyalty to this country?""
""I served in the United States Marine Corps. I went to Iraq for this country. I built a business for this country. And my running mate took a bullet for this country. So my question to Kamala Harris is, what the hell have you done to question our loyalty to the United States of America?"" Vance added. ""And the answer, my friends, is nothing."" Asked about how Harris should handle Republican criticism of her immigration policy, Schumer told CBS host Robert Costa that Democrats in Congress and the Biden-Harris administration ""put together the toughest border policy that would have stopped the flow from the border that we've seen in a very long time.""

He said the plan was initially supported by Republicans but claimed Trump wants chaos at the border so he can run on it during the election.
""We're happy to bring that up. And case after case, when we bring that up, the voters side with us, not with their policies. We were willing to fix the border. Trump and his Republican minions said, 'Don't fix it, we want chaos for political purposes.' Who do you think's going to win the argument?"" Schumer said.

Chuck Schumer dodged multiple questions about whether he told President Biden to drop out of the race during a meeting in early July during an interview on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""
Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., dodged questions on Sunday during an interview on ""Face the Nation"" about whether he pushed President Biden to drop out of the race during a recent private meeting.
""Senator, on July 13, you went to Delaware to meet with President Biden. It was a private discussion, and I know you like to keep your discussions with the president private. But that, for history, was a very momentous meeting in the sense that you were the Senate Democratic leader, the majority leader, meeting with the president to discuss the presidential race. For history, for the record, did you in any way suggest to the president that he should leave the presidential race on July 13?"" CBS' Robert Costa asked. 
Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, 2024, and immediately endorsed Vice President Harris to take his spot at the top of the ticket. 
""Well, first, let’s look at President Biden’s record. He’s had one of the most amazing presidencies we’ve had in decades, passing so many good things. The infrastructure bill, the IRA bill, getting the price of prescription drugs down for the first time, going against the NRA successfully, helping our veterans with burn pits. So he’s had an amazingly successful record, and he’s always done what’s right for America and I respect him. I respect his patriotism. I respect the amazing things we worked together on many of them,"" Schumer responded.

CNN_1,"Trump, who once trashed bitcoin as ‘based on thin air,’ addresses crypto’s largest convention",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/politics/donald-trump-bitcoin-cryptocurrency/index.html,2024-07-28 08:30:00,politics,"
            For a time, Donald Trump would have made for an unlikely headliner at a cryptocurrency confab.
    

            As president, Trump declared bitcoin “not money” and criticized it as “highly volatile and based on thin air.” He cautioned that crypto assets helped facilitate illegal underground markets.
    

            “We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever,” Trump wrote on Twitter in 2019. “It is called the United States Dollar!”
    

            But on Saturday, Trump addressed the cryptocurrency industry’s largest annual gathering here in Nashville not as a cynic but as one of its best-known supporters – the culmination of a total reversal on the issue during the former president’s latest White House bid.
    

            Despite cryptocurrency’s troubling recent history and his own past reservations, Trump has fully embraced the hype and hopes of the nascent industry. His campaign now accepts bitcoin donations – and has collected about $4 million worth, a source with knowledge of his fundraising said. He has attacked the Biden administration’s efforts to regulate the industry as a “war on crypto” without acknowledging the massive fraud schemes that have shattered public confidence in digital currencies. And he has vowed as president to make it easier for cryptocurrency mining companies to operate in the United States.

            “Otherwise, the other countries are going to have it,” Trump said earlier this month in Wisconsin.
    

            The industry, in turn, has embraced Trump. Its leaders and investors have donated millions of dollars to his campaign and aligned political committees. They are cheerleaders for his candidacy to their sizable online audiences and provided him a platform Saturday to speak directly to the anticipated 20,000 of attendees at this year’s Bitcoin Conference.
    

            “A lot of these people consider themselves single-issue voters,” said tech writer Jacob Silverman, author of the best-selling book “Easy Money: Cryptocurrency, Casino Capitalism, and the Golden Age of Fraud.” “If Trump or anyone else says they’re pro-bitcoin, that matters to them.”
    

            Trump made several cryptocurrency-friendly policy commitments Saturday, including pledging to fire Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler and to create a “strategic national bitcoin stockpile,” all part of his campaign promise to encourage the growth of the industry in the US.
    

            “If crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted and made in the USA,” Trump said at the convention, ahead of a more traditional campaign event in St. Cloud, Minnesota, later in the day.
    

            Since Trump voiced his opposition to bitcoin in 2019, the volatile industry has only faced more turbulence, most notably the arrest, trial and imprisonment of Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Once the face of a company that counted comedian Larry David and superstar quarterback Tom Brady among its celebrity endorsers, Bankman-Fried was sentenced in March to 25 years in prison for running a multibillion-dollar fraud scheme through his companies.
    

            Trump’s campaign would not say what sparked the former president’s 180-degree turn on bitcoin. Nor has Trump addressed one of the central criticisms of digital currencies: a lack of a practical, real-world use for it besides being a highly speculative investment.
    

            Trump campaign spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement to CNN that “crypto innovators and others in the technology sector are under attack” from Democrats, while the former president was “ready to encourage American leadership in this and other emerging technologies.”
    

            Republican allies have joined Trump in his pivot toward bitcoin. Speaking at the conference on Friday, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott argued that the former president understands attendees’ concerns about financial freedom – a common refrain in the crypto community.
    

            “We want people, whether they love their dollars or they love their digital assets, we want them in charge of making their decisions,” Scott said.
    

            Leaders in the industry have courted Trump for months and have been educating his campaign on their policy agenda and the opportunity to sway voters on the topic, David Bailey, the CEO of bitcoin-focused media company BTC Inc, said in a recent interview.

            Their pitch, Bailey acknowledged, included “the amount of industry backing he can get” by embracing cryptocurrency. Their conversations included a meeting earlier this summer with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.
    

            “Everything rapidly accelerated at that point,” said Bailey, whose company hosts the annual conference where Trump spoke Saturday.
    

            Indeed, support for Trump quickly followed. Billionaire crypto tycoons Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss each pledged to donate $1 million worth of bitcoin to Trump’s campaign. The Federal Election Commission has allowed political committees to receive bitcoin as contributions since 2014, the value of which is determined by the price at the time the contribution is received.
    

            Cryptocurrency was also a topic of discussion during a recent fundraising blitz through Silicon Valley that Trump’s new running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, helped arrange. Billionaire tech entrepreneur David Sacks, a prominent champion of cryptocurrency, hosted one of the fundraisers at his home.
    

            “One of the things I think we heard a lot at that dinner was just the difficulty that people in business were having under this Biden administration,” Sacks said in a recent episode of the “All-In Podcast,” which he co-hosts. “You got the crypto guys who just want a framework. They just want the government to tell them how to operate, and they can’t get that.”
    

            Leaders and champions of the industry have become increasingly political, helping to bankroll super PACs that have overwhelmingly supported Republicans over Democrats.
    

            “It’s time for the crypto army to send a message to Washington,” Tyler Winklevoss wrote in a lengthy social media post endorsing Trump. “That attacking us is political suicide.”
    

            Eric Soufer, a political adviser to major crypto companies, said people committed to cryptocurrencies who were pushed out of power after the Bankman-Fried episode are “looking for political validation after years in the wilderness.”
    

            “They believe now is their moment, and it’s hard to resist someone who is telling them everything they want to hear,” Soufer said.
    

            The cryptocurrency industry has experienced a resurgence since the downfall of FTX. After cratering in 2022, the price of bitcoin has recovered and reached an all-time high in June. Enthusiasm around this year’s Nashville event was palpable inside the Music City Center. Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also addressed the conference Friday.

            Still, many Americans have expressed concern about cryptocurrency even as more people become aware of it. A 2023 Pew Research survey found nearly 9 in 10 adults had heard of cryptocurrencies, and 75% of those people didn’t believe it was safe or reliable.
    

            But Trump’s courtship of crypto voters is in line with other efforts to find new support in unconventional places. Earlier this year, Trump reached out to Libertarian Party members at their annual convention, where he promised to “support the right to self-custody to the nation’s 50 million crypto holders.” There’s considerable overlap between Libertarians and the crypto community.
    

            Trump supporters were not hard to find inside the Bitcoin Conference. John Fischer, a 61-year-old from Atlanta, has personally invested in cryptocurrency since 2021. He voted for Trump in 2020 and plans to again.
    

            Still, he was clear-eyed about Trump’s attempts to court conference attendees.
    

            “Every politician is going to be pro-something if they’re going to get votes,” Fischer said.
    

            Luke Broyles, a 25-year-old Michigander working in the crypto industry, was similarly unsure of Trump’s latest entreaties despite his recent rhetoric.
    

            “I think there is a good bit of skepticism that bitcoin people have,” Broyles said. “I think that’s reasonable. Ultimately, people are in bitcoin because they don’t trust politicians.”

            US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will hold a trilateral meeting with his Japanese and South Korean counterparts in Tokyo on Sunday local time, the first of its kind in 15 years, a senior US defense official said.
    

            The trilateral meeting came nearly one year after President Joe Biden held the first stand-alone summit with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol at Camp David in August 2023. Following the summit, Kishida announced that annual recurring summits will be held among several of the nations’ highest officials, including the ministers of foreign affairs, defense, and national security advisers, along with the financial, industry, and commerce ministers.
    

            “We’ve made enormous progress, trilateral since the Camp David summit, with early warning missile data sharing real time with a trilateral exercise plan,” the US senior defense official said.
    

            According to the defense official, Secretary Austin is expected to announce the US intends to reconstitute US Forces Japan (USF-J) as a joint force headquarters to serve as a counterpart to Japan’s Joint Operations Command (J-JOC). Details of this implementation will be figured out in working groups led by US Indo-Pacific Command. There is no intention to integrate Japanese forces into the US commands, according to the official.
    

            “The intent here is for USF-J to become a standalone three-star joint force headquarters. Eventually separate and apart from 5th Air Force,” the official said.
    

            “We view this as a historic announcement among the strongest improvements to our military ties in 70 years. Bottom line is that this is a transformative change. And that’s because when this transition is complete, USF-J will have a direct leadership role in planning and leading US forces in both peace time and potential crises. And they’ll be doing that side by side with Japanese forces like never before.”

California’s largest wildfire of the year has burned an area larger than the size of the city of Los Angeles, destroyed dozens of buildings and forced thousands of residents to flee their homes as wildfires wreak havoc in the Western United States. Meanwhile, homes and businesses in a popular Canadian resort town were incinerated as a wildfire continued to roar through the area. Here’s the latest:


            • California’s Park Fire now state’s 7th largest: Even with Saturday’s weather working in favor of firefighters, the massive Park Fire continued to devour huge amounts of land in parts of Butte and Tehama counties, north of Sacramento, California. The blaze has grown to more than 350,000 acres, or 546 square miles, according to Cal Fire, making it the seventh-largest wildfire in recorded state history. Containment for the fire, which is now bigger than the city of Los Angeles, is now at 10%.
    

            • California governor declares state of emergency: Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for both counties Friday. The state also secured a federal grant to ensure there are enough resources to fight the blaze.
    

            • A man is accused of igniting Park Fire: Ronnie Dean Stout II, 42, was arrested on suspicion of pushing a burning car 60 feet into a gully, “spreading flames that caused the Park Fire,” authorities said. The DA says the man was seen “calmly leaving the area by blending in with the other citizens who were in the area and fleeing the rapidly evolving fire.” Stout, who has not retained an attorney, will likely face an arson charge, the DA’s office told CNN.
    

            • Pilot dies while fighting Oregon fire: A firefighting pilot was found dead in a single-engine air tanker on Friday after going missing the night before while working in the vicinity of the 141,000-acre (221 square miles) Falls Fire burning in the Malheur National Forest, according to officials. The fire, which was 57% contained as of Saturday afternoon, is among a number of large wildfires burning across Oregon. The largest active wildfire in the state is the Durkee Fire, which has scorched about 451 square miles and was 27% contained as of Saturday morning.
    

            • Fire wipes out many of a Canadian town’s buildings: Flames are still out of control in the Canadian Rockies largest national park, according to the Jasper National Park Facebook page. The fire complex sent thousands of visitors, season workers and residents fleeing the municipality of Jasper in Alberta, where flames devastated an estimated 30% of the town’s structures. “Recent fire activity has been low,” officials said Saturday midday. “Today will see a return to slightly warmer and drier weather. Some areas, which did not receive rain, may see an increase in fire behaviour in the coming days.”
    

            • 102 large wildfires burning nationwide: Triple-digit heat and dry conditions across the West this week have made conditions poor for firefighters actively fighting to contain more than 100 large wildfires burning nationwide, including 37 in Oregon and 14 in California. “Smoke from wildfires will continue to plague parts of the West (NorCal eastward/ northeastward into Montana), resulting in poor air quality and areas of reduced visibility. Affected residents are urged to stay indoors if possible with windows and doors closed,” the National Weather Service said. 


            The Park Fire, which began Wednesday in the Chico area, has forced thousands of people to evacuate in Butte County, where the state’s deadliest wildfire, the Camp Fire, killed more than 85 people and destroyed thousands of homes in 2018.
    

            A heavy plume of smoke once again looms over the county as crews battle thick flames that are torching everything in their path. The Park Fire has left graveyards of burned cars and charred, hallowed out structures, video from the Chico area shows.
    

            For Butte County residents, the advancing flames bring with them painful memories of the losses they endured from the Camp Fire six years ago.
    

            One evacuee, Tim Ferguson, told CNN affiliate KOVR he had lost his father in the Camp Fire, and it’s painful thinking about having to experience more loss this time around.
    

            “We’ve got our home, and we’ve been working on it a lot lately, fixing it up, and it’s just we’re at the verge of maybe losing all that,” Ferguson said.
    

            Lauri Schwein, who lost her home in the Camp Fire, told CNN affiliate KCRA she’s on high alert. “I’m packing up, my dog, my cat,” she said. “All I can do is wait and watch.”
    

            In the town of Paradise, the smoke is enough to bring back the horrors the Camp Fire unleashed when it incinerated much of the town.
    

            “It was very impactful, every once in a while we smell smoke or see smoke like that, it does trigger us. It triggers the people here in Paradise. When you go through trauma, that’s what happens,” Ron Lassonde, the mayor of Paradise, told KCRA.
    

            Paradise is under an evacuation warning, according to the town web site. “An EVACUATION WARNING means prepare to evacuate and await additional instructions, under a warning those who need additional time to evacuate should begin evacuating now,” officials cautioned.
    

            The Park Fire is burning just three weeks after the Thomspon Fire in Butte County burned more than 3,700 acres, forced people from their homes, and destroyed more than two dozen structures, including houses.
    

            Local officials cautioned it would take some time before people would be allowed back in their homes.
    

            “We are no strangers to evacuations in Butte County,” said Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea at a news conference Friday. “We are constantly looking for the earliest opportunity to get people back in.”
    

            The North Valley Animal Disaster Group has rescued 88 animals from the blaze as its members dealt with losses of their own. In 2018, the group managed to shelter over 4,000 animals during the Camp Fire.
    

            “When you’ve been through a big fire and you’ve lost everything, sometimes the only thing you have left to give is to go help the animals,” Vice President Norm Rosene told CNN.
    

            Triple-digit temperatures and high wind gusts have fueled the explosive growth of the Park Fire amid an active fire season in California. An estimated 626,600 acres have burned across the state so far in 2024, compared to 25,254 acres burned by this time last year, according to Cal Fire.
    

            “It’s been nothing but challenging,” Cal Fire Captain Dan Collins told CNN. “If we see fires behave like this in July, they may behave even more radically come the fall when the fields are even drier.”
    

            In Jasper, a popular tourist town in Alberta, 25,000 residents and visitors were forced to evacuate from a fast-moving blaze that has destroyed 30% of the town’s structures, officials said.
    

            Two wildfires converged in the Jasper National Park area, becoming what authorities are referring to as the Jasper Wildfire Complex. It remains difficult to measure exactly how big the complex – which also includes a third nearby fire – is due to extreme fire behavior and thick smoke cover. Together, the fires have swallowed an estimated 89,000 acres, the Jasper National Park said.
    

            An evacuation order remains in effect for Jasper and Jasper National Park, with the vast majority of evacuees being visitors, officials said. Along with about 4,100 residents – and thousands of seasonal workers – who live in the town, 2.48 million people visited Jasper National Park last year.
    

            Out of a total of 1,113 structures in the town, 358 have been destroyed, according to a Facebook post from Jasper National Park. The fire is about 32,000 hectares or 790,000 acres.
    

            The owner of Maligne Lodge in Jasper told CNN news partner CTV News that she was shocked when she saw a photo of the 98-room hotel up in flames. It had been in the family since 1961 after her father purchased the property, and she had been working there since she was a child.
    

            “As soon as we’re given the go-ahead, we’ll be in there rebuilding our hotel,” Karyn Decore said.
    

            Jasper Mayor Richard Ireland lost the home that his family had moved into around his second birthday, according to CTV News.
    

            On a tour of the wreckage in Jasper, Ireland said that the loss of his home of 67 years “is shattering.”
    

            “Now it’s memories of family and fire,” Ireland told CNN news partner CBC. “So many others are going to go through this same thing.”
    

            But he said “when I stood back and looked, and saw what remains, I know that the community is still there.”

CNN_5,One of the biggest cartel busts in recent memory began with an act of betrayal,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/us/el-mayo-sinaloa-cartel-mexico-enterprise/index.html,2024-07-28 09:20:00,us,"
            How did an alleged cartel kingpin who evaded capture for more than half a century end up in the hands of US federal agents?
    

            According to officials, it started with an act of betrayal.
    

            Details are still emerging about what led last week to one of the most significant and stunning cartel busts in recent memory.
    

            US officials who’ve spoken with CNN say a key player in the operation to arrest Sinaloa cartel co-founder Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada was another major cartel figure who was arrested beside him.
    

            Joaquín Guzmán López, one of the sons of convicted cartel boss Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, duped Zambada and orchestrated their arrest, officials told CNN.
    

            Zambada, 76, thought he and Guzmán López were flying to northern Mexico to look at real estate, officials said. But instead, their small private plane landed north of the border near El Paso, Texas, where US authorities were waiting on the tarmac.
    

            But how was Guzmán López able to pull off the act of deception officials have described? And why did he turn on Zambada?
    

            So far, we haven’t heard either man’s account of what happened. Zambada pleaded not guilty to all charges in his first federal court appearance Friday.
    

            “Typically, I do not comment on my criminal cases. However, I will say that my client did not come to the U.S. voluntarily,” his attorney, Frank Perez, told CNN.
    

            Guzmán López, 38, is expected to appear in federal court Tuesday in Chicago, his attorney, Jeffrey Lichtman, told CNN.
    

            Lichtman said in an email that he’d appear in court with Guzmán López and added, “I’m looking forward to seeing Joaquin and working on the case with him.” He declined further comment.
    

            One cartel expert told CNN he’s dubious of some details officials have shared.
    

            “It would not surprise me at all if the story changes from today to tomorrow, or next week,” said InSight Crime’s Steven Dudley, who’s spent more than a decade investigating drug trafficking and organized crime.
    

            And as reporters pressed for answers in a contentious press conference Friday, Mexico’s president suggested he, too, has many questions about what occurred.
    

            “The government of the United States has to give a complete report. It can’t be just general statements,” President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said. “There has to be transparency.”
    

            This much is clear: The arrests of Zambada and Guzmán López mark a major development in decades-long efforts to capture and prosecute alleged cartel bosses. And the details revealed so far about what led to this dramatic moment offer a telling glimpse into the inner workings of what authorities describe as one of the world’s most notorious and nefarious criminal enterprises.
    

            It wasn’t the first time authorities had Zambada in their sights.
    

            In a 2010 interview with the Mexican magazine Proceso, Zambada said Mexico’s military had come close to capturing him at least four times before.
    

            “I fled through the highlands, where I know the branches, the streams, the rocks, everything. They catch me if I am still or if I am careless, like El Chapo,” he said.
    

            At the time, Zambada told Proceso that fear about being captured weighed on him constantly.
    

            “I’m terrified that they’ll lock me up,” he said.
    

            That 2010 interview was one of his last known public appearances for the notably lower-profile Zambada. His name surged into international headlines in 2018 and 2019 during the high-profile trial of Guzmán, whose lawyer argued that Zambada was the cartel’s true leader.
    

            Lichtman, the defense attorney, also represented the elder Guzmán and alleged at the time that Zambada had bribed the Mexican government to frame El Chapo and remain free to run the cartel.
    

            In 2021, US authorities raised the reward for information leading to Zambada’s arrest to $15 million.
    

            Over the years, Zambada’s storied ability to evade capture was referenced in narcocorrido ballads about him. The 2022 corrido “Señor Zambada,” performed by El Fantasma and Enigma Norteño from Zambada’s perspective, includes the lines: “I know very well that they want to catch me, that the government wanted to lock me up. But they are going to keep wanting that, because no matter how much they look, they are not going to find me.”
    

            His elusive reputation also caught the attention of his enemies, former Drug Enforcement Administration agent Mike Vigil told CNN.
    

            “Mayo Zambada, prior to (Thursday) and over 50 years of involvement in the drug trade had never been captured, never served any time,” Vigil said, “so he is highly respected even by his rivals.”
    

            Dudley of InSight Crime pointed to this aspect of Zambada’s past when he told CNN en Español he was skeptical of accounts that painted the Sinaloa cartel leader as an unwitting victim who was tricked into being captured.
    

            “I’m not 100% convinced that’s what happened. I see in El Mayo Zambada a person who’s older. He’s 76. I see a person who’s also experienced, a person who knows exactly when and from where any deception is coming,” Dudley said. “That’s why he’s never stepped foot in a jail until yesterday. So I have my doubts. That is to say, I think that we’re still missing information.”
    

            Officials who spoke with CNN said Zambada boarded a plane with Guzmán López Thursday thinking they’d be inspecting property together near the border. Zambada didn’t realize US investigators had exploited a rift in the Sinaloa cartel, one official said, and that Guzmán López was in fact helping with Zambada’s capture.
    

            A long-simmering power struggle between Zambada and El Chapo’s sons, also known as the Chapitos, was about to boil over.
    

            Agents from Homeland Security Investigations, which led the operation, were skeptical at first when Guzmán López made the offer, an official familiar with the operation told CNN.
    

            But as the plane they were flying in landed at the Santa Teresa airport near El Paso, Texas, on Thursday, federal agents were waiting.
    

            One worker at the airport told Reuters that he saw a Beechcraft King Air land Thursday afternoon on the runway, where federal agents were already waiting.
    

            “Two individuals got off the plane… and were calmly taken into custody,” said the man, who declined to share his name out of concern for his safety.
    

            “It seemed like a pretty calm, arranged thing,” he added.
    

            The entire operation, one source told CNN, went off surprisingly smoothly given the gravity of the arrests and the disruption it could cause to drug trafficking from Mexico.

What we know about the Sinaloa cartel and its leaders


            Now that Zambada and Guzmán López are in US custody, authorities are ready to make the case against them.
    

            Both Zambada and Guzmán López face charges in the US for allegedly leading the cartel’s criminal operations, including its “deadly fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking networks,” US Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement after the arrests.
    

            Top US officials trumpeted the arrests as a major victory. But some analysts were more measured in their assessment of the potential impact.
    

            “It’s a historic capture, of course, and symbolic. But is it going to create a collateral effect or have an impact on drug trafficking? I really doubt that,” Dudley said. “As much because El Mayo had pulled back already from the day-to-day operations, and the world of drug trafficking is really now a different world from when he started. It’s much more decentralized. It’s much more like a franchise. There are contractors, subcontractors, other contractors. There are many parts that can be easily replaced.”
    

            Speculating on what could happen next, Mexico’s president pointed to Zambada’s own words in the 2010 Proceso interview. If he were captured or killed, Zambada said that effectively nothing would happen. In the world of drug trafficking, he said, whether capos are “locked up, dead, or extradited, their replacements are already out there.”
    

            Experts say there’s little doubt that these arrests, like past high-profile kingpin takedowns, will spur a new wave of violence as rival groups vie for territory and power.
    

            And no matter what new details emerge about how they happened, the surprising and dramatic arrests won’t soon be forgotten.

CNN_6,The US says it has successfully practiced using a low-cost bomb to sink a major surface ship. China is taking note,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/asia/rimpac-air-force-b2-bomber-low-cost-bomb-sinking-exercise-intl-hnk-ml/index.html,2024-07-28 09:14:00,world,"
            A very specialized part of the world’s largest naval drills off the northern Hawaiian island of Kauai is gaining attention on both sides of the Pacific.
    

            Earlier this month, the US and allies practiced taking out a large surface ship with long-range weapons, including, for the first time, a US Air Force B-2 bomber.
    

            In one test that analysts called “very significant” in what it could mean for the calculus of any future, hypothetical conflict between the US and China, a B-2 stealth bomber hit a decommissioned amphibious assault ship with an inexpensive guided bomb.
    

            The test of the weapon, dubbed QUICKSINK by the US Air Force, occurred on July 19, when a B-2 participated in the sinking of the ex-USS Tarawa, a retired 820-foot-long, 39,000-ton amphibious assault ship, a vessel the size of a small aircraft carrier.
    

            It showed the US military can use one of its most survivable weapons platforms, the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, to sink a major surface ship with a low-cost guided bomb.
    

            “This capability is an answer to an urgent need to quickly neutralize maritime threats over massive expanses of ocean around the world at minimal costs,” said a press release from the US Navy’s 3rd Fleet, which led Rim of the Pacific 2024 (RIMPAC), the exercise that included the sinking of the ex-Tarawa.
    

            The B-2 bomber is the US military’s most sophisticated aircraft. The Air Force says its stealthy characteristics allow it to penetrate heavily defended areas and also fly with a small chance of being detected by radar at high altitudes. That gives the B-2’s sensors the ability to get a view of the battlefield not possible in lower-flying planes.
    

            Mating it up with relatively cheap and demonstrably effective precision-guided bombs with warheads of up to 2,000 pounds could give the Air Force bombers the “anti-ship lethality” of a submarine-launched torpedo without the liabilities of a submarine, according to a US Air Force website.
    

            “A Navy submarine has the ability to launch and destroy a ship with a single torpedo at any time, but by launching that weapon, it gives away its location and becomes a target,” the Air Force Research Lab says.
    

            QUICKSINK could provide “a low-cost method of achieving torpedo-like seaworthy kills from the air at a much higher pace and over a much larger area than covered by a lumbering submarine,” it says.
    

            The Air Force first tested QUICKSINK in 2022, when an F-15 fighter jet released a GBU-31 Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) that destroyed a full-scale surface target in the Gulf of Mexico, according to an Air Force statement.
    

            Analysts say QUICKSINK launched from a B-2 would give China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) much to consider in the event of any possible conflict in the western Pacific, including around hotspots like Taiwan, the Philippines and the southern islands of Japan.
    

            “It is very significant,” said Carl Schuster, former head of the US Pacific Command Joint Intelligence Center.
    

            “The B-2’s demonstrated anti-maritime capability will constrain if not deter PLAN operations east of Taiwan or off the Philippines.
    

            “You cannot ignore a weapon that can sink a 25,000-plus-ton ship with one hit,” Schuster added.
    

            In any conflict close to its home shores, China, on paper, holds distinct advantages.
    

            It has thousands of missiles on the Chinese mainland, the world’s largest navy to dominate nearby seas and the ability to provide air cover to those ships from land-based aircraft.
    

            But the B-2, and other systems tested at RIMPAC, could negate some of China’s advantages with long-range fire, analysts said.
    

            “It extends the range at which potential enemies can be held at risk through advanced weapons whilst retaining a considerable degree of stealth. It basically says, you are not safe no matter where you are in this vast theater,” said Alessio Patalano, professor of war and strategy at King’s College in London.
    

            Long-range missiles were also fired from aircraft and ships during RIMPAC.
    

            A US Navy F/A-18 also hit the ex-Tarawa with a Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRSAM), “a precise, stealthy, and survivable cruise missile,” the Navy’s 3rd Fleet press release said.
    

            This missile can hit targets up to 230 miles (370 kilometers) away with a 1,000-pound warhead while navigating semi-autonomously to its target.
    

            And the Royal Australian Navy destroyer HMAS Sydney struck the ex-Tarawa with a Naval Strike Missile (NSM), an achievement Vice Adm. Mark Hammond, Australia’s chief of navy, said “represents a significant increase in the lethality of our surface fleet.”
    

            “Multi-domain strike capabilities including Naval Strike Missile are foundational to deterring any potential adversary’s attempts to project power against Australia,” he said.
    

            The Naval Strike Missile, developed by Norwegian defense company Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace, can challenge an adversary’s defenses by flying at sea-skimming altitudes and making evasive maneuvers in flight at a range of 115 miles (185 kilometers).
    

            A US Navy destroyer, USS Fitzgerald, also tested a Naval Strike Missile during RIMPAC, and the weapon has previously been fired from a US littoral combat ship and land-based versions have been successfully tested by the US Marine Corps.
    

            The ex-Tarawa was one of two surface vessels sunk during RIMPAC. On July 11, the ex-USS Dubuque, a 17,000-ton amphibious transport dock was sent to the bottom of the Pacific, also off Kauai.
    

            Besides the US and Australian units, forces from South Korea, Malaysia and the Netherlands participated in ship-sinking exercises.
    

            “Sinking exercises give us a chance to sharpen our skills, learn from one another, and get real-world experience,” US Navy Vice Adm. John Wade, RIMPAC 2024 Combined Task Force commander, said in a statement.
    

            “Using advanced weapons and seeing the professionalism of our teams during these drills shows our commitment to keeping the Indo-Pacific region safe and open.”
    

            John Bradford, a Council on Foreign Relations International Affairs fellow, said the RIMPAC tests show what kind of conflict the US is preparing for in the region.
    

            “We can fully expect a major power naval conflict in the Pacific to be predominantly a fight of long-range weapons,” Bradford said.
    

            “The US is investing in readiness for this sort of combat,” he said.
    

            China was taking note of the RIMPAC plans even before the ship-sinking exercises took place.
    

            A commentary in the state-run Global Times on June 27, the day RIMPAC began, said, “the only country deemed as ‘enemy’ by the US that operates a 40,000-ton amphibious assault ship in the Asia-Pacific region is China.”
    

            The PLA Navy has three Type 075 amphibious assault ships, which displace around 36,000 tons, in service with a fourth being readied. A bigger successor, the Type 076, is also under construction.
    

            Global Times has previously cited Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, as saying the Type 075s could be called into action in the Taiwan Strait or South China Sea if the situation dictated it.
    

            “The choice of the USS Tarawa as the sinking target reflects the concern of the US and its allies about the development and strength of China’s maritime power, especially regarding the mainland’s military deterrence on the Taiwan island,” the Global Times commentary said.
    

            But it said sinking the ex-Tarawa, which was commissioned in 1976, had little relevance in 2024.
    

            “Such an outdated ship cannot be compared with modern military equipment,” Global Times said.

CNN_7,"Container of hazardous materials catches fire, closing crucial highway connecting Los Angeles and Las Vegas for over 30 hours",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/us/interstate-15-california-las-vegas-hazmat-fire/index.html,2024-07-28 10:50:00,us,"
            A stretch of the major highway between California and Las Vegas has been closed for more than 30 hours after a tractor trailer carrying hazardous materials overturned and caught on fire.
    

            Officials say a section of the essential highway will remain closed for an “unknown duration” as crews monitor the air for any potential dangerous chemicals and try to move the massive trailer.
    

            The truck lost control and overturned onto Interstate 15 near Barstow, California, around 6 a.m. Friday, according to the California Highway Patrol. The truck was carrying a flatbed trailer containing lithium-ion batteries that detached from the truck and eventually caught on fire.
    

            “Due to the lithium-ion, water cannot be added to the fire, the batteries must burn out on their own,” the patrol said.
    

            Both northbound and southbound lanes were initially closed due to the potential hazardous situation, but southbound lanes later reopened and northbound lanes remained closed as of Saturday evening.
    

            Crews on scene are testing the air quality and will reopen the rest of the lanes when they deem it safe to do so, officials said.
    

            “The primary concern is the air quality due to the hazardous materials and chemicals involved,” San Bernardino County Fire said. “Air monitoring is assessing for hydrogen cyanide, chlorine, and sulfur dioxide. These chemicals pose significant health risks at elevated levels, with hydrogen cyanide and chlorine being particularly dangerous even at low concentrations.”
    

            Many attempts have been made to remove the 75,000-pound container carrying the hazardous material from the highway, but those efforts have been unsuccessful due to its weight, according to San Bernardino County Fire.
    

            Charles Gallagher was one of the many drivers that got caught in traffic on the highway and called the situation a “complete mess.” Gallagher, who was headed home to Las Vegas, told CNN that what should have been a four-hour-drive home instead took 11 hours.
    

            Gallagher and his family left Los Angeles at 3:30 p.m. Friday and ran into traffic in Barstow around 6 p.m., when they were rerouted to Interstate 40.
    

            Eventually, after realizing traffic wasn’t going to move any time soon, the family turned around and stayed the night in Barstow. When they left early Saturday morning, they decided to take I-40 as I-15 was still closed.
    

            “There were times that we were at a standstill for 45 minutes or more,” he said. “Many of us would get out to stretch.”
    

            They were stuck on I-40 for seven hours before getting on Route 66 and eventually making it home to Las Vegas on Saturday afternoon, Gallagher said.
    

            The family had stocked up on water bottles that they placed in an insulated bag and had a tank full of gas. Whenever they stopped, they put the sun shade over the front window to help keep cool inside, Gallagher added.
    

            With temperatures well over 100 degrees in the area, fire officials handed out water to some of the stranded drivers.
    

            “Emergency crews are currently on scene monitoring the hazmat releases as well as air quality levels,” California Highway Patrol said Saturday evening. “Once hazmat personnel have deemed the area safe, reopening of the northbound lanes will be discussed, with the goal of opening all lanes as soon as possible.”

CNN_8,"Children and teens among 12 dead in Golan Heights attack that Israel blames on Hezbollah, raising fears of major escalation",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/lebanon-israel-golan-strikes-intl-latam/index.html,2024-07-28 10:13:00,world,"
            At least 12 people, including children, were killed when multiple rockets hit a village in Israeli-controlled Golan Heights Saturday, Israeli officials said, in an attack that has raised fears of a major escalation in the long-running conflict.
    

            Israel said it had identified “approximately 30 projectiles” crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory in a barrage it blamed on the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and described as the deadliest against it since October 7. Hezbollah has said it “firmly denies” firing the rockets.
    

            The attack risks significantly escalating the situation at the countries’ border, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office vowing Hezbollah will “pay a heavy price.” Israel and Hezbollah have been trading fire across the demarcation line for almost 10 months with increasing ferocity and even before Saturday’s attack regional leaders had been warning the conflict is reaching a boiling point.
    

            In addition to the 12 deaths, at least 29 people were injured in the attack in Majdal Shams, a village that is home to a large Druze community.
    

            Some 20,000 Druze Arabs live in the Golan Heights, an area Israel seized from Syria in 1967 during the Six-Day War and annexed in 1981. Considered occupied territory under international law and UN Security Council resolutions, the area is home to about 50,000 Israeli Jewish settlers and Druze. Most Druze there identify as Syrian and have rejected offers of Israeli citizenship.

            Among the sites hit in the attack was a soccer field where children and teenagers had been playing, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari said. He described the barrage as “the deadliest attack on Israeli civilians since October 7.”
    

            “This is a very serious incident and we will act accordingly,” he said.
    

            Hagari said the rocket that hit the soccer field was a “Falaq 1 Iranian rocket carrying a 50kg warhead.” “This is a model that is owned exclusively by Hezbollah, and tonight it caused the deaths of 12 young boys and girls,” he added.
    

            Netanyahu announced he was cutting short by several hours his visit to the United States and returning to Israel because of the attack and said he would convene a security cabinet meeting immediately upon his return.
    

            The prime minister said he was “shocked” by the attack. “I can say that the State of Israel will not be silent about this. We will not put this off the agenda,” he said.
    

            In a separate statement earlier, Netanyahu’s office said the prime minister “made it clear” that “Hezbollah will pay a heavy price for (the attack) that it has not paid so far.”
    

            The Government Press Office said Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant was conducting a situation assessment together with the IDF Chief of the General Staff and senior defense officials.
    

            Speaking later on Saturday, Gallant said Israel will hit back at the enemy “harshly.”
    

            Adeeb Safadi, a resident of Majdal Shams, told CNN that those killed in the rocket attack on the soccer field were all Druze children from local villages, boys between the ages of eight and 15.
    

            “They were attending a football training class with a coach whose fate is still unknown. Ten of the killed have been identified, but there are more who were torn apart and are still unidentified,” said Safadi, who lives some 600 meters from the site of the attack.
    

            Another eyewitness, Taymor Wili, who lives near the soccer field, told CNN he saw the strike on the field seconds after he heard the air raid signal.
    

            “It’s Saturday, it’s summer, kids are playing, and we kind of got used to the situation, because it’s been going on for a while… nothing like this ever happened before,” he said, adding that there hadn’t been enough time for the children to react to the warning alarm.
    

            “We tried to help, but it was beyond our help, there was nothing we could do,” he said of the situation on the field. “It’s a dark day for our town … this day will be remembered for generations to come.”

            Evacuation helicopters, ambulances and intensive care vehicles have been dispatched to the scene.
    

            Israel’s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service reported that the fatalities included “teenagers and young adults” whose ages ranged from 10 to 20 years old. It said a further 29 people were injured, six of whom were in a serious condition.
    

            Idan Avshalom, a senior medic from MDA, said the team saw destruction and fire when arriving at the scene.
    

            “Injured people were lying on the grass and the sights were dire. We immediately began triaging the injured, some of the injured were sent to local clinics and our teams were also directed to the clinics,” he said, adding that there were additional alerts as they worked to save the injured.
    

            Ziv Medical Center in the northern Israeli city of Safed said it had received 26 injured people, five of whom were admitted to the trauma center. Rambam Hospital in Haifa has also opened an information center to help people get information about their loved ones.
    

            Police are “securing the area and searching for additional remnants to eliminate any further risk to the public,” the Police Spokesperson’s Unit said.
    

            The attack on Saturday is a major escalation in what has been an extremely volatile few months in the border area.
    

            Officially, Lebanon and Israel are – and have been for decades – in a state of war, but the recent tensions have so far not escalated into a full-blown conflict.
    

            The strikes have become more frequent in recent weeks and both Hezbollah and Israel are targeting sites deeper and deeper into each other’s territory.
    

            The tensions increased further in the past few weeks when Israel killed two high-ranking Hezbollah commanders – Sami Taleb Abdullah in May and Muhammed Neamah Naser in June – blaming them for directing terror attacks both before and after Hamas’ October 7 attacks from Gaza. Hezbollah retaliated by firing hundreds of missiles into Israel.
    

            During the October attack by Hamas, at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted, according to Israeli authorities. Israeli military action in Gaza has since killed 39,258 Palestinians and injured another 90,589, according to the Ministry of Health there. As of early July, nearly 2 million people had been displaced in Gaza – almost the entire population, according to figures from the UN.
    

            It is unclear how Israel will respond to Saturday’s attack, with a number of government officials saying there would be a response.

            Israeli President Isaac Herzog decried the attack as a “terrible and shocking disaster” and vowed Israel would “firmly defend its citizens and its sovereignty.”
    

            “The world cannot continue to sit in silence in the face of (Hezbollah leader Hassan) Nasrallah’s terror attacks, which come at the behest of the empire of evil in Iran,” he said in a post on X.
    

            Israeli opposition leader Benny Gantz traveled to Majdal Shams on Saturday, calling on Netanyahu to increase the IDF presence in the area.
    

            “We have a moral obligation in the south to return the hostages home, and we have a strategic obligation to return security to the north and the people to their homes,” Gantz said.
    

            Some IDF units previously stationed along the country’s northern border have been redeployed to southern Israel following the October 7 terror attack and the subsequent Israeli ground invasion of Gaza.
    

            Speaking to CNN, former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said Lebanon and Hezbollah had “started a war with Israel” and that the only way for Israel to deter its enemies from hitting it was “to fight back and to hit them.”
    

            “The state of Lebanon, which Hezbollah is part of, has started war with Israel and we will no longer make the distinction between Lebanon and Hezbollah, which is part of Lebanon,” Naftali told CNN’s Jessica Dean in an interview on Saturday. “Hezbollah equals Lebanon, we should not make a distinction between the two.”
    

            The Lebanese government said after the attack that it condemned “all acts of violence and attacks against all civilians,” Lebanese state news agency NNA reported.
    

            The government also called for “an immediate cessation of hostilities on all fronts” and said that “targeting civilians constitutes a blatant violation of international law and is contrary to the principles of humanity,” NNA reported.
    

            While the IDF has blamed the attack on Hezbollah, the militant group denied involvement in a statement on Telegram Saturday.
    

            “The Islamic Resistance in Lebanon firmly denies the allegations made by some enemy media outlets and various media platforms regarding the targeting of Majdal Shams,” it said.
    

            “We confirm that the Islamic Resistance has no connection to the incident whatsoever and firmly denies all false claims in this regard,” the statement continued.
    

            Earlier on Saturday, Hezbollah had said it targeted an Israeli military site in a different part of the occupied Golan Heights.
    

            But the IDF said its analysis showed the rocket launched at Majdal Shams was “carried out from an area located north of the village of Chebaa in southern Lebanon.”
    

            Hagari, the IDF spokesperson, said Hezbollah was lying when denying it was behind the attack. “Our intelligence is clear – Hezbollah is responsible for killing innocent children. Ten-year-old children and once again, the brutality of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization was exposed,” he said.
    

            The White House on Saturday condemned the attack and reiterated its “iron-clad” support for Israel.
    

            “Israel continues to face severe threats to its security, as the world saw today, and the United States will continue to support efforts to end these terrible attacks along the Blue Line, which must be a top priority,” a National Security Council Spokesperson said in a written statement to CNN, referring to the demarcation line between Israel and Lebanon.
    

            EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called for an independent international investigation into the attacks and urged restraint.
    

            “Shocking images from the soccer field in the Druze town of Majdal Shams. I strongly condemn this bloodbath. We urge all parties to exercise utmost restraint and avoid further escalation,” he said in a statement posted on X.

CNN_9,California town decimated by 2018 wildfire threatened again by state’s largest this year as fires plague Oregon and Canada,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/us/park-fire-paradise-evacuation-warning-oregon-canada-wildfires/index.html,2024-07-28 12:28:00,us,"
            As the Park Fire continues to rapidly grow and threaten thousands more acres of northern California, an evacuation warning has been issued for the town of Paradise, a place where people know the horrors of a raging wildfire all too well.
    

            In 2018, the deadliest wildfire in state history, the Camp Fire, incinerated much of the town. Three years later, the Dixie Fire burned nearby. And now, residents of Paradise say the smell of smoke is already enough to traumatize them anew.

            Paradise Mayor Ron Lassonde was visibly emotional as he told CNN affiliate KCRA it was “hard to talk about” the Park Fire as it brought back memories of 2018.
    

            “Every once in a while, we smell smoke or see smoke like that, it does trigger us. It triggers the people here in Paradise. When you go through trauma, that’s what happens,” Lassonde told KCRA.
    

            Ava Elsner, who lived through the fire six years ago, told CNN she fears for her neighbors as the Park Fire – now the seventh-largest wildfire in California history – burns nearby.
    

            “I don’t want anyone else to experience this. It’s the most traumatizing, terrifying, and saddening thing to have a whole community go up in flames, and to lose all your personal items … so to see my parents go through this is just really hard,” Elsner told CNN. “I want to stay strong for them and comfort them the way that they did for me. And it’s just, it’s just difficult.”
    

            Meanwhile, wildfires are burning across the mountain west, in the US and north of the border in Canada, as firefighters deal with strong winds, low humidity and high temperatures to try to get the blazes under control.
    

            There are 86 large wildfires burning across the US, including 37 in Oregon and 14 in California, according to the Interagency Fire Center, and hundreds in Canada reported by its Fire Center. Here’s a brief rundown of some of the largest fires:

            • Park Fire – Butte and Tehama counties, California: The Park Fire has become California’s largest wildfire this year, covering more than 350,000 acres, or 546 square miles, which is bigger than Phoenix. President Joe Biden has directed his administration to do “everything” possible to support ongoing fire suppression efforts, according to a White House official. It began Wednesday in the Chico area, forcing thousands of people to evacuate.
    

            • Durkee Fire – Baker and Malheur counties in Oregon: The largest active wildfire in Oregon is the Durkee Fire, which has burned more than 288,000 acres. It started July 17 near the Oregon-Idaho state line. Amid high temperatures, extremely dry vegetation and strong winds, the fire was 49% contained as of Saturday evening, according to Oregon Wildfire Response and Recovery.
    

            • Jasper National Park Fire – Jasper, Alberta: Large sections of the largest national park in the Canadian Rockies are being consumed by “a wall of flames.” As of Saturday evening, the fire is at just under 80,000 acres, according to park officials, making it the largest wildfire in more than 100 years in Jasper National Park. Thousands of visitors and residents fled as flames devastated an estimated 30% of the town’s structures. Around 134 wildfires are burning throughout Alberta as firefighters from eastern Canada and internationally have been recruited to help with the fight, 34 of which remain out of control, officials said Saturday.
    

            A firefighting pilot was found dead in a single-engine air tanker on Friday after going missing the night before while working in the vicinity of the 221-square-mile Falls Fire burning in the Malheur National Forest, among several large wildfires burning across Oregon, according to officials.
    

            Meanwhile, the lightning-sparked Durkee Fire is the largest of the wildfires currently burning across Oregon, which has been the hardest hit by fires in recent days.
    

            Three people were injured and four homes and 19 other structures were destroyed as the fire spread, according to the Oregon Department of Emergency Management.
    

            Evacuation recommendations in Malheur County have been lifted as of Thursday afternoon. In Baker County many areas’ evacuation levels were reduced or eliminated, according to the county’s Sheriff’s Office.
    

            In Alberta, two wildfires converged in the Jasper National Park area, becoming what authorities are referring to as the Jasper Wildfire Complex. Officials say the losses are significant, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has deployed federal support to help battle the blaze.
    

            “Homes and businesses have been lost to a wildfire that people are calling a ‘wall of flames,’” Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said.
    

            In Jasper, a popular tourist town in Alberta, 25,000 residents and visitors were forced to evacuate from a fast-moving blaze, which has damaged 30% of the town’s structures, officials said during a news conference Thursday.

            It remains difficult to measure exactly how big the complex – which also includes a third nearby fire – is due to extreme fire behavior and thick smoke cover.
    

            “We will recover from this,” Smith said while holding back tears. “To those in Alberta and around the world who have experienced the magic of Jasper, the magic is not lost, and it never will be.”
    

            The owner of Maligne Lodge in Jasper told CNN news partner CTV News she was shocked when she saw a photo of the 98-room hotel up in flames. It had been in the family since 1961 after her father purchased the property, and she had been working there since she was a child.
    

            “As soon as we’re given the go-ahead, we’ll be in there rebuilding our hotel,” Karyn Decore said.
    

            Nearly 4,000 firefighters are “on the front lines, battling the blaze” of the Park Fire, according to Cal Fire.
    

            The Park Fire is burning just three weeks after the Thompson Fire in Butte County burned more than 3,700 acres, forced people from their homes, and destroyed more than two dozen structures, including houses.

            “Yes, there’s a fire back there,” Paradise Mayor Lassonde told CNN affiliate KCRA, appearing to be distressed. “Yes, people’s houses are being destroyed. Yes, we’ve got over 1,000 firefighters out there, risking their lives, to keep us safe.”
    

            One Butte County evacuee, Tim Ferguson, said he lost his father in the Camp Fire, and it’s painful thinking about having to go through the experience again, according to an interview with CNN affiliate KOVR.
    

            “We’ve got our home, and we’ve been working on it a lot lately, fixing it up, and it’s just we’re at the verge of maybe losing all that,” Ferguson said.
    

            A heavy plume of smoke once again looms over the county as crews battle thick flames torching everything in their path. The Park Fire has left graveyards of burned cars and charred, hallowed out structures, video from the Chico and Cohasset areas of Butte County shows.
    

            A 42-year-old man identified by authorities as Ronnie Dean Stout II has been arrested on suspicion of pushing a burning car 60 feet into a gully, “spreading flames” that caused the Park Fire. Stout will likely face an arson charge, though it’s unclear what count or whether enhancements will be added, Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said Thursday.
    

            The DA’s office told CNN Stout has not retained an attorney and will be assigned a public defender at his arraignment.
    

            Cal Fire initially estimated the fire had destroyed more than 100 structures, but on Saturday said crews on the ground have so far confirmed 20 structures destroyed.
    

            California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for both counties Friday. The state also secured a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to ensure there are enough resources to fight the fire.
    

            Elsner said the Park Fire has forced her and her parents to take shelter at the same location they stayed at in 2018. She told CNN, in tears, the experience is causing her significant PTSD from the Camp Fire and flashbacks triggered by the flames and “charred bits of remnants.”
    

            Elsner’s mother, Mary Graeff, said it’s been challenging comforting her daughter through this. “It was just hard, you know, to be that age and then lose absolutely everything. So that was hard. And watching your child go through that was awful,” Graeff said through tears.

CNN_10,"US Defense Secretary Austin holds trilateral meeting with Japanese, South Korean counterparts, first in 15 years",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/asia/us-austin-trilateral-japan-south-korea-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-28 12:48:00,world,"
            Defense chiefs from the United States, South Korea and Japan vowed to strengthen cooperation to deter “nuclear and missile threats” from North Korea during a meeting in Tokyo Sunday, the first of its kind in 15 years as the countries move to tighten coordination in an increasingly tense region.
    

            The trilateral meeting comes nearly one year after a landmark summit between the three countries held by US President Joe Biden at Camp David – part of a bid by Washington to strengthen ties with two of its key allies in Asia as it eyes North Korean provocations and Chinese aggression in the region.
    

            In a joint statement Sunday, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Japan’s Minister of Defense Minoru Kihara and South Korea’s Shin Won-sik “recalled their enduring commitment to strengthen trilateral security cooperation to deter nuclear and missile threats” from North Korea.
    

            They also expressed “grave concern” over the “increasing military and economic cooperation commitment” between Moscow and Pyongyang, according to the statement. Numerous governments have accused North Korea of supplying Russia with weaponry for its war in Ukraine and the two neighbors last month signed a new defense pact.
    

            The burgeoning trilateral coordination between the US, Japan and South Korea marks a shift in regional relations, with Seoul and Tokyo – both long-standing US allies – widely seen as working to put aside historic animosity and mistrust to better address shared security threats.
    

            Following last year’s summit, Kishida announced that annual recurring summits will be held among several of the nations’ highest officials, including the ministers of foreign affairs and defense, and national security advisers, along with the financial, industry, and commerce ministers. The leaders also announced new military exercises and a hotline for crisis communications.
    

            The increasing coordination has sparked pushback from Beijing, which when asked about the leaders’ trilateral summit at Camp David last year said the Asia-Pacific region shouldn’t be “turned into a wrestling ground for geopolitical competition.”
    

            Sunday’s joint statement didn’t explicitly refer to China, but the defense chiefs reiterated their opposition to “any unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the waters of the Indo-Pacific” and noted that they shared assessments of “recent maritime and air military activities in the Indo-Pacific region, including the South China Sea.”
    

            China has been aggressively asserting its claims in the contested waters of the South China Sea, maintaining an extended presence near Japanese-controlled islands Beijing claims in the East China Sea, as well as ramping up its military intimidation of the self-ruling island of Taiwan.
    

            The defense chiefs also formalized a trilateral agreement that reaffirms the “unwavering nature of the new era of trilateral cooperation,” according to a joint statement.
    

            This would “institutionalize” trilateral security cooperation among their countries’ defense authorities, including senior-level policy consultations, information sharing, trilateral exercises, and defense exchange cooperation.
    

            According to a defense official, Secretary Austin is also expected to announce that the US intends to reconstitute US Forces Japan (USF-J) as a joint force headquarters to serve as a counterpart to Japan’s Joint Operations Command (J-JOC).
    

            Details of this implementation, which would give the reconstituted USF-J a direct leadership role “in both peace time and potential crises,” will be figured out in working groups led by US Indo-Pacific Command, according to the official.
    

            “The intent here is for USF-J to become a standalone three-star joint force headquarters. Eventually separate and apart from 5th Air Force,” said the official, who added that there is no intention to integrate Japanese forces into the US commands.
    

            “We view this as a historic announcement among the strongest improvements to our military ties in 70 years. Bottom line is that this is a transformative change,” the official said.
    

             “When this transition is complete, USF-J will have a direct leadership role in planning and leading US forces in both peace time and potential crises, and they’ll be doing that side by side with Japanese forces like never before.”

CNN_11,Trump and Harris enter final 100-day stretch of a rapidly evolving 2024 race,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/politics/trump-harris-election-100-days/index.html,2024-07-28 13:33:00,politics,"
Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are entering the last 100 days of one of the fastest-moving and least predictable campaign seasons in memory, after a historic month upended the 2024 presidential race.
    

            The ground has shifted under both political parties since June 27, when President Joe Biden’s poor performance in his debate with Trump threw the Democratic Party into chaos and prompted Trump’s team to eye an expanded electoral map.
    

            The race was rattled yet again after the former president survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. Just days later, he chose Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate and rallied the Republican Party at its convention in Milwaukee.
    

            Then, a week ago, Biden announced his exit from the race – and pointed to Harris, his vice president, as his successor. Within 36 hours, Harris had rallied the party behind her candidacy, locking down enough support from Democratic National Convention delegates to become the party’s presumptive nominee.

            Then she hit the ground running, holding events with voters in the swing state of Wisconsin on Tuesday, a Black sorority on Wednesday and teachers on Thursday. Friday morning, she touted the endorsements of Barack and Michelle Obama.
    

            Trump has responded to Harris’ apparent momentum with a series of personal attacks. At recent campaign stops, he has referred to her as “evil,” mocked her laugh and the pronunciation of her name, and said that “the American dream is dead” if Harris wins in November. The vice president responded at a Saturday fundraiser that the attacks by Trump and his running mate were “plain weird.”
    

            Polls are only beginning to capture the new state of play in a race that now has no clear leader.
    

            A Democratic vice presidential pick and convention, as well as potential debates between Harris and Trump and between their running mates, could further shake up the 2024 contest in the 100 days between now and Election Day, November 5.
    

            The issues and lines of attack that are animating both campaigns are increasingly coming into view.
    

            Trump’s campaign has focused on inflation, border security and crime – and the former president is arguing that Harris bears just as much blame as Biden on those issues and that she is more liberal than her boss.
    

            However, Trump has also escalated his attacks on Harris, criticizing her in deeply personal terms at campaign events Friday and Saturday.
    

            At a conservative Christian gathering in Florida on Friday, he said that Harris had been “a bum three weeks ago” before her ascension to the top of the Democratic ticket and dubbed her “the most incompetent, unpopular and far-left vice president in American history.” He also said he “couldn’t care less” about mispronouncing her first name.

            Then, at a Saturday night rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota, Trump called Harris “evil” over her handling of the border and said that if “a crazy liberal like Kamala Harris gets in, the American dream is dead.”
    

            He also mocked his Democratic opponent’s laugh, claiming that the media was trying to portray Harris as a “Margaret Thatcher,” referring to the late British prime minister, but that “it’s not gonna happen,” because “Margaret Thatcher didn’t laugh like that.”
    

            A Harris spokeswoman responded to Trump’s Minnesota speech by slamming the GOP nominee as a “bitter, unhinged, 78-year-old convicted felon.”
    

            On Friday, Trump said protesters who sprayed pro-Hamas graffiti in Washington on Wednesday were Harris supporters, even though the vice president condemned their actions. He criticized her for skipping Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Congress, without noting that Harris met privately with Netanyahu and that his own running mate also didn’t attend the speech. And Trump said that Harris “doesn’t like Jewish people. She doesn’t like Israel. That’s the way it is, and that’s the way it’s always gonna be.” Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, is Jewish.
    

            Trump, who continues to peddle falsehoods and raise fears about election fraud, also drew heat on social media for telling the Florida audience that if he wins in November, they won’t have to vote again.
    

            “You won’t have to do it anymore, my beautiful Christians. I love you, Christians. I’m a Christian. … You gotta get out and vote,” the former president said. “In four years, you won’t have to vote again. We’ll have it fixed so good, you’re not going to have to vote.”
    

            Harris, at a Western Massachusetts fundraiser on Saturday, said that the former president was pushing “wild lies” about her record and that the attacks by Trump and Vance were “plain weird.”
    

            “I mean, that’s the box you put that in, right?” Harris told supporters.
    

            In campaign events since emerging as the presumptive Democratic nominee, Harris is taking on Trump over abortion rights and casting him as a threat to freedom.
    

            “We are seeing a full-on agenda that is now about restricting rights, and one of the most fundamental rights, the right to make decisions about your own body,” she said at the Massachusetts fundraiser. “If there are those who dare to take the freedom to make such a fundamental decision for an individual, which is about one’s own body, what other freedoms could be on the table for the taking?”
    

            Harris has also been pointing to the former president’s legal troubles. In remarks to campaign staffers Monday – her first time delivering a brief version of her new stump speech – she recalled her time as San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general, saying that she “took on perpetrators of all kinds.”
    

            “Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own game,” Harris said. “So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump’s type.”
    

            Among the next orders of business for Harris’ campaign is to accomplish two tasks in a period of days or weeks that Trump’s campaign achieved over months.
    

            First, she must choose a running mate.
    

            Former Attorney General Eric Holder is leading a team that is poring through financial documents, family histories, public statements, published documents, voting records, campaign experience and social media postings. Tony West, Harris’ brother-in-law and a former associate attorney general under Holder, is also playing a central role in the search.
    

            Democrats close to the process say the roster of leading contenders being vetted still includes North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly.

How Kamala Harris’ warp-speed campaign launch has changed the 2024 race


            Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who has developed a close relationship with Harris and has also been previously vetted and confirmed by the Senate, is also under consideration, along with Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, sources say.
    

            Many of those potential picks have been offering Harris’ campaign informal glimpses of how they’d perform as her running mate through appearances on cable news shows.
    

            Democratic pollsters have been asked to test how Harris and the prospective candidates would fare in their home states – and in key battlegrounds – in hypothetical matchups against Trump and Vance.
    

            Harris has told the team of lawyers and advisers conducting one of the most accelerated vice presidential searches in modern American history that she plans to name her running mate before August 7.
    

            Then, Harris’ campaign and its allies must rapidly revise plans for the Democratic National Convention, which is set to start on August 19 in Chicago.
    

            Instead of nominating Biden for a second term, Democrats will use the convention to showcase the outgoing president passing the baton to Harris – and could alter the party’s programming to better align with the vice president’s personality and political appeal.
    

            Her campaign must also identify Harris’ best path toward 270 Electoral College votes. Biden’s hopes of a second term were thought to reside primarily in sweeping the “blue wall” states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Harris, though, has been polling better among young and non-White voters – and could prove more viable in the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina that appeared to be moving away from Biden.
    

            One of the biggest questions, now that Harris has replaced Biden as the presumptive Democratic nominee, is whether she will face Trump on the debate stage.
    

            The June 27 clash on CNN between Trump and Biden had already transformed the race. And a Trump-Harris debate could shape the race’s final weeks perhaps more than any other event.

Trump campaign says it won’t commit to Harris debate until she’s confirmed as nominee


            Biden and Trump had agreed to another debate – one that would take place on September 10, hosted by ABC. Harris said she would participate in that debate.
    

            “I think the voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on a debate stage. And so, I’m ready. Let’s go,” she told reporters Thursday.
    

            However, Trump’s campaign released a statement indicating that the former president wouldn’t commit to any future debates until the Democratic nominee is formally selected.
    

            “Given the continued political chaos surrounding Crooked Joe Biden and the Democrat Party, general election debate details cannot be finalized until Democrats formally decide on their nominee,” Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement Thursday.
    

            That prompted Harris to reply on social media: “What happened to ‘any time, any place?’”
    

            Perhaps the clearest indicator of the political earthquake that’s taken place in recent days is the shift in cultural vibes and viral moments.
    

            Just a week ago, Republicans were riding high after a convention in Milwaukee at which Trump’s reaction to the assassination attempt days earlier – his right fist raised in the air as he mouthed “Fight” to the crowd – had become a rallying cry.
    

            Now, Democrats – who were previously fretting about slow fundraising, a disengaged base and slippage in support among young, Black and Latino voters – are rallying behind a candidate with more cultural cachet among those same voters. And Republicans are on defense, with Trump’s vice presidential pick, Vance, having to defend prior comments that could alienate the suburban women the Trump ticket is courting.

Jennifer Aniston criticizes JD Vance for ‘childless cat ladies’ remarks: ‘I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children’


            Vance has come under fire over comments he made as a Senate candidate on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show in 2021.
    

            He told Carlson that the United States is being run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” He then specifically mentioned Harris, Buttigieg and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as examples.
    

            Vance did not acknowledge that Harris has two stepchildren with her husband. Buttigieg, who has since become a father to two children, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Tuesday that he and his husband were struggling with “a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey” when Vance made the remark.
    

            Actress Jennifer Aniston criticized Vance for the comment as someone who has struggled to have children and said she prays his daughter is “fortunate enough to bear children.”
    

            In an interview Friday with conservative host Megyn Kelly on SiriusXM, Vance said he was being sarcastic and the substance of what he said has been lost. He said he was criticizing the Democratic Party for becoming “anti-family.”
    

            “The simple point that I made is that having children, becoming a father, becoming a mother, I really do think it changes your perspective, and in a pretty profound way,” Vance said.
    

            Vance said it’s a “catastrophic problem” that the United States has the “lowest birth rate in our history in this country.” As CNN previously reported, the United States’ fertility rate has been trending down for decades, and in 2023 it reached the lowest rate in a century. Vance said his remarks about childless adults had been motivated in part by a conversation with his wife about balancing life as a working mother.
    

            “What a weird society that we’ve set up where moms who want to work, the thought that a lot of them are having is, ‘I can’t have more babies because it’s going to be bad for my career,’” Vance said. “How about we make the workplace more accommodating to working moms and working dads so that we can promote a real culture of life?”

            Harris, on the other hand, has been the beneficiary of a series of viral moments.
    

            Charli XCX, the British pop singer, declared the vice president “brat,” which is the title of her sixth studio album and a Gen Z summer soundtrack. It set off an avalanche of posts on TikTok, Twitter and other social media platforms featuring the same shade of bright green as the album cover and video compilations of Harris.
    

            Then, there were the coconut memes, revisiting a May 2023 speech in which Harris spoke about “a difference between equality and equity.”
    

            “None of us just live in a silo. Everything is in context,” she said in that speech. “My mother used to – she would give us a hard time sometimes – and she would say to us, ‘I don’t know what’s wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree? You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.’”
    

            Since then, coconuts and coconut tree imagery have been used online in support of Harris, with Colorado Gov. Jared Polis even posting an endorsement of the vice president on social media that was communicated through three emojis: a coconut, a palm tree and an American flag.
    

            “What we’re seeing is a really classic example of when pop culture really gets intertwined with politics, and it takes a special kind of candidate and a special kind of leader to inspire that,” Florida Rep. Maxwell Frost, a 27-year-old Democrat, said on CNN. “It has to be organic. You can’t make it happen.”
    

            There were signs that after a launch that had gone better than Democrats could have hoped, Harris’ previous remarks were coming under fresh scrutiny.
    

            CNN’s KFile reported Friday that Harris voiced support for “defund the police” in a radio interview in June 2020 amid nationwide protests for police reform, just months before denouncing the movement after she had joined the Biden presidential campaign.
    

            “This whole movement is about rightly saying, ‘We need to take a look at these budgets and figure out whether it reflects the right priorities,’” Harris said on a New York-based radio program on June 9, 2020, adding that US cities were “militarizing police” but “defunding public schools.”

            On Saturday, ahead of the campaign rally in Minnesota, the Trump campaign released a video that slammed Harris for her “soft on crime policies,” highlighting her 2020 support on social media for a fund that bailed out protesters in the aftermath of the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
    

            The Minnesota Freedom Fund is one of several US charities dedicated to helping low-income defendants post bail that boomed in the aftermath of Floyd’s death. However, the fund, in addition to other charitable bail groups, later came under fire after some defendants who were bailed out were arrested again for alleged acts of violent crime.
    

            As Trump’s campaign adjusts its tactics for the race against Harris, the former president has made clear on social media and on the trail that he plans to make political ideology an issue.
    

            “We’re not ready for a Marxist President,” Trump said Thursday on Truth Social, “and Lyin’ Kamala Harris is a RADICAL LEFT MARXIST, AND WORSE!”
    

            Trump had long criticized Biden over border security. He is similarly blasting Harris – who early in Biden’s presidency was tapped to tackle the root cause of migration from Central America. The Republican National Committee on Thursday posted a video on social media featuring assorted clips of Harris saying that an undocumented immigrant was not a criminal.
    

            Down-ballot Republicans have similarly begun attacking Harris as too liberal.
    

            In Pennsylvania, Dave McCormick, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Bob Casey in one of the year’s most important races, posted a video Tuesday featuring Casey praising Harris – followed by a series of clips of Harris speaking in support of eliminating private health insurance, passing the progressive “Green New Deal,” abolishing US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a mandatory gun buyback program and more.
    

            On Friday, McCormick posted a slightly shorter version of the video.
    

            “Starting this Monday, Pennsylvanians watching the Olympics will also see Bob Casey and Kamala Harris’ dangerously liberal agenda on display,” he said.

CNN_12,Five things to watch from the swimming competition at this year’s Olympic Games,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/sport/what-to-watch-swimming-olympics/index.html,2024-07-28 14:30:00,world,"
            The first week of the Olympics and with it comes one of the Games’ signature events: Swimming.
    

            The pool has been the scene of some of the Games’ most legendary moments over the years and 2024 appears set to be no different. Several key swimmers are looking to end up on the podium one last time in what could be their final Olympics, while others are looking to play spoiler.
    

            Here are five things to watch from this year’s swimming competition in Paris.
    

            The 10-time medalist is aiming to cement her legacy as one of the greatest American swimmers of all time in Paris.
    

            Ledecky started off her Olympics with bronze medal finish in Saturday’s 400-meter freestyle.
    

            She’ll also compete in the 800-meter and the 1,500-meter races over the next several days. She’s won gold in the 800 three times and gold in the 1,500 twice – and hasn’t been defeated in those races in any of the Olympics that she’s entered.
    

            Results in Tokyo suggested the rest of the world might be catching up to the American star, at least in the 800-meter, and Saturday’s swim confirmed those results.
    

            While the 400-meter is not Ledecky’s best race, she finished ahead of Ariarne Titmus in a semifinal heat. American hopes were raised as anticipation built in La Défense Arena.
    

            But the matchup wasn’t really much of a contest at all. Titmus ended Ledecky’s hopes of revenge, dominating the race and finishing almost a full second ahead of Canada’s Summer McIntosh, who took silver. Ledecky finished a distant third, about three seconds off the pace.
    

            Chinese swimmers are under an intense microscope in Paris, fairly or unfairly.
    

            Ever since the New York Times reported in April that 23 Chinese swimmers had all tested positive for the same banned substance ahead of the Tokyo Olympics and were still allowed to compete at the games in 2021, resentment and frustration has been simmering in the water. Eleven of those Chinese swimmers are due to compete again in Paris, and many of their rivals are preparing to go against them with a sense of bitter resignation.
    

            Rob Koehler, director of international sports advocacy group Global Athlete, told CNN that they are already anticipating the worst.

            “If any of those 11 Chinese swimmers hit a podium,” he told CNN last week, “they will absolutely lose it.”
    

            The Chinese swimmers tested positive for the banned performance enhancing drug Trimetazidine at a national meet several months before the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, but China’s Anti-Doping Agency (CHINADA) said that the concentration was “extremely low.” CHINADA decided that the swimmers were not responsible for the results because the drug had been accidentally ingested via some contaminated food.
    

            The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was notified of the test results a month before the games in 2021 and accepted CHINADA’s conclusion, because, according to WADA’s President Witold Bańka, they found “no credible way to disprove the contamination theory that was accepted by CHINADA.”
    

            The US government is investigating the case and it’s likely that any Chinese swimmer who wins in Paris will be under scrutiny from the media, fans and their fellow swimmers as questions over whether the races are truly clean will swirl.
    

            American swimmer Caeleb Dressel told reporters last week that he didn’t feel like he’d competing on a level playing field.
    

            “No, not really. I don’t think they’ve given us enough evidence to support them (World Aquatics) with how this case was handled,” Dressel said.
    

            The heat is turned up on the rivalry between two of the greatest swimming nations.
    

            Controversial comments in 2023 by Australian swimmer Cate Campbell – who won’t be in Paris after failing to qualify – were given new life by USA legend Michael Phelps in a viral video filmed by NBC last month. Phelps was reacting to a video from Campbell saying it was always sweeter to win when beating the USA.
    

            “It’s just so much sweeter beating America,” Campbell told an Australian news station.
    

            “When we’re like right next to each other in the warmup areas, the US have this like infernal cowbell that they ring. And as someone leaves to go out to the competition pool, they all go ‘U-S-A! U-S-A!’ and I’ve never wanted to punch someone more,” she added.
    

            Phelps in the video said he would make a rival regret ever saying something like that to him if he was on the US team, naming dropping former rivals Ian Thorpe of Australia and Chad le Clos of South Africa as examples of people who tried to get in his head.
    

            “You guys have all talked s— about me and I had the last laugh. For the Americans, if you saw what I just saw … I would watch that thing every single day to give me that little extra bit of just oomph,” Phelps said.
    

            The back-and-forth will take on new life as Aussie and American swimmers take to the pool and compete to take home the most medals. Australia’s women topped the American women with eight gold medals in Tokyo and will be looking to repeat the feat this time around.
    

            The tone was set early on when Ledecky and Titmus faced off in the 400-meter freestyle and Titmus easily beat her American rival. In fact, the Australians medaled in all four medal races on Saturday night – two golds and two silvers – to the Americans’ three. But in the last race of the night, the American men’s 4X100 freestyle team took back the momentum by winning Team USA’s first gold of the Olympics.
    

            Still, despite Phelps’ urging, the competition is mostly friendly.
    

            Bronte Campbell, swimming on the Australian’s 4x100-meter freestyle relay team, told reporters: “I really respect our American competitors. I’ve known a lot of them for many years. I’ve enjoyed racing them, and I’m looking forward to doing it again.”
    

            Billed as a potential successor to Phelps, Marchand is likely to be one of the key figures for the host nation.
    

            Marchand, who broke Phelps’ last remaining world record in the 400-meter individual medley, will be swimming in four events in Paris. It’s likely the French team’s best hope for gold in the pool and will be cheered loudly by his supporters who long to hear “La Marseillaise” playing with him on the podium.
    

            It’s been 12 years since the French have won a medal in swimming.
    

            The 22-year-old is the favorite in the 400-meter medley again this year and is also expected to compete closely in the 200-meter individual medley, 200-meter butterfly and 200-meter breaststroke.
    

            Dressel – the top American male swimmer again at this Olympics – is using his experience as a new father to drive him forward in his slightly scaled-back Olympics.
    

            Having already won seven gold medals in his Olympic career, Dressel will compete in fewer races in these Games. He’ll focus on the 100-meter butterfly, the 50-meter freestyle and has already won gold as a part of the 4x100-meter relay team.
    

            Dressel has won gold in every Olympic event he’s entered so far in his career. It’s a sterling record that he’ll look to keep as he aims for double-digit gold medals over the course of his three Olympic Games.
    

            He told reporters last week that his son, August, is now his inspiration.
    

            “I can’t imagine my life before August was here, so yes, it’s very, very different. Pretty much all I have time for is him and swimming, but I don’t want to be doing anything else,” Dressel said.
    

            “It’s extremely different with a whole new routine, a lot more challenges that come with it, earlier bedtimes for myself, more naps, so camp has been great to sleep in a little bit.”
    

            After his win on Saturday, Dressel said doing it in front of his family made it all the sweeter.
    

            “It’s really special, making the team in front of them and then winning the gold in front of them, just checking little boxes that I never would have thought to create throughout my career,” he told reporters. “So that was a really, really special event tonight.”

CNN_13,What we know about the Sinaloa cartel and its leaders,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/us/sinaloa-cartel-history-leaders/index.html,2024-07-28 15:46:00,us,"
            The arrests of two top alleged leaders of Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel are an “enormous blow” to the group accused of being responsible for most drugs “killing Americans from coast to coast”, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration says.
    

            Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, the cartel’s alleged co-founder, and Joaquin Guzman Lopez, son of former boss Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, were arrested Thursday by US authorities in El Paso, Texas.
    

            They face several charges for allegedly leading the criminal operations of what is considered one of world’s most powerful and deadly drug trafficking operations.
    

            Here’s what we know about the Sinaloa cartel’s decades-long operations, impact and key players:
    

            The Sinaloa cartel, named after the Mexican state where it was formed, is one of the oldest and most established drug trafficking groups in Mexico. It has long supplied much of the marijuana, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and fentanyl peddled on US streets, according to a Congressional Research Service report.


            In the early 2010s, estimates indicated the cartel controlled roughly 40% to 60% of Mexico’s drug trade, earning as much as $3 billion annually, the CRS report said.
    

            It was founded in the late 1980s and led by El Chapo, who twice escaped from Mexican prisons before being detained by Mexican authorities in Sinaloa in 2016. He was extradited to the US the following year and is serving a life sentence in US federal prison.
    

            The cartel has been blamed for having a key role in the drug war that plagued Mexico for years, leaving tens of thousands of people dead, as well as contributing to the ongoing high levels of violence across the country.
    

            Since Guzman’s imprisonment in the US, experts believe the cartel has faced several challenges after breaking into factions – including some led by Zambada and Guzman’s sons – and with the rise of rival cartels.
    

            The Sinaloa cartel was formerly led by El Chapo Guzman, who infamously eluded authorities while expanding the organization’s drug trafficking operation across the world. In the process, he became the topic of numerous best-selling books and TV shows.

            El Chapo initially escaped from a Mexican prison in 2001, reportedly hiding in a laundry basket, and again in 2015 through a tunnel. After he was recaptured in 2016, he was extradited to the US, where he was convicted on federal drug conspiracy and various trafficking charges in 2019.
    

            Zambada, 76, is considered the last of the old-school Mexican drug capos. A longtime associate of Guzman, he’s allegedly led transportation operations, employing people to secure “warehouses to import and store narcotics, and ‘sicarios,’ or hit men, to carry out kidnappings and murders in Mexico to retaliate against rivals who threatened the cartel,” according to the Justice Department.
    

            In February, the US charged Zambada with conspiring to manufacture and distribute fentanyl.


            Guzman Lopez and his brothers, known as “Los Chapitos,” have allegedly led one of the three main factions of the cartel since their father’s imprisonment. He and his brother, Ovidio Guzman Lopez, are believed to have inherited relationships and narcotics proceeds after one of their brother’s death, leading them to invest in marijuana, cocaine and ephedrine from Mexico, Colombia and Argentina, according to the Justice Department. At some point, Guzman Lopez oversaw methamphetamine labs, selling wholesale in Sinaloa and to distributors in the US and Canada.
    

            The Sinaloa cartel is known for trafficking wholesale amounts of fentanyl, heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana, according to the DEA. The group has distribution hubs in several cities across the US, controlling the smuggling corridors in Arizona and California. The group also allegedly runs fentanyl labs in Mexico.

            It is one of two cartels that has used its control of the fentanyl trade to develop sophisticated money-laundering techniques that exploit cryptocurrency, according to US officials.
    

            In one case, the cartel laundered more than $869,000 using cryptocurrency between August 2022 and February 2023, according to a US indictment unsealed last year.
    

            The DEA says most of the fentanyl that enters the US comes from ingredients made in China that are then pressed into pills – or packed in powder – and smuggled in from Mexico by drug cartels.
    

            The men boarded a plane in Mexico and were arrested when it landed near El Paso, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN. Zambada believed they were inspecting property in the Mexican side of the US border and was not aware Guzman Lopez was helping US investigators, the official said.
    

            The lure operation resulting in the arrests has prompted a furious behind-the-scenes reaction from Mexican government officials who are demanding senior US law enforcement officials explain exactly what transpired, according to a US official familiar with the operation.
    

            Officials in Mexico were not briefed ahead of the planned captures, the official said. CNN has reached out to Mexican officials for comment.
    

            Samuel González, a legal expert and former chief of Mexico’s anti-drug unit, told CNN the potentially deceptive circumstances of the arrest could reflect possible negotiations between Guzman Lopez and his brother Ovidio, who was extradited to the US last year and is facing drug and money laundering charges.
    

            “If Ovidio had not surrendered, Mayo (Zambada) would not have fallen either,” González said.
    

            The arrests on Thursday have raised concerns about what the future of the cartel will be and the potential for increased violence in Mexico.
    

            Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute who covers drug markets and counternarcotic policies, told CNN the arrests will most certainly lead to increased violence since Zambada was known to, at times, broker deals with criminal groups to avoid it.
    

            “Among all the drug bosses, he was the most cool-headed,” Felbab-Brown said.
    

            Some experts say internal fighting may result in the downfall of the Sinaloa cartel, but Felbab-Brown warned that other Mexican cartels stand ready to take their place, including the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG).
    

            “This would have very complicated ripple effects across global drug markets,” Felbab-Brown said of the Sinaloa cartel’s potential downfall, “but as long as there is (CJNG), we will end up with a drug market on our doorstep that’s run by a much more vicious, much nastier, much less restrained group than the current one.”

CNN_14,US to ‘reconfigure’ military forces in Japan as regional tensions mount,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/asia/us-austin-trilateral-japan-south-korea-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-28 15:57:00,world,"
            The United States will reconfigure its military forces in Japan as the two countries move to deepen defense cooperation, Washington and Tokyo said Sunday, in a sweeping step to modernize their alliance in the face of mounting security threats in Asia.
    

            The announcement comes as Japan and the US warily eye a region where China is seen as increasingly aggressive in asserting its disputed territorial claims and North Korea continues its illegal weapons program – while both tighten ties with Russia as it wages war in Ukraine.
    

            US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and their Japanese counterparts Minoru Kihara and Yoko Kamikawa announced the plan in a joint statement following a meeting in Tokyo, where they also called China’s “political, economic, and military coercion” the “greatest strategic challenge” in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.
    

            The move is likely to stoke the ire of Beijing, which has watched warily as the US has bolstered ties with regional allies in a part of the world where observers say China seeks to be the dominant power – and where it’s accused the US of fostering a Cold War-style bloc mentality.
    

            Under the new configuration, US forces in Japan would be reconstituted as a joint force headquarters reporting to the Commander of US Indo-Pacific Command to “facilitate deeper interoperability and cooperation on joint bilateral operations in peacetime and during contingencies,” according to the statement.
    

            In April, US President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida vowed during a summit in Washington to “upgrade” their respective command-and-control framework “to strengthen deterrence and promote a free and open Indo-Pacific in the face of pressing regional security challenges.”
    

            Details of the implementation would be figured out in working groups led by US Indo-Pacific Command, a senior US defense official said ahead of Sunday’s announcement, adding that there is no intention to integrate Japanese forces into the US commands.
    

            US Forces Japan (USFJ), whose headquarters is Yokota Air Base, consists of approximately 54,000 military personnel stationed in Japan under a 1960 mutual cooperation and security treaty.
    

            “We view this as a historic announcement among the strongest improvements to our military ties in 70 years. Bottom line is that this is a transformative change,” the official said.
    

            “When this transition is complete, USFJ will have a direct leadership role in planning and leading US forces in both peace time and potential crises, and they’ll be doing that side by side with Japanese forces like never before.”
    

            The expected reconfiguration comes as Japan shifts its defense posture, veering away from the pacifist constitution imposed on it by the United States in the aftermath of World War II, with a plan to boost defense spending to about 2% of its GDP by 2027 and acquire counterstrike capabilities.
    

            These changes have cemented Japan’s centrality to Washington’s regional security strategy and its push for increasing coordination with allies and partners amid rising regional tensions – and as it increasingly sees security in Europe and Asia as intertwined in the wake of the war in Ukraine.
    

            China was repeatedly mentioned with pointed language in the joint statement, with the ministers outlining shared concerns including what they described as Beijing’s “intensifying attempts to unilaterally change the status quo” in the East China Sea, its “threatening and provocative activities in the South China Sea,” and its “support for Russia’s defense industrial base.”
    

            China has been aggressively asserting its claims in the contested waters of the South China Sea and maintaining an extended presence near Japanese-controlled islands Beijing claims in the East China Sea. Western leaders have accused Beijing of “enabling” Moscow’s war in Ukraine through the provision of dual-use goods, a charge Beijing denies.
    

            The ministers also said Taiwan’s “political transition period should not be used as a pretext for provocative actions across the Taiwan Strait,” a statement that follows Chinese military drills encircling the self-ruled democracy Beijing claims just days after Taiwan swore in a new president in May.
    

            In the statement, they also condemned North Korea’s missile testing and nuclear weapons programs, and condemned deepening Russia-North Korea cooperation, including Russia’s “procurement of ballistic missiles and other materiel from North Korea” for use in Ukraine.
    

            The meeting follows a trilateral meeting earlier Sunday between defense chiefs from the United States, Japan and South Korea, the first of its kind in 15 years – and yet another sign of the tightening coordination of regional US allies.
    

            That came nearly one year after a landmark summit between the three countries held by Biden at Camp David. The burgeoning trilateral coordination between the US, Japan and South Korea marks a shift in regional relations, with Seoul and Tokyo – both long-standing US allies – widely seen as working to put aside historic animosity and mistrust to better address shared security threats.
    

            On Sunday, the three defense chiefs vowed to strengthen cooperation to deter “nuclear and missile threats” from North Korea and formalized a trilateral agreement that reaffirms the “unwavering nature of the new era of trilateral cooperation,” according to a joint statement.
    

            This would “institutionalize” trilateral security cooperation among their countries’ defense authorities, including senior-level policy consultations, information sharing, trilateral exercises, and defense exchange cooperation.

CNN_16,Bermuda’s Flora Duffy aims to defend her triathlon gold to cap off an emotional comeback,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/sport/flora-duffy-bermuda-profile/index.html,2024-07-28 16:47:00,world,"
            When it comes to the highs and lows of professional sport, Bermuda’s first ever Olympic champion has experienced it all in recent years.


            Flora Duffy made history at the Tokyo 2020 Summer Games by winning gold in the triathlon. It was a life-changing moment for both her and her country which has a population of just under 64,000.
    

            “It was an incredible day in Tokyo to win Bermuda’s first ever gold medal. Such a surreal moment. I think it continues to soak in as the days and years go by. But it was a huge moment for Bermuda. Particularly in a tough time because Covid was still going on and it really united the island and everyone was so proud to celebrate,” Duffy said.
    

            “There were lots of celebrations on the island. There are quite a few things named after me there now, which is just really cool and really special,” she added.
    

            But Duffy would go from the euphoria of that historic triumph to the utter despair she faced due to a persistent knee injury following a tear to her patella tendon. The Olympic champion couldn’t compete at all last year much to her frustration but at no point did she give up hope of making it to Paris.
    

            “It was certainly a very up and down three years in between the games, with having a really bad knee injury and not racing at all in 2023. That was certainly not in the plan. But training has gone pretty well the last few months. And I think I’m in pretty good shape and excited to get out there. I’m kind of going in a little bit under the radar, even though I’m the reigning champion because of my injury,” she said.
    

            Duffy admits she went through a highly challenging period in her life. It became a race against time to be ready for Paris with Flora at one point even considering the possibility of retirement. The women’s triathlon is scheduled to be held in Paris on Wednesday
    

            “I definitely did. If you spoke to me this time last year in 2023, you’d probably get a very different person.  It was a hugely challenging time, and I had to have some pretty serious conversations with those in my inner circle my coach, my husband,” Duffy said.
    

            And it’s that inner circle along with her own self-belief that Flora credits helping her through the ordeal.
    

            “I’ve (got) a lot of great people around me that helped me get through that. I think racing in Paris was one of the big things that kind of got me through that, that tough period and just really kept giving me hope to keep on with all the rehab and just kind of believing that my knee would heal, and I’d be able to get back to training again,” the Bermudian said.
    

            The triathlon is one of the most challenging endurance tests there is. It comprises a 1,500-meter swim, a 40-kilometer cycle with a 10-kilometer run to finish it all off. And these Paris Games also bring with them another challenge – the quality of the water in the River Seine where triathletes are scheduled to compete.


            In the build-up to the Games, official testing showed E. coli bacteria levels above acceptable levels on most days between early June and early July, potentially exposing athletes to serious health risks.
    

            Duffy though took part in a test event last year in the Seine and is reassured by the fact she didn’t get sick.
    

            “The water seemed fine,” said the 36-year-old. “The biggest issue for me was more thinking about the current and the dynamics that adds to the race portion of the swim. I’m confident we will be able to swim. I look forward to it.”
    

            Duffy added, “I mean, it’s an iconic venue, right there where the triathlon is. I’m confident that everyone is doing what needs to be done to ensure that the water quality is up to par.”
    

            Official data however shows one-off rainfall events can quickly cause E. coli levels to spike again, a scenario that could impact the 3 stages of a triathlon.
    

            “It’s a possibility that might happen, but it’s not something we can control,” Duffy conceded. “So, you just kind of have to prepare mentally for both scenarios of racing the triathlon as per normal or perhaps racing a duathlon.”
    

            When asked about that potentially compromising the integrity of the Games, Duffy responded, “Yeah, I think that would certainly change it. You want to go there and race a triathlon and hopefully, the medalists will win in triathlon. I think in a duathlon that would probably look a slightly different way. I’m pretty confident there will be a swim. And if there’s not, you’re still racing in Paris at the Olympics and an iconic venue in a beautiful city with friends and family there, which will still make it an amazing day,” she added.
    

            However these Games turn out for Flora, emotions are certain to be running high as she targets another podium finish having already decided this will be her fifth and final Olympics.
    

            “It’s been a big portion of my life preparing for an Olympics and racing at Olympics. I think I’m going to try and bottle up all of those emotions and use them for a positive on race day. And I think regardless of the outcome of the race, just to know that the Olympics has given me so much and changed my worldm” she said. “So regardless, I’m just going to enjoy it and just soak it all up slowly.”
    

            Competing in the triathlon is all about going the distance, something Duffy knows only too well as she prepares for what she hopes will be one final and memorable Olympics swan song.

CNN_17,Israel says Hezbollah will ‘pay the price’ after blaming it for attack on soccer field that killed 12 children,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-golan-heights-soccer-strikes-intl/index.html,2024-07-28 17:35:00,world,"
            Israel vowed Hezbollah will “pay the price” after blaming the Lebanese militant group for a rocket attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights that killed 12 children, touching off fears once again that an all-out war would envelop the region.
    

            Hezbollah says it “firmly denies” it was behind the strike, the deadliest to hit Israel since the October 7 attacks.
    

            Israeli warplanes conducted airstrikes against Hezbollah targets “deep inside Lebanese territory” and along the border overnight Sunday, according to a statement from the military on Sunday morning. It was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties from those strikes.
    

            And on a visit to the town of Majdal Shams near the Syrian and Lebanese borders, where the rocket attack left children and teenagers dead on Saturday, Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant pledged a heavy response.
    

            “Hezbollah is responsible for this and they will pay the price,” Gallant said. In an earlier statement from his office, he added: “We will hit the enemy hard.”
    

            The Saturday attacks on the region involved “approximately 30 projectiles” crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory, in a barrage Israel’s military quickly blamed on the Iran-backed militant group.
    

            Among the sites hit in the attack was a soccer field where children and teenagers had been playing, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said.
    

            All 12 victims of Saturday’s strike were children, according to a list from Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and residents who spoke to CNN.
    

            Some 20,000 Druze Arabs live in the Golan Heights, an area Israel seized from Syria in 1967 during the Six-Day War and annexed in 1981. Considered occupied territory under international law and UN Security Council resolutions, the area is also home to about 50,000 Israeli Jewish settlers. Most Druze there identify as Syrian and have rejected offers of Israeli citizenship.
    

            Israel and Hezbollah have been trading rocket fire on a near-daily basis since Hamas’ attacks on Israel on October 7, and those exchanges have become increasingly volatile, sparking fears on several occasions that Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza would spiral into a conflict on multiple fronts across the Middle East.
    

            While Hezbollah admitted striking the Golan Heights on Saturday it rejected responsibility for the attack on Majdal Shams.
    

            “We confirm that the Islamic Resistance has no connection to the incident whatsoever and firmly denies all false claims in this regard,” a statement read.
    

            Israel’s initial overnight response appeared to stop short of the kind of attack that would launch an all-out war, but it gave rise to an incredibly tense day in the region.
    

            Iran on Sunday warned Israel against “any new adventures” aimed at Lebanon, in a statement issued by foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani. The statement said Israel “does not have the minimum moral authority to comment and judge about the incident that happened in Majdal Shams area, and the claims of this regime against others will not be heard either.”

CNN_18,The Re-Dream Team: LeBron James leads a star-studded roster as Team USA goes for Olympic gold,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/sport/team-usa-star-roster-olympic-gold-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-28 17:30:00,world,"
            Situated in North London, England sits an ordinary college sports center. Usually, this gym would be full of students getting a workout in, but on this sweltering Friday afternoon there’s a slightly different feel to the place.
    

            Fans are eagerly stood outside waiting with bated breath, security sits on the entrance and a long line of press queues up to enter the center.
    

            Eventually the reason for this additional excitement reveals itself. The hum around the place gets louder as the USA Men’s Basketball team emerges from the changing rooms and takes to the court to get some reps in before playing in the Olympic Games.
    

            That star-studded team on Sunday begins its quest in earnest for a fifth-straight gold medal with its match against Nikola Jokić and Serbia. Tip off for the game is scheduled for 11:15 am ET in Lille, France, about two-and-half hour’s drive north of Paris.
    

            Shift your eyes to one side of the court and you can see reigning NBA champs Jayson Tatum and Derrick White getting shots up from three-point distance. Sandwiched between the Celtics pair is former NBA MVP Joel Embiid practicing from the mid-range. The NBA’s all-time leading three-point scorer Steph Curry then comes into frame, weaving in and out of his teammates with the ball.
    

            The idea of this level of talent playing together seems stranger than fiction – a fiction that delves straight into the realm of fantasy upon seeing the rest of the roster.
    

            Look left and stretching in the middle of the court is Anthony Davis, Jrue Holiday, Devin Booker and Bam Adebayo. Rising stars Anthony Edwards and Tyrese Haliburton soon enter the fray, as two-time NBA champion, two-time Finals MVP and former regular season MVP Kevin Durant watches on from the sidelines.
    

            Then there’s the small matter of four-time NBA champion, four-time regular season MVP and four-time Finals MVP – LeBron James – who finishes up media work before heading onto the court.
    

            Team USA has had plenty of star power in the past, but it would be hard to argue against this being the strongest roster the USA has ever sent to an Olympic Games.
    

            Basketball fans have long dreamt of seeing the likes of James and Curry on the same team and when a powerful James block led to a Curry three in a warmup game against Germany – it was realized that these dreams have become reality.
    

            While having star power on the roster is an advantage, the team’s prowess needs to translate from paper to the court. In order to facilitate this, Team USA held a basketball showcase to get the team up to speed.
    

            A game in Las Vegas, before a trip to Abu Dhabi for two games and then finally to London for a pair of games saw Team USA tested before the Olympics.
    

            Five games, five wins for the star-studded roster. However, it wasn’t as straightforward as the results suggest – particularly in London.
    

            The US scraped past South Sudan 101-100 before surviving a scare against Germany with a 92-88 win.
    

            “Don’t take nothing away from South Sudan,” James said after the close win. “They played extremely good basketball and that’s why the game is won in between the lines and not all on paper.”
    

            The NBA’s all-time leading scorer had a similar view after beating Germany.
    

            “We got better tonight and that’s most important,” the Lakers star told reporters postgame. “We was tested by a great Germany team, they was world champion last year, so it was a good test for us.
    

            “I’m glad we was able to, once again, keep our composure, persevere like we did the other day versus South Sudan. It was a good win for us.”
    

            On both occasions Team USA looked to its leader, and it was “King James” who got his team over the line.
    

            The 20-time NBA All-Star led the US in scoring against South Sudan with 25 points before adding a game-high 20 points against Germany – including 11 in the fourth quarter.
    

            When watching James in action it is almost impossible to believe he will be celebrating his 40th birthday later this year and teams are still unable to stop the Los Angeles Lakers star.
    

            “Somebody named LeBron James made some pretty good plays at the end,” Germany head coach Gordon Herbert told reporters postgame when summing up his team’s game against the US.
    

            But heading to Paris Team USA will know it can’t always rely on James and, with the five games of practice under their belts, other stars will be looking to step up at the Olympics.
    

            Golden State Warriors star Curry said he has confidence in everyone in the team being able to do so.
    

            “The chemistry is pretty natural,” Curry told reporters in Paris on Thursday. “You have confidence whoever has the ball, you make a play, be yourself and hopefully something good comes out of it. The chemistry has been there so far, hopefully it continues.
    

            The two-time MVP also spoke on the importance of having the right attitude in order to bring success when playing in a team of such quality.
    

            “You got to be able to adapt quickly,” Curry said. “You got to be able to bring your egos of who we are as individual players, but also let them go, knowing it doesn’t matter who’s the man scoring that particular night. When you’re on the floor, you’re asked to do a certain thing and do it to the best of your ability, to play with energy, and as Team USA, if we do that, usually good things happen.”
    

            Stars from around the world now have an eye on ending the USA’s golden run and the amount of stars on the team is, oddly, one thing they’re trying to exploit.
    

            “If you look on paper, obviously they’re the most talented team, it’s not a secret to anybody,” Australian star Josh Giddey told reporters last week. “The difference is these guys (on the USA team), they’ve never played together, whereas a lot of these other countries have a core and have been together for years. I think those type of things really do (have) an effect.”
    

            Miami Heat star Adebayo reminded reporters that you can’t win games on paper and, while Team USA is overflowing with All-NBA players, opposition countries are also packed with NBA quality – unlike at Olympic Games of yesteryear.
    

            France boasts talent such as rookie of the year phenom Victor Wembanyama and four-time NBA defensive player of the year Rudy Gobert, Canada has 10 NBA players including two-time All-NBA first team star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Australia has a core of NBA vets.
    

            But Team USA’s all-time Olympic Games top scorer Durant namechecks two NBA MVPs as the players to watch outside of Team USA.
    

            “Giannis [Antetokounmpo] maybe, [Nikola] Jokić,” Durant said on who the biggest international stars could be. “Our game is global now; all of these guys are huge stars in their own ways … We are playing against like 65 or 64 NBA players now, there are all the best of the best in the world.”
    

            But despite the added competition, Team USA’s self-belief has not waivered.
    

            When asked on who he’s looking forward to playing in the Olympics, Curry answered confidently.
    

            “Whoever is in the gold medal game,” the sharpshooter told reporters. But with his team’s pedigree, the confidence is far from misplaced.
    

            Team USA could make it five gold medals in a row with a win in this year’s Olympic Games and with victory, this team will surely write its name in basketball history.

CNN_19,US history-making women’s Olympic gymnasts inspiring young hopefuls back home,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/sport/usa-womens-gymnastics-team-inspiring-back-home/index.html,2024-07-28 17:30:00,world,"
            The most diverse US women’s gymnastics team in history will begin competing this weekend at the Olympic Games, inspiring younger gymnasts in the process.
    

            Four of the five team members are women of color, according to USA Gymnastics, which deemed the team the most diverse in history.


            But far from Paris, at James Jones Gymnastics Academy (JJGA) in Jonesboro, Georgia, everyone — from the eponymous Jones himself to his gymnasts – are Black.
    

            The gym owner and coach said seeing this year’s diverse Olympic team competing at the highest level in a sport where their race has been underrepresented is inspiring.
    

            “It makes me feel wonderful,” Jones told CNN. “There are no more tokens. And that’s good. Everyone is there for their merit, and everyone has worked hard to get there. And they’re sharing the spotlight.”
    

            Four members from the Tokyo Games are returning: Seven-time Olympic medalist Simone Biles, three-time world medalist and reigning Olympic all-around champion Suni Lee, seven-time world medalist Jade Carey and 2020 Olympic team silver medalist Jordan Chiles. Rookie Hezly Rivera, 16, is the youngest member of Team USA’s delegation, according to USA Gymnastics.


            Jones said he had also seen the effect this Olympic team was having on his young gymnasts.
    

            “It motivates me and inspires me to work harder,” said Zuri Norwood, an 11-year-old competitive gymnast at JJGA. “If I keep on going and working harder, then I will become the best. And like them, they had to push through a lot of injuries and a lot of like, emotional stuff.”
    

            “Possibly racism,” her mother Danielle Saxon-Norwood chimed in.
    

            “Yeah, racism,” Zuri agreed, “but they worked through it. And I want to do the same.”
    

            Phoenix Rogers trains more than 20 hours a week at her gym in Chicago. Rogers, who has a Black mom and White dad, told CNN that seeing the Olympic team representing multiple races feels “powerful.”
    

            “To all gymnasts out there, no matter the color of your skin, it doesn’t really matter. Things are changing - and even if it’s in the smallest way - but it’s getting a little bit easier for people who aren’t White to achieve their goals,” Phoenix told CNN.
    

            The 12-year-old is a level 9 gymnast – meaning she’s been able to complete certain routines as laid out by USA Gymnastics – who started as a toddler with “mommy and me” classes. Her mom was not the typical parent, however, as Onnie Rogers had started competing in gymnastics when she was six years old and won the NCAA individual all-around title in gymnastics in 2001 while at UCLA.
    

            Rogers is now an associate professor in the Department of Comparative Human Development at the University of Chicago, specializing in cultural stereotypes, diversity and educational inequalities.
    

            During Rogers’ gymnastics career, she was often the only Black person on her team and one of very few in a whole arena at competitions, she said, and all of that was normalized.
    

            She told CNN white tape stood out distinctly on her brown skin, “flesh” colored undergarments were never the color of her flesh, and in photos, her image would often appear dark, among her well-lit White teammates.
    

            The US Olympic team’s diversity didn’t signify racism in the sport had gone, she said.
    

            “I think there’s been just time, representation, as well as the technical advocacy and disruption of racism that’s starting to allow us to see the talent and the breadth of diversity within the sport,” Rogers said.
    

            Betty Okino, a member of the bronze medal-winning 1992 US Olympic gymnastics team, told CNN that when she began competing for the national team she didn’t have Olympic role models who looked like her. She was on her own with her gymnastic dreams.
    

            “Whereas today, the next generation of kids growing up, that’s not a question anymore – if they can do gymnastics because they don’t see anybody else that looks like them,” said Okino.
    

             “You look at our team, our national team, and you see diversity across the board. Not only Black and Brown girls, but you see all of the different colors.”
    

            Corrinne Tarver is the first Black gymnast to win an NCAA all-around championship and currently the Head Women’s Gymnastics Coach at Fisk University, an historically Black college.
    

            “I was trying not to cry honestly when I saw the makeup of the team. I just kind of felt in my heart, I truly felt, ‘Wow, we’ve finally gotten somewhere,’” said Tarver.
    

            “We’re finally able to truly show the talent that we have, and it has nothing to do with the color of one’s skin. It has to do with what they do on the mat,” Tarver added.
    

            Back in Georgia, Jones said his all-Black team continued to experience inequity in various forms. At one gymnastics competition, he said an announcer had skipped his group during team announcements, the team’s name had been omitted from the list of competitors online and judges had doled out blatantly unfair scores.
    

            “There have been occasions where Zuri has done great routines, and I’m like, OK, that’s gonna do a 9.4, 9.5. And they’re like, 8.9. And I’m like, how?” said Jones. “Then a (White) gymnast gets up and falls off the beam completely. And she gets the same score.”
    

            Zuri’s brother Cruz Norwood, who’s 12 and competes alongside his sister around the country, told CNN that there were “a lot of barriers that we need to get past, like racism, with judges and scoring.”
    

            But they won’t let anything get in the way of winning medals or dreaming.

CNN_20,"California’s Park Fire now among state’s top 13 largest ever as it consumes 239,000 acres",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/us/california-park-fire-oregon-durkee-jasper/index.html,2024-07-28 18:29:00,us,"
Hot and dry weather is fueling wildfire activity in the Western United States and Canada, with fires damaging homes, causing injuries and forcing evacuations. The largest active wildfire in the US has scorched more than 280,000 acres in eastern Oregon and another blaze has exploded to more than 239,000 acres in California. Here’s the latest:


            • Park Fire roars across parts of Butte and Tehama counties, north of Sacramento, California: As of Friday evening, the Park Fire has burned more than 239,000 acres, or about 373 square miles, about the size of San Diego, which makes it the 13th largest in state history. More than 1,600 firefighters are working to slow its progress. Cal Fire reported the blaze was 0% contained Friday, with at least 20 structures destroyed and another 4,200 threatened. Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for both counties Friday. The state also secured a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to ensure there are enough resources to fight the fire.
    

            Billy See, incident commander for Cal Fire, said the fire is advancing at 4,000 to 5,000 acres per hour but with winds forecast to die down overnight and higher humidity moving into the area, See believes it will give firefighters a better chance to slow the fire down. He noted fire crews are working to hold the fire south of California Highway 36.
    

            The fire has forced road closures and mandatory evacuations in Butte County, where the state’s deadliest wildfire, the Camp Fire, killed more than 85 people and destroyed thousands of homes in 2018. Local officials cautioned it would take some time before people would be allowed back in their homes and urged residents to visit county websites for the most up-to-date information on evacuations and road closures.
    

            • Three firefighters injured and structures damaged: Three firefighters had minor heat-related injuries on Wednesday while fighting the Park Fire, Cal Fire Captain Dan Collins told CNN Thursday. They were treated and released, he said. Officials know structures have been damaged or destroyed by the fire, but there is no official count yet, Collins said.
    

• Man accused of starting California wildfire is arrested: A suspect has been arrested on suspicion of pushing a burning car 60 feet into a gully, “spreading flames” that caused what’s now become California’s largest wildfire of the year, authorities said. The Park Fire in the Butte County area has quickly burned an area larger than the city of Atlanta.
    

            • Firefighters battle massive Oregon fire: The Durkee Fire, which has burned more than 288,000 acres and is 20% contained as of Friday afternoon, started on July 17 near the Oregon-Idaho state line. The lightning-sparked fire is the largest of 34 large wildfires currently burning across Oregon, which has been the hardest hit by fires in recent days. More than 500 firefighters and resources from 22 states are working to fight the fire, according to InciWeb. Over the weekend and earlier this week, the Durkee Fire exhibited extreme fire behavior, even creating its own weather in the form of pyrocumulus clouds.
    

            • Oregon wildfire destroys buildings: Three people were injured and two homes and 12 other structures were destroyed as the fire spread, according to the Oregon Department of Emergency Management. Evacuations are still in effect in Baker County for areas around the Durkee Fire. Some communities do not have power, according to Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, who has deployed resources from the National Guard to assist. Dense smoke from the flames has also impeded traffic on Interstate 84, leading to periodic closure of the freeway. Wildfire smoke was spreading into Boise and beyond. Air quality alerts have been issued for parts of Colorado, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.
    

            • Wildfire engulfs tourist town in Canada: A fast-moving wildfire sent thousands of visitors and residents fleeing the town of Jasper in Alberta, where flames devastated up to half of the town’s structures. Officials say the losses are significant, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has deployed federal support to help battle the blaze. Cool temperatures and rain are expected to keep fire behavior low for the next 72 hours, which will help crews fight the blaze, Jasper National Park said on Facebook Thursday night.
    

            • Fire-conducive weather continues in Western US: Triple-digit heat and dry conditions across the West this week have made conditions poor for firefighters actively fighting to contain the 89 large wildfires burning nationwide. “Many wildfires in the Northwest area continue to exhibit active to extreme fire behavior, with evacuation orders in effect on 17 wildfires. Several teams are managing multiple fire starts as complexes. Evacuation orders are also in effect for several fires in California, the Northern Rockies and the Great Basin,” the National Interagency Fire Center said. Conditions will begin to improve for much of the West over the weekend as cooler temperatures and higher humidity levels arrive in the area.
    

            Some families have found themselves displaced as the Park Fire raged near Chico, a city in northern California, burning homes and forcing evacuations.
    

            A former news anchor told CNN affiliate KOVR she watched her Butte County house burn down live through security camera footage.
    

            “There is no rhyme or reason. Our house is gone, their house is okay. The house next to it, you can see it’s gone,” Julia Yarbough said.
    

            Looking at the remnants of her home, Yarbough said she felt numb.
    

            “It’s surreal,” she said. “It probably won’t hit me till later, I’m pretty sure.”
    

            Cal Fire initially estimated the fire had destroyed more than 100 structures, but later said crews on the ground have so far confirmed 20 structures destroyed as work to assess the damage continues.
    

            Triple-digit temperatures and high wind gusts have fueled the explosive growth of the Park Fire amid an active fire season in California. An estimated 343,253 acres have burned across the state so far in 2024, compared to 22,439 acres burned by this time last year, according to Cal Fire.
    

            A 42-year-old man, identified as Ronnie Dean Stout II, has been arrested after being accused of igniting the inferno.
    

            Witnesses reported seeing someone “pushing a car that was on fire into a gully near the Alligator Hole in upper Bidwell Park shortly before 3:00 p.m. yesterday,” Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said Thursday. “The car went down an embankment approximately 60 feet and burned completely, spreading flames that caused the Park Fire.”
    

            The DA says the man was seen “calmly leaving the area by blending in with the other citizens who were in the area and fleeing the rapidly evolving fire.” Stout was later arrested at a mobile home park in Chico, Ramsey said.
    

            Stout will likely face an arson charge, though it is unclear what count, or whether any enhancements will be added, Ramsey said. The DA’s office told CNN Stout has not retained an attorney and will be assigned a public defender at his arraignment.
    

            He was previously convicted of second degree robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and drug paraphernalia possession in Kern County, according to criminal records. He was sentenced to 21 years in prison. He was released on parole in 2018, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation confirmed to CNN.
    

            He was also convicted of lewd or lascivious acts on a child under 14 in Butte County, records show.
    

            In Jasper, a popular tourist town in Alberta, 25,000 residents and visitors were forced to evacuate from a fast-moving blaze that has damaged 30 to 50% of the town’s structures, officials said during a news conference Thursday.
    

            “Homes and businesses have been lost to a wildfire that people are calling a ‘wall of flames,’” Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said.
    

            An “enormous wind gust” moved the wildfire roughly about 3 miles in “probably less than 30 minutes,” Alberta Minister of Public Safety & Emergency Services Mike Ellis said during the press conference. This created “a wall of fire that was about 100 meters high.”
    

            “Any firefighter will tell you there is little to nothing you can do when you have a wall of flames coming at you like that. Nobody anticipated that fire to come so fast, so large,” Ellis said.
    

            Two wildfires converged in the Jasper National Park area, becoming what authorities are referring to as the Jasper Wildfire Complex. It remains difficult to measure exactly how big the complex – which also includes a third nearby fire – is due to extreme fire behavior and thick smoke cover. Together, the fires have swallowed an estimated 89,000 acres, the Jasper National Park said.
    

            Damage wrought by the flames will result in “a significant rebuild and significant displacement,” Smith said. The most significant structural damage lies on the west side of town, according to a Facebook post from Jasper National Park.

            “We will recover from this,” Smith said while holding back tears. “To those in Alberta and around the world who have experienced the magic of Jasper, the magic is not lost, and it never will be.”
    

            The vast majority of evacuees were “visitors with other places to return to,” Ellis said. Along with about 5,000 residents who live in the town, 2.48 million people visited Jasper National Park last year.
    

            Jasper Mayor Richard Ireland said residents will work together to rebuild after the wildfire “ravaged our beloved community.”
    

            “Your resilience and strength have always been the backbone of our community. In the coming days and weeks, we will rally together, support one another, and begin the daunting process of recovery,” Ireland said in a statement on Thursday.
    

            Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said all federal agencies are working together to provide resources to Jasper, support evacuations and strengthen response efforts on the ground.
    

            “Our governments are working together to keep Albertans safe and supported through this,” he said on Facebook.

CNN_21,Venezuelans vote in crucial election as opposition challenges Maduro,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/americas/venezuela-presidential-election-polls-open-intl-latam/index.html,2024-07-28 18:24:00,world,"
            Venezuelans headed to the polls on Sunday to vote in a highly consequential presidential election where the country’s longtime strongman, Nicolas Maduro, will face one of his greatest political challenges yet, say analysts.
    

            Maduro, who took the mantle of the ruling Chavismo movement after his predecessor Hugo Chavez’s death in 2013, is seeking his third consecutive six-year term in office. Of the nine other candidates running for the presidency, his biggest challenger is a unified opposition movement that overcame their divisions to form a coalition known as the Democratic Unitary Platform.
    

            The opposition movement has maintained its momentum despite sustained government repression, in which their first-choice candidate, María Corina Machado, was disqualified from running. Machado, an avowed capitalist who has promised privatization of several state industries, has since rallied for her replacement, the soft-spoken former diplomat Edmundo González Urrutia.
    

            The vote has come at a crucial moment for Venezuela, which has experienced violent repression under Maduro’s watch and the worst economic collapse of a peacetime country in recent history. The oil-rich nation, once the fifth-largest economy in Latin America, has seen its economy shrink in the last decade to the equivalent of a medium-sized city, according to data from the International Monetary Fund. 


            Punishing sanctions on the regime by the United States and European Union have failed to topple the populist incumbent, who argues that Venezuela’s woes are due to being a victim of an “economic war.”
    

            Around eight million Venezuelans have fled the country amid shortages of vital goods and soaring inflation.
    

            There has been mounting concern that the opposition will not see a fair contest as Maduro’s government controls all public institutions in Venezuela and has been accused of rigging previous votes, which it denied. Experts note, however, that concerns of vote tampering may be mitigated by the planned presence of opposition party representatives at each polling station.

            The election campaign has seen at least 71 people arbitrarily detained – the majority of whom provided some sort of service to the opposition – and a dozen online media outlets blocked within the country, according to human rights organization Laboratorio de Paz.
    

            The government has also created significant impediments for the millions of Venezuelans abroad to vote, including widely unattainable passport and residency requirements.
    

            A limited group of election observers, including a team from The Carter Center – a non-profit organization set up by former US President Jimmy Carter – will be on the ground. But several international election observers have announced this week that they will no longer travel to Venezuela to monitor the vote.
    

            Latin American leaders, including Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, have called on Maduro to commit to stepping down if he loses. Venezuelan opposition figures have also appealed to the country’s military, that has long supported Maduro and his predecessor, to respect the results. The Venezuelan leader has said his victory will ensure “peace” in the country.
    

            How the army reacts to the outcome could be an important factor in any scenario, but analysts say it impossible to parse where it stands.
    

            “The military is absolutely key. But I must also say that the military is very hermetic, [and] it is very difficult to access information about what it is thinking,” Laura Cristina Dib, the Venezuela Program Director of Venezuela Program at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), told CNN.
    

            Polls will close at 6 p.m ET.

CNN_22,Hungary’s Orban says Russia stands to gain as ‘irrational’ West loses power,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/europe/hungary-viktor-orban-russia-irrational-west-intl/index.html,2024-07-28 19:08:00,world,"
            Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Saturday Russia’s leadership was “hyper rational” and that Ukraine would never be able to fulfil its hopes of becoming a member of the European Union or NATO.
    

            Orban, a nationalist in power since 2010, made the comments during a speech in which he forecast a shift in global power away from the “irrational” West towards Asia and Russia.
    

            “In the next long decades, maybe centuries, Asia will be the dominant centre of the world,” Orban said, mentioning China, India, Pakistan and Indonesia as the world’s future big powers.
    

            “And we Westerners pushed the Russians into this bloc as well,” he said in the televised speech before ethnic Hungarians at a festival in the town of Baile Tusnad in neighbouring Romania.

            Orban, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, has sharply differed from the rest of the bloc by seeking warmer ties with Beijing and Moscow, and he angered some EU leaders when he went on surprise visits to Kyiv, Moscow and Beijing this month for talks on the war in Ukraine.
    

            He said that in contrast to the “weakness” of the West, Russia’s position in world affairs was rational and predictable, saying the country had shown economic flexibility in adapting to Western sanctions since it invaded Crimea in 2014.
    

            Orban, whose own government has passed a number of anti-LGBT measures, said Russia had gained clout in many parts of the world by cracking down on LGBTQ+ rights.
    

            “The strongest international appeal of Russian soft power is its opposition to LGBTQ,” he said.
    

            He added that Ukraine would never become a member of the EU or NATO because “we Europeans do not have enough money for that”.
    

            “The EU needs to give up its identity as a political project and become an economic and defence project,” Orban added.
    

            The EU opened membership talks with Ukraine late last month, although a long and tough road lies ahead of the country before it can join the bloc.
    

            A declaration at the end of the NATO summit this month said the alliance will support Ukraine on “its irreversible path” towards membership.

            She appeared in pain, walking with a heavy limp, but still managed to twist through the air with her usual force on every other apparatus, scoring an impressive 15.800 on the vault, 14.433 on the uneven bars and 14.600 on the floor.
    

            Overall, she registered an all-around score of 59.566, the highest total as of yet and more than three points ahead of her teammate Suni Lee, though she and the USA team won’t have a confirmed spot in the finals until later on Sunday once every country has completed its qualifying round.
    

            When asked by reporters if she was OK following competition on Sunday, Biles sad, “Yup! As good as I can be.” She didn’t stick around to talk further.
    

            Biles has endured a long and much documented road back to the Olympics, the competition where she experienced a mental block known as “the twisties” that forced her to withdraw from multiple events, including the women’s team final, three years ago in Tokyo.
    

            Biles kept moving throughout much of Sunday’s qualifying, rarely taking time to sit unless she was getting training, in an attempt to keep her ankle loose. While she was obviously in discomfort through the day’s final three rotations, she hardly slowed down and moved with the explosiveness that is her trademark.
    

            Once she completed all her routines, joy seemed to radiate from Biles as she grinned, waved to the crowd and danced in celebration with her teammates.
    

            She ended the second subdivision of the day leading in the all-around competition and having the top scores on the vault and floor routine – both of which came after her apparent injury – and the second-best score on the balance beam.
    

            Gymnastics qualifying continues throughout the day on Sunday, so it won’t be until the evening in Paris for it to be clear who will go through to the medal competition on Tuesday.

CNN_24,A man missing for 14 days in Kentucky’s wilderness was found on the last day of the search for him,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/us/missing-hiker-rescue-kentucky-wilderness/index.html,2024-07-28 20:49:00,us,"
            An Ohio man was found alive after 14 days in the rough terrain of a Kentucky forest, just as crews were starting to lose hope, rescuers said.
    

            There was a shoe print and evidence of a walking stick in an area few people traverse, the search group said in a Facebook post on July 20.
    

            On the last day of the search mission in the Red River Gorge, the Wolfe County Search & Rescue Team bushwacked through dense forest and up a creek when they found a sign of life.
    

            The team of five rescuers heard a yell for help in the woods. Once they reached the voice, it turned out to be Scott Hern, the missing man.
    

            The moment the good news came over the radio was “exhilarating,” Wolfe County Search and Rescue Chief John May told CNN.
    

            “An inexperienced hiker in a wilderness area for 14 days without food or water, nobody really expected to find him alive like we did,” he said. “It’s really just a miracle that he survived.”
    

            Hern, 48, was last seen in the woods off Tower Rock Trail on July 6, the rescue group said. His family in Ironton, Ohio, which is about 100 miles northeast of the gorge, hadn’t heard from him since that date.
    

            A US Forest Service officer saw Hern’s truck on the Saturday when he went hiking in the Red River Gorge – and the same ranger saw it again when he returned to duty a week later on July 13, Wolfe County Search and Rescue Chief John May told CNN.
    

            “When he ran his license plate, that’s what kind of triggered this whole event because there was a missing persons report filed in Ohio where he was actually missing from,” May told CNN affiliate WLEX.

            The search began on July 16, when Hern’s family realized where he had gone and contacted the search group, May told CNN.
    

            CNN reached out to Hern’s family on Thursday but has not heard back.
    

            That night, a team searched for Hern until after midnight, but they couldn’t find him, the Wolfe County rescue group posted on Facebook. “Darkness and fog” made visibility difficult on the rugged, off-trail area, they said.
    

            Twenty-five members from three rescue crews and two canine units tried again the next day without luck. And four dog crews tried the day after that.
    

            Eric Wolterman said a prayer as he and the Wolfe County Search & Rescue Team headed out on Saturday, July 20, two weeks since Hern went missing. He and his teammates went into the search thinking it would be a recovery day, he wrote on Facebook.
    

            “It was going to be the final day of searching whether we located anything or not. We were in the roughest terrain you could imagine and it’s very dangerous for anyone to even be out there,” he wrote.

            Hern’s diary, provided by his family, pointed the search team to Bell Falls. The team had already searched there, but they decided to go north up a creek, the group said.
    

            After spotting footprints, someone on the team heard a faint noise, Wolterman recalled. They shouted again, thinking it was another search team.
    

            “Help,” Wolterman said he heard.
    

            As the team got closer, they asked for the person’s name. “Scott Hern,” he said.
    

            “My name is Eric, I’m with Wolfe County search and rescue, you are safe, we are going to get you out of here,” said Wolterman, who was the first one to reach Hern.
    

            Hern looked at him and thanked him before asking for a hug, Wolterman said.
    

            “I think it was the best hug of both of our lives,” he wrote.
    

            Finding out Hern was alive, despite the odds, changed the tone of the operation and sent energy through the crew, May said.
    

            “That extra boost of energy kind of kicked in when we heard that he was alive now just shifted (to) let’s figure out how to get him out of there as quickly as we can,” he said.
    

            The area proved to be a challenge, as waterfalls with drop-offs and a narrow trail would have made carrying him out dangerous, May said. Hern was also tucked into an overgrown area.
    

            Instead of carrying Hern out, rescuers decided it would be safer for everyone to hoist him out by air, May said. They called in the Kentucky State Police, who extracted Hern by helicopter.
    

            “We’ve never encountered anyone that has been lost for 14 days and found alive. So, it’s definitely unusual,” May told CNN.
    

            Hern carried six bottles of water with him that day – and there were six empty bottles in his backpack when the crew got there, May said. After July 8, Hern told rescuers he didn’t eat or drink anything, as his mouth was too dry to do so.
    

            Hern was “extremely dehydrated” and “his feet were in really bad shape” from blisters and bug bites, May said. Hern couldn’t walk when they discovered him.
    

            Despite being lost in the woods in rough terrain, Hern had a few advantages working in his favor, May said.
    

            “He’s a heavier gentleman, so he had some reservoirs there. He did take in those six bottles of water with him – that helped him for the first couple of days,” May said. “Where we located Mr. Hern was under a rock shelter.”
    

            The rock shelter up against the cliff line kept Hearn out of the direct sun and safe from the elements, he explained.
    

            May did not know if Hern was able to retrieve water dropping into the cave, as they hadn’t spoken about it, he said.
    

            Hern was hospitalized and was not able to walk on his own, the rescue group wrote on Facebook on July 22, two days after his rescue.
    

            Hern beamed with a smile in his navy-blue hospital gown with his walker in a photo the family shared with the rescue group.
    

            “I think he’s going to make a full recovery,” May said. “It’s just going to take a little time to get real food in him, rehydrate him, get his feet in better condition and we think he’ll be good to go.”

CNN_25,Putin says planned US deployment of long-range missiles in Germany is ‘reminiscent’ of Cold War,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/europe/putin-us-missiles-germany-cold-war-intl/index.html,2024-07-28 20:53:00,world,"
            Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that the United States’ and Germany’s decision to deploy US long-range missiles in Germany from 2026 is “reminiscent of the events of the Cold War” and could see Russia station similar missiles in response.
    

            “If the United States of America implements such plans, we will consider ourselves free from the unilateral moratorium on the deployment of medium and shorter-range strike weapons, including increasing the capabilities of the coastal forces of our Navy,” said Putin, speaking at Russia’s annual Navy Day in St. Petersburg.
    

            Putin said that the US and Germany’s decision to begin “episodic deployments” of the long-range missile capabilities from its Multi-Domain Task Force in Germany starting in 2026 would put Russian infrastructure within the reach of the to-be-deployed missiles.

            “This situation is reminiscent of the events of the Cold War related to the deployment of Pershing medium-range missiles in Europe,” he said.
    

            Pershing II missiles, designed to deliver nuclear warheads, were deployed by the US Army at American bases in West Germany from 1983 to the alarm of the then Soviet leadership.
    

            They were withdrawn with the introduction of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) in 1988.
    

            Putin added that the development of Russian medium and shorter-range strike weapons was “in the final stages,” and Russia would take “reciprocal measures to deploy them.”
    

            The US and Germany in July issued a joint statement on the deployment of weapons systems in Germany, saying that “when fully developed, these conventional long-range fire units will include SM-6, Tomahawk, and developmental hypersonic weapons, which have significantly longer range than current land-based fires in Europe.”
    

            Russia has repeatedly threatened to end its self-declared moratorium on fielding both “short range” and “intermediate range” land-based ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and missile launchers that could be used to carry either nuclear or conventional payloads.
    

            Announcing the moratorium after the US withdrew from the INF in 2019, Russian deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said “Russia will refrain from deploying these systems when we acquire them unless the American equipment is deployed in certain regions.”
    

            The treaty, which the US and Europe accused Moscow frequently violating, banned such missiles and was seen as a centerpiece of European security since the Cold War.
    

            Russia soon followed the US in withdrawing from the treaty, sparking concerns of a new arms race.

CNN_26,Simone Biles fights through calf injury to produce impressive performance on Olympic return,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/sport/simone-biles-return-paris-olympics-2024-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-28 20:04:00,world,"
            Simone Biles fought through pain in her calf on Sunday to post an impressive all-around score and display the qualities which have made one of the greatest gymnasts of all time on her return to the Olympics.
    

            After she produced a flawless balance beam routine which scored 14.733 – the highest on the apparatus – Biles landed awkwardly while warming up for her floor routine and exited the arena before reemerging to get her lower left leg heavily taped.
    

            Cecile Landi, her coach, told reporters after the competition that Biles had been dealing with calf pain a couple weeks before Paris that flared up again during Sunday’s competition.
    

            “She felt a little something in her calf. But yeah, that’s all,” Landi told reporters.

            Biles has endured a long and much documented road back to the Olympics, the competition where she experienced a mental block known as “the twisties” that forced her to withdraw from multiple events, including the women’s team final, three years ago in Tokyo.

            “Simone was great. She was outstanding,” said Chellsie Memmel, the technical gymnastics lead for USA Gymnastics, to reporters following the competition. “That’s how she trains. I mean, she comes out and she comes into the gym and she does her job. She did that at podium (training). She just did it again here. So she’s fun to watch.”
    

            Memmel told reporters that she couldn’t publicly repeat the thoughts that went through her head after Biles appeared in pain, but was impressed by the star’s gritty performance.
    

            “She is an outstanding gymnast and person – just, like, overall human – so what she was able to do with looking like she you know, had some soreness or something in her lower leg. It is remarkable,” Memmel said.

Wednesday﻿The Federal Reserve will wrap up its two-day meeting on interest rates. Policymakers are widely expected to hold the line, but recent economic data indicates that the central bank is about to stick what’s called a “soft landing,” which is when inflation returns to the Fed’s 2% target without a recession. Last week, one of the Fed’s closely watched gauges of inflation showed that price hikes are slowing to near that level. That came on the heels of a separate report showing that Gross Domestic Product, the broadest measure of economic output, was much stronger in the second quarter than economists had predicted — which has Wall Street betting that the Fed will decide to cut rates in its September 17-18 meeting.

CNN_28,The Israel-Hezbollah war that no one wants could finally blow up,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-war-blow-up-analysis-intl/index.html,2024-07-28 22:47:00,world,"
            Back in May, Amos Hochstein, US President Joe Biden’s point-man for keeping a lid on tensions between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, spoke in a webinar.
    

            “What I worry about every single day,” he said, “is that a miscalculation or an accident… hits a bus full of children, or hits another kind of civilian target, that could force the political system in either country to retaliate in a way that slides us into war. Even though both sides probably understand that a fuller or deeper-scale war is in neither side’s interest.”
    

            The equivalent of that bus came on Saturday evening in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
    

            A rocket, which Israel says was launched by Hezbollah from Chebaa in southern Lebanon, slammed into a soccer pitch in the Druze town of Majdal Shams. Twelve children, ranging in age from 10 to 16, were killed while taking part in a training session. Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the strike. Will Hochstein’s fear of a fuller-scale war now also come to pass?
    

            If Israel’s Foreign Minister, Israel Katz, is to be believed, it probably will. “We are approaching the moment of an all-out war against Hezbollah,” he said in an Israeli television interview on Saturday evening. “The response to this event will be accordingly.”
    

            The United States has apparently blessed retaliatory action, to some degree. “We stand by Israel’s right to defend its citizens from terrorist attacks,” said Secretary of State Antony Blinken, before adding that the US did not want to “see the conflict escalate.”
    

            The response, so far, has been relatively timid. More strikes will probably follow. “We’re fed up with lofty rhetoric and hollow words accompanied by feeble action,” former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett told CNN. “The only way to stop all of this, the only way to deter our enemies from hitting us… is to fight back and to hit them. There’s no other way.”

Israel says Hezbollah will ‘pay the price’ after blaming it for attack on soccer field that killed 12 children


            For months now, the international community has been trying to de-escalate tensions between Israel and Hezbollah. With Iran’s strongest proxy estimated to have at least 150,000 missiles and rockets pointing south, the fear is of a war that would devastate Lebanon, and do serious damage to Israel.
    

            Moreover, as Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told CNN, “it has the potential to create a situation that we have never seen in this region: a major regional war, which could draw in the Gulf”. He warns it could also lead to direct confrontation between the United States and Iran.
    

            And yet, over the past near-10 months of fighting, Israel, Hezbollah and Iran have always pulled back from what appeared to be the brink. In January, Israel took out a senior Hamas leader in Beirut. All-out war failed to materialise. In April, Israel killed a top commander in the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRCHG) in Damascus. In response, Iran launched unprecedented strikes on Israel. All-out war failed to materialise.
    

            The status quo, of course, can’t continue either. Tens of thousands of Israelis have been displaced from their homes. Large swathes of northern Israel are like ghost towns. A similar picture plays out in southern Lebanon. The best way to avoid all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah, says Blinken, is to get a ceasefire in Gaza. Talks aimed at achieving that resume on Sunday.
    

            But that would only be a short-term fix. Israel wants to remove the Hezbollah threat entirely, moving it back to the Litani River, in accordance with the UN Security Council Resolution that ended the last major war between the two in 2006. “If the world doesn’t get Hezbollah away from the border, Israel will do it,” said Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in December.
    

            And so despite the bombast, domestic pressures, the fears and the escalations, the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah continues to simmer rather than boil over. No one seems to want this war. But as Hochstein warned in that same webinar: “Wars have started historically around the world even when leaders didn’t want them, because they had no choice.”

CNN_29,"Fact check: Trump revives false claim that he, not Minnesota’s governor, deployed the National Guard to Minneapolis in 2020",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/politics/fact-check-minnesota-trump-speech-national-guard/index.html,2024-07-28 23:50:00,politics,"
            Former President Donald Trump has revived his four-year-old false claim about how he and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz handled the civil unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020.
    

            Walz is among the Democrats whom sources say Vice President Kamala Harris is considering as a potential running mate. Trump, the Republican nominee, claimed during a Saturday campaign speech in Minnesota: “Every voter in Minnesota needs to know that when the violent mobs of anarchists and looters and Marxists came to burn down Minneapolis four years ago — remember me? I couldn’t get your governor to act. He’s supposed to call in the National Guard or the Army. And he didn’t do it. I couldn’t get your governor. So I sent in the National Guard to save Minneapolis.” (Trump went on to criticize Harris for her own response to the unrest.)
    

            CNN fact-checked this Trump story in July 2020. But he has repeated the tale on multiple subsequent occasions, including an abbreviated version during his June 2024 presidential debate with President Joe Biden.
    

Facts First: Trump’s claims that he sent the National Guard to Minneapolis in 2020 and that Walz refused to do so are both wrong. Walz, not Trump, sent the National Guard to Minneapolis — and Walz first deployed the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself. 


            The Minnesota National Guard, the entity that Walz deployed, is under the command of the governor, not the president. The president has the power to federalize states’ Guard troops under certain circumstances, but Trump never did so during the 2020 unrest in Minnesota.
    

            After Trump began telling this false story in June 2020, Walz spokesperson Teddy Tschann provided a statement to CNN in the form of a question-and-answer sheet. It said, among other things: “Did President Trump ‘call out’ the Guard? No.” “Did Gov. Walz call out the Guard? Yes.” “Did Gov. Walz call out the National Guard at the direction of the President? No. He activated the Minnesota National Guard at the request of the Mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, before he talked to the White House.”
    

Evidence shows Trump’s claim is false


            Public evidence confirms that Walz, who served in the Army National Guard from 1981 to 2005, deployed the Guard himself in May 2020.
    

            Floyd was killed on May 25, 2020. There were protests in Minneapolis on May 26, 2020, some of them involving violence. And there was looting, violence and arson, along with peaceful protest, on May 27, 2020.
    

            On May 28, 2020, Walz issued a press release just after 4 p.m. local time announcing he had signed an executive order activating the Minnesota National Guard. At 4:13 p.m. local time that day, the Minnesota National Guard announced on social media that adjutant general Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen had said, “We are ready and prepared to answer the Governor’s request. We are currently in process of assigning and preparing units to respond.”
    

            At 10:41 p.m. local time that night, after a Minneapolis police precinct building was set on fire, the Minnesota National Guard announced that “we have activated more than 500 soldiers to St. Paul, Minneapolis and surrounding communities.”
    

            Then, at 11:53 p.m. local time, Trump posted twice on social media.
    

            In one post, Trump threatened to send in the Guard if Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey did not “get his act together and bring the City under control.” In the other post, Trump wrote, “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!”
    

            In neither post did Trump claim to have been the person who sent in the Guard. He began publicly making such claims in June 2020.
    

            Walz has been criticized by both Republicans and some Democrats for his handling of the unrest. Frey said in August 2020 that he had verbally asked Walz on the evening of May 27, 2020 to send in the Guard but that Walz had hesitated; Walz pushed back on Frey’s account, saying the mayor’s May 27, 2020 comments on the call had not constituted an official request, which came in writing the next day.
    

            Regardless of what happened in their conversation or the merits of how Walz managed the crisis, it is indisputable that Walz, not Trump, was the person who activated the Guard. Similarly, while it’s possible that Trump’s public pressure contributed to Walz’s May 30, 2020 decision to greatly increase the size of the deployment by mobilizing the entire Minnesota National Guard — though Walz’s office denied in 2020 that Trump had anything to do with it —  this increase, too, was indisputably Walz’s act, not Trump’s.

CNN_30,What Gov. Gavin Newsom’s order to clear homeless encampments means for the people who live in them,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/us/homeless-encampments-gavin-newsom-california/index.html,2024-07-28 23:18:00,us,"
            After California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a directive ordering state officials to take down homeless encampments, John Janosko returned to a dead-end street in Oakland where he once lived for years in one of the state’s largest camps.
    

            Longtime residents of the makeshift shelters at the sprawling Wood Street encampment have largely moved on since state and local officials razed it two years ago. Some ended up in tiny cabins provided by the city. A handful, like Janosko, have recently secured permanent housing with the help of nonprofits.
    

            But many of the 200 or so regulars remain unhoused, according to Janosko. They sleep in cars, RVs and handmade dwellings erected behind a Target store up the road and other parts of West Oakland.
    

            “The sad thing is most people on the street I came across don’t even understand,” the governor’s directive, said Janosko, 55, a chef and caterer before losing his apartment and ending up on the street for a decade. “It’s just somebody saying they’re going to make their lives even harder. It’s a hammer on the head day in and day out.”
    

            The mallet dropped again on Thursday when the Democratic governor of the state with the nation’s largest homeless population ordered officials to begin dismantling thousands of encampments. The move came after the US Supreme Court ruled last month in favor of an Oregon city that ticketed homeless people for sleeping outside. The ruling rejected arguments that such “anti-camping” ordinances violated the Constitution’s ban on “cruel and unusual” punishment.

What we know about the governor’s order to clear homeless encampments in California


            “There are simply no more excuses. It’s time for everyone to do their part,” said Newsom, directing state agencies to “adopt humane and dignified policies” and “move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them.”
    

            Homeless advocates and some elected officials immediately voiced outrage, saying the crackdown – without providing adequate shelter and other services – would simply move people to other areas in a state where the cost of living is high and the number of shelter beds limited.
    

            “Governor Newsom, where do you expect people to go? This is a shameful moment in California history,” said Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the parent organization of the Housing is a Human Right initiative, accusing the governor  of “criminalizing poverty” and “doubling down on failed policies.”
    

             California has the largest homeless population in the nation, with more than 180,000 of the estimated 653,000 people experiencing homelessness nationwide residing in the Golden State, according to a 2023 report to Congress from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.
    

            An estimated 653,100 people were experiencing homelessness nationwide – a jump of around 12% since 2022, according to the report.
    

            “A lot of my friends out there just sort of just shake their heads, like, ‘OK, well, how do I get through my next hour? How am I going to eat, you know? How am I going to get high or whatever it might be?’” Janosko said.
    

            “It’s like, OK, I’m going to lose all my sh*t again. Nobody gives a f**k about us. You get so used to the sweeps. People are so beat down. What can they do?”
    

            A point-in-time count taken in January 2023 found California had 71,131 shelter beds for an estimated 181,399 people experiencing homelessness – a deficit of more than 110,000 beds, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.


            At a time when many large American cities are closely watching California as they too struggle with burgeoning homelessness, the Golden State is locked in a desperate grapple with mushrooming encampments despite pouring billions of dollars into housing programs.
    

            California has spent more than $30 billion on housing-related programs in recent years as the annual growth of its homeless population outpaces that of any other state in the nation.
    

            “It’s kind of putting the cart before the horse and you can’t really resolve the underlying issue, which is homelessness, by doing encampment resolutions,” said Sarah Hunter, director of the Rand Center on Housing and Homelessness. “It’s kind of backward just to try to move people … Where are they going to go? We should be building enough resources to place these people before we try to move them around.”
    

            Hunter is a co-author of a new Rand Corp. study which found encampment clearing efforts in Los Angeles had no long-term effect on the number of people on the streets.
    

            The researchers looked at camp cleanups in Venice, Hollywood and Skid Row in Los Angeles and “observed temporary declines in the unsheltered population that lasted two to three months on average” before returning to previous levels, according to the study.

            In Venice, for instance, encampment removals meant “the share of unhoused people living literally unsheltered (e.g., without a tent) increased from 20 percent to 46 percent,” the study said.
    

            “It’s just going to be kind of where there’s enforcement, people won’t be there and where there’s less enforcement or no enforcement, that’s where people will be because we haven’t yet solved the underlying crises, which is having enough health and social support along with actual housing for these people to go,” Hunter told CNN.
    

            Involuntary displacements from encampments, Hunter said, “can substantially increase morbidity and mortality” among the homeless and “increased costs to society through hospitalizations.”
    

            “This is probably not the most cost-effective approach that we could be using,” she said of the crackdowns.
    

            Researchers at Boston and Cornell universities, in a policy brief last year, said “punitive policing strategies” such as encampment removals “do not reduce or end homelessness.”
    

            “Such strategies often worsen homelessness. For example, fines and fees make it harder to access employment and social services; in some cases criminal charges impact peoples’ eligibility for existing social services and housing programs,” the researchers said.
    

            “Property confiscation during encampment clearance may come at the expense of documents that are essential for obtaining housing, employment, insurance, like birth certificates and identification,” they added, noting a link between criminal arrests and cycles of homelessness.

Gov. Gavin Newsom issues executive order for removal of homeless encampments in California


Newsom’s order directs, but does not mandate, agencies and departments to adopt “policies and plans consistent” with the existing encampment policy of the state Department of Transportation (Caltrans).
    

            Caltrans will provide “advance notice of clearance and works with local service providers to support those experiencing homelessness at the encampment, and stores personal property collected at the site” for at least 60 days, Newsom’s office said. 


            Janosko, in Oakland, is doubtful.
    

            “You go out there to any homeless encampment or any homeless person in America, especially in California, you ask them, ‘Were you able to go retrieve any of your stuff?’ No. They take everything and throw it in a dumpster,” he said.
    

            Newsom’s order encourages local governments to use some state funds for housing and intervention programs to remove encampments, prioritizing those that pose the greatest danger to people living in and around them.
    

            Janosko, referring to the crackdown, said: “It’s a cleanup tactic where the voters live and where the voters shop … I know people out there, their voices aren’t being heard. I was lucky enough to have a strong support system. I’m in a better position now to amplify the voices of the unheard.”
    

            Late last month, the results of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority’s point-in-time count – conducted in January – showed the homeless population in Los Angeles had dropped for the first time in six years. It showed overall homelessness and in particular unsheltered homelessness was down in both Los Angeles County and the city. According to the count, homelessness was down 2.2% in the Los Angeles and 0.27% in the county.
    

            Still, there were 45,253 homeless people counted in the city and 75,312 people unhoused in the county, the authority reported.
    

            “For the first time in years, unsheltered homelessness has decreased in Los Angeles because of a comprehensive approach that leads with housing and services, not criminalization,” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said Thursday. “Strategies that just move people along from one neighborhood to the next or give citations instead of housing do not work.”
    

            An audit by Los Angeles City Controller Kenneth Mejia found the number of interim housing beds in the city last year was about 16,000 for an unhoused population nearly three times that size. 


            On Friday, a sweltering 90-degree day in Los Angeles, a soft spoken 52-year-old homeless man who only gave his first name – Jonathan – sought shade under a billowing sheet tethered to an old bed frame.
    

            “If the Governor says go, I will. But I don’t know how it’s going to work,” said Jonathan, whose decades living on the street included a stay at a transitional housing shelter he found too controlling.
    

            Several miles away, in Griffith Park, a woman named Sha was lying under the shade of a tree with another homeless friend. She said she has been on the street five years. She grew frustrated speaking about the temporary shelter where she’s staying with her cat as she struggles to find permanent housing.
    

            Her message to Newsom: “What are you planning on doing with people? We’re people. We’re still people like you… But without a stable foundation.”
    

            In Oakland, more than 370 miles north, Janosko said he had been living in a small cabin for two people since the city in 2023 dismantled the sprawling Wood Street camp that stood beneath Interstate 880. In March, he said, he signed a lease for his own apartment, a small one-bedroom in East Oakland.
    

            “It’s a beautiful little place,” said Janosko, who has battled drug addiction for years. “I love it.”
    

            But, Janosko said, he is haunted by guilt over finally having his own place coupled with the trauma of eviction.
    

            “I just wish that everybody else could be able to have that security in their lives,” he said. “And I’m so used to living in a space where I have access to all my friends. The daily struggle on the ground is a little bit different than a daily struggle living in an apartment, you know, on the second floor.”
    

            Janosko fears a wave of encampment raids will only worsen homelessness in the state.
    

            “Every time that you like regain a tent and maybe some blankets and a couple of outfits and just get enough stuff around you to start to really feel – I’m not going to say normal – like you have a safety zone, it’s gone,” he said.
    

            “Even though it’s a tent and a few things, as soon as you get to that point, in that moment, it’s wiped out again… Nobody’s asking the question. The voters, the people. Where are the people going? If they’re not in my neighborhood now, then whose neighborhood are they going to if you don’t have enough shelter beds in your city?”

CNN_31,What is the Golan Heights and who are the Druze?,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/druze-golan-heights-israel-occupied-attack-explainer-intl/index.html,2024-07-29 00:24:00,world,"
            Tensions between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah have reached new heights in the wake of a deadly rocket attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
    

            The strike on Saturday hit a soccer field in the Arab town of Majdal Shams, home to a large Druze community, and killed at least 12 children, according to Israel.
    

            Israel blamed Hezbollah for the attack and vowed to retaliate. The Iran-backed group denied being behind the strike.
    

            Here’s what to know about the Golan Heights, and the religious and ethnic Druze minority that fell victim to the attack.
    

            The Golan Heights is a strategic plateau that Israeli seized from Syria during the Six-Day War in 1967, before formally annexing it in 1981. The hilly landscape, which spans some 500 square miles, also shares a border with Jordan and Lebanon.
    

            Syria’s capital Damascus is visible from atop the rocky Golan. The Israeli-occupied part of the region is separated from Syria by a buffer zone supported by the United Nations.
    

            The Golan Heights is considered to be occupied territory under international law and UN Security Council resolutions, and Syria continues to demand it be returned.
    

            The area has often been a flashpoint, most recently in 2019 when former President Donald Trump said the US will recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights – a move that overturned years of policy and worsened tensions with Syria.
    

            Israel sees the Golan Heights as key to its national security interests and says it needs to control the region to fend off threats from Syria and Iranian proxy groups there.
    

            Saturday’s strike is not the first in the Golan Heights since Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza began following the October 7 attacks.
    

            In early July, a Hezbollah rocket attack killed two people in the region, prompting Israel’s head of the Golan Regional Council to call for retaliation “with force” against the Lebanese group. Hezbollah had said earlier that it fired dozens of Katyusha rockets on the Golan Heights “in response” to an alleged Israeli attack in Syria targeting a Hezbollah key member.
    

            The Druze are an Arab sect of roughly one million people who primarily live in Syria, Lebanon and Israel.  Originating in Egypt in the 11th century, the group practices an offshoot of Islam which permits no converts – either to or from the religion – and no intermarriage.
    

            More than 20,000 Druze live in the Golan Heights. Most of them identify as Syrian and rejected an offer of Israeli citizenship when Israel seized the region in 1967. Those who refused were given Israeli residency cards but are not considered Israeli citizens.
    

            None of the Druze killed in Saturday’s attack on the soccer field held Israeli citizenship, the Regional Council of Majdal Shams told CNN.
    

            Druze of the Golan Heights share the territory with around 25,000 Jewish Israelis, spread across more than 30 settlements. Last year, the UN Human Rights Council sounded alarms over Israel’s plan to double the settler population on the Golan by 2027.
    

            Syrian Druze in the Golan have suffered from discriminatory policies, especially those relating to land and water allocation, according to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.
    

            “Over the years, the expanding Israeli settlements and their activities had reduced the access of Syrian farmers to water, due to discriminatory policies related to prices and fees,” the UN committee said.
    

            Druze in the Golan Heights have historically opposed Israeli laws they saw as attempts at “Israelization.” In 2018, thousands of Druze-led protesters opposed the Jewish Nation-State Basic Law put forth by the Israeli parliament, fearing it would deepen discrimination.
    

            The law established Israel as the historic home of the Jewish people with a “united” Jerusalem as its capital and declared that the Jewish people “have an exclusive right to national self-determination” in Israel.
    

            Druze leaders at the time said the controversial law made them feel like second-class citizens because it didn’t mention equality or minority rights.
    

            Recent data reported in Israeli media shows an increase in the numbers of Druze from the Golan seeking Israeli citizenship, but the numbers doing so remain extremely small: 75 in 2017 to 239 in 2021
    

            Outside the Golan, some 130,000 Israeli Druze live in the Carmel and Galilee in Israel’s north.
    

            In contrast to other minority communities within Israel’s borders, many are fiercely patriotic. Druze men over 18 have been conscripted to the IDF since 1957 and often rise to positions of high rank, while many build careers in the police and security forces.

CNN_32,Mark Meadows seeks Supreme Court intervention in bid for immunity from Georgia election subversion prosecution,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/politics/mark-meadows-supreme-court-election-interference-georgia/index.html,2024-07-29 01:10:00,politics,"
            Mark Meadows’ lawyers say they’ve asked the Supreme Court this weekend to take up his bid to move the Georgia election subversion prosecution against him to federal court, where the former White House chief of staff to ex-President Donald Trump would bring arguments that he is entitled to immunity from the charges.
    

            “It is hard to imagine a case in which the need for a federal forum is more pressing than one that requires resolving novel questions about the duties and powers of one of the most important federal offices in the Nation,” Meadows’ lawyers wrote in the new filing, which pointed to the justices’ recent ruling that gave Trump some immunity in the federal election subversion prosecution.
    

            The US 11th Circuit Court of Appeals said last year that the Georgia prosecution against Meadows should move forward in state court, concluding that former federal officials are not covered by that statute “removing” state cases against government officials to federal court. Chief Judge William Pryor’s opinion for the court also said that “the events giving rise to this criminal action were not related Meadows’s official duties.”

Mark Meadows goes to court to get his Trump White House records


            Since that December ruling, Meadows has obtained multiple extensions on his deadline to ask the Supreme Court to review the dispute. In the meantime, the high court’s conservative majority handed down the immunity ruling earlier this month that said Trump had at least “presumptive” immunity for any of his official acts as president that were targeted in the federal criminal charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith. That case, which was brought in Washington, DC, will go back to the trial court for the judge to sort out which alleged acts in Smith’s indictment are subject to presidential immunity under the Supreme Court’s ruling.
    

            Meadows’ new filing repeatedly referred to the Trump ruling, with his lawyers writing that “a White House Chief of Staff facing criminal charges based on actions relating to his work for the President of the United States should not be a close call—especially now that this Court has recognized that federal immunity impacts what evidence can be considered, not just what conduct can form the basis for liability.”
    

            Meadows also used the Trump immunity ruling to argue that, in his case, his status as a former official should not affect his ability to move the proceedings to federal court.
    

            “Just as immunity protection for former officers is critical to ensuring that current and future officers are not deterred from enthusiastic service, so too is the promise of a federal forum in which to litigate that defense,” Meadows wrote.
    

            His lawyers told the justices that if they were not willing to give a full review of Meadows’ case, they should at least wipe away last year’s 11th Circuit ruling and send the case back down for lower courts to reconsider in light of the Trump immunity opinion.
    

            The Georgia case is at a standstill while an appeals court considers ethics allegations against Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis — an issue that will not be resolved before the election.

            US Customs and Border Protection officers at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport seized illegal drugs twice from the same traveler in one week, according to a news release.
    

            The first seizure took place July 14 when a 43-year-old man was referred to officers for a secondary inspection upon arrival on a flight from Amsterdam. During the inspection, officers found more than “12 pounds of ketamine in both liquid and powdered form, nearly two pounds of codeine, and nearly three ounces of Gamma Hydroxybutyrate.”
    

            According to a public information officer, the man put the drugs into bottles made for other products like rubbing alcohol.
    

            The man, who is a US citizen, was arrested and turned over to the Port of Seattle Police Department.
    

            Shortly afterward, officials said, the man posted bail and again attempted to board a flight to London. Border Protection officers found more than one-half pound of ketamine in his checked bag.
    

            So far this year, officers have carried out more than 43,000 drug seizures, according to the agency.
    

            “CBP officers at the Seattle Tacoma International Arrivals Facility work diligently to keep dangerous drugs from the streets of our community. CBP officers also utilize their unique border search authority to prevent persons from taking dangerous drugs out of the United States, thus stopping a threat to other countries,” said Brian Humphrey, director of field operations for the agency’s Seattle office.
    

            “Led by Seattle Area Port Director Rene Ortega, our officers work tirelessly to protect our nation’s air, land and sea borders,” Humphrey said.
    

            The man is now facing charges under Washington state law for possession with the intent to distribute ketamine, officials said.

            In 2018, the deadliest wildfire in state history, the Camp Fire, incinerated much of the town. Three years later, the Dixie Fire burned nearby. And now, residents of Paradise say the smell of smoke is already enough to traumatize them anew.

            Paradise Mayor Ron Lassonde was visibly emotional as he told CNN affiliate KCRA it was “hard to talk about” the Park Fire as it brought back memories of 2018.
    

            “Every once in a while, we smell smoke or see smoke like that, it does trigger us. It triggers the people here in Paradise. When you go through trauma, that’s what happens,” Lassonde told KCRA.
    

            Ava Elsner, who lived through the fire six years ago, told CNN she fears for her neighbors as the Park Fire – now the seventh-largest wildfire in California history – burns nearby.
    

            “I don’t want anyone else to experience this. It’s the most traumatizing, terrifying, and saddening thing to have a whole community go up in flames, and to lose all your personal items … so to see my parents go through this is just really hard,” Elsner told CNN. “I want to stay strong for them and comfort them the way that they did for me. And it’s just, it’s just difficult.”
    

            Meanwhile, wildfires are burning across the mountain west, in the US and north of the border in Canada, as firefighters deal with strong winds, low humidity and high temperatures to try to get the blazes under control.
    

            There are 86 large wildfires burning across the US, including 37 in Oregon and 14 in California, according to the Interagency Fire Center, and hundreds in Canada reported by its Fire Center. Here’s a brief rundown of some of the largest fires:

            • Park Fire – Butte, Tehama, Plumas and Shasta counties, California: The Park Fire has become California’s largest wildfire this year, covering more than 350,000 acres, or 546 square miles – larger than the city of Phoenix – and it’s still spreading. President Joe Biden has directed his administration to do everything possible to support ongoing fire suppression efforts, according to a White House official. The fire began Wednesday in the Chico area, forcing thousands of people to evacuate. CalFire said Saturday a preliminary air assessment showed over 100 structures impacted by the fire, and officials on the ground confirmed 20 structures have been destroyed.
    

            • Durkee Fire – Baker and Malheur counties in Oregon: The largest active wildfire in Oregon is the Durkee Fire, which has burned more than 288,000 acres. It started July 17 near the Oregon-Idaho state line. Amid high temperatures, extremely dry vegetation and strong winds, the fire was 49% contained as of Saturday evening, according to Oregon Wildfire Response and Recovery.
    

            • Jasper National Park Fire – Jasper, Alberta: Large sections of the largest national park in the Canadian Rockies are being consumed by “a wall of flames.” As of Saturday evening, the fire is at just under 80,000 acres, according to park officials, making it the largest wildfire in more than 100 years in Jasper National Park. Thousands of visitors and residents fled as flames devastated nearly 40% of the town’s structures. Around 134 wildfires are burning throughout Alberta as firefighters from eastern Canada and internationally have been recruited to help with the fight, 34 of which remain out of control, officials said Saturday. The fire is expected to become more active over the coming days with warmer weather ahead, Parks Canada said.
    

            A firefighting pilot was found dead in a single-engine air tanker on Friday after going missing the night before while working in the vicinity of the 221-square-mile Falls Fire burning in the Malheur National Forest, among several large wildfires burning across Oregon, according to officials.
    

            Meanwhile, the lightning-sparked Durkee Fire is the largest of the wildfires currently burning across Oregon, which has been the hardest hit by fires in recent days.
    

            Three people were injured and four homes and 19 other structures were destroyed as the fire spread, according to the Oregon Department of Emergency Management.
    

            Evacuation recommendations in Malheur County have been lifted as of Thursday afternoon. In Baker County many areas’ evacuation levels were reduced or eliminated, according to the county’s Sheriff’s Office.
    

            In Alberta, two wildfires converged in the Jasper National Park area, forming what authorities are referring to as the Jasper Wildfire Complex. Officials say the losses are significant, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has deployed federal support to help battle the blaze.
    

            “Homes and businesses have been lost to a wildfire that people are calling a ‘wall of flames,’” Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said.
    

            In Jasper, a popular tourist town in Alberta, 25,000 residents and visitors were forced to evacuate from a fast-moving blaze, which has damaged nearly 40% of the town’s structures, officials said.
    

            “The pain our town is feeling is beyond comprehension. Our homes were full of memories and hubs for family, friendship and community,” Jasper Mayor Richard Ireland said in a statement Saturday. “We have rallied many times in the past to support each other. I know this will be the darkest week in our community’s history. I am confident that together we will see brighter days are ahead.”

            It remains difficult to measure exactly how big the complex – which also includes a third nearby fire – is due to extreme fire behavior and thick smoke cover.
    

            “We will recover from this,” Smith said while holding back tears. “To those in Alberta and around the world who have experienced the magic of Jasper, the magic is not lost, and it never will be.”
    

            The owner of Maligne Lodge in Jasper told CNN news partner CTV News she was shocked when she saw a photo of the 98-room hotel up in flames. It had been in the family since 1961 after her father purchased the property, and she had been working there since she was a child.
    

            “As soon as we’re given the go-ahead, we’ll be in there rebuilding our hotel,” Karyn Decore said.
    

            Nearly 4,000 firefighters are “on the front lines, battling the blaze” of the Park Fire, according to Cal Fire.
    

            The Park Fire is burning just three weeks after the Thompson Fire in Butte County burned more than 3,700 acres, forced people from their homes, and destroyed more than two dozen structures, including houses.

            “Yes, there’s a fire back there,” Paradise Mayor Lassonde told CNN affiliate KCRA, appearing to be distressed. “Yes, people’s houses are being destroyed. Yes, we’ve got over 1,000 firefighters out there, risking their lives, to keep us safe.”
    

            One Butte County evacuee, Tim Ferguson, said he lost his father in the Camp Fire, and it’s painful thinking about having to go through the experience again, according to an interview with CNN affiliate KOVR.
    

            “We’ve got our home, and we’ve been working on it a lot lately, fixing it up, and it’s just we’re at the verge of maybe losing all that,” Ferguson said.
    

            A heavy plume of smoke once again looms over the county as crews battle thick flames torching everything in their path. The Park Fire has left graveyards of burned cars and charred, hallowed out structures, video from the Chico and Cohasset areas of Butte County shows.
    

            A 42-year-old man identified by authorities as Ronnie Dean Stout II has been arrested on suspicion of pushing a burning car 60 feet into a gully, “spreading flames” that caused the Park Fire. Stout will likely face an arson charge, though it’s unclear what count or whether enhancements will be added, Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said Thursday.
    

            The DA’s office told CNN Stout has not retained an attorney and will be assigned a public defender at his arraignment.
    

            Cal Fire initially estimated the fire had destroyed more than 100 structures, but on Saturday said crews on the ground have so far confirmed 20 structures destroyed.
    

            California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for both counties Friday. The state also secured a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to ensure there are enough resources to fight the fire.
    

            Elsner said the Park Fire has forced her and her parents to take shelter at the same location they stayed at in 2018. She told CNN, in tears, the experience is causing her significant PTSD from the Camp Fire and flashbacks triggered by the flames and “charred bits of remnants.”
    

            Elsner’s mother, Mary Graeff, said it’s been challenging comforting her daughter through this. “It was just hard, you know, to be that age and then lose absolutely everything. So that was hard. And watching your child go through that was awful,” Graeff said through tears.

CNN_35,"LeBron James and Kevin Durant power Team USA past Serbia, 110-84, in opening Olympic contest",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/sport/usa-defeats-serbia-2024-olympics/index.html,2024-07-29 01:45:00,world,"
            LeBron James made his emphatic return to Olympic basketball on Sunday, turning in a dominant performance in a 110-84 win against Serbia, his first contest at the Games since 2012.
    

            It was the first time James had played in the quadrennial tournament since winning his second consecutive gold medal at the London Games and it was clear the 39-year-old all-time leading NBA scorer was bringing as much energy as he can to Paris. The US next plays South Sudan on Wednesday, who ran the Americans close in an exhibition game in London before the Games that was decided by just a point.
    

            James’ 21 points, eight rebounds and nine assists helped provide the spark for Team USA throughout the contest. The ever-present four-time NBA champion seemed to always be on the verge of breaking out of the US backcourt on the fast break, exemplified by a tough, contested layup in the third quarter, in which the Los Angeles Lakers star powered through a Serb defender for a bucket.
    

            The first half though was all about Kevin Durant, who scored 21 points on 8-for-8 shooting. It’s the Phoenix Suns forward’s fourth time at the Olympics and his performance proved just how much the two-time NBA champion loves this particular competition.
    

            Durant is recovering from a calf injury and his playing time was limited during the game, otherwise he might have ended the contest with an even more ridiculous stat line. He finished with 23 points.
    

            On a team laden with stars, two first-time Olympians also stood out against Serbia.
    

            Anthony Edwards made his Olympics debut and already has his first highlight reel play. With a deft spin-and-pump-fake move along the baseline on Team USA’s final possession of the third quarter, the Minnesota Timberwolves guard sent a Serb defender flying past him toward the sideline as he went to the basket. Edwards was left with an uncontested shot that he easily floated in for a bucket, putting the US up by 19 heading into the final frame.

            The move and bucket from Edwards set off celebrations among his teammates, including Steph Curry breaking into dance. Edwards finished with 11 points and five rebounds.
    

            It appeared to be the turning point that put Team USA on its way to a blowout win after Serbia hung around for much of the first three quarters of the game.
    

            Curry’s three-point shooting proved to be a major asset in the early going as Serbia jumped out to a hot start. A couple of key buckets in the early part of the first quarter helped stymie the Europeans’ run and kept the US from having too big of a hole to dig itself out of.
    

            The Golden State Warriors star was largely quiet for the rest of the game, missing a couple of shots that he might like to have back as he gets used to the shorter international three-point line. He finished the game with an exclamation point three-pointer for 11 points.
    

            Jrue Holiday and Devin Booker also turned in solid performances with 15 and 12 points respectively.
    

            Serbia figures to be a force in this tournament though thanks to its talismanic forward Nikola Jokić. The Serbians refused to go away in the game, even as Team USA picked up steam in the second half with the three-time NBA MVP Jokić finished with 20 points, eight assists and five rebounds.
    

            Serbia’s next game is on Wednesday against Puerto Rico.

CNN_36,Olympic moment of the day: Cap-catching lifeguard steals the swimming show,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/sport/olympic-moment-lifeguard-swimming-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-29 01:09:00,world,"
            They say in sports to expect the unexpected.
    

            But really, who could have expected a lifeguard in a bright, multi-colored, very small swimsuit to jump into the pool at La Défense Arena on Sunday in front of 15,000 people – and be hailed as a hero.
    

            When American swimmer Emma Weber lost one of her swim caps in the pool, someone needed to fish it out. And it was up to the aforementioned hero lifeguard to plunge into the pool in front of thousands of fans to do the retrieval.
    
Who do you call when a swim cap falls in the pool?""BOB THE CAP CATCHER."" 😂#ParisOlympics pic.twitter.com/eN5ycGkKjw

            To huge cheers from the crowd, the lifeguard dove into the pool and picked up the cap at the bottom. After a quick swim to the edge of the pool, he pulled himself out – and allowed himself a wave to his new flock of adoring fans.
    

            “This situation is common at swimming competitions,” a Paris 2024 spokesperson told CNN. “As the lifeguards are the only people wearing swimwear, apart from the athletes, a request may be made to fetch an item at the bottom of the pool prior to the next race. In this case, the request was made to the lifeguard closest to the item.”
    

            The lifeguard declined to allow his name to be reported, the spokesperson said, in order to keep his attention on his duties for the rest of the competition.
    

            Deemed “Bob the Cap Catcher” by NBC’s commentary crew, it was a moment of levity at one of the most pressure-packed venues at these Games. The atmosphere at La Défense Arena has been intense for the last two days of competitions, with many of the competitors remarking on the volume of cheers from the Paris crowd.
    

            It’s one of the great questions of every Olympics: What would it look like if the average human were to be in the same competition as these incredible athletes?
    

            For a brief moment on Sunday, we had a look of what that might be like. And it was glorious.

CNN_37,"Container of hazardous materials catches fire, closing crucial highway connecting Los Angeles and Las Vegas for 48 hours",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/us/interstate-15-california-las-vegas-hazmat-fire/index.html,2024-07-29 02:01:00,us,"
            A stretch of the major highway between California and Las Vegas was closed for 48 hours after a tractor trailer carrying hazardous materials overturned and caught on fire.
    

            The California Highway Patrol announced Sunday morning that all lanes of Interstate 15 were open after crews worked overnight to “carefully move the hazardous materials container a safe distance away from the roadway.”
    

            The truck lost control and overturned onto Interstate 15 near Barstow, California, around 6 a.m. Friday, according to the California Highway Patrol. The truck was pulling a flatbed trailer containing lithium-ion batteries that detached from the truck and eventually caught on fire.
    

            “Due to the lithium-ion, water cannot be added to the fire, the batteries must burn out on their own,” the patrol said.
    

            Both northbound and southbound lanes were initially closed due to the potential hazardous situation, but southbound lanes later reopened and northbound lanes remained closed until Sunday morning.
    

            “The primary concern is the air quality due to the hazardous materials and chemicals involved,” San Bernardino County Fire said. “Air monitoring is assessing for hydrogen cyanide, chlorine, and sulfur dioxide. These chemicals pose significant health risks at elevated levels, with hydrogen cyanide and chlorine being particularly dangerous even at low concentrations.”
    

            Efforts to remove the 75,000-pound container carrying the hazardous material from the highway were made more difficult by the vehicle’s weight, according to San Bernardino County Fire.
    

            It typically takes around four hours to drive from Las Angeles to Las Vegas, but on Saturday, Barbara Gray said it took her and her friends 12 hours to get to Sin City due to the crash.
    

            She told CNN that she and her friends initially thought the impact of the crash was “not that bad.”
    

            “There was no indication of how insane it actually was,” Gray said. “Pretty much after Barstow, it was completely gridlocked. There would be 30 to 45 minutes at a time where we simply did not move.”
    

            Gray said people had to use the bathroom on the side of the road amid over 115-degree heat.
    

            “We luckily did not run out of gas. Thank God. I don’t even know what we would have done because there was no assistance,” Gray said. “There was nowhere to call anybody. There was no service on our phones.”
    

            “People were really in a bad spot, and it was an emergency,” Gray said.
    

            “People gave me some snacks, and then a guy asked me for water because he didn’t have any, so I had to give him water,” Gray said.
    

            The gridlock finally broke open after getting past a stretch of construction that was not connected to the truck fire.
    

            “It was extremely frustrating,” Gray said. “And it was scary. Honestly, it was very scary.”
    

            Charles Gallagher, another driver who was caught in traffic on the highway, called the situation a “complete mess.” Gallagher, who was headed home to Las Vegas, told CNN that what should have been a four-hour-drive home instead took 11 hours.
    

            Gallagher and his family left Los Angeles at 3:30 p.m. Friday and ran into traffic in Barstow around 6 p.m., when they were rerouted to Interstate 40.
    

            Eventually, after realizing traffic wasn’t going to move any time soon, the family turned around and stayed the night in Barstow. When they left early Saturday morning, they decided to take I-40 as I-15 was still closed.
    

            “There were times that we were at a standstill for 45 minutes or more,” he said. “Many of us would get out to stretch.”
    

            They were stuck on I-40 for seven hours before getting on Route 66 and eventually making it home to Las Vegas on Saturday afternoon, Gallagher said.
    

            The family had stocked up on water bottles that they placed in an insulated bag and had a tank full of gas. Whenever they stopped, they put the sun shade over the front window to help keep cool inside, Gallagher added.
    

            With temperatures well over 100 degrees in the area, fire officials handed out water to some of the stranded drivers.

CNN_38,"‘Deadpool & Wolverine’ opening weekend surpasses $200 million, biggest R-rated debut",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/business/deadpool-wolverine-box-office-movie/index.html,2024-07-29 02:10:00,us,"
            “Deadpool & Wolverine” barreled through the $200 million benchmark, cementing the blockbuster as the record holder for the highest grossing opening weekend for an R-rated movie.
    

            According to studio estimates, “Deadpool & Wolverine” — the 34th movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup — has grossed $205 million dollars in domestic sales and $438.3 million globally in its debut.
    

            The first Deadpool movie set the record for the highest grossing opening weekend for an R-rated film when it was released in 2016 to roughly $132 million, and “Deadpool 2” cinched the second-place spot with $125 million in domestic sales in 2018. But even adjusted for inflation, both films pale in comparison with the third installation’s debut.
    

            “Deadpool & Wolverine” is now also among the top opening weekends ever, ranking at No. 8 — a hair’s breadth below 2012’s “The Avengers” ($207 million) and just above 2018’s “Black Panther” ($202 million).
    

            Of the 10 biggest debuts, six are Marvel properties. With “Deadpool & Wolverine” joining the ranks, Marvel movies are now worth more than $30 billion combined, Disney announced Sunday, making Marvel the highest grossing film franchise of all-time.
    

            Still, MCU has been trying to find its footing after its wildly popular “Infinity Saga” culminated with 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame,” a movie that still holds the record for biggest opening weekend by a margin of nearly $100 million. Since then, several of Marvel’s offerings in recent years have left fans and critics alike unmoved.


            Could “Deadpool & Wolverine” reinvigorate the franchise?
    

            “We should continue taking each film on its own terms with varying thresholds of success, especially as the MCU rebuilds with several films next year before the anticipated return of Avengers films,” Shawn Robbins, founder and owner of Box Office Theory, told CNN.
    

            The fifth and sixth “Avengers” movies are slated for 2026 and 2027, giving Marvel a runway of four new movies through which to build momentum.
    

            “Still, there’s no denying ‘Deadpool & Wolverine’ is a massive win in its own right, with a unique hook that’s attracting die-hard Marvel fans and casual audiences alike,” Robbins added. “This release is the breath of fresh air Marvel has been working toward and it sets the stage for a new era in the overall brand. It’s a win all around for Disney, Marvel, theater owners, and moviegoers.”
    

            According to Box Office Pro data, the excitement surrounding “Deadpool & Wolverine” has propelled demand for theater showings, increasing the number of times the movie is being screened at movie theaters across the country. It currently holds 43% of the showtime market share across the United States.
    

            “We are thrilled to see ‘Deadpool & Wolverine’ bringing people to theatres for the biggest opening weekend ever for an R-rated movie,” said Michael O’Leary, president and chief executive officer of the National Association of Theatre Owners. “This is the kind of movie you want to experience on the big screen and the historic level of enthusiasm this weekend reminds us yet again that audiences know there is no experience like theatrical. We also know that when people go to the movies, they want to come back — so we are excited to capitalize on this weekend’s energy with a robust theatrical slate in months to come.”
    

            While the summer box office had a lackluster start after a lukewarm spring, there have been several blockbusters pumping new life into the industry.
    

            “Since June, there has been a nonstop parade of over-performing blockbusters starting with ‘Bad Boys: Ride Or Die,’ and continuing with ‘Inside Out 2,’ ‘A Quiet Place: Day One,’ ‘Despicable Me 4,’ ‘Twisters,’ and now ‘Deadpool & Wolverine,’ making for one of the most notable string of hits in summer movie history,” Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore, told CNN on Saturday.
    

            Last week, Disney announced “Inside Out 2” had become the highest grossing animated film of all-time, raking in $1.46 billion at the global box office and dethroning former record holder, 2019’s “Frozen 2.”
    

            Until the film’s release on June 16, domestic sales had been lagging more than 25% behind 2023’s performance, according to Comscore data. But less than three weeks after its release, the year-over-year domestic box office revenue deficit shrunk from 27% to 19%.
    

            Now, the deficit stands at 16.9% and it could keep shrinking depending on how “Deadpool & Wolverine”  finishes its run in theaters. This time last year, “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” was the top film with a domestic gross of more than $574 million. Meanwhile, the enduring success of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” — both released on July 21 — helped to push the cumulative 2023 domestic box office revenue past $9 billion, the highest it’s been since the pandemic.
    

            Although analysts have forecast a dip in revenue for 2024, the better-than-expected summer movie slate has narrowed the the gap.
    

            “This weekend’s performance certainly makes us more optimistic for the box office prospects for 2024, but we have a long way to go before the end of the year and year-over-year comparisons will keep us on a seesaw of ups and downs,” said Dergarabedian, estimating the full-year box office will land between $8.2 and $8.7 billion. “The fact that we will likely wind up at $8 billion plus, considering how weak first quarter and April were in terms of revenue, is quite impressive.”

            Out in front were the Japanese duo of Coco Yoshizawa, who took gold thanks to a massive score on her fourth trick, and Liz Akama, who had led for much of the competition.
    

            Just as with this event in Tokyo, the entire podium was made up of teenagers: Yoshizawa is 14, Kama 15, and Leal – who became Brazil’s youngest ever Olympic medalist when she won silver three years ago – 16.
    

            Although she wasn’t able to upgrade her silver from Tokyo, Leal, along with her huge number of supporters, would have been equally joyous and relieved to win bronze in dramatic fashion, scoring 88.83 with her final act of the competition to climb ahead of China’s Cui Chenxi on the leaderboard.
    

            “It was like a gold medal because … she had to make it,” Brazilian fan Michelle Arruda, who bought tickets for the women’s street skateboarding to watch Leal a year ago, told CNN Sport. “It was a lot of emotion and felt like the Olympic spirit – you have to be here to understand what it is.
    

            “You get so nervous, it’s like you are there with them … We were literally praying, holding hands. It was like: ‘She’s going to make it.’ I don’t know how, but I really believed that she was going to make it.”
    

            Leal first catapulted to fame when a video of her skateboarding aged seven, dressed in a blue fairy princess costume, went viral. It was shared by skateboarding icon Tony Hawk, who tipped his hat to the “fairytale heelflip.”
    

            Known as the fadinha do skate – Portuguese for “skate fairy” – from then on, Leal’s popularity has continued to grow. She has acquired a number of sponsors, including Nike and Monster Energy, and boasts 7 million followers on Instagram, all while her skateboarding has continued to take an upward trajectory.
    

            The highlight of her performance at Paris’ Urban Park, a temporary facility erected on the Place de la Concorde, was scoring 92.88 for the first of her two successful tricks – the second-highest score of the final.
    

            “When I was very young, I dreamed of becoming a skateboard athlete,” Leal told reporters. “And here I am, with a second Olympic medal from the Games. Once again, thanks God I won a medal. I’m very happy to be here.”
    
Te amamos @rayssaleal ❤️ você é demais!!

            Thousands in Brazil will have celebrated the medal, among them Brazil and Real Madrid soccer star Vinícius Jr. “We love you @rayssaleal,” he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. “You are awesome.”
    

            The Urban Sport Park, which plays host to skateboarding, BMX, breakdancing and 3x3 basketball at these Olympics, has a different feel to other venues: DJs tell fans to put their hands in the air, kids demonstrate their moves on a wooden dance floor, and a man spray paints graffiti on a white canvass.
    

            Yet despite its distinctly youthful slant, the venue still carries the hallmarks of an iconic Parisian destination. Located at the end of the Champs-Élysées, the Arc de Triomphe, Eiffel Tower and River Seine are all visible from temporary stands, while the Musée de l’Orangerie is nearby.
    

            Heavy rain on Friday had caused the men’s street skateboarding to be postponed by two days, but the women’s event was blessed with bright sun. In the skate park – a collection of slopes, stairs, and rails – participants compete in headphones, baggy T-shirts and cargo pants, while music blasts from the speakers.
    

            A preliminary round of 22 is whittled down to eight finalists, all of whom were teenagers, aged between 14 and 19. Yoshizawa qualified with the highest score ahead of Akama, while Leal was back in seventh.
    

            Akama had led for most of the final, jumping from last to first between her first and second runs, before Yoshizawa surged into the lead with her penultimate trick, recording an overall score of 272.75.
    

            Those two were out of reach when Leal stepped up for one final run and jumped into the bronze medal position, later sparking a party atmosphere among the Brazilian fans in the stands as GALA’s Eurodance hit “Freed from Desire” – released well before any of the medalists were born – rang around the stadium.
    

            Speaking to reporters later, Leal said that it felt like “100% Brazilians” in the crowd. “It means a lot, not only for me, but for my team, for Brazil. We are happy,” she added. “This is for skateboarding.”

CNN_40,Attorney for Mexican drug lord says client ‘forcibly kidnapped’ by El Chapo’s son,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/us/el-chapo-son-guzman-kidnapping-allegation/index.html,2024-07-29 04:48:00,us,"
            The attorney for Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, the alleged co-founder of the Sinaloa cartel, says his client “neither surrendered nor negotiated any terms with the U.S. government,” but was instead kidnapped.
    

            U.S. law enforcement officials had previously told CNN that Joaquín Guzmán López had duped Zambada and orchestrated their arrest by making him believe they were flying to northern Mexico to look at real estate. Instead, the officials said, their small private plane landed north of the border near El Paso, Texas, where US authorities were waiting on the tarmac.
    

            Zambada’s attorney forcefully denied any suggestion previously raised by Mexican officials that his client may have surrendered of his own volition or willingly come to the United States as part of a deal.
    

            In a phone conversation and a statement sent to CNN Sunday, Frank Pérez said that Zambada, 76, was kidnapped by Joaquín Guzmán López, one of the sons of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, the other co-founder of the Sinaloa cartel, who was extradited to the United States in 2017 and is serving a life sentence in U.S. federal prison.

            “Joaquín Guzmán López forcibly kidnapped my client. He was ambushed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed by six men in military uniforms and Joaquin. His legs were tied, and a black bag was placed over his head,” Pérez said in the statement.
    

            “He was then thrown into the back of a pickup truck and taken to a landing strip. There, he was forced onto a plane, his legs tied to the seat by Joaquin, and brought to the U.S. against his will. The only people on the plane were the pilot, Joaquín and my client,” Pérez added.
    

            Zambada has been one of the most elusive figures in the criminal world.  He was able to lead the Sinaloa cartel for decades and, up until now, hadn’t seen a jail cell.  Mike Vigil, a former Drug Enforcement Administration agent who served with the agency for 31 years, described the alleged Mexican drug lord as “astute.”
    

            “Mayo Zambada, prior to Thursday and over 50 years of involvement in the drug trade had never been captured, never served any time, so he is highly respected by even his rivals,” Vigil said.
    

            Mexican Security Secretary Rosa Icela Rodríguez said Friday that her government was not part of any operation to detain the alleged Mexican drug lords but clarified that the Mexican government is going to “keep collaborating with the United States government as we have done up until now.”

US operation to capture Sinaloa cartel leaders had the help of one of the captured men: a son of ‘El Chapo,’ official says


            “You ask if [they] surrendered or were captured. That is part of the investigation and part of the information that we will be waiting for from the United States government,” Rodríguez told Mexican media, with President Andrés Manuel López Obrador by her side.
    

            President López Obrador said that, regardless of whether Zambada and Guzmán turned themselves in or were captured, the fact that they’re now in custody is an important step forward in the fight against drug trafficking.
    

            “I believe that it is a sign that there we are working together [Mexico and the United States], even though in this specific case neither the Mexican Army nor the Navy participated, but the fact that he [Zambada] made the decision to surrender or leave, run the risk of going to the United States and getting captured there, means an important advance in the fight against drug trafficking,” the Mexican president said.
    

            CNN learned Saturday that whatever action the U.S. might’ve taken to arrest Zambada and Guzmán López prompted a furious behind-the-scenes reaction from Mexican government officials who are demanding senior US law enforcement officials explain exactly what transpired, according to a US official familiar with the operation.
    

            The Mexican government is “totally pissed,” the source said, noting officials in Mexico were not briefed ahead of time on the planned captures.
    

            CNN has reached out to Mexican officials for comment regarding Zambada’s attorney’s kidnapping claim.
    

            CNN also reached out to Guzmán López’s attorney regarding the claim Sunday but did not receive a response.
    

            Zambada entered a not guilty plea to all charges in US District Court in El Paso on Friday and is scheduled to appear in-person in that same court for a status conference August 1 at 11 a.m. local time (1 p.m. Eastern Time), according to Perez and filed court documents.
    

            The arrests of Zambada and Guzmán López mark a major development in decades-long efforts to capture and prosecute alleged cartel bosses. And the details revealed so far about what led to their arrests give a glimpse into the inner workings of what authorities describe as one of the world’s most notorious and nefarious criminal enterprises.

CNN_41,Venezuelans vote in crucial presidential election as opposition challenges Maduro,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/americas/venezuela-presidential-election-polls-open-intl-latam/index.html,2024-07-29 04:14:00,world,"
            Venezuelans headed to the polls on Sunday to vote in a highly consequential presidential election in which the country’s longtime strongman, Nicolas Maduro, will face one of his greatest political challenges yet, say analysts.
    

            Long lines began to form outside polling centers in the capital, Caracas, before they were due to open at 6 a.m. ET. Opposition leaders later said there had been a high voter turnout of more than 9 million people as of Sunday afternoon.
    

            Voters in Caracas appeared optimistic. “[After] 25 years, I see that there is a real chance to change. I see a lot of people getting together to vote,” voter Mariana Schemel said.
    

            Others spoke about wanting to help their country, which has seen an exodus of Venezuelans fleeing economic collapse. “I’m doing this for my children and my grandchildren,” voter Amelia Perez told CNN. She has three sons, one of whom is living in Washington, D.C. “I want him to come back and I don’t want my children to leave. All the rest of my family already left.
    

            Maduro, who took the mantle of the ruling Chavismo movement after his predecessor Hugo Chavez’s death in 2013, is seeking his third consecutive six-year term in office. Of the nine other candidates running for the presidency, his biggest challenger is a unified opposition movement that overcame their divisions to form a coalition known as the Democratic Unitary Platform.

            The opposition movement has maintained its momentum despite sustained government repression, in which their first-choice candidate, María Corina Machado, was disqualified from running. Machado, an avowed capitalist who has promised privatization of several state industries, has since rallied for her replacement, the soft-spoken former diplomat Edmundo González Urrutia.
    

            The vote has come at a crucial moment for Venezuela, which has experienced violent repression under Maduro’s watch and the worst economic collapse of a peacetime country in recent history. The oil-rich nation, once the fifth-largest economy in Latin America, has seen its economy shrink in the last decade to the equivalent of a medium-sized city, according to data from the International Monetary Fund. 


            Punishing sanctions on the regime by the United States and European Union have failed to topple the populist incumbent, who argues that Venezuela’s woes are due to being a victim of an “economic war.”
    

            Around eight million Venezuelans have fled the country amid shortages of vital goods and soaring inflation.
    

            Others spoke about voting for the future of their country, which has seen an exodus of Venezuelans fleeing economic collapse. “I’m doing this for my children and my grandchildren,” voter Amelia Perez told CNN. She has three sons, one of whom is living in Washington, D.C. “I want him to come back and I don’t want my children to leave. All the rest of my family already left.”
    

            There has been mounting concern that the opposition will not see a fair contest as Maduro’s government controls all public institutions in Venezuela and has been accused of rigging previous votes, which it denied. Experts note, however, that concerns of vote tampering may be mitigated by the planned presence of opposition party representatives at each polling station.
    

            The opposition coalition reported what they said were minor irregularities on Sunday, but voting proceedings appeared to be smooth in most of the country.
    

            More than 21 million people are registered to vote, both in the country and abroad. Machado reported a 41% voter turnout by Sunday afternoon, which represents more than 9 million voters.
    

            “This is huge. If this continues, it will be a historic participation figure,” Machado said in a statement released Sunday afternoon. “What you are seeing is the most important civic act in our history.”

            Machado’s statement also spoke of reported “problems” at some voting stations. “In our monitoring there were 1,300 stations in which there were problems for our observers to enter. At this time there are only 13 tables with problems.”
    

            Machado said 18 voting stations out 30,000 nationwide “couldn’t be set up.” The opposition leader also reported a “slowdown in the process and scanning of ID cards that is not justified in any way. We hope this will be eliminated and speed up the process.” However, Machado says these have been “exceptions to a process that develops peacefully.”
    

            Electoral authorities say only an identity card is needed to be eligible to vote, and a Sunday statement from the election body, the National Electoral Council (CNE), said that there is no dress code for polling centers.
    

            But in Caracas, a 55-year-old voter told CNN he was turned away from a polling center by soldiers for wearing cargo shorts. After queuing for several hours, Henrique Mendoza said the military patrolling around the center would not let him in due to his outfit.
    

            When Maduro voted at 6 a.m. in the capital, he urged citizens to respect the results of the election. His main challenger González said the opposition coalition is “going to wait for the results from the National Electoral Council, however, we also have our methods and mechanisms to know the progress of today’s electoral process.”

            The election campaign has seen at least 71 people arbitrarily detained – the majority of whom provided some sort of service to the opposition – and a dozen online media outlets blocked within the country, according to human rights organization Laboratorio de Paz.
    

            The government has also created significant impediments for the millions of Venezuelans abroad to vote, including widely unattainable passport and residency requirements. Only 69,211 Venezuelans living abroad are eligible to vote in this year’s poll, according to data published by the CNE.
    

            A limited group of election observers, including a team from The Carter Center – a non-profit organization set up by former US President Jimmy Carter – will be on the ground. But several international election observers have announced this week that they will no longer travel to Venezuela to monitor the vote.
    

            Latin American leaders, including Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, have called on Maduro to commit to stepping down if he loses. Venezuelan opposition figures have also appealed to the country’s military, that has long supported Maduro and his predecessor, to respect the results. The Venezuelan leader has said his victory will ensure “peace” in the country.
    

            How the army reacts to the outcome could be an important factor in any scenario, but analysts say it impossible to parse where it stands.
    

            “The military is absolutely key. But I must also say that the military is very hermetic, [and] it is very difficult to access information about what it is thinking,” Laura Cristina Dib, the Venezuela Program Director of Venezuela Program at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), told CNN.

Israeli attacks killed at least 19 Palestinians, including children, and injured numerous others across Gaza on Sunday, according to health officials and Gaza’s Civil Defense.
    

            At least 10 people were killed in an airstrike on a house in central Khan Younis, a health official at the Nasser Hospital that received the casualties told CNN. CNN video shot at the hospital shows several body bags at the morgue and people carrying the wounded, including children.
    

            Gaza’s Civil Defense said another airstrike hit tents in the Al-Mawasi area, which the Israeli military has designated a “humanitarian zone” for displaced Palestinians, killing at least four people. One of them was an infant girl that arrived at a nearby hospital, according to a statement by the Kuwait Specialized Field hospital.
    

            Video obtained by CNN shows a graphic scene of a man holding the lifeless body of a decapitated child in bloodied clothes while walking toward the hospital in Khan Younis.
    

            “My son, my son, my brother, his wife, his sister, and my sister are all gone,” he says as he walks toward the hospital entrance. “They struck a tent, I swear they struck a tent, my mother is gone.”

            CNN is not distributing the video at this point due to its graphic nature.
    

            In response to a CNN question about the attacks in Khan Younis, the Israeli military said it “follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm” and that it is “operating to dismantle Hamas’ military and administrative capabilities.”
    

            Five other people were killed in attacks in Gaza City and Deir Al-Balah, the Civil Defense spokesman said in a statement on Sunday.
    

            Israel launched its war on Hamas in Gaza in retaliation to the militant group’s October 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and kidnapped more than 250 others.
    

            Since then, Israeli attacks have killed more than 39,000 people and injured over 90,000 others since October 7, according to figures by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.
    

            CNN cannot independently verify the death toll, partly because Gaza is inaccessible to the international media.

            On Wednesday, a resident near the remote area of Campbellville, who was among those evacuated amid the blaze, had to leave the dogs behind when their truck became disabled, according to a post on the Sheriff’s Office’s Facebook page.
    

            “The owner provided responders with the location of the truck but the area was not immediately accessible due to the fire,” the post detailed.
    

            On Saturday, Trevor Skaggs, a member of the county’s search and rescue team, was flown to the area by helicopter pilot Connor Smith, and ran 1.5 miles to where the dogs were last seen.
    

            Sadly, another adult female Rottweiler did not survive and two other puppies remain missing.
    

            Skaggs gave the dogs water and bites from a protein bar before getting them to follow him back to the helicopter, the post detailed.
    

            The dogs were flown to the Chico airport and are being cared for at the North Valley Animal Disaster Group, which is caring for horses, pigs and other animals affected by the fire. After a veterinary evaluation, they will be transferred to a nearby shelter until they can be reunited with their owner.
    

            “It’s been a horrific few days for our community and we are grateful to be able to share this amazing story,” the post concluded.

NYT_1,‘Maybe I’ve Gotten Worse’: Trump Makes Clear That Unity Is Over,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/28/us/politics/trump-vance-unity-minnesota.html,2024-07-28 12:07:00,,"Early in his speech in Minnesota on Saturday night, former President Donald J. Trump made clear just how quickly he has jettisoned the appeal for national unity that he made after he survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania two weeks ago.
“I want to be nice,” Mr. Trump said. “They all say, ‘I think he’s changed. I think he’s changed since two weeks ago. Something affected him.’”
But to a cheering crowd of thousands, Mr. Trump quickly conceded the point. “No, I haven’t changed,” he said. “Maybe I’ve gotten worse. Because I get angry at the incompetence that I witness every single day.”
Propelled by the upheaval in the presidential race caused by President Biden’s decision to end his campaign six days ago, Mr. Trump on Saturday once more escalated his attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee.During a speech lasting roughly 90 minutes, Mr. Trump called Ms. Harris “evil,” “unhinged” and “sick.” He lied about her views on abortion in an effort to paint her as extreme, and he mocked her laugh and her demeanor.
“We have a brand-new victim,” Mr. Trump told thousands of people inside the Herb Brooks National Hockey Center in St. Cloud, Minn. “And, honestly, she’s a radical left lunatic.”

WaPo_1,Second gentleman Doug Emhoff hits the campaign trail,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/27/doug-emhoff-kamala-harris-campaign/,2024-07-28 08:55:02.837576,,"STEVENS POINT, Wis. — Doug Emhoff was late to learn his life had changed, he told an enthusiastic audience of Democratic volunteers Saturday as they prepared to knock on doors in support of his wife, Vice President Harris, running for president.At home in Los Angeles last Sunday after a campaign swing through Nevada, the nation’s first second gentleman had a delayed flight. Deciding to make the most of “another free morning in L.A.,” he said, “I thought I’d just go to an exercise cycling class with some friends of mine.”The attendees laughed, anticipating his punchline: “I left my phone in the car.”Emhoff enjoyed coffee after a spin class with friends until, after about 20 minutes, one of them showed him their phone, displaying the letter President Biden released declaring he was suspending his campaign. As a lawyer, Emhoff said, he skipped toward the end of the letter and assumed Biden was just writing that he would address the nation later in the week after recovering from covid.But his friend told him to read the paragraphs above, in which Biden said he would not seek reelection — and Emhoff and his Secret Service detail took off running to the car, where his phone was blowing up with people telling him to call Harris.“You could literally see steam and smoke,” Emhoff said of his phone, to even more laughter. He called Harris. “She’s like, where the” — then he paused, suggesting a missing word — “were you? I need you.”Emhoff traveled to Wisconsin on Saturday for his first major campaign swing since Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee, delivering brief remarks at the Hmong Wausau Festival, stopping for soft serve and kicking off a canvas launch at a local party office in Stevens Point. The second gentleman is no stranger to campaigning on behalf of his wife or the then-Biden campaign, but the switch in the ticket last week has revived attention on the man who could be the first gentleman.A former entertainment lawyer, Emhoff is viewed by many Harris supporters as the ultimate “wife guy” and a purveyor of dad jokes. He’s co-starred in some of the Harris-related memes and fan edits taking over social media over the past week, with a photo of him when he was young going viral, as well as a photo in which he eagerly shows Harris his phone while she looks at him with skepticism. Some social media users even have mused that he is the true “brat” in the relationship, referring to songs from a Charli XCX album used in many of the pro-Harris social media postings.Speaking in Wisconsin, Emhoff had plenty of jokes (such as suggesting he’s “just a lawyer from L.A.” who’s often thrown into unpredictable circumstances given his White House role) and personal anecdotes to share, including meeting Harris on a blind date. But he also highlighted his experience traveling the world for the Biden administration, speaking at the Hmong community event about his trips to Asia and Harris’s background as the daughter of an Indian immigrant. He leaned on his legal background when describing the election’s role in shaping the future Supreme Court and the actions it could take to restrict access to contraception.He described “my wife, Kamala Harris, and her vision for the future,” laying out the stakes while running through a list of popular Democratic policies. He also needled both former president Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, who have lobbed a grab-bag of attacks at Harris since she became the likely Democratic nominee.“You’ve all seen how pathetic JD Vance is, what a weirdo,” Emhoff said while at the canvass launch, where freshly printed Harris signs hung between now-vintage Biden for President signs and memorabilia from past Democratic campaigns. “Seriously, this guy, the more you get to know him, the more it’s just ridiculous.”He also used his role to directly counter some of the Republican lines of attack against Harris, including Vance’s three-year-old comments calling Democrats — including Harris — “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable.”“Over the last decade, she’s not just been an amazing partner to me but a loving parent to two kids named Cole and Ella. From Day 1, she’s been present, nurturing and fiercely protective of them,” he said, referring to Harris’s two stepchildren from Emhoff’s prior marriage.He concluded his remarks with a direct message for Trump, drawing raucous applause.“Mr. Trump, I know you have so much trouble pronouncing her name,” Emhoff said, hand on his hip before waving it through the air and leaning forward. “Here’s the good news — after the election, you can just call her Madam President.”Voters who watched Emhoff speak in Wisconsin praised him and his humor and said they hoped to see him out more on the campaign trail.“I think he’s wonderful. It is not part of our country’s history that the women stand up in front of their husbands and run for something like this — it’s usually the woman’s position to stand back and smile,” said Nancy Foth, 74, a retired librarian who attended the canvass launch.“I think this is amazing, and it’s time,” she added."
WaPo_2,Ariarne Titmus and Katie Ledecky have pushed each other to immortality,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/27/ariarne-titmus-katie-ledecky-400-meters-paris-olympics/,2024-07-28 08:08:02.837576,,"NANTERRE, France — When Katie Ledecky arrived on the pool deck Saturday night at Paris La Défense Arena for the first final of her fourth Olympics, she looked in the bin that sits behind each starting block, something of a trash can for warmup clothes and flip-flops that are part of the strut to the stage. In the receptacle assigned to her spot — Lane 4, for the top seed in the women’s 400-meter freestyle — she found the green-and-gold sweatsuit of Australia’s Ariarne Titmus, the woman who was the first to track her down in this event.In an unusual exchange for the normally teeth-grinding tension before a race for gold, Ledecky stepped toward Titmus. It could have been a moment to say, essentially: “Look, girl. I’m the top dog here. Move your stuff.”But that’s not how this relationship works. You might want a knife fight. What you get is a group hug.“She was freaking out,” Ledecky said. “I didn’t want her to feel bad or anything.”Such sweetness — toward your most significant rival.Wait. Wrong word.“I wouldn’t consider it a rivalry,” Ledecky said. “I mean, I think it’s a friendship.”There are so many realities in that statement and so many realities in the race that played out. The event was billed as potentially one of the best Olympic races of this millennium, what with Ledecky, Titmus and Canada’s Summer McIntosh world record holders in the event at some point. The opening night of what promises to be a rollicking swim meet focused on those three, each an accomplished competitor. Look out.The problem with the idea that there might be blood in the pool is that it’s really just adrenaline.Ledecky, the 27-year-old from Bethesda who counts the 400 free in 2016 among her seven Olympic golds, is among the nicest, most pleasant people you could encounter in this shiny steel suburb west of Paris — or anywhere on the planet, for that matter. She is not as much threatened by Titmus, who memorably beat her in this event at the Tokyo Olympics to become the standard-bearer at the distance, as she is pushed by her. Add the teenager McIntosh to the mix, and the competition is fierce. The aftermath is friendly.“It’s nice to catch up with her,” Titmus said, “see her and have a chat.”There will be spice at the Olympic pool this week — and maybe more, given the presence of 11 Chinese swimmers who tested positive for a banned substance before the Tokyo Games but were allowed to compete. That so many are back, after no repercussions, has left swimmers from Western nations openly wondering whether this is a clean competition and some Chinese saying the rest of the world is just scared of their accomplishments.That storyline thankfully didn’t touch the women’s 400 free. The building was electric during introductions, with Ledecky receiving a thunderous ovation as she walked out last based on her performance in the preliminaries. That in itself was something of a development because Titmus has three times swam faster than Ledecky’s best time, the then-world record she set as a teenager at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. To show up and show out, even in a morning semifinal, wasn’t nothing — and it gave her the coveted lane over Titmus for the final, at this point a rarity.“I joked with her before the medals,” Ledecky said of swimming the better semifinal time, “‘You’re getting a little comfortable there in Lane 4.’”Right, the medals. Though New Zealand’s Erika Fairweather swam faster in the morning than McIntosh — and, indeed, is one of just five women in history to swim under four minutes in this event — the race was touted as a three-way battle royale. Of the 30 best times in the history of the event, Titmus, McIntosh and Ledecky own 30 of them.So the buzz was real. La Défense Arena normally holds indoor rugby matches. It has been modified to have a pool here. With the swimmers at the starting blocks, it buzzed.“I’d like to think that I contributed a little bit to the buildup around that race with my performances,” said Ledecky, never boastful, always realistic. “But they’ve continued to get faster over the years and push the pace in this event, and it’s incredibly exciting to be a part of it. I think we could all still feel the energy in the stadium today, and that definitely spurred us on.”The energy may not have matched the race. Titmus took control from the start, blazing over the first 50 meters in 27.31 seconds, by which time Ledecky was fourth. Titmus led after 100 meters and 200 meters and every time the swimmers touched the wall. When the 23-year-old from Tasmania beat Ledecky three years ago in Tokyo, she was the first person to do so in an individual Olympic race. Even if that was predictable given performances before those pandemic-delayed Games, it still was stunning.This felt normal, expected.“It’s a different feeling winning it again after the first time,” Titmus said. “I know what it takes to be an Olympic champion, and I know how hard it is racing in these circumstances.”As does Ledecky. By the last 50 meters, the order was preordained and a bit anticlimactic: Titmus for gold in 3:57.49, McIntosh for silver 0.88 seconds behind her and Ledecky with the first bronze among her 11 Olympic medals in 4:00.86.“I would like to have gone a little faster tonight,” said Ledecky, who swam 3:58.35 at the U.S. Olympic trials last month.Ledecky’s best events — she owns the 16 best times in the 800 free and the 19 best times in the 1,500 free — are still to come. So she could say quite truthfully, “I’m looking forward to the rest of the week.” Before she left the medal stand, she was handed a camera, and her job was to take a selfie of the trio — herself in front, Titmus immediately behind her, McIntosh in back.“I was joking with them,” Ledecky said, “like, ‘You’re going to give the oldest person the phone to figure out how to open it up and click the right button?’”Maybe it wasn’t the time she wanted. Maybe it wasn’t the race she expected. But part of coming to the Olympics for a fourth time is acknowledging challengers who weren’t there when she made her debut a dozen years ago as a 15-year-old. When Ledecky won gold in the 800 freestyle in London, Titmus was 11, McIntosh 5. They were dreamers then. Now they are performers — and rivals and maybe even friends.“We have a lot of respect for each other,” Ledecky said. “We love competing against each other.”There will be fights in the pool this week. They didn’t happen on opening night. And that’s just fine."
WaPo_3,"After Tokyo disappointment, Torri Huske is positioned for Paris redemption",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/27/torri-huske-100-meter-butterfly-olympics/,2024-07-28 08:00:02.837576,,"NANTERRE, France — Living through the race was painful enough, re-watching it was downright torture. So Torri Huske has mostly avoided it. She says she played it a couple of times that first year after the Tokyo Games, but it never got any easier. The result never changed. The difference between an Olympic medal and three years of second-guessing, wondering, lamenting: just one-hundredth of a second.“Even though, like, it sucked having to watch it, I feel like it probably helped me,” Huske says now. “Just seeing that race and knowing I don’t want to feel like that ever again.”She’s in Paris seeking redemption at these Olympics, to find the sliver of time that kept her off the podium and make sure the Olympic record books don’t remember her as a talented sprinter who was a fingernail away from glory. Huske, the 21-year old from Arlington, Va., is off to promising start, helping the U.S. women capture silver in the 4x100 freestyle relay Saturday night and putting herself in prime podium position entering Sunday’s final of the 100-meter butterfly.She’s certainly not dwelling on the past, but that race is a wound that’s still trying to heal. In Tokyo, she was just a year removed from graduation at Yorktown High and was getting ready to report to Stanford for her freshman year. Her skill level was high; experience and expectations were not.“Last time, the whole goal at trials was just to make the team,” Huske said in a recent interview. “And I feel like once I had done that, it was really hard for me to try to kind of change gears and be like, okay, now I have to set goals for the Olympics. In my head, I was kind of just like, ‘Wow, I’m here. I made it.’”In that Tokyo 100 fly race three years ago, Huske found herself in second place at the turn, but the last half of the race was a mad sprint with water sloshing in every lane. Canada’s Maggie MacNeil blasted her way from seventh to first, but only 0.14 seconds separated the top four finishers. Huske was nipped at the end. Her fourth-place time of 55.73 seconds was just a hair behind Australia’s Emma McKeon, 0.01 seconds that would somehow hang over — and influence — the weeks, months and years that would follow.“Even though it was definitely a setback at the time, it helped me in the future,” Huske said, noting her strong showing a year later at the 2022 world championships in Budapest, where she won six medals, including three golds.That growth was on display Saturday, the opening night of the Paris meet. Three years earlier, her strategy in the 100 fly race amounted to “fly and die,” she says. She’s more measured now, thinking strategically and focused on the back half of her race.In the Paris semifinal, Huske led from start to finish, touching the wall in 56.0 seconds. It was the second-best mark of the day, but Huske knows there’s room for improvement. She posted her personal best time at the U.S. trials last month, 55.52, the fourth-fastest time ever, though she might have to go even lower Sunday.Her U.S. teammate, Gretchen Walsh, won Saturday’s other semifinal in 55.38 seconds, just 0.20 seconds shy of the world record she set at last month’s trials, putting the Americans in position for a pair of potential medals in the race.Huske already got a taste of the Paris podium, turning in a tremendous leg in the women’s 4x100 relay Saturday. The Americans were running in fourth at the race’s midway point, when Walsh touched the wall and Huske leaped from the block.Huske went on to turn in the best 50-meter split of any of the U.S. women — 24.47 seconds. She reeled in Sweden first and then China, and had the Americans in second for the final leg. Huske’s 100-meter time of 52.06 was the second-best of anyone in the relay final, and gave Simone Manuel enough breathing room on the anchor leg to hold on for silver. It’s Huske’s second Olympic medal; she was part of the U.S. women’s 4×100m medley relay team that finished second in Tokyo, just 0.13 seconds behind Australia.“It was good,” she said Saturday night. “I get really nervous on relays, and I’ve been workshopping my start for the whole year. That I finally got it in a good place and I was just trying to set it up well for Simone.”Huske will also compete in the 100 free in Paris and could get a look in at least one more relay. It’s a heavy workload, to be sure, but she’s been focused on it since that disappointing 100 fly result in Tokyo. In the year leading up to these Olympics, she took a break from her studies at Stanford and paused her athletic career. She felt overloaded by schoolwork, emotionally and mentally drained. Focused solely on her training, she says, has already paid dividends in the water and out.This time around, just making the U.S. Olympic team wasn’t going to be enough,“I have more goals for the future,” she said."
WaPo_4,"It was 90 in D.C. on Saturday, but it was also a great day.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/27/weather-washington-warm-dry-cool/,2024-07-28 08:00:02.837576,,"It was 90 degrees in the District on Saturday once again, but it demonstrated how delightful even a 90-degree day can be when the sweet summer air is totally lacking in humidity.Saturday was also notable for the coolness of the morning, when the mercury in D.C. descended to a pleasant and comfortable level that had not been encountered here in weeks.A few minutes before sunrise, the thermometer proclaimed that the temperature in Washington was only 68 degrees. It was a July milestone of minimalism.Even in the strictly numerical sense, that 68 proclaimed a definite victory over the steamy forces of  summer.Although it may have occurred too suddenly to organize a celebration, that 68-degree reading marked the first time in a substantial period of punishing heat that Washington had  been cooler than 70 degrees.On July 2 the low was 66 degrees. Since then the low temperature each day had been in the 70s. That is, when it was not in the 80s.One of the best techniques for summertime survival in an often-steamy city like Washington is to enjoy the consolations of cool shelter at night. But high nighttime temperatures frustrate that effort. Thus, Saturday’s morning low of 68 degrees seemed enough in itself to make the day  worth welcoming. That reading is the average low temperature in D.C. in the middle of June, a month with a far better meteorological reputation than July.Among the other delights, large and small, offered by Saturday was the sight of the moon during morning daylight. Waning, but still more than half full, it rode high in the west,  an almost ghostly apparition in a blue sky.Around 9:30 a.m., it seemed to be an isolated presence, unaccompanied by any cloud in an expanse of sky that showed the barest hint of summertime haze.The temperature was in the low 80s. A dew point on the border between the 50s and 60s confirmed a suspicion that humidity had temporarily abandoned the Washington area.It suggested the start of long sunny hours of summertime pleasure, of a kind of day that seemed to represent late July at its atmospheric pinnacle.It seemed benevolent and beguiling, filled with luxuriant but benign warmth. Clouds eventually gathered, but they drifted in a lazy, almost dreamlike way.Saturday seemed to be close to the peak of July enjoyment,  and almost everything about it combined to dismiss even the possibility that summer could ever be fearsome or disagreeable."
WaPo_5,"U.S. swimmers can’t take gold, or Caeleb Dressel, for granted anymore",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/27/paris-olympics-swimming-katie-ledecky-caeleb-dressel/,2024-07-28 08:00:02.837576,,"NANTERRE, France — As Caeleb Dressel flung himself from the starting blocks Saturday at Paris La Défense Arena at the end of the first finals session of the Paris Olympics swim meet, Team USA was still without a gold medal. There are few sure things anymore for the American swimmers in what feels like a transitional era for this powerhouse program, but Dressel with a nearly two-second lead in the anchor leg of the men’s 4x100-meter freestyle relay is still one of them.There is a reason the U.S. swim team considers Dressel its ultimate firewall against the encroaching tide of parity coming from Australia and other rivals, why the Americans would take 90 percent of Dressel’s best over 100 percent of someone else, why they chose him over some faster, younger teammates — the ones who built him that lead Saturday night — for the crucial anchor leg.When Dressel, 27, touched the wall more than a second clear of the Australian to his right, Team USA had that first gold medal. Dressel and the three youngsters — Jack Alexy (21), Chris Guiliano (21) and Hunter Armstrong (23) — finished in 3:09.28, safely ahead of the runner-up Aussies (3:10.35) and the bronze medalists from Italy (3:10.70).“They made my job easy,” Dressel said.For Dressel, the victory extended one of the more remarkable runs in recent swimming history: He remains unbeaten in Olympic finals. Eight times to the starting blocks, eight gold medals. Though he isn’t the unbeatable force he was in Tokyo, where he won five gold medals and cemented his status as the premier male swimmer in the world, he remains an elite racer whose ability to get his hand to the wall is still world-class.“Relays are a little more special, to be honest. It takes me back to my first gold,” Dressel said, recalling his two relay wins at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games. “It really doesn’t get old. It’s really special standing on the podium with these guys.”The crowd that filed into La Défense Arena, a 30,000-seat indoor stadium that is home to the Racing 92 rugby team, cheered on the Americans with only slightly less energy and volume than it did the French swimmers in the field. After two renditions of “Advance Australia Fair” — the Aussie national anthem — finally the last medal ceremony of the night brought “The Star-Spangled Banner.” On the top step of the podium, Armstrong was in tears as the anthem rang out.“I will give my entire body and soul up for these boys,” Armstrong, who swam the third leg, said of the emotions behind his ­46.75-second split, the fastest of the four Americans. “I knew I had to give Caeleb everything I had, so I’m glad I was able to get my job done.”If Dressel’s presence at the end of that relay was a comfort to his three teammates, that relay’s presence at the end of an otherwise unfavorable race card on opening night was a comfort to the entire team. While the victory prevented a gold medal shutout, the Americans already trail their rivals from Down Under in the gold medal count (two to one) and the overall count (four to three).Earlier on Saturday night, Australian middle-distance star Ariarne Titmus turned a potential race-of-the-century matchup against American distance legend Katie Ledecky and Canadian teenager Summer McIntosh into a rout, touching the wall in 3:57.49, nearly a second faster than silver medalist McIntosh (3:58.37) and more than three seconds clear of Ledecky (4:00.86). For Ledecky, the bronze medal was the first of her Olympic career, to go with seven golds and three silvers, and leaves her one medal shy of matching three others for the most by a female swimmer in history.You need to go back to 1988 — when it amassed eight gold medals and 18 overall, compared with 11 and 28 for East Germany — to find the last time Team USA failed to finish atop the medal table in swimming. But Australia, in particular, has been closing fast and outpaced the Americans in golds a year ago at the world championships in Fukuoka, Japan — a meet in which, notably, Dressel did not swim, having recently taken an eight-month mental health break from the sport.When it comes to the women’s side of the sport, the Australians have already surpassed Team USA for world supremacy, based on the results from the Tokyo Olympics as well as the 2023 world championships — both of which saw the Aussies double the Americans’ gold medal hauls.And on Saturday, their women’s 4x100 free relay of Mollie O’Callaghan, Shayna Jack, Emma McKeon and Meg Harris (3:28.92) torched the silver medal-winning American quartet of Kate Douglass, Gretchen Walsh, Torri Huske and Simone Manuel (3:30.20). Walsh and Huske, however, have Team USA pointed toward a potential gold-silver sweep of the 100-meter butterfly Sunday, having finished 1-2 in Saturday’s semifinals.Like Dressel, Manuel, 27, has been absent from the international scene in recent years, having been forced into an extended break by a bout of overtraining syndrome. Like Dressel, she poured an infinite amount of emotion and energy into trying to will herself back into form. And like Dressel, she viewed her anchor leg as a mission she once thought she might never be entrusted to take again.“It just feels good to be back here, honestly,” Manuel said. “I didn’t know if I would ever be performing at this level again, and so just to have the full-circle moment of being on this relay again from 2021 to now but in a happier and healthier place, I just think is really special. So I’m really excited I got to get my first Paris medal with these women.”Like Dressel and Ledecky, Manuel represents a link to the program’s glory years. All three earned gold at Rio in 2016, the last Olympics of Michael Phelps, when the Americans could still be counted upon to dominate the medal table — that year’s haul was 16 golds and 33 overall, compared with three and 10 for second-place Australia — and the pipeline of talent seemed endless.To get the Americans back to that point, if it’s even possible anymore, is going to take more than the efforts of their veterans. The remaining eight days of this meet will show whether the younger group has the wherewithal to hold off Australia and the rest of the world for another generation."
WaPo_6,"A priest sues Grindr after he was outed, his lawsuit says",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/27/priest-grindr-privacy-lawsuit/,2024-07-28 08:44:02.837576,,"When Monsignor Jeffrey Burrill began using queer dating app Grindr in 2017, there was no indication that people outside of the app could access his data, according to a new lawsuit. If there had been, the lawsuit said, he never would’ve downloaded it.After all, Burrill’s position as the top administrator of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) required him to take a vow of celibacy, and Catholic teaching opposes sexual activity outside heterosexual marriage.But in 2021, a Catholic media site reported that Burrill had been using the app, news that forced him to resign from his position, according to the lawsuit, which Burrill filed against Grindr last week in California Superior Court.Burrill alleged that Grindr did not protect his data and inform him that vendors could access it, leading him to lose his job and suffer “significant damage” to his reputation.A spokeswoman for Grindr said in a statement to The Washington Post that the company “intends to respond vigorously to these allegations, which are based on mischaracterizations of practices relating to user data.”James Carr, an attorney representing Burrill, wrote to Grindr last month that his client was “publicly ‘outed’ as gay” as a result of his data being released, according to a copy of the letter.“To have that decision forced out of your hands and into the public realm is reprehensible,” Carr told The Post on Saturday.Burrill’s resignation made national headlines in July 2021, dividing Catholics and reflecting a shift in traditional church power dynamics, with some churchgoers now in positions to pressure bishops. It also shed light on the issues surrounding data privacy.His resignation came around the same time that the Pillar, an online newsletter that covers the Catholic Church and that is not a defendant in the lawsuit, reported that it had collected information about Burrill from Grindr that showed he visited gay bars. The news site said it hired an independent firm to authenticate the information.The USCCB asked Burrill to resign after it received his Grindr data from the Catholic Laity and Clergy for Renewal (CLCR), said Gregory Helmer, an attorney representing Burrill. The CLCR is a Denver nonprofit which, according to its tax records, aims to “empower the church to carry out its mission” by giving bishops “evidence-based resources” with which to identify weaknesses in how they train priests. A USCCB spokeswoman told The Post at the time that Burrill decided to resign after allegations of his “improper behavior” were released.Jayd Henricks, the president of the CLCR, wrote in an email to The Post on Saturday that the organization retrieved Grindr data to help Catholic bishops “assist their priests and seminarians in living their priestly vows.” He denied sharing information with the Pillar, which has not revealed its source.Grindr sold Burrill’s data from between 2017 and 2021 to companies and data vendors, the lawsuit said. Henricks wrote in religious journal First Things last year that the CLCR bought the “publicly available data” in an “ordinary way.” But Helmer hopes to learn in court where the organization obtained the data.“We want answers so we can use that as a warning to other Grindr users,” Helmer said.In June 2022, Burrill’s bishop, William Callahan, appointed Burrill the parochial administrator of a parish in La Crosse, Wis. But Burrill is still “trying to get back on his feet” after suffering from “shame and embarrassment,” Helmer said.Last month, Carr asked Grindr to compensate Burrill $5 million. When Grindr didn’t agree, Carr said, Burrill filed a lawsuit on July 18, requesting damages and an order that would prevent the app from releasing users’ data without prior notice.Chris Hoofnagle, the faculty director of the University of California at Berkeley’s Center for Law and Technology, said most people don’t read companies’ privacy policies, and even if they did, companies typically remain vague in their policies, such as saying they’ll “sometimes” share information about their users. Hoofnagle said some companies could find new customers by purchasing data from Grindr, such as a store that sells LGBTQ+ products.“There’s this illusion of control when users put personal information into applications,” Hoofnagle said, “and the reality is that there are an unfathomable number of security breaches, many of which we never hear about because they’re undisclosed.”Anton Dahbura, the executive director of Johns Hopkins University’s Information Security Institute, said the U.S. government doesn’t have enough regulation over data privacy to halt many data sales. Even as some lawmakers are pushing for more protections, Dahbura said the problem is getting worse.Burrill isn’t the first person to accuse Grindr of not protecting users’ privacy. A lawsuit filed in April alleged that the app shared users’ HIV statuses, and the company’s former chief privacy officer Ron De Jesus said last year that he was fired after he raised concerns about Grindr’s privacy.Michelle Boorstein contributed to this report.

WaPo_7,"If you don’t know Frederick Richard’s name, you will soon if he has his way",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/27/frederick-richard-gymnast-paris-olympics/,2024-07-28 08:23:02.837576,,"PARIS — Before competing on his best apparatus, Frederick Richard sat in fourth place in the overall standings of the men’s gymnastics qualification. No place at all for someone who possesses Frederick Richard’s aspirations.Richard, 20, may be a gymnast in name and reputation. But he’s really a dreamer. An ambitious climber. A young man who views these Paris Olympics as his launchpad to world domination. Which, if Richard was a movie villain, would sound menacing.“I’d want to say that the world knows Frederick Richard’s name …”Somehow, Richard — with his disarming smile and sincere expressions — can pull off a quote like that. He’s just being honest.So, ahead of his high bar routine, Richard stood just feet away from the elevated platform and lowered his head. No, he wasn’t thinking about the standings. Richard says he doesn’t follow the scores, and if that’s true, then he didn’t realize that he was trailing his U.S. and University of Michigan teammate Paul Juda and a pair of gymnasts from Britain. Instead, Richard bowed his head so he could visualize his routine.This was the same apparatus on which he had earned an NCAA championship during his freshman season at Michigan and won during the 2021 U.S. gymnastics championships. Most people don’t know that — because most people don’t follow men’s gymnastics. Richard aims to change that.Some Olympians arrive at the Olympics just happy to wave their flag during the Opening Ceremonies. Did you catch the Italians’ party boat floating down the Seine on Friday night? Not all of those athletes will leave with a medal, but they all won gold in having the most fun.Other athletes would consider it to be a lifetime achievement to medal in their discipline. After U.S. divers Kassidy Cook and Sarah Bacon won their silver medals in the women’s synchronized three-meter diving competition, Cook summed up the dream feeling: “This is freaking awesome.”But Richard has other plans. He simply wants to dominate his sport, make it popular for the masses, create a pipeline for young Black boys … and, oh, yes, take over the world.“I put it on myself, but I don’t view it as pressure. I view it as an opportunity,” Richard said after the day’s first subdivision when the United States competed alongside Britain, Canada, Germany and several other individuals representing their countries. “I grew up my whole life wishing there was some Black gymnast dominating the sport in the men’s side that I could look up to, wishing that the sport was 20 times bigger. And now I have an opportunity to contribute to that and make that happen.”Conquering a mountain that high takes small, incremental steps. Such as in 2023, when Richard became the first American male to medal in the all-around at the world championships in 13 years. Then another step Saturday, when he sought to finish among the 24 gymnasts who would qualify for the all-around final in the Olympics.So Richard was envisioning his next step, seeing himself complete every daring and graceful skill on the high bar. With his eyes closed, Richard moved ever so slightly. Turning his head to the right, twisting his torso to the left. He called it “going through the motions,” a mundane and completely wrong way of explaining the complexities and power involved in his high-difficulty routine. When Richard finished his visualization, he rested on a seat to watch teammate Brody Malone’s routine.Malone struggled. On his first release element, Malone let go of the high bar, flipped in the air and fell. Richard reacted by looking away. The way you might divert your eyes when someone slips on a sidewalk, as to not add to their embarrassment. Then Malone slipped again, and Richard, again, turned his eyes to the left. Looking away might have been the most kind thing, but also someone with Richard’s goals can’t let the visual of a faulty release creep into his mind. He’s got a world to conquer.Finally, his turn on the high bar. And Frederick Richard proved why he deserves to speak liberally of himself in the third person.From the crowd inside Bercy Arena, the gasps were mixed with awe when Richard let go for his first release attempt and caught the bar. Those gulps grew louder into enthusiastic cheers by his second and third and fourth flips. Then, Richard dismounted and stuck a dead-on landing, finishing with a 14.166 score, good enough for third overall in the group.“Let’s go!” Richard said to himself, to the crowd, to the audience he hasn’t met quite yet but hopes to wow over the next few days.“I just view that as an opportunity,” Richard said. “Every day’s an opportunity to compete and to make this sport bigger, and make my dreams happen. So I could see it right there; I’m reaching for it and not fearing missing out.”The United States finished behind Britain in its subdivision, casting doubt on whether this team can earn a medal. That’s not where Richard wants the sport to be.Behind his high bar routine, Richard finished 10th after all the gymnasts were done Saturday.  Richard would have to earn a medal — gold would be nice, if far-fetched — to accomplish his world takeover. For now, a gymnast can dream, can’t he?“I think we want to say that Team USA made a statement to the world, that we’re getting better and better on the men’s side, and we represented the country well,” Richard said, answering a question on what he would like the narrative to be surrounding his team following its Olympic performance. “I’d want to say that the world knows Frederick Richard’s name and that he’s going to keep getting stronger and stronger and in 2028 he’ll probably be the greatest gymnast in the world. That’s what I want the world to say after this competition.”"
WaPo_8,"Years after his dad drowned, this Commanders starter is teaching kids to swim",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/27/cornelius-lucas-swim-commanders/,2024-07-28 08:00:02.837576,,"Cornelius Lucas III remembers everything about the day his father drowned on a family camping trip outside their home in New Orleans.“We had a little campfire going. … I was running around. I was in and out the water, but I didn’t really go deep. My dad had went in the water deep a couple times, and I feel like this was his second or third time, maybe third or fourth time going back in the water.“He literally asked me, ‘You want to come with me?’ I was like, ‘Nah, I’m just going to stick back here and throw the football around.’ And I just remember seeing him walk out — as a kid, everything seemed bigger — but maybe like 40, 50 yards deep into the water. And then he — I saw his hands waving at me, and he just dipped underwater.”People rushed out to help, but when they got there, they couldn’t find his father. He had been dragged under by a riptide.“Forty-five minutes later, he floated back,” Lucas said.“At the age of 7, I was out of having a dad, out of having my best bud, my best friend, my greatest — my best teacher, you know what I’m saying? Like, the guy that was put in this world to give me all the game that I’ve been searching for since then.”Twenty-six years later, Lucas is a man, 6-foot-8, 327 pounds, a professional hitter with a goofball grin and the self-confidence he lacked growing up without his dad. Lucas believes his unlikely journey has led him to this moment with the Washington Commanders. Entering the 11th season of his improbable NFL career, the longtime backup is competing for the huge role of starting left tackle and blind-side protector for new franchise quarterback Jayden Daniels.Lucas, 33, feels he’s doing well early in the competition with rookie Brandon Coleman, and unlike his first shot at being a full-time starter (his second season, with Detroit), he feels ready.Many players who go undrafted out of college, as Lucas did out of Kansas State in 2014, get chewed up by the NFL. Their moment is darkened by the ever-present possibility of getting fired, and they’re often forced out of the league against their will, broken or brokenhearted. In his fifth year, Lucas was overwhelmed by repeated rejection and tried to quit by ignoring calls from his agent.It was in those difficult moments Lucas felt his father’s absence most.“Outside of my coaches and my teammates to push me and tell me I could do this, I haven’t had someone I could call on and just tell them how I’m feeling, what’s going on,” he said.“It’s really been a me situation. Like, me figuring it out. Me going home and sitting in silence for two hours because I got beat in practice, and I’m thinking about why I got beat and how I can’t get beat no more because I’m on the edge of getting cut, and you know — I’m saying it’s been stressful.”As he honed his skills, Lucas has grown mentally tough, observing people around him, looking for “life tidbits” and refining who he wants to be.In 2018, everything came together. Lucas caught a break, played well in one game for his hometown New Orleans Saints and parlayed it into a job with Chicago, where he shined. In 2020, he signed a two-year deal with the Commanders, and in 2022, he signed another. Last summer, he felt as if he finally “filled myself up enough to pour into others.”And he had an idea how: swim camp. Every summer, NFL players host youth football camps across the country, and while he saw the value in them, he wanted to do something more personal. He attended pool parties growing up, even after his father’s death, but he still had never gone in a pool deeper than his height.So he partnered with Son of a Saint, a nonprofit organization for fatherless boys in New Orleans, and figured he could show boys like him how to be a man and teach them a potentially lifesaving skill.“I live in New Orleans, Louisiana,” Lucas said. “We are currently seven feet under sea level. In New Orleans, we get flooding. Hurricane Katrina, it was flooding for 45 days.”This year, at his second camp, the only boy scared of the water was too big for anyone but Lucas to hold while learning to doggy paddle. Lucas encouraged him to go into the pool, urging him to fight their fear together.“Trust me,” Lucas said. “I won’t let you drown.”Weeks later, Lucas left New Orleans for training camp extra motivated. His girlfriend — with whom he bonded, in part, over missing a parent — is pregnant with their first child, a son, due in early November. Sometimes, when Lucas notices her belly growing, it makes him want to go outside in the sun and practice.“When he gets here, I just want him to see his daddy doing the right thing.”Lucas wants to teach his son all the lessons he had to gather from others, such as how to mow the lawn or drive on the highway. He’s picking up even more from Instagram and TikTok. He hopes to one day teach his son to play tackle.And he wants to throw his son in the water. He wants him to flail on his own at first, to fight to float, because he believes struggling will help his son get comfortable. Even if he doesn’t like to swim, Lucas’s top priority is for his son never to feel how he sometimes felt around water.“He’s not going to have a fear of it,” he said."
WaPo_9,Trump team complained they were not told of suspicious-person reports before shooting,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/27/trump-team-complained-they-were-not-told-suspicious-person-reports-before-shooting/,2024-07-28 09:50:02.720799,,"Members of former president Donald Trump’s Secret Service detail and his top advisers have privately questioned why they were not informed that local police were tracking a suspicious person before that person opened fire on Trump at his July 13 rally in western Pennsylvania, according to people with direct knowledge of the concerns.Approximately 20 to 25 minutes before Thomas Matthew Crooks shot at the former president, local countersnipers noticed him behaving strangely and sent his photograph to a command center staffed by state troopers and Secret Service agents, the head of Pennsylvania State Police told a congressional committee Tuesday.Members of the Secret Service detail that protects Trump and was with him backstage have complained to confidantes and others inside the agency that they were never made aware of that warning, said three people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive conversations about that day. They also said they were not aware that the local countersnipers eventually lost track of Crooks, or that another local officer — hoisted up to the roof of a building just outside the rally site’s security perimeter — saw Crooks perched there with a gun.The Trump detail’s first warning of trouble came as gunshots began ringing out at 6:11 p.m.,  eight minutes after Trump took the stage, according to the three people. The assassination attempt wounded Trump, killed one rallygoer and critically wounded two others.Some of Trump’s top advisers, in a large white tent behind the stage where Trump was speaking,  thought the spray of bullets was  fireworks, two people said, and did not immediately dive to the ground. According to the two people, Trump advisers said that they first learned of any issue when the shots were fired, and that they could not understand why the suspicious-person alert hadn’t been passed on to them so they could consider delaying Trump’s speech — a sentiment Trump echoed in a TV interview. “Nobody mentioned it. Nobody said there was a problem,” the former president said in an interview that aired Monday on Fox News. “They could’ve said, ‘Let’s wait for 15 minutes, 20 minutes, five minutes, something. Nobody said — I think that was a mistake.”Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Saturday the agency was declining to comment on The Washington Post’s questions about which radio communications Trump’s security detail received at the Butler rally. He repeated that the agency is examining everything about the incident, including whether there might have been a communication breakdown among its staff or other law enforcement, to determine precisely what happened.“As it relates to communications at the rally, the Secret Service is committed to better understanding what happened before, during, and after the assassination attempt of former President Trump to ensure that never happens again,” Guglielmi said in a statement. “That includes complete cooperation with Congress, the FBI and other relevant investigations.”A spokeswoman for Trump declined to comment.The concerns from Trump’s security detail and his advisers come after a period in which tensions between the former president’s orbit and top Secret Service officials simmered for months — and boiled over after the July 13 assassination attempt.Trump’s team has been at odds with Secret Service headquarters over various requests that the agency denied, including more magnetometers at events, more countersnipers at some events and other specialty teams at other events, The Post has reported. The Secret Service and Trump’s team also repeatedly clashed over security and logistics at the Republican National Convention earlier this month.The Butler, Pa., shooting is also emblematic of what some Secret Service critics say are chronic communication problems that have dogged the agency and contributed to serious security lapses.Members of Congress have repeatedly questioned the role that poor communication may have played in allowing 20-year-old Crooks an opportunity to shoot at Trump, an episode widely considered the worst Secret Service security failure since then-President Reagan was shot in 1981. Communication breakdowns —  because of the different radio frequencies that Secret Service teams use while working together and also technical failures in communications systems — have figured into some of the agency’s other significant security lapses. When a gunman began shooting at the White House one night in November 2011, for example, President Obama’s daughter Sasha was at home with her grandmother. But an agent protecting Sasha Obama did not know about the shooter for several minutes because the agent used a different radio frequency than officers and agents stationed at the White House. and no one had alerted him to the threat outside.At the Trump rally this month, knowledge that law enforcement officials were looking for a suspicious person just outside the security perimeter may have factored into security decisions by Trump’s team, though it is unclear whether it would have caused them to stop him from taking the stage.Sometimes there are reports of suspicious people or activities at Trump’s rallies, and they turn out to be nothing, said one of the people who spoke to The Post, and who is in Trump’s orbit and familiar with operations at his rallies. Usually when there are reports of suspicious people, though, this person said, they are located inside the hardened Secret Service perimeter of the rally — which means they have been screened by magnetometers meant to prevent people from entering with weapons. There would have been no such comfort with Crooks, given that he was just outside the secure area.A Secret Service official told The Post investigators are still working to determine whether anyone relayed the information about the suspicious person to Trump’s security detail or to other Secret Service operational teams.The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation, said reports of suspicious people are fairly commonplace at some public events and sometimes do not rise to the level of changing plans or alerting the senior official’s security detail, a team of  about five to 10 agents who serve as the innermost ring of security for that person.At a House Oversight hearing on Monday, then-Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle was asked why the Secret Service didn’t immediately delay the Trump speech or act more aggressively when local police reported a suspicious person. She told lawmakers that such reports were commonplace.“At a number of our protected sites, there are suspicious individuals that are identified all the time,” she said. “It doesn’t necessarily mean that they constitute a threat.”Cheatle told lawmakers the Secret Service was notified of a suspicious person at the Pennsylvania rally “somewhere between two and five times” and that she didn’t know when countersnipers or the “shift” — another term for Trump’s security detail — were notified of those warnings. The agency was examining whether there had been a communications breakdown that prevented an effective response, she said.Cheatle resigned last week under intense pressure from Republican and Democratic lawmakers who were outraged at the security lapses.Col. Christopher L. Paris, head of Pennsylvania State Police, told the House Homeland Security Committee on Tuesday that local countersnipers saw Crooks as suspicious because he was milling around just outside the rally site and not entering. Their suspicion grew when they saw him with a golf range finder, Paris said. At that point, they sent a picture of Crooks to a Pennsylvania state trooper who was stationed in a command center with Secret Service agents.That trooper relayed the message verbally to the Secret Service in the command center. The Secret Service requested that the warning be forwarded to a different phone number, which state police understood belonged to a Secret Service “tactical asset,” Paris testified.Several committee members asked Paris whether various law enforcement agencies had been able to communicate effectively and efficiently on the day of the Butler rally. Rep. Morgan Luttrell (R-Texas) asked whether there was one common radio channel where any law enforcement could raise a red flag in case of a threat. “If they don’t, how many people does that have to go through to get to the right actor in order to say, ‘Stop!’?”“I don’t know,” Paris replied.Paris said that on the day of the Butler rally, there were three different radio systems for local, state and federal law enforcement officials. State police had sought to integrate with Secret Service communications by sitting together in one command post, he said.He added that there are disadvantages to sharing one communications channel among many law enforcement officers.On the day of the rally, more than 100 people needed medical attention because of the heat, and officers were fielding reports of a missing 6-year-old and three other suspicious people besides Crooks, he said. “In theory, the more people you have on the same channel, if there was a medical emergency or a lost 6-year-old, and everyone keys up at once, it paralyzes your communication.”"
WaPo_10,Harris and Trump grapple with a transformed race for the White House,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/27/harris-trump-election-white-house/,2024-07-28 09:56:02.720799,,"ST. CLOUD, Minn. — Donald Trump supporters lining up to enter a rally here passed the usual tents hawking MAGA merchandise, but suddenly most of the gear attacking President Biden (often in vulgar terms) was gone. A few straggler stickers remained with a phrase that’s code for a profane expression against Biden. New swag targeting Vice President Harris, the new likely Democratic nominee, had yet to arrive.Those sale racks were a small but telling symbol of how the White House race has rapidly transformed since Biden withdrew last Sunday. Democrats have swung from despondency to jubilance with a surge of fundraising, volunteering and meme-making, with one dance club thumping to an excerpt of a viral quote from Harris about falling from a coconut tree. Republicans, meanwhile, have struggled to adapt to Biden’s exit and settle on a clear message to define Harris, with just 100 days until the election.“He will always be my first choice, but she’s my second choice,” Trump said Saturday of running against Biden or Harris at the top of the ticket. During an address at a bitcoin conference in Nashville, he said he was running against “a low I.Q. individual — her.” (He used the same phrase to describe Biden).Later, at the rally in St. Cloud, Trump called Harris his “new victim” and mocked her laugh.“They’re trying to make her into a — let’s say Margaret Thatcher,” Trump said, referring to the former British prime minister. “I don’t think so. It’s not going to happen. Margaret Thatcher didn’t laugh like that. Did she? Did she laugh? If she did she wouldn’t have been Margaret Thatcher. It’s very simple.”A new national survey by the Wall Street Journal found 49 percent of registered voters said they supported Trump and 47 percent backed Harris, within the margin of error, compared to Trump leading Biden by six percentage points in the same poll before Biden dropped out. New Fox News polls in battleground states found the candidates statistically tied in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Harris led by six points in Minnesota.Interviews with rallygoers ahead of a Trump event that was supposed to signal strength and a widening path to victory reflected the grab-bag attacks that Republicans are trying against Harris. Trump supporters referenced her role in the administration’s response to migration, called her liberal and criticized the process of replacing Biden on the ticket. Similarly, the pro-Trump MAGA Inc. super PAC launched new ads attacking Harris on the border, accusing her of covering up Biden’s health and having a liberal voting record.“I will proudly put my record against his any day,” Harris said at a fundraiser in Pittsfield, Mass. “Some folks would suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down … The true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.”Harris allies responded with a new spot touting her work as a prosecutor, state attorney general and vice president. The super PAC Future Forward said it would spend $50 million boosting Harris ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August. Another group, American Bridge 21st Century, is resuming Trump attack ads in battleground states.Harris allies are leaning into attacking Trump’s new running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), as out of touch with the values of most Americans, especially by spotlighting his three-year-old comments calling Democrats — including Harris — “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable.” (Harris has two stepchildren.)“You’ve all seen how pathetic JD Vance is, what a weirdo,” second gentleman Doug Emhoff said Saturday at a door-knocking event in Stevens Point, Wis., in support of his wife. “Seriously, this guy, the more you get to know him, the more it’s just ridiculous.”In a viral cable news interview, Gov. Tim Walz (D-Minn.), who has emerged as a leading contender for Harris’s running mate, warnedVance that he should careful about stirring the anger of cat people. The Harris campaign followed with a statement describing Vance as a “creep (who wants to ban to abortion nationwide).” Even before changing candidates, the campaign has consistently sought to portray Trump as dangerous and unhinged.Walz, in an interview with The Washington Post, said he wasn’t trying to drive a political message, just making “an observation.”“This is weird stuff — they’re way too obsessed with our bedrooms,” he said. “All of a sudden it feels like to me, people are pausing and saying, ‘You’re right, this just doesn’t feel right.’”Harris’s fundraiser in western Massachusetts on Saturday was expected to bring in $1.4 million for the campaign, according to one of the co-hosts. The campaign said it raised $126 million from 1.4 million donors in the three days after Biden endorsed Harris.The surge of contributions marks a reversal of fortunes for Democrats. As of June, Trump and the GOP had virtually erased an earlier Democratic cash advantage.Harris landed in Massachusetts greeted by busloads of local Democrats, Air National Guard base employees and a 4-H youth group. She took her time on the rope line, mostly posing for selfies.“It’s definitely a complete transformation,” said Valery Franco, a 23-year-old from Springfield, Mass., who works in recruiting at the nearby base. “There was a lot of discouragement about Biden and what we saw in the debate. People felt like they were choosing between the lesser of two evils. But with Kamala, there’s a lot more energy that she’s bringing to the table.”At the fundraiser in Pittsfield, Harris told the crowd that Trump and his allies have been resorting to some “wild lies” about her record. And she picked up the Walz line of argument as well“Some of what he and his running mate are saying it’s just plain weird,” Harris said to laughter at The Colonial Theatre in Pittsfield. “That’s the box you put that in.”She also noted that Trump had “just pulled out of our debate.” Trump and a spokesman have recently made statements casting doubt on sticking with the debate that the former president and Biden agreed to have in September, hosted by ABC News.“I hope he reconsiders because we have a lot to talk about,” she said. But she also told the crowd that Democrats are the “underdogs” in the November election. “The bottom line is we have our work cut out for us.”The event included cellist Yo-Yo Ma, pianist Emanuel Ax and singer-songwriter James Taylor. Former governor Deval Patrick is among the co-hosts for the fundraiser, where tickets to attend ranged from $100 to $12,500. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who ran against Harris in the 2020 presidential primary, also attended.“She made a commitment to come here before this all happened,” said co-host Sherwood Guernsey, an attorney and former state legislator who leads the Rural Freedom Network, a political action committee. “She could have easily said ‘I’ve got to go to the swing states.’ … She’s got lots of other places to go.”Across the pivotal swing states, the Harris campaign said it was hosting 2,300 grass-roots events this weekend to mobilize supporters. Several of the events doubled as auditions for potential running mates including Walz, and Govs. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan.Trump, meanwhile, was scheduled to speak Saturday afternoon at a bitcoin conference in Nashville. The former president previously dismissed cryptocurrency as “a scam” and a “disaster waiting to happen” — but in this campaign, he started opposing “a Central Bank Digital Currency,” adding that to the Republican Party platform, after aggressive lobbying and major donations from industry executives.In the Nashville speech, Trump repeatedly attacked Biden, adding Harris almost as an afterthought.“We lost this wonderful person, you know he’s actually a terrible human being,” Trump said of Biden. “The problem is that Kamala,” he added, mispronouncing Harris’s name. “She’s worse than Joe. … She’s got a little honeymoon going on now.”Later Saturday, Trump was set to join Vance for the rally in Minnesota. Vance has been on defense over his past comments insulting childless people and advocating for a national abortion ban.Taking the stage in St. Cloud ahead of Trump, Vance styled Harris as far-left and out of touch.“The media is at it again,” he told an amped-up crowd that repeatedly leaped to its feet to give deafening cheers. “For three-and-a-half years, my friends, they told us that Joe Biden was Abraham Lincoln. And now the media tells us that Kamala Harris is Martin Luther King Jr.”Many rally attendees brushed off concerns that Harris could pose a stiffer challenger to Trump than Biden. They asked, rhetorically, what she had done as vice president, convinced she had little to show for it. Like Trump, many mispronounced her name. Some had seen the viral videos of what they called Harris’s “word salads” and predicted she would soon trip up again.But there was also a hint of apprehension in the crowd that the race just got harder.“I just feel like there’s more problems ahead with that happening,” said Kris Ryks, a rally attendee from New London, Minn. “It just seems like there’s so much money involved and so many people behind them like never before.”Knowles reported from St. Cloud. Reston reported from Pittsfield. Wells reported from Wasau and Stevens Point. Arnsdorf reported from Washington."
WaPo_11,"From first lady to Flav, everyone wants in on U.S. women’s water polo",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/27/us-womens-water-polo-jill-biden-flavor-flav/,2024-07-28 09:28:02.720799,,"SAINT-DENIS, France — They had summarily laid waste to another Olympic opponent and celebrated with Flavor Flav, and now a dignitary of a different sort wanted to meet them. As members of the imperial U.S. women’s water polo team walked off the Aquatics Centre pool deck Saturday afternoon, an assistant coach told them first lady Jill Biden was waiting.“I got chills,” goalie Ashleigh Johnson said.“My jaw dropped,” captain Maggie Steffens said.When they walked into their players’ lounge after their 15-6 demolition of Greece in their Paris Olympics opener, the Americans saw more than Biden. South Carolina women’s basketball coach Dawn Staley, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass (D) and figure skating legend Brian Boitano all wanted to meet them, too.One of the most dominant sports teams on the planet, the U.S. women opened their attempt at a fourth consecutive gold medal and discovered they have become kind of a big deal. Before Saturday, they had been supported in some form by luminaries that ranged from Taylor Swift to Flav, the rapper who signed a five-year contract to sponsor and promote them as an official hype man.Now, the first lady handed them coins with the presidential seal, and Staley commended their centers, the players who jostle a few feet in front of the net, as particularly impressive.“It just made me remember that this is so much bigger than us,” Johnson said. “It also reminded me that the Olympics creates moments that would never happen.”Johnson felt shaky as Biden addressed her and her teammates. She marveled at how Biden made her feel like the only person in the room. Biden told the players that she had never watched water polo before and that she could not believe the physical exertion the sport requires.“She reminded me of my mom,” Steffens said. “She was wearing the cutest outfit. Here’s the first lady, and the first thing she said was: ‘I could never do what you guys do. It’s so difficult.’ I was like, ‘I do not want to trade jobs.’”Biden arrived late in the match and sat in the front row next to her Greek counterpart. Flav, whose counterpart exists neither domestically nor internationally, sat in the top of the stands waving an American flag and wearing a water polo cap, then walked down to wave to them.The United States’ three remaining group-stage games feel like formalities before the knockout phase in larger Paris La Défense Arena, a place that already holds special meaning for the Americans.As the year began, Coach Adam Krikorian scheduled a test match at the Aquatics Centre for May, wanting his players to get a feel for the city and the pool that would host their opening games. Over the winter, while scanning for a potential family trip to see Swift in concert, Krikorian realized the Eras Tour would be swinging through Paris the same week as his team’s exhibition — and that Swift would be playing La Défense Arena, the venue of the gold medal water polo match.“For us to be able to visualize and get to see the stadium, the only way was to go to a Taylor Swift concert,” Steffens said.Team operations manager Ally Beck contacted Swift’s camp. Swift gifted the entire team tickets. Four days after dusting France, 12-6, in the test match, the U.S. women glammed up and headed to the show together. And thus, two superpowers in their chosen fields — one globally famous, one largely anonymous — converged on a Friday night in May on the outskirts of Paris.“If we get the chance to play in La Défense Arena, we want to be like her,” Steffens said. “We want to be able to love the pressure and have fun and enjoy the moment. As badass and powerful of a woman as she is, for us to see that in person was pretty magical.”At one moment during the set, Krikorian stepped back and looked at his team: Olympic veterans with arms slung over one another’s shoulders, first-timers still in college singing along, all of them swaying together. He began to cry.“You’re trying to create the best environment where there’s so much love and joy that the rest of it takes care of itself,” Krikorian said. “To see them all in that moment, it just got me.”After the Tokyo Games in 2021, there was no guarantee they would be together for another run. They had conquered the world again, and they were exhausted. Krikorian, their coach since the 2012 London Olympics, contemplated retirement. Kaleigh Gilchrist, twice a gold medalist, was sure she was done. Rachel Fattal, a leading scorer back at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games, considered moving on to coaching. Johnson asked herself, “Do I have anything left to give to this sport?”Steffens, the lone current player to win all three golds, started recruiting them for one more run. Krikorian took Gilchrist out to breakfast and, rather than congratulating her on a great career as she expected, told her, “You know, you could still play water polo.” Gilchrist texted Johnson to ask if she would return. “I will if you do,” Johnson replied. At some point, an individual choice became a collective decision.The Americans entered these Olympics carrying both utter dominance and relative vulnerability. They brought a 172-5 run of dominance into the Tokyo Games, then lost to Hungary in the group stage before cruising to gold. They have gone 27-6 in major tournaments since 2021, finishing fifth at last year’s world championship and losing twice before taking gold at the World Cup. They fell to Hungary, 10-8, in their final friendly tuneup in Berkley, Calif., this month.In an instant Saturday, the United States showed it still has the Olympics in a stranglehold. The Americans romped to a 7-0 lead, Johnson commanding from the goal and their rhythmic offense pulverizing Greece’s net. “There’s a part of me that was like, ‘Where’s this been, guys?’” Krikorian said. “They love these moments.”Johnson — “maybe the best goalkeeper of all time,” Greek Coach Alexia Kammenou said — saved 10 of the 14 shots she faced. Nine Americans scored. Olympic rookie Jenna Flynn had a hat trick before halftime and finished with four goals, an emblem of how younger players have meshed with gold medalists.“There was a fairly large gap between the women that have been there and done it before and all of our youngsters,” Krikorian said. “And I think that gap has closed significantly, if there even is a gap.”Krikorian tells his players to appreciate every moment. After their opener, Maddie Musselman, twice a gold medalist, looked up into the crowd and felt goose bumps. She did not see a rapper or celebrity or politician. She saw her family, and it reminded her that they had been absent in Tokyo. It was another moment that could happen only at the Olympics."
WaPo_12,Asking Eric: Did aunt dress inappropriately to ruin niece’s wedding?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/07/28/asking-eric-wedding-dresscode-aunt/,2024-07-28 11:59:02.825844,,"Dear Eric: My husband and I recently hosted the wedding of our daughter in our beautiful, upscale California beach town. The reception was described as “cocktails, dinner, and dancing,” and children were not included. The dress was “Festive Cocktail Attire,” which was communicated via a save-the-date notice sent on paper via the U.S. Postal Service and email. The notice was sent nine months before the wedding. The dress code was also mentioned in the material that accompanied the invitation, sent two months before the wedding.It was a fabulous event, with great Spanish cuisine, a 12-piece live band and fun, colorful decor chosen by my daughter. With one weird exception: My husband’s older sister, a woman of 76 years, who lives in an even more upscale nearby town, but who arrived at our event looking like she had just taken a walk on the beach, in white jeans, very casual sandals, and the sort of untucked shirt you might throw on to go grocery shopping. Meanwhile, her husband followed our dress code, as did her daughter in a lace designer cocktail dress and stilettos.This older sister was the topic of much speculation, as she stood out like a sore thumb. Several of our daughters’ friends who had, of course, dressed up, asked if she had done it on purpose, as did a couple of my friends.I don’t know what to think, except that this event harked back to my own wedding more than 35 years ago. In the spirit of building cordial relations, I had asked my husband’s sister, whom I had only met a couple of times, to be one of my bridesmaids. After I included her on a group trip to choose bridesmaid dresses, she phoned my husband to demand that he pay for her bridesmaid dress. Later, I overheard her belittling the bridesmaid dress to a couple of friends. I had put this incident completely out of my mind until she showed up at my daughter’s wedding dressed inappropriately. What do you think?— Attired CorrectlyAttired: I think your sister-in-law was dressing comfortably because “Festival Cocktail Attire” actually doesn’t mean anything anymore. Technically, it’s supposed to be a mix of cocktail and semiformal with a little flair added to it, but even that is vague enough to be of little use. I think everyone got a little confused about it in the early 2000s and stopped trying to care.I cannot tell you how many events I go to where the dress code is “Festive Cocktail Attire,” and people show up wearing whatever they want. It's chaos. There are too many words in the description. We've lost the plot.Your sister-in-law sounds like someone who doesn't place the same value as you do on fashion trends. I suspect she lives a very different kind of life. So, for her, perhaps white jeans and a casual shirt was appropriate for a wedding in a beach town adjacent to her own.Dressing inappropriately is a very unsatisfying form of revenge. So, it's far less likely that she was doing this to send a message to you. Unless that message is “I'm 76; this is who I am; congratulations on your special day.”Dear Eric: A friend I have known for many years recently asked me for about $30,000. He needed the money to pay off old debts, which he claimed he had. I doubt that. He does not work and owns a few rental properties. I responded that I was sorry and couldn’t give him that kind of money and further suggested he go to his bank and ask for a loan.He wouldn't hear of it, questioned our friendship and then lectured me that friends are not only for the good times but also for times in need. He then abruptly ended our friendship.I was disappointed and sad. What should I say to this person after he dumped me? Should I have given him money in order to keep the friendship?— Finance FriendFriend: When relationships start coming with exorbitant price tags, I stop calling them friendships and start calling them rental agreements. At $30,000, the rent with this landlord is too high. I’m afraid that if your friend is willing to abruptly sever your ties over this, there may not be much to salvage here.Perhaps the stress of his financial situation is clouding his judgment. You can reach out to him to express your hurt over the way things ended and ask him to help you understand his point of view. Maybe he thinks you’re flush with cash and this figure is no big deal.But it’s a big deal to you. And, moreover, if you don’t feel comfortable giving him the money, then “no” is a complete, loving sentence.(Send questions to R. Eric Thomas at eric@askingeric.com or P.O.

WaPo_13,Carolyn Hax: Is girlfriend planning a trip with her male friend to make a point?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/07/28/carolyn-hax-girlfriend-trip-ploy-proposal/,2024-07-28 11:59:02.825844,,"Hi, Carolyn: I recently had a huge fight with my girlfriend of three years. Our relationship is a good one; we talk of being married but have not set a wedding date.Recently, she was on the phone with a college friend (male) who suggested the two of them take a vacation together on the opposite side of the country. I was not included in this vacation plan. I am currently attending classes and am not available. She was on the phone with this college friend and in no way was trying to hide the call or the plans from me. At the end of the call, I was furious. I stormed out of her house, and currently our relationship is in question.I suspect this might be her way of getting me to propose sooner, but do you think her making these plans with a male friend is at all fair to me?— P.J.P.J.: I think we need to square up our definitions of “good.”Your relationship may be a good one in terms of your compatibility, or general goodness as people.It may even be a good one in terms of where you are in the process of learning to get along with someone in an intimate relationship. If one or both of you came from a dysfunctional home, especially a volatile one, or an abusive prior relationship, or came to each other from a path through emotional or neurological differences, then a stable and positive three-year relationship is great, even. Trust is the hardest thing there is to learn from scratch as an adult. That and maybe ice hockey.But if you’re still storming out of places in anger and if she is still having performative conversations to “get” someone to do something? Or you think she’s capable of doing that? Or you assume that’s how everyone operates? Then that’s not a get-married-to-it kind of “good.” Not yet, and not soon.So I will answer your question now, using that context: If your girlfriend was using her friend or their conversation in any way to manipulate you, then of course it wasn’t “fair.” It was somewhere on the scale from adolescent to abusive.But neither of us knows whether she did that, because you stormed out before you found out — and apparently got this far without following up. And that’s on you.If difficulty trusting is your explanation for that, then I’m sympathetic. Here you want to marry this woman, hand yourself over to her for life, basically — the most precious thing you’ve got — and she’s making plans out loud with some other guy? That can make a person lightheaded just thinking about all the possible life-altering mistakes in progress in that one moment: You think your whole future is off. You think your judgment is broken. You think you’re an idiot (and everyone knew it but you). You think it’s either this endless loop of suspicion and betrayal, or no one.Maybe I’ve imagined it wrong, but clearly your thoughts dropped three years of facts and ran after some grim speculation.What matters more, though, is that you didn’t stop the runaway girlfriend-distrust long enough for an override: “I’m panicking. I won’t know what this is really about till I breathe, think, ask.”What gives you or any of us the presence of mind to pause and think in such a terrible moment is trusting your own strength to get you through even the worst-case relationship scenarios. She’s done with me, she’s replacing me right in my face, I just burned three years of my life on that? Devastating, yes, but also something you can emerge from whole — because no one gets through life without some kind of rejection.Another way to look at it: You will be ready for life partnership when your trust and self-calming functions are working for you from the inside, so they’re not constantly reacting to the latest thing someone else does.I don’t know what your girlfriend was doing on the phone that day. I hope it was benign, some joyous spitballing with a longtime platonic travel buddy of a possible trip that she was excited to run by you as soon as she got off the phone. I hope by now you have found out, through some combination of speaking honestly, knowing each other well and being able to add 2 + 2.But I do know that if you’re still looking at intimacy as an extended courtship performance, where two people need to push each other’s buttons until they erupt in door-slamming truths, then you are being deeply unfair to yourself.Please, trust your courage to bear the weight of staying in the room and saying what you mean. Be vulnerable.If this episode has persuaded you both that even full-frontal rejection has to be better than this guessing-game torment, then your chances as a couple sound pretty “good” to me. After time building and really living this trust in yourselves, of course. If marriage is right, it can wait."
WaPo_14,F-16 fighter jets arrive in Ukraine but may not tip advantage against Russia,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/28/f-16s-ukraine-planes-war-russia/,2024-07-28 13:00:02.818467,,"KYIV — Long-awaited F-16 fighter jets are set to be flying in Ukraine within weeks, but Ukrainian and Western officials now caution that the aircraft, once championed by Kyiv as a game changer, are unlikely to make an immediate impact on the battlefield, where Russia is slowly advancing.There are simply too few of the planes and too many Russian air defenses that can shoot them down. That means the first F-16s will likely serve to boost Ukraine’s air defenses — to shoot down aerial targets such as missiles, drones and aircraft — rather than strike Russia’s invading ground forces and other military assets near the front.Officials have said that the planes, at least initially, are unlikely to fly too close to the front-line fighting, meaning it is unclear they will even be able to deter attacking enemy aircraft from crossing into Ukraine from Russian airspace.Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway have pledged to provide Ukraine with 80 F-16s, but most of those won’t arrive for years. The United States, which approved the transfer of planes to Ukraine by NATO allies last summer after long blocking Kyiv’s request, has not provided or pledged any aircraft.Officials declined to say exactly how many jets Kyiv will receive this year, but it won’t be more than one squadron — about 20 jets — and just six pilots were projected to complete training by this summer, because the program has limited spots and has been marred by delays.The expected limited role of the U.S.-made planes highlights a deepening fault line between Kyiv and its Western supporters. U.S. officials had long said that the F-16s were unlikely to give Ukraine a decisive advantage because of Russia’s robust air defenses. Ukrainian officials, however, respond with a familiar refrain: With F-16s, as with other materiel, the West has supplied too little, too late.President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Ukraine needs more than 100 F-16s to combat Russia’s huge air force and has called the quantity of jets Ukraine is receiving “insufficient.”“The decision on the F-16 is strategic,” he said this month. “The number is not yet strategic.”Some analysts are even more skeptical than Zelensky. Becca Wasser, an analyst at the Center for a New American Security, said the F-16s might be most potent as a psychological and morale boost for Ukrainians and a specter for Russian conscripts — in part because battlefield conditions have changed since last year when the decision to send the planes was announced.“We’ve seen this pretty routine pattern when it comes to Western military equipment for Ukraine,” she said. “There’s an immediate need for them. Often by the time they are delivered that immediate operational need is null and void based on the rate of battlefield adaptation.”But they may also fill urgent needs, Wasser said, because of their dual role of shooting down enemy aircraft and hitting ground targets.So far, Western nations donating the fighter jets to Ukraine have not disclosed any restrictions on how they can be used. In other cases, Ukraine is limited in using Western weapons to strike targets in Russia. Officials have said Washington has confined Kyiv to firing less than 100 kilometers, about 62 miles, inside the border.The question of restrictions might be moot because F-16s initially are expected to fly a cautious distance from the front, officials said.A Ukrainian defense official, who, like others in this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive security matter, said “dozens” of pilots were tapped for F-16 training. But limited instructors and training facilities have forced Ukraine to send one group of pilots and engineering staff at a time, the official said.Four months of English lessons in Britain to learn key terminology precede working with the aircraft, making it a year-long process even for experienced pilots.Ukraine also cannot afford to part with too many experienced pilots for such a long stint because they are needed for combat duty, the defense official said.“The main restriction … is the amount of planes and time of training,” a second Ukrainian official said. “If Russia has 300 [fighters] and you have much less, you can’t operate properly.”“We will not use it too close to the Russians” due to the threat of air defenses, the official said, adding that Ukraine also lacks some technical gear and additional training for maintenance engineers.The Pentagon declined to answer questions about F-16s provided to Ukraine or Russia’s preparations to counter them.In routine circumstances, F-16s carry a variety of weapons that allow them to target enemy aircraft and strike enemy positions on the ground.But Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, Ukraine’s commander in chief, said in a recent interview with The Guardian that F-16s will fly at least 25 miles from the front line. Ukraine is unlikely to use the fighters to strike sites in Russia as a result.The Ukrainian defense official said Kyiv’s F-16s will carry the AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile — projectiles in a broader class of munitions fired by the NASAMS ground air defense systems Western countries have provided.One missile variant has a range of about 100 miles, the official said — longer than several other aircraft-dropped munitions provided to Ukraine.But the official said that Ukraine already has too few AIM-120 missiles and will have to split them between the F-16s and NASAMS.Protecting the F-16s on the ground will also be a challenge given that Ukraine’s airfields are all within Russian missile range. Moscow recently struck several aircraft left exposed on runways.The Ukrainian defense official said that “it’s not possible” for Kyiv to build covered concrete hangars to fully protect aircraft during wartime. Instead, Ukraine uses camouflaging techniques and even parks model planes on airfields as decoys.A senior Ukrainian military official said Russia has been preparing for Ukraine to receive F-16s. Late last year, the official said, Russia launched several missiles with dummy warheads from an S-400 air defense system in Dzankoy, a town in occupied Crimea.The projectiles reached the Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk, more than 200 miles away, the official said, adding that he suspected Moscow was testing the S-400’s range to shoot down aircraft.Ukrainian officials and airmen have long bemoaned their existing, outdated fleet of MiG-29, Su-27 and Su-24 planes that have inferior radar range for target detection — about 25 miles — than Russia’s newer models of the same aircraft. The F-16’s radar can spot targets about 125 miles away, making them safer because pilots do not have to get as close to enemy planes to fire at them.While the F-16 offers an improvement over Ukraine’s existing jets, it is still an older-generation fighter compared with Russia’s newer, more sophisticated air force. Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate previously reported that Moscow has more than 200 fighters, dwarfing Ukraine’s fleet.As Ukraine’s air defenses have weakened in recent months, especially near the front, the Russians have flexed their air power in riskier combat missions. One of the most destructive weapons Russia uses, guided glide bombs, are nearly impossible for Ukrainian forces to shoot down once launched, officials have said. The only solution is to target the aircraft or their bases.But officials said the threat of F-16s could scare some Russian aircraft from getting too close and dropping the bombs.Ukraine has pleaded for fighter planes since early in Russia’s invasion, but the United States initially opposed the idea. In May 2023, under heavy pressure, the Biden administration reversed course.Back then, Ukrainian officials hoped to get them in theater quickly, potentially in time for their 2023 counteroffensive, but it soon became clear that timeline was way off.European nations stepped in to coordinate the training, led by the Netherlands and Denmark. At the recent NATO summit, the United States, the Netherlands and Denmark issued a statement confirming that “Ukraine will be flying operational F-16s this summer.”Defenders of the plan say it will help even the scales with Russia, which has used close air support to advance in Ukraine.When you can “actually call in close support from overhead, that gives you significant advantage, and an ability to actually move a battle line, a battle front, forward,” said a NATO official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss battlefield assessments. “So the arrival of fighter aircraft certainly gives Ukraine more capability.”But there are long-standing doubts about overall impact. The United States especially never seemed enthusiastic, first arguing that there were other priorities and more recently that there will not be enough pilots and support to use the planes effectively.“The training pipeline is pretty meager,” a senior Defense Department official said last month, speaking on the condition of anonymity to brief the press.Michelle “Mace” Curran, a former F-16 pilot, said the plane is an upgrade compared with Ukraine’s existing Soviet-era models. Its sensors and missiles can track and fire at targets pilots cannot see with their own eyes, allowing them to stay further back to avoid enemy fire.One challenge for Ukraine is the F-16’s complexity, Curran said, which requires a deep maintenance regimen involving specialists focused on engines, fuel and avionics.Curran was once assigned to the Thunderbirds demonstration team, which brings eight stripped-down jets to its shows. About 90 of the 130-person team are maintenance crew, Curran said, underscoring the upkeep required.“I think people are waiting for this climactic moment of the jets arrive and everything shifts, and it just doesn’t work like that,” Curran said. “They’re complicated. They’re complex to support and to operate. It’s exciting, but we have to be a little bit patient to see the results.”There is a chance the F-16s will follow the path of U.S.-provided Abrams tanks, said Wasser, the defense analyst. A limited number arrived after conditions had changed and had debatable impact on last year’s counteroffensive. Still, it is possible that the F-16s will address Ukraine’s need for better air defenses, she said.It makes sense to use the planes conservatively, Wasser said. “If you have this exquisite capability, are you going to use it immediately, knowing that there’s a greater risk of it being expended?” she said. “Or are you going to withhold it and use it so it has broader strategic value?”Horton reported from Washington and Rauhala from Brussels.

WaPo_15,"On a night the Nats deal Jesse Winker, they also blow out the Cardinals",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/28/nationals-jesse-winker-traded-mets/,2024-07-28 12:59:02.818467,,"ST. LOUIS — The move made sense in the moment: Nationals Manager Dave Martinez lifted Jesse Winker for a pinch hitter in the top of sixth with the bases loaded in a two-run game. St. Louis had brought in a lefty and Winker is a lefty.A few minutes later, the logic behind the move was something else entirely: The Nationals, in the midst of a 14-3 win over the Cardinals, had dealt Winker to the New York Mets. The trade is pending a physical, according to a source familiar, and the return for the outfielder is not yet known.The move is the second the Nationals have made this month heading into Tuesday’s 6 p.m. trade deadline. They dealt reliever Hunter Harvey to the Royals on July 14 for a prospect and a draft pick.There’s a good chance they are not done dealing. Reliever Dylan Floro, on an expiring contract, could be an attractive option for a contender. Likewise, closer Kyle Finnegan and outfielder Lane Thomas, both under team control through 2025, could be on the move before Tuesday as well.As for the game itself, which started after a rain delay of 124 minutes, the decision to pinch-hit for Winker paid dividends. Harold Ramirez hit a two-run double that started a seven-run burst that effectively ended the competitive portion of the evening.That hit was the first of four hits in a row surrendered by Matthew Liberatore. Juan Yepez followed with a two-run single before James Wood roped a double to center. Keibert Ruiz followed with a three-run homer to make it 9-0. Ramirez added an RBI single in the Nationals’ four-run ninth.Winker, in what was likely his final game as a National, finished 2 for 3 with an RBI before being pulled.The Nationals signed Winker to a minor league deal this offseason, hoping that he would return to the all-star form that he displayed in 2021. Winker, 30, was one of the Nationals’ most consistent hitters, hitting .257, with a .793 OPS. He was tied for second on the team in home runs (11) and third in RBI (45).His bounce-back season made the gamble by GM Mike Rizzo pay off.Winker contributed in his final game, delivering a bloop single in the third to put the Nationals up 2-0. Jake Irvin, who cruised through 5⅓ innings, ended his start by yielding a two-run homer to Willson Contreras in the sixth."
WaPo_16,IDF announces strikes deep in Lebanon after Golan Heights attack,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/28/israel-hamas-war-news-gaza-lebanon/,2024-07-28 12:50:02.818467,,"Israel’s military said it struck a string of Hezbollah targets deep inside Lebanon and in the country’s southern region on Sunday in response to a rocket strike from Lebanon that killed 12 people, mostly teenagers and children, on a soccer field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had promised to retaliate against what military officials said was the deadliest single attack on Israel since Oct. 7, raising fears of a wider escalation in hostilities. He is scheduled to return to Israel Sunday from his visit to the United States and is set to meet his security cabinet on Sunday afternoon.United Hatzalah, an Israeli volunteer-based emergency medical services organization, said its paramedics arrived at the soccer field Saturday to a “very difficult scene.” Dozens of children lay injured. Nine of the victims were declared dead on the scene because of the severity of their injuries, the group said in an email. Israel’s military said those injured and killed were aged between 10 and 20.Israel blamed the incident on Hezbollah, citing military intelligence and an assessment of the scene. The Lebanese militant group denied Israel’s claims. Fighting along the Lebanon-Israel border has intensified in recent months, with regular exchanges of fire between Hezbollah — which is backed by Iran — and Israel’s military.“Hezbollah will pay a heavy price for this that it has not paid so far,” Netanyahu said Saturday on social media.In a statement posted on Telegram early Sunday, Israel’s military said it was targeting Hezbollah weapons caches and terrorist infrastructure in Lebanon, including in the areas of Chabriha, Borj El Chmali, and Beqaa, Kfarkela, Rab El Thalathine, Khiam, and Tayr Harfa.Saturday’s rocket attack in the Druze town of Majdal Shams followed a deadly strike in central Gaza, where local health authorities said at least 30 Palestinians were killed when Israel bombed a school that was sheltering displaced people. The Israel Defense Forces said it targeted a Hamas command and control center inside the Khadija school compound.At least 39,258 people have been killed and 90,589 injured in Gaza since the war began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack, including more than 300 soldiers, and says 329 soldiers have been killed since the launch of its military operation in Gaza."
WaPo_17,"Canada owes First Nations for treaty breaches, top court rules",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/28/canada-indigenous-robinson-treaties-compensation/,2024-07-28 12:14:02.818467,,"Treaties signed more than 170 years ago between Canada’s British colonial settlers and several Indigenous groups have not been honored by successive Canadian governments, which for generations deprived the First Nations of fair compensation for resource revenue, the country’s top court has ruled.The Supreme Court of Canada on Friday ordered the government to enter into negotiations to determine the compensation it owes to groups of Ojibewa (Anishinaabe) people for breaking its promises, leaving their descendants mired in poverty.The decision could have significant implications for how resource revenue, such as from mining and forestry, are shared with the country’s Indigenous communities and for the role of courts in reconciliation between First Nations and Canadian governments.The negotiated settlement is expected to be sizable. During the case, Canada argued that the beneficiaries were owed at most about 1.8 billion Canadian dollars, or about $1.3 billion. But Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz — who was called by the First Nations groups to testify — told the court that his economic model showed the figure was upward of $90 billion.In its decision, the court rebuked Canada’s “longstanding and egregious” breach of the treaties — entered into in 1850, more than a decade before Canada confederated — between the Crown and the Anishinaabe of Lake Huron and Lake Superior in what is now Northern Ontario. The Crown was represented by Ontario’s attorney general in the case, and Canada’s attorney general was also a respondent in the claim.“For well over a century, the Crown has shown itself to be a patently unreliable and untrustworthy treaty partner,” Justice Mahmud Jamal wrote. “... It has lost the moral authority to simply say ‘trust us.’”At the time, the Anishinaabe and the Crown agreed that the Anishinaabe would cede their territories in exchange for, among other things, an annual payment. A novel clause in that agreement said that if the land produced an amount in the future that would allow the government to increase the annuity “without incurring loss” then it “shall” be increased “from time to time.”Jamal called for a “declaration setting out the rights and obligations of the treaty parties, including the Crown’s obligations under the Augmentation Clause,” in addition to the negotiated settlement. If a settlement cannot be reached between the parties, he said, the Crown must “exercise its discretion” to determine an appropriate amount of compensation.The federal government had agreed that some compensation was owed, but Ontario argued it has no legal obligation in part because it has incurred billions in losses from building infrastructure needed for development.The two agreements, commonly called the Robinson Treaties, were not followed, the descendants of the First Nations people who signed it successfully argued.“Billions of dollars have since been generated from the Treaty territories from forestry, mining, and other resource development,” First Peoples Law, which was involved in the case, said in a statement last year.“At the same time, the Anishinaabe Treaty beneficiaries continue to receive the same annual payment of $4 per person that they received in 1875.”The court found that paying the treaty beneficiaries a “shocking” $4 each per year without an increase since 1875 “can only be described as a mockery” of the document’s intended promise.It also commented on how historical treaties should be interpreted, emphasizing that courts “must consider both the words of a treaty and the historical and cultural context” and take into account how the agreement would have been understood by each party at the time. The Canadian government recognizes 70 historical treaties between the Crown and 364 First Nations signed between 1701 and 1923.Harley Schachter, counsel for Red Rock First Nation and Whitesand First Nation, celebrated the ruling in a news release, saying: “The Supreme Court has ruled today that governments are not above the law,” he said. “It is a sacred relationship between First Nations and the Crown. It is a partnership, not a dictatorship.”The Robinson Huron Treaty Litigation Fund, which represents another group of Huron claimants who reached a 10 billion Canadian dollar settlement with the federal and provincial governments last year, said it was “very happy with the decision.” The ruling vindicated its position, it added, including that “the Treaty contains a sacred promise to share the wealth of the territory in accordance with the Anishinaabe legal principles of reciprocity, respect, responsibility and renewal.”Amanda Coletta contributed to this report."

The burning areas had steep terrain and few roads, making it difficult fore fire crews to work, Cal Fire Capt. Robert Foxworthy said.

Gavin Newsom (D) declared a state of emergency Friday in Butte and Tehama counties. He said in a statement that “we are using every available tool to protect lives and property as our fire and emergency response teams work around the clock to combat these challenging fires.” More than 3,700 fire officials had been deployed as of late Saturday.Evacuation orders and warnings were in place in Butte, Plumas, Shasta and Tehama counties. Roads including parts of Route 36 remained closed.Authorities suspect that the fire began when 42-year-old Ronnie Dean Stout pushed a burning vehicle down a gully into a lush wildland area. Officials said he has not been charged, but they plan to book him on suspicion of intentional arson once they finish reviewing evidence, The Washington Post reported. He is in the Butte County Jail with an arraignment set for Monday, according to the Butte County district attorney’s office.The worst fire in California history was the August Complex Fire in August 2020, burning more than 1 million acres. The Park Fire was the seventh-worst fire in terms of acreage burned as of Saturday evening.A fire that started in Southern California’s Sequoia National Forest has spread to more than 38,000 acres. The Borel Fire ignited on July 24 on federal lands in the forest, and the blaze has swept through the communities of Havilah and Piute Meadow Ranches, the U.S. Forest Service said Saturday.Unusually hot weather has contributed to fire risk. Record-breaking heat was a factor in the state’s recent destructive fire seasons, especially in 2020, when over 4 million acres burned. California wildfires have ravaged at least 626,000 acres so far this year.Brianna Sacks contributed to this report."
WaPo_19,"For three Filipino American gymnasts, an unexpected Olympic opportunity",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/28/philippines-womens-gymnastics-paris-olympics/,2024-07-28 15:58:02.810532,,"PARIS — Three years ago, the gymnasts who advanced to the U.S. Olympic trials gathered on the floor at the national championships, held in Texas, and posed while wearing cowboy hats and holding plaques. They could celebrate that their Olympic dreams lived on.The other athletes, a smaller group of just 10 gymnasts, watched from afar — without cowboy hats, plaques or a chance to earn a spot on the team headed to Tokyo. Aleah Finnegan was part of that disappointed group, and she believed that moment marked the end of her elite career.So if someone had told her then that she would be here, “Oh, my gosh, I’d be literally looking at you sideways, like you’re crazy,” said Finnegan, tearing up at the Olympic gymnastics venue in Paris.After Finnegan began competing for LSU in the next chapter of her career, an official from the Gymnastics Association of the Philippines reached out to her mother with an opportunity: Finnegan could represent her mother’s native country. She decided to return to elite gymnastics and qualified for the Paris Games, a once-unthinkable accomplishment.Finnegan will compete Sunday for the Philippines alongside Emma Malabuyo and Levi Jung-Ruivivar, two other Filipino Americans and former U.S. national team members who followed a similar path. They hope their performances will help grow the sport in the Philippines. They will be the first to represent the Philippines in women’s artistic gymnastics at the Olympics since 1964.Before the start of the women’s gymnastics competition, Finnegan stood in an interview space that resembled a loading dock. She had just practiced in an empty venue, but the bright lights and the Philippine flag hanging in the arena made the grandeur of the event and the significance of the moment inescapable.“I’m going to get emotional because it’s finally hitting a little bit,” Finnegan said with the same teary eyes she had after the world championships in Belgium last fall when she earned this Olympic berth. “The Olympics is something that is just so near and dear to my heart. Just trying to take in every single moment as it comes to me and trying to do the best I can to represent the Philippines well.”These Filipino American gymnasts qualified for the Games through differing avenues over the past year. They will compete as individuals, rather than as a team, but they’ve known one another for years and are experiencing these Olympics together.They made baguettes in a baking class in the Olympic Village alongside the Irish rugby team. They recorded TikToks and traded pins. Finnegan stayed alongside Jung-Ruivivar last week as she received emergency medical care after suffering a severe allergic reaction. (Jung-Ruivivar posted videos on social media describing the episode as “an Olympic experience like no other” and said she is okay.) They got coffee with friends from the U.S. team and then floated down the Seine, soaking wet from rain while waving Philippine flags during the Opening Ceremonies. And everywhere they go, there are Olympic rings — constant reminders of the summit they have reached.“They’re so good at branding,” Jung-Ruivivar said after training in the arena filled with Paris 2024 logos.Malabuyo came the closest to reaching this stage in the U.S. program, finishing fourth at the national championships in 2021, then ninth at the Olympic trials. She headed to Tokyo as an alternate, an experience marred by pandemic-related protocols that intensified when a fellow U.S. alternate contracted the coronavirus. Jung-Ruivivar, who wasn’t age-eligible for the Tokyo Games, competed at U.S. nationals several times, as recently as last year, but never finished higher than 14th in the all-around.All three made it to the highest tier of gymnastics in the United States — a level that includes just a few dozen athletes at any time — but they weren’t quite good enough to earn one of the competitive spots on a U.S. team for the world championships or the Olympics.Finnegan and Malabuyo arrived at college in 2021 believing they never again would compete at the elite level. When the Philippine federation reached out to Finnegan’s mother to extend this opportunity, “I wasn’t really sure if that was a door that I wanted to open quite yet,” she said. But a few months later, she competed at the Southeast Asian Games. Finnegan had the most straightforward Olympic qualification path: She competed at the world championships in 2023, placing 32nd in the all-around during the qualifying round, which was enough to clinch a berth.Last year, the federation contacted Malabuyo, whose parents are Filipino. She felt content with what she accomplished as a U.S. elite, but with the Philippines assembling a team for the Asian Championships, she figured she could contribute on beam and floor.“She was in a really good place as far as just loving the sport again and having fun doing it,” said Janelle McDonald, who coaches Malabuyo at UCLA. During Malabuyo’s sophomore year in 2023, she rediscovered the “joy that she had for gymnastics and then really remembered what it was like to have big goals and really go after them,” McDonald said.Malabuyo met with the UCLA coaches last fall with a plan: She would chase her Olympic dream via the sport’s World Cup series while remaining with her college team. It turned into a wildly complicated few months, with Malabuyo competing at several early-season NCAA competitions before traveling to Egypt and Germany. She returned home, competed at Stanford and then headed to Azerbaijan a week later.Entering the final World Cup event in Qatar, Malabuyo had a chance to clinch an Olympic berth. Her ranking points, compiled based on the standings at these meets, needed to land in the top two among the eligible athletes on an apparatus. She was in strong position on floor.Jung-Ruivivar, who realized representing the Philippines might be possible by watching Finnegan and Malabuyo, competed at this series of meets as well. She had a less complicated schedule because she hasn’t moved on to college yet, and she entered that final competition in April with a chance on bars.Jung-Ruivivar earned the spot. Malabuyo did not.Malabuyo stayed up all night as the frustration lingered. When she returned to UCLA, she cried while sitting on the floor with teammate Brooklyn Moors, a former elite who represented Canada.But there was still one more opportunity, the Asian Championships in May. One more gymnast, whoever finished the highest in the all-around, would qualify.“She kind of left the sadness on the floor that day and got up and hasn’t stopped since,” McDonald said.They scrambled to prepare because Malabuyo needed to compete on all four apparatuses, which she hadn’t done at an elite competition since 2021. Malabuyo hadn’t vaulted in more than a year, McDonald said, and a shoulder injury had kept her from practicing turning elements on bars.At the decisive competition in Uzbekistan, Malabuyo performed well and then had to wait. Two sessions followed, and if any gymnast from a country that hadn’t maximized its number of qualifiers scored better, her pursuit of an Olympic bid would be over. Finally, the scores of the final rotation confirmed that Malabuyo had held on by just 0.033 points — a smaller margin than the deduction for the tiniest error — to become the third Filipino American gymnast headed to Paris.They’re almost certainly not going to win any medals. They’re here for all the other moments. And for gymnasts in the Philippines, a country that has gone so long without any female gymnasts reaching this level, Finnegan said, “I hope it’ll unlock a dream.”"

WaPo_22,Virginia is changing the way it rates schools. Here’s what to know.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/07/28/virginia-school-ratings-change/,2024-07-28 16:59:02.919355,,"Virginia’s board of education has approved a new system for how the state measures school success.The board has been looking at overhauling the system since 2022 in response to concerns from Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) that a vast majority of schools were accredited despite declining test scores. At the time, Youngkin called it a broken system that “fails to provide a clear picture of the academic achievement and progress of our schools to parents, teachers and local school divisions.”On Thursday, the board, which is made up almost entirely of Youngkin appointees, passed regulations that separate school accreditation and accountability into two separate measurements to be fully implemented by the 2025-2026 school year.A final vote on how the new accountability system will work is expected at next month’s board meeting.Here’s what to know about this major overhaul in Virginia education.Accreditation and accountability is essentially how the state measures whether a school is doing its job. Some states, like Florida, use an “A-F” system to grade schools. The goal is to communicate how a school is performing on a range of metrics, including student test scores. It also factors in whether schools are meeting state requirements such as staffing levels and high school graduation requirements.
Currently, Virginia combines accountability and accreditation into one measurement and awards schools a simple rating: accredited or accredited with conditions.Accreditation and accountability is essentially how the state measures whether a school is doing its job.

Schools will still earn accreditation based on whether they meet basic state requirements. But now, they will receive a separate accountability ranking based on other metrics like mastery of topics and how much student performance has improved over a time period. It also will measure student readiness based on factors — which are still being finalized — such as chronic absenteeism and advanced coursework. The four categories for accountability will be: Distinguished, On Track, Off Track and Needs Intensive Support.Under the new plan, the board of education decided to break up the two measurements.Schools will still earn accreditation based on whether they meet basic state requirements.

Many think it’s important to give parents a fuller picture of how a school performs than what is in Virginia’s current system. But stakeholders are divided on what should be measured.
One dividing point is how much the state should measure “mastery” versus “growth” — essentially if schools should receive more credit for students reaching benchmarks, or for helping students improve from where they are. In Virginia, the current proposal includes both, with mastery being weighted greater in the evaluation.
Critics of the move, like the Virginia Education Association, worry that favoring mastery will lead to schools being categorized on demographics. Statistically, they said in a news release, schools in affluent neighborhoods typically perform better on standardized tests than schools in lower-income areas, and the rankings will reflect that.
“It will penalize schools that demonstrate significant student growth but serve students who start further behind due to various educational barriers,” the state education union wrote Thursday.
Other groups like the Virginia Association of School Superintendents, the Virginia School Board Association and Virginia PTA expressed concerns about various other aspects of the model at the recent state board meeting, including about using the categorical ratings like “Distinguished.” They worry that the new system will unfairly paint some schools in a bad light.
“The bucket ‘off track,’ with more than 50 percent of Virginia schools, is so large that it fails to provide critical information for parents about which student subgroups are struggling versus schools that are underperforming across all grade levels,” said Virginia PTA president Jenna Alexander.Like many things in the education world, policy experts have long been divided on accountability and the best way to measure school success.

But according to data projections from the Virginia Department of Education, about 60 percent of Virginia’s schools will be ranked as “Off Track” or “Needs Intensive Support” under the current proposed metrics.
Under the current proposal, data collection from assessments will start in the school year that begins in August.

WaPo_23,How India’s warm embrace of Kamala Harris grew chilly,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/28/india-kamala-harris/,2024-07-28 16:59:02.919355,,"NEW DELHI — When Sen. Kamala D. Harris joined the 2020 Democratic presidential ticket, Indian media were excited to detail her Indian ancestry. They traveled to her grandfather’s village and expounded upon her love for foods like idli, a savory rice cake.Harris leaned into the identity. She made a masala dosa with actress and screenwriter Mindy Kaling in a viral 2019 video. A memoir published that year detailed her South Asian roots and upbringing. Television chef Padma Lakshmi cooked tamarind rice to celebrate her and the 2020 Democratic win.But now, as Harris nears a presidential nomination, India seems to view her differently. While her identity may continue to excite the Indian diaspora in the United States, in the homeland observers are not only more muted on her connections but also uncertain about her strategic stance toward the subcontinent.The initial “silly and irrational exuberance” saw a “dose of reality,” said Harsh V. Pant, visiting professor at King’s College London and vice president at the Observer Research Foundation, an Indian think tank. Things had changed, he said, and “it’s fair to say that there is no real warmth for her in India.”Indian analysts point to several factors in this shift. One is a perceived lack of embrace of her Indian heritage by Harris. Another is a growing concern of Harris’s periodic comments on issues related to Indian democracy and human rights, ruffling feathers in India and pricking the warming ties between Washington and New Delhi.It’s led to a feeling of “rejection” among Indian fans of Harris, Pant said. “That terminated the affair with Kamala Harris and India. She has to be seen as an American as opposed to an Indian American,” he added.Indians are also by now familiar with members of the diaspora in high offices abroad. Britain, Ireland and Portugal have all had prime ministers with Indian lineage in recent years. In the United States, there were two candidates from the diaspora — Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy — in the Republican presidential primaries this year.Karthick Ramakrishnan, a professor at the University of California at Riverside and the founder of AAPI Data, said the novelty was wearing off.“At least in terms of the media, I think there’s less — and maybe even in society — less of a curiosity element,” he said.Harris was raised by her Chennai-born mother after her mother and her Jamaican-born father divorced when she was 7. Her maternal grandfather was formerly a government civil servant and freedom fighter in India.Harris’s multiracial upbringing involved “a strong awareness of and appreciation for Indian culture,” she wrote in her 2019 memoir. Still, her early politicization revolved around being Black in America, including growing up in Oakland, Calif., during the Black Power movement and studying at Howard University.Harris wrote that her mother “knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women.”When asked in a 2009 interview by Indian diaspora magazine India Abroad, republished by CNN, about other politicians who have distanced themselves from their Indian heritage, Harris responded that “we have to see that most people exist through a prism and they are a sum of many factors.”Since becoming vice president, Harris made several nods to her Indian roots. In 2022, she hosted the White House’s largest-ever annual Diwali celebration, in addition to a smaller gathering to commemorate the Hindu festival of lights at her private residence.But for some Indians, it wasn’t enough. Indrani Bagchi, a foreign policy commentator and head of the think tank Ananta Centre, argued that Harris has “deliberately downplayed” her Indian roots. Some note that as vice president, Harris spent a week in Ghana but has not visited India.Dinsha Mistree, a U.S.-India relations expert at the Hoover Institution and a Stanford professor, said it may be that Harris won’t see her Indian identity as “politically advantageous” at the moment.“Given the states that she needs to win and given the number of Indian voters, do I think that that’s something she should play up over the next hundred days? Probably not,” Mistree said.Indian government officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid said the rise of politicians of Indian origin has garnered much attention in India but that it has not immediately equated to any special favorableness to the country.“Whether Harris likes idlis for breakfast may be noteworthy, but it is of little consequence in explaining her political trajectory,” Raja Mohan, director of the Institute of South Asian Studies at the National University of Singapore, wrote in the Indian Express.Indian officials and strategic experts say Harris has played little role in the growing geopolitical relationship between India and the United States, leaving it to President Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan.“Harris hasn’t moved any mountains on the India relationship,” Bagchi said. “When she did make comments on India, they were comments — forget friendly — I don’t think they were comments that took into account where India stood on issues.”In 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration removed a special autonomy given to the Muslim-majority region of Kashmir — a long-standing plank of his party. On its heels, the government sent Kashmir into a severe lockdown and internet shutdown, arresting hundreds of politicians and activists.Asked about the events more than a month later in Texas while on the campaign trail, Harris responded sympathetically, stating that Kashmiris needed to be reminded that “we are all watching.”Later that year, India’s external affairs minister abruptly canceled a meeting with senior members of Congress after U.S. lawmakers refused to exclude Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), one of the most vocal critics of Indian policy, from the meeting. Harris shared a message on social media in Jayapal’s defense.Her actions were a contrast to the Republican administration then in office. Just a few months later — as riots erupted in Delhi in response to a new citizenship law — President Donald Trump made an official grand visit to the city.The India Today television channel brought up Harris’s Kashmir comments Tuesday, displaying the banner: “Harris and Modi: It’s Complicated.”Harris, much like Biden, may shift her tone if she gains the White House. Before his presidency, Biden had also published a policy paper calling for India to take the steps needed to “restore rights” for Kashmir. But in office, Biden has taken a far more cautious stance.There have been rough patches in the U.S.-India relationship. Last year, U.S. authorities thwarted an attempted assassination plot against a U.S. citizen in New York. The Washington Post later revealed that an Indian officer in the country’s spy agency gave instructions for the operation.But overall, India has found itself in a geopolitical sweet spot, with the United States looking for friends in Asia as tensions with China rise.Harsh Vardhan Shringla, former Indian foreign secretary and ambassador to Washington, said that regardless of who wins in November, India’s position is secure. “For India, it’s a win-win either way.”Seth reported from Washington."
WaPo_24,Kamala Harris raises $200 million in less than a week,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/28/harris-200-million-fundraising-week/,2024-07-28 16:59:02.919355,,"Kamala Harris’s campaign has raised more than $200 million since President Biden endorsed her last Sunday and terminated his own presidential bid — with two-thirds of the vice president’s haul coming from first-time donors, according to Harris campaign officials.The outpouring of cash and Democratic enthusiasm for Harris has reshaped the presidential race since President Biden abandoned his bid a week ago, forcing Republican nominee and former president Donald Trump out of the comfortable posture he had maintained over the past few months as polls showed an edge over Biden in key swing states. Trump had also begun eyeing opportunities to expand the electoral map — including in states like Minnesota, where he campaigned on Saturday night.Harris campaign aides said they have recruited 170,000 new volunteers since last Sunday and are holding 2,300 events to mobilize grassroots supporters this weekend. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), who is under serious consideration to be Harris’s running mate, launched a canvassing event Saturday in Carlisle, Pa., while Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, another potential vice-presidential contender, rallied supporters in St. Paul, Minn, to stoke enthusiasm for the Harris effort.Harris quickly cleared the field of any serious competition and secured pledges from enough Democratic delegates to clinch the nomination Monday night, according to the Associated Press’s delegate tracker. She notched a series of critical endorsements, including from Barack and Michelle Obama. And she is now in the midst of her intensive search for a running mate — a decision that she intends to make before Aug. 7, when the national party plans to have virtually nominated a ticket.The vice president attended a fundraiser on Saturday in the Berkshires in Massachusetts that was expected to bring in $1.4 million for the campaign, according to one of the hosts. She told the crowd that Trump and his allies have resorted to some “wild lies” about her record: “Some of what he and his running mate are saying, it’s just plain weird,” Harris said to laughter at The Colonial Theatre in Pittsfield, Mass. “That’s the box you put that in.”A new national survey by the Wall Street Journal found 49 percent of registered voters said they supported Trump and 47 percent backed Harris, within the margin of error. New Fox News polls in battleground states found Trump and Harris statistically tied in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Harris led by six 6 points in Minnesota."
WaPo_25,"As Harris steps up to face Trump, far-right attacks follow",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/28/harris-steps-up-face-trump-far-right-attacks-follow/,2024-07-28 17:59:02.863177,,"As President Biden’s reelection bid fizzled over the last month, the right-wing targeting of Vice President Harris picked up steam, starting with a return of old racist and sexist memes.The weaker Biden appeared, the more intense the attacks became, with extremism monitors warning of a threatening undercurrent to rhetoric calling Harris a “demon” or a “DEI hire.”Biden’s decision Sunday to exit the race and endorse the vice president turned that stream of hostility into a torrent. Within hours, far-right forums were awash in vitriol aimed at almost every aspect of Harris’s identity, mounting what analysts call a smear campaign led by the most intolerant — and menacing — elements of Donald Trump’s MAGA universe.For example, former Trump adviser Sebastian Gorka, speaking to Britain’s right-wing GB News, described Harris as “this disaster whose only qualification is having a vagina and the right skin color.”The backlash is a glimpse of what Harris could face if she wins, say extremism monitors, who fear a far-right resurgence like the one that followed the election of Barack Obama, the country’s first Black president, only worse because of factors including social media and the nation’s deep polarization.The pile-on also fits the pattern of studies showing that women candidates — and particularly women of color — experience online abuse and threats for seeking election at any level, from school board seats to the Oval Office. The intimidation campaigns elevate the risk of real-world attacks by the violent far right, analysts say, a concern that takes on urgency as thousands of Black and Brown women across the country pledge street-level organizing to get out the vote for Harris.“She represents what it means to try to have a multiracial democracy, a feminist democracy — and that’s what they don’t want,” said Alexandria Onuoha, a researcher at Suffolk University in Boston who studies extremist targeting of Black women and girls. “It’s not just VP anymore. This is the big leagues now. It’s going to be even more aggressive.”Harris’s backstory is a smorgasbord for extremists across ideologies: A mixed-race daughter of immigrants grows up to become California attorney general before making it to the United States Senate and, eventually, the White House.Neo-Nazis go after her Indian and Jamaican ancestry and use antisemitic slurs against her Jewish husband, Doug Emhoff. Anti-government types call Harris “a cop” because of her prosecutor days. QAnon-style conspiracy theorists portray her as part of a deep-state cabal; they spread fake photos of Harris with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Christian nationalists, meanwhile, cast her as Jezebel, the biblical symbol of womanly wickedness. Lance Wallnau, a prominent pro-Trump Christian nationalist, responded to Harris’s ascent with a video saying she represents “the spirit of Jezebel in a way that will be even more ominous than Hillary [Clinton] because she’ll bring a racial component, and she’s younger.”More mainstream conservatives, too, engage in the racist and sexist dog whistling. Some Republican lawmakers mispronounce “Kamala,” for example, or promote conspiratorial thinking about her rise. At MAGA rallies, T-shirts and bumper stickers deride Harris with slogans that imply that she traded sexual favors for political gain.“This is what comes with the territory when you are a woman of color and in the arena,” said a Harris campaign worker who also was involved with her 2020 primary effort, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive campaign matters. “It’s kind of a testament to the fact that Republicans have a race problem themselves — that’s pretty clear-cut.”In the first two days of Harris’s campaign, online discussion of her among high-profile right-wing politicians and influencers grew to almost six times the typical volume, according to a Washington Post analysis. Sexual and racial themes dominated the chatter; dozens of influential figures on the right shared crude sexual remarks about Harris on social media. The spread of a debunked theory that Harris was ineligible for the presidency for citizenship reasons spiked after Biden endorsed her for the presidency.“X and Telegram are essentially a free-for-all where we’re seeing a ton of conspiracy theories,” said Freddy Cruz, a researcher and program manager at Western States Center, an anti-extremism watchdog group. “It looks like there’s a new conspiracy theory every hour.”The campaign against Harris borrows heavily from the earlier targeting of Obama, the country’s first Black president.Once again, “birther” conspiracy theories are spreading quickly online, racking up millions of views for posts showing Harris’s purported birth certificate alongside a debunked argument that she’s ineligible to run because of her foreign-born parents. Harris is legally eligible and was born in Oakland, Calif.Other commenters are stoking racial divisions by asserting that Harris isn’t really Black, suggesting that her Caribbean roots don’t represent Black Americans — a tactic that also was used against Obama, whose father was Kenyan.“They are very aggressive at latching onto and continuing to repeat baseless accusations,” Cruz said. “In Obama’s case, it was about skin color and supposed religion. We’re seeing a lot of attacks on Vice President Harris that are conspiracy theories laced with racism and sexism.”The online and verbal attacks, extremism researchers warn, can influence unrest on the ground. They note that the right-wing uproar over Obama’s election re-energized the anti-government militia movement, which had been largely quiet since the devastating 1995 Oklahoma City bombing by far-right extremist Timothy McVeigh.“When Obama left office, we normally would’ve expected a little bit of a downturn because they usually relax some of their fervor when a Republican comes back into office,” said Amy Cooter, a researcher who specializes in militia groups at the Middlebury Institute’s Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism. “We didn’t see that because Trump legitimized the fears that they and other folks on the right have.”Cooter said far-right armed groups stayed active, often organizing in plain sight on Facebook and other social platforms. The picture changed after a pro-Trump mob — with extremist groups in the lead — stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The double blow of social media platforms’ crackdown on militant accounts and a sweeping Justice Department investigation that has resulted in more than 1,000 convictions to date pushed many armed groups underground or to encrypted apps.One exception is the White-power movement, a sector of the far right that has reasserted itself in an era when others have atomized or are keeping a lower profile, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a global conflict monitoring group. White supremacist groups are staging pop-up appearances in various parts of the country, often carrying swastika flags and handing out fliers with messages such as “Diversity means fewer white people.”Recent sites include Nashville, where White-power demonstrators have spread propaganda throughout the month and disrupted a city council meeting. Photos showed men dressed in T-shirts that say “Pro-White” giving Nazi salutes. In Michigan, local news outlets reported, about a dozen masked White supremacists marched through downtown Howell this month; others were filmed on a nearby highway overpass shouting, “We love Hitler, we love Trump!”Analysts say they can’t predict whether these groups will ramp up their activities in opposition to Harris, but that the idea of Trump competing against a woman of Black and South Asian heritage presents a common rallying point for disparate factions with different agendas and tactics.“It’s simple: She’s a Black woman in power and they’re terrified,” said Onuoha, the Suffolk University researcher. “Their mindset is that any woman of color in power is out to take something away from them.”Last month, the Christian nationalist pastor Clay Nash told worshipers in Boise, Idaho, about a dream in which he was looking out over the Democratic National Convention, which inexplicably was taking place aboard an aircraft carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln.In the dream, Nash said, a Jezebel spirit “was shot right through the brain.” He boasted that a friend, knowing his skill as a long-range shooter, suggested Nash was the man for the job.“How many of you know that being shot through the brain is a dead shot?” Nash asked, according to a video of the remarks. “I believe we’re about to render Jezebel null and void.”Such visions or prophecies are central to Nash’s subset of Christian nationalism, the independent charismatics of the New Apostolic Reformation, or NAR, which scholars describe as a fast-growing, anti-democratic movement preaching that hard-right Christians should control all aspects of government and society.A report last year from extremism monitors at the Southern Poverty Law Center called the NAR “a new and powerful Christian supremacy movement that is attempting to transform culture and politics in the U.S. and countries across the world into a grim authoritarianism.”Some NAR leaders have pushed back on descriptions of their goals as violent, insisting that their focus on “spiritual warfare” is figurative, not literal — a stance, analysts say, that allows for plausible deniability should a radicalized follower attack.Take the example of Nash fantasizing about the killing of Jezebel. The pastor never says in the sermon that the demonic spirit in his vision was a stand-in for Harris.Among Christian nationalists, however, the vice president repeatedly has been branded as Jezebel, a racialized depiction “used as a stereotype or controlling image of Black womanhood, of Black female sexuality,” said Karrie Gaspard-Hogewood, a sociologist at Tulane University whose doctoral research focuses on Christian nationalism.The Washington Post asked Nash for comment about the vision and whether, in the wake of the assassination attempt on Trump, he would still share a violent dream about a shooting death at a political event. The response was a single sentence in an email: “I did not say or preach this at any time.” The full video of the sermon remains on the Clay Nash Ministries YouTube channel.A top concern, Gaspard-Hogewood said, is that extreme or unstable followers will now revisit visions like the one Nash expressed and interpret them as prophecies to be fulfilled — with Harris’s expected formal nomination at the Democratic National Convention only weeks away.Gaspard-Hogewood said dehumanizing portrayals of Harris as an evil, power-hungry demon resonate with pro-Trump Christian voters who have embraced the spiritual warfare narrative.“It’s both a caricature and a warning in framing her in this way,” she said."

WaPo_27,Venezuelans vote in election that could oust an autocrat,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/28/venezuela-election-maduro-gonzalez/,2024-07-28 17:08:02.863177,,"CARACAS, Venezuela — The Venezuelan opposition was hopeful of an election victory Sunday that could bring an end to the authoritarian government of Nicolás Maduro and the socialist state that has controlled this crisis-stricken South American nation for a quarter-century.Exit polling released after voting centers began to close Sunday evening showed opposition candidate Edmundo González taking 65 percent of the vote, more than doubling Maduro’s 31 percent, Edison Research reported. Venezuelans were waiting for official results.The opposition, suffocated by Maduro’s autocratic rule and historically hobbled by infighting, sees its best chance in more than a decade to unseat the strongman, whom many here blame for this oil-rich country’s economic collapse and the exodus of millions of migrants, hundreds of thousands of them to the United States.Maduro has barred the opposition’s chosen candidate, arrested campaign workers and blocked access to state media. Still, the opposition says it can win — and by a landslide. A high turnout could provide a significant boost; by 4 p.m., González’s campaign estimated that 11.7 million Venezuelans had voted, a participation rate of more than 54 percent.But in a country where the electoral council, courts and military are controlled by Maduro, the outcome remained far from certain. He and his team were confident they can win, according to people familiar with their conversations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the conversations. If he loses the vote, he’s not expected to cede power willingly.There were reports of blocked access, delays and some violence. In Maturín, a state capital some 350 miles east of Caracas, local opposition leaders said a voting center coordinator and her mother were demanding access for opposition poll watchers when members of a colectivo — armed Maduro supporters on motorbikes — rode up and shot the mother in the leg.Voting centers were scheduled to open 6 a.m. Sunday, but at a school in the Chacao neighborhood of Caracas, a group of 18 people arrived three hours early. They would wait for more than six hours, amid delays opening some voting tables.By 9 a.m., some of the hundreds of people began to chant: “We want to vote!” Esther Pérez Villegas, whose husband was among those waiting, stepped in to help organize the lines. “Anxiety is high, very high, because of all of the uncertainty we feel,” she said.Noemi Tovar, 61, had been in line since 3 a.m. “If I have to wait all day, I’ll wait all day,” she said.“We’ve made lines here for many things — for food, for gasoline,” said Martha Salas, 62. “This is for so much more — for a vote.”Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said problems at voting centers “were exceptions to a process that is developing peacefully.”“The way things are going, I think we are going to have, as they say, irreversible results,” she said at a voting center in Caracas.Somerville, N.J.,-based Edison Research, which interviewed more than 6,800 voters at 100 locations, said González outpolled Maduro among men and women, rural, suburban and urban voters, and every age group.“Our exit poll projects a resounding victory for Edmundo González,” executive vice president Rob Farbman said. “The opposition candidate had broad support across nearly all demographic backgrounds.”The opposition was betting it could turn out voters for a victory so overwhelming that Maduro will be forced to accept the results and begin to negotiate his exit.The number of eligible voters for the election is estimated at about 17 million. Several voting centers saw long lines. It was not possible to determine whether this reflected the greater turnout that the opposition had said would be its key to victory, but some voters in Caracas said they hadn’t seen such long crowds in many years.“I haven’t seen this kind of voter intention since Chávez,” said Vladimir Ramos, a 60-year-old engineer waiting in line. Hugo Chávez, Maduro’s mentor and predecessor, founded Venezuela’s socialist state in 1999 and led it until his death in 2013.“I think people are no longer afraid,” said Natalie Moreno, 47.By 12:40 p.m., Maduro addressed the nation to announce the activation of Operation Remate — a word meaning “finish it off” — a government-led effort to rally supporters to the polls. Maduro campaign staff and supporters called people to pressure them to vote and offer food and supplies.“Let’s mobilize ourselves with force,” Maduro said in a message aired by state television. “Let’s vote with strength as was planned, and with the force of the” social programs.The government aid was flowing in the rural eastern state of Delta Amacuro. In an Indigenous community there, people were being offered bags of food in exchange of support, said Yoxsamar Jiménez, a poll watcher for the opposition.“But that’s normal here,” she said. More concerning, she said: Poll watchers were not allowed inside, and the center’s coordinator hit Jiménez.“To avoid violence, we couldn’t do anything so we had to leave the table,” Jiménez said. “The table is alone, and they’re doing whatever they want in that center.”If Maduro loses, the United States could play a critical role in a potential negotiated transition, offering legal incentives and relief from sanctions to give Maduro a way out that doesn’t lead him straight to prison.The United States stands ready to “consider measures that would facilitate a peaceful transition of power,” a senior Biden administration official said Friday, speaking on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the administration.A Maduro defeat would be a significant foreign policy win for the Biden administration. U.S. officials negotiated a deal last year in which Maduro pledged to hold a competitive election in exchange for some sanctions relief. With irregular immigration at the center of the U.S. presidential campaign, success in Venezuela could boost Vice President Harris’s bid against former president Donald Trump.Venezuela’s opposition candidate, the former diplomat Edmundo González, was unknown to most Venezuelans just months ago. Now polls predict he could beat Maduro by double digits. He is a stand-in for longtime Maduro critic Machado, the “Iron Lady” who draws tens of thousands of Venezuelans to her near-messianic campaign caravans — and has been disqualified from running by Maduro’s supreme court.Her campaign focuses on a simple message: Vote for us, and your loved ones can come home.“The central theme is family, in the sense that this could be the last opportunity to reunite our families,” she told The Washington Post. “This is not just an electoral campaign. This is a redemption movement, for liberation.”Maduro’s campaign has portrayed the opposition as an extreme, right-wing threat that would bring instability.Some voters in Caracas seemed to agree. Hector Trujillo, a 79-year-old retired architect, said he was voting for “peace” and the continued improvement of the economy. He blamed U.S. sanctions for the country’s troubles. He feared the opposition would “eliminate everything,” including the country’s welfare benefits.The run-up to the election was far from free and fair. European Union observers who planned to monitor the vote were disinvited, leaving only small teams from the Atlanta-based Carter Center, a U.N. panel of experts and a grass-roots group of thousands of ordinary Venezuelans who have been training to watch polling centers.Machado gave a call to action last week: Vote early, stay near the polls and alert the opposition to any suspicious activity. “We will all become citizen reporters,” she said.Ana Rosas, 26, voted Sunday for the first time in her life. Rosas, who now lives in El Salvador, is among the millions of Venezuelans dispersed across the world — and among the scores who returned home to vote.“I have goose bumps,” she said. “I still can’t believe I’m able to vote. I hope it makes a difference.”In Miami, dozens of Venezuelans, unable to vote from abroad, gathered at the Dolphin Mall to watch coverage of the election. Many wore shirts of red, yellow and blue, the colors of the Venezuelan flag, that read “Venezuela Libre.”“God willing, today the country will be free,” said Lennyn Padilla, 47, tears in his eyes. “I’m emotional because when I speak about it my throat closes up. It makes me so sad.”Victor Manuel Morina Parra, a 59-year-old bus driver in Caracas, said he has noticed discontent among his passengers. He moved from his farm in the countryside to the Katia neighborhood of the capital, he said, because his rural town was “in a state of total abandonment.”“We no longer have help from the government. There’s no fuel, the electricity goes out every eight hours,” he said. “That’s why we want change. For our children, for our grandchildren.”Venezuelans are watching the armed forces and how they respond to any attempt to manipulate the election.Leopoldo López, an opposition leader, said members of the military should consider their own interests, “their own stability, their own future.”“Today, with Edmundo, a transition could be a better source of stability,” he said, “rather than Maduro telling them to go out to kill, to repress, to impose the state.”Maduro has warned of a “bloodbath” if he loses.“The destiny of Venezuela depends on our victory,” he told rallygoers this month. “If we want to avoid a bloodbath or a fratricidal civil war triggered by the fascists, then we must guarantee the biggest electoral victory ever.”Maduro’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López, said last week he would uphold the law. He called for “the one who won to take charge of his government project and the one who lost, go to rest.”"

WaPo_30,"Study examines link between family incarceration, children’s health",https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/07/28/prison-children-parents-mental-health/,2024-07-28 18:30:02.861000,,"Children with a family history of incarceration are more likely to be diagnosed with physical and mental health conditions than other kids, a recent analysis suggests.Published in Academic Pediatrics, the study looked at 11 years’ worth of electronic health records from Cincinnati Children’s, analyzing over 1.74 million unique patients under age 21 years between 2009 and 2020. It sheds light on the ripple effects of mass incarceration.Researchers searched the records for keywords such as “incarcerated,” “parole” and “jail” for signs of justice system involvement, and then compared the records of patients with a justice keyword in their chart with those of demographically similar patients.Ultimately, the researchers identified nearly 38,300 patients with justice keywords in their files, 2.2 percent of the total sample. The overall group was majority-White (64 percent). While Black patients made up just 12.8 percent of the larger group, 28.2 percent of those with justice keywords in their records were Black.Over a third of patients whose charts indicated they were in child welfare custody also had a justice keyword.Patients with justice keywords made up 42.9 percent of all schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, 42.1 percent of bipolar and related disorders, and 38.3 percent of suicide and self-injury diagnoses, and were disproportionately diagnosed with physical conditions such as neurodevelopmental disorders (69.7 percent) and shaken baby syndrome (44.9 percent).Given that an estimated 7 percent of U.S. youths have had an incarcerated parent, the numbers in the study are probably “a gross underestimation of the true exposure of personal or family incarceration in youth served by this institution,” the researchers note. The “vast disparities” suggested by their analysis could help inform future research, they write.“We will continue to have health care disparities and lead the world with poor health outcomes if we continue to lead in incarceration,” Samantha Boch, an assistant professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Nursing and the paper’s lead author, says in a news release."
WaPo_31,Inside the powerful Peter Thiel network that anointed JD Vance,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/28/jd-vance-peter-thiel-donors-big-tech-trump-vp/,2024-07-28 18:05:02.861000,,"In the weeks before former president Donald Trump announced his vice-presidential pick, some of tech’s biggest names launched a quiet campaign to push for one of their own: Ohio Sen. JD Vance.The former president fielded repeated calls from tech entrepreneur David Sacks, Palantir adviser Jacob Helberg, and billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel, Vance’s former employer and mentor, imploring him to add the one-time Silicon Valley investor to the ticket, according to three people familiar with the entreaties, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private conversations.Vance’s most forceful Silicon Valley advocates are euphoric about the former never Trumper’s rise in the GOP. They see Vance as their emissary in Washington, spreading a doctrine that government and entrenched corporate giants from Google to Lockheed Martin stifle innovation, while nimble, bold-thinking start-ups — especially their own — can propel the national interest. And while the ascension of Vice President Harris has invigorated many left-leaning tech leaders, some in Thiel’s network would stand to benefit from having Vance in the White House — a new asset for venture capitalists who until recently shunned Washington.“WE HAVE A FORMER TECH VC IN THE WHITE HOUSE GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH BABY,” Delian Asparouhov, a partner at Thiel’s Founder’s Fund, wrote on X after the announcement of Vance’s nomination.For Thiel, Vance’s presence on the ticket is the payoff on a prescient bet placed a decade ago, when he embraced the Yale Law School graduate with Rust Belt roots as his protégé — joining a roster that included Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and OpenAI founder Sam Altman.Especially after the publication in 2016 of his memoir “Hillbilly Elegy,” Vance impressed Thiel’s rarefied Silicon Valley set with what they saw as an omnivorous intellect, mild manner and outsider story of growing up working-class in Ohio — a narrative that resonated after the 2016 election, as tech elites sought to understand how their obsession with building the future was leaving so many Americans behind.Thiel made him wealthy, setting him up to invest in companies that became popular with the MAGA set. He shepherded Vance’s entry into politics, bankrolling, alongside other Silicon Valley donors, his successful bid for the U.S. Senate in 2022.“For Peter,” said one of the people familiar with his thinking, “Vance is a generational bet.”But Vance’s connections in the business world — along with his stances on social issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage — have also opened him up to criticism. Critics have called him a “shillbilly,” arguing that his relationship to the Thiel network could become a pay-to-play scenario.“The best way for them to [instate] their elitist scheme and reactionary views is regulatory capture,” investor Del Johnson posted on X, using a term to describe the private sector’s control of the regulatory process. “You haven’t seen anything yet if you let the VC class get into the presidency.”This report is based on 17 interviews with people familiar with Vance’s rise in the Valley, his relationship with Thiel, and the tech world’s ambitions for him should he win the country’s second highest political office, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their relationships.Thiel declined to comment. Vance did not respond to comment requests.Though Thiel became a Trump megadonor during the 2016 campaign, he ultimately was disappointed by the disorganization of his administration, as well as the lack of focus on science and innovation, according to several people with knowledge of his thinking.1/7
But the Vance pick is helping Thiel warm to Trump. And Trump’s selection coincides with a newly sharpened focus on issues of central importance to the tech world. The former president has embraced industry-friendly messages on electric vehicles, cryptocurrency, and artificial intelligence. Trump appeared last month on Sacks’ All-In podcast, where he called his Silicon Valley donors “geniuses.” And at a recent campaign rally,   he praised electric vehicle pioneer Elon Musk, saying, “We have to make life good for our smart people.”
Sacks hosted Trump and Vance at his San Francisco home for a pricey fundraiser in June, where the pair met more than 50 technology executives and other wealthy donors, according to a list of attendees reviewed by The Washington Post.
At the RNC, Sacks could be seen talking with Vance in Trump’s private box. Others present said they had never seen the event so flooded with donors, lobbyists and others from the technology industry.The Biden administration, by contrast, has infuriated tech leaders by hindering the crypto industry, attempting to regulate AI and challenging corporate acquisitions — a key path for start-up founders to cash in. Sacks, Musk, Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, Sequoia Capital’s Doug Leone, and founders of the prominent venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz have all thrown in with Trump and are donating large sums to a pro-Trump PAC.If Trump reclaims the White House, Vance could help transform the tech industry from political punching bag to engine of capitalism, filling government positions with ideologically-aligned tech leaders. A web of Thiel-associated start-ups, including Vance’s own token investment in defense start-up Anduril, are competing for billions in contracts.Meanwhile, friends of Sacks — whose pitch to Trump on nominating Vance was about noninterventionist foreign policy — often joke that he is angling for Secretary of State.Vance’s supporters said his willingness to call out Big Tech’s monopolistic practices, while supporting more nimble start-ups — branded “Little Tech” — make Vance a persuasive envoy.Blake Masters, a former senior executive with Thiel Capital who is running for Congress in Arizona, said Vance’s ties to Silicon Valley would help usher in a new era of innovation.“It’s not about making a buck,” said Masters, who became friends with Vance after Thiel asked him to review the billionaire’s blurb for “Hillbilly Elegy.” “It’s about making new technologies that the government, which used to do big initiatives like the Manhattan Project, is no longer equipped to make. It’s like someone who actually understands, almost at an intuitive level, the problems coming down the pike.”Two months before Trump was elected, Vance attended a salon dinner in San Francisco with some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in tech. The attendees, which included Thiel, Andreessen, Altman, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, and Jon Levin, then a dean at Stanford Business School, had gathered to discuss a newly relevant topic: “The difficulties of working class America and the future of work.”The wide-ranging conversation quickly turned to politics. Though a never-Trumper at the time, the young memoirist translated the populist rage that had propelled Trump’s long-shot campaign along with that of democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)“Everyone there was trying to understand that moment,” said a person familiar with the evening, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because it was a private gathering. The then-32-year-old “held his own with these incredible intellects … he commanded the respect of everybody in the room.”Thiel paved the way for Vance around a decade ago, after Vance emailed the billionaire about exploring opportunities in Silicon Valley. He was inspired by a 2011 speech Thiel had given at Yale Law School, a talk lamenting technological stagnation and arguing that the elite obsession with hypercompetitive jobs was crushing innovation. Vance described the address as “the most significant moment” of his time at Yale.Vance made an impression on Thiel, said Colin Greenspon, a former managing director at Mithril, a Thiel investment firm.“We knew this guy is someone we one hundred percent want in our network,” said Greenspon, who would go on to co-found the venture firm Narya with Vance. “The benefit of that Peter Thiel world is that there is always someone interesting coming and going, and JD was someone we knew we wanted to stay close to.”An associate of Thiel helped Vance get a job at the biotechnology company Circuit Therapeutics. Though Vance knew nothing about optogenetics, the company’s specialty, he was a rigorous student. He soon approached Mithril about investing in the start-up.Mithril passed. But Vance’s approach — a “knack for checking in at the right time” — so impressed Greenspon that the group concluded “we needed to hire him.”Joining Mithril in 2016, Vance absorbed how investors evaluate companies, swept up in a milieu where technological innovation was revered as the engine of social progress. The man from Middletown, Ohio, who wrote in his memoir that he didn’t know there was more than one kind of white wine, attended dinners with billionaires. Katherine Boyle, a venture capitalist who now helps start-ups work with governments, threw him a book party with pizza at her San Francisco apartment.Though pundits were already calling “Hillbilly Elegy” a campaign book, Vance rarely spoke of his political ambitions in Washington-skeptical Silicon Valley.“He didn’t seem like somebody who was trying to get the limelight,” said Auren Hoffman, CEO of the start-up SafeGraph, who became friends with Vance after organizing the 2016 salon dinner to introduce him to his social set. “I didn’t know his politics.”Others saw Vance as more calculating. One person who socialized with Thiel’s circle said Vance made no effort to get to know people with similar backgrounds, gravitating instead toward influential people who could help his career.“Vance does seem to fit the mold of scrappy, Horatio Alger-type bootstrap-pulling White male founder that attracts a lot of attention in Silicon Valley,” said Ellen Pao, former investor at Kleiner Perkins and a co-founder of the nonprofit Project Include, who noted that she did not know Vance. Pao wondered whether “his success is tied to his willingness to shift with the wind — malleability that can be helpful if you’re looking for government assistance in getting the start-ups you fund off the ground.”A year after joining Mithril, Vance went back to Ohio. In a 2017 New York Times editorial called “Why I’m moving home,” he described his time in Silicon Valley — “surrounded by other highly educated transplants” — as “jarring.” In another interview, he seemingly snubbed elite tech crowds, saying that people on the West Coast “wield political-financial power in combination with a certain condescension.”Days after the editorial, Vance also announced that he had a new job: working with AOL co-founder Steve Case, an independent who had endorsed Hillary Clinton in the previous election, on Rise of the Rest, an initiative focused on developing start-up talent outside of coastal tech capitals.In 2018, Vance boarded a luxury bus in Youngstown, Ohio, to participate in a similar effort organized by politicians, the Comeback Cities Tour. Surrounded by vegan doughnuts, kombucha, and West Coast venture capitalists, Vance described the local start-up scene and the region’s challenges because of the opioid crisis. Vance had spent much of his adult life far from the declining steel town, but the visitors viewed him as an ambassador well-positioned to close the gulf between their sleek San Francisco offices and Ohio.“What people realized … with meeting JD in this context is that Silicon Valley is full of smart people, but not all the smart people are in Silicon Valley,” said Patrick McKenna, one of the investors on the bus.The next year, Greenspon and Vance started their own Ohio-based fund, Narya, named after a ring of fire in “The Lord of the Rings.” (Thiel’s Mithril and Palantir also drew their names from the J.R.R. Tolkien epic). Thiel stayed closely involved, providing at least 15 percent of the capital.Vance told potential backers Silicon Valley was “oversaturated” with copycat, flavor-of-the-moment companies like “Uber for parking.” Vance said Narya would focus on sourcing big ideas and “deep technologies” such as robotics and biotech. (AI and crypto were overhyped, he said at the time.)Not all of its investments paid off. Narya Capital led a $28 million investment in the agriculture start-up AppHarvest, which filed for bankruptcy last year.An early investor who bought into the “deep tech” pitch was surprised by what  the investor  considered to be ideologically driven bets by the firm, according to one person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the investment.The firm, along with Thiel, became a large investor in Rumble, a YouTube competitor that is popular with right-leaning audiences. Narya and Thiel also funded a Catholic prayer app, Hallow.A Narya meeting in 2021 featured Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Allen Husted (R) and Vivek Ramaswamy, at the time a former pharmaceutical executive and author of a popular book attacking “woke” capitalism. Hallow’s founder talked about politics and religion in a session dedicated to “taboo dinner topics.”Narya co-founder Greenspon said the firm’s objective is “generating the best possible returns for our investors.”By the time he announced his Ohio Senate run in 2021, Vance had transformed from Never Trump into a MAGA Republican — the result of years of conversations with Thiel, Masters, and others.Masters said he and Vance spoke by phone in 2021, the day longtime Ohio Sen. Rob Portman (R) announced his retirement. “I immediately called JD, and was like, dude, I think you need to run in Ohio … We both felt like we needed to leave our business careers for this.”During the 2022 midterms, Thiel injected more than $30 million into the candidacies of both his protégés, his largest donations ever and his only major donations that cycle.One bet lost. The other would surpass his expectations.Vance is the first prominent tech venture capitalist to win a spot on a major party presidential ticket, a sign of the industry’s growing influence.Though Silicon Valley was built on government support stretching back to the 1950s,  its leaders have eschewed Washington — and defense contracts in particular — in recent decades. But since the pandemic, as financial returns have fallen and China and global instability have become bigger threats, the government has become a sought-after customer.Vance, who has championed breaking up Google while advocating for a hands-off approach to nascent technologies like cryptocurrency, is widely seen within tech as one of the few politicians who understands that Silicon Valley doesn’t lobby as a monolith.If Vance wins the vice presidency, “Little Tech and Medium Tech is going to have someone there,” said Evan Swarztrauber, a senior fellow at the Foundation for American Innovation, who previously worked for Trump’s Federal Communications Commission Chair Ajit Pai. The debate is “so dominated by the largest players.”Several prominent “little” and “medium” defense tech companies happen to be funded by players in Thiel’s tightly-knit orbit: Anduril, which aims to infuse artificial intelligence into U.S. weapons systems, is backed by Thiel’s network, Andreessen, and is co-founded by Vance-donor Palmer Luckey. Palantir is represented by Helberg and co-founded by Thiel and Lonsdale, an investor and Vance and Musk friend who helped rally Silicon Valley players to donate to a pro-Trump PAC. Asparouhov, Thiel’s Founder’s Fund partner who posted euphonically about Vance, is a co-founder of Varda Space Industries, which is also pushing for government cash.On a recent episode of All-In, co-host Jason Calacanis teased Sacks for criticizing Democrats for being captive to donors and called him the “architect” of the Vance pick.Sacks, in the podcast, downplayed his involvement. “I was probably one of a thousand people, or at least hundreds of people,” he said, “who offered my opinion [to Trump.]”An earlier version of this article incorrectly reported that JD Vance was the first venture capitalist on a major party ticket; Mitt Romney's Bain Capital made VC investments when it was first founded.

WaPo_32,Inside the command center deploying resources to America’s wildfires,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/07/28/fires-west-california-burn/,2024-07-28 18:00:02.861000,,"BOISE — As Sean Peterson took his seat Friday morning in the nation’s nerve center for fighting wildfires, 104 large blazes raged uncontained across the United States.The federal government’s firefighting resources were already fully committed, but requests from regional commands kept pouring in.The day before, his office had turned away requests for 37 aircraft, 40 fire engines, and hundreds of specialists, from dispatchers to heavy equipment bosses. Six hundred more requests had landed that morning. The Park Fire in Northern California was exploding at a pace that horrified and amazed even the hardened veterans here. A firefighter injured by a tree had been evacuated to an Idaho hospital. And an aircraft had gone missing overnight amid the smoke billowing from Oregon’s Malheur National Forest.Peterson, with his can of Liquid Death  on the conference table, scanned the room before the morning briefing.“Ready to rock and roll?” he asked.When all of the West is on fire at once, this is who deals with it.Peterson manages the 32 employees at the National Interagency Coordination Center, on a fenced-in federal government campus abutting the Boise Airport. The staff, from the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management and Bureau of Indian Affairs, must constantly weigh the threats of multiple rapidly changing fires and deploy their limited resources where they can do the most good.After weeks of extreme heat and waves of lightning storms, there is so much fire burning now that the U.S. has reached Preparedness Level 5, something that has only happened this early in the summer four times in the past 20 years, according to staff here.At times like this, there’s never enough help.“No fires are going to get everything that they want,” Peterson said.The vibe here is not Situation Room suits and ties. It’s looser and more outdoorsy: short sleeves and jeans, sandals and tattoos. But it’s serious work.On the video screen, Jeff Walther, a representative from the Pacific Northwest region, informed the group that a single-engine air tanker had gone down the night before while fighting a new blaze near the Falls Fire in the Malheur National Forest.“Ground crews are out there this morning trying to locate,” Walther said. “Pretty difficult terrain. Smoke still hampering the area.”“Thanks Jeff, and definitely, our thoughts from here, along with everyone in the dispatch coordination community, hoping for the best,” Derrek Hartman, the center’s deputy manager, told him. “I feel terrible for the situation going on.”The Forest Service and the Grant County Sheriff’s office later confirmed that the pilot had died.The staff at the coordination center are familiar with these risks. Nearly all of them were once firefighters. And many have worked together for years or decades, building a camaraderie and rapport that helps them navigate the logistical maelstrom on any given day.Peterson, a third-generation firefighter with a scar on his right cheek from one of his close calls, grew up in California and took his first firefighting job two weeks out of high school. He was raised partially in Paradise, the mountain town that was demolished by the 2018 Camp Fire, one of the deadliest blazes in U.S. history. Both of his childhood homes there went up in flames.Over his three-decade career, he has watched as fires have grown in scope and intensity. He’s lived to see a winter fire that burned more than 1,000 homes. Forests hit by repeated blazes that have transformed into quick-burning grasslands. When he started, he said, a 50,000-acre fire was a very rare occurrence.“Now that’s the norm,” he said. “Right now we have six fires burning over 100,000 acres. And we haven’t even got to August yet.”Peterson acknowledges that warming temperatures from climate change is part of the story but also believes the decline of the logging industry — whose clear-cuts helped thin the forest and gave firefighters anchor points from which to work — is to blame for the country’s worsening fire problem.This summer’s quick explosion has followed two relatively light fire years, as abundant winter rain and snow has nourished the West. To fire experts, wet winters mean more grass, which eventually dries out and turns to kindling when the heat cranks up.“We can turn good news into bad news like nobody’s business here,” said Steve Larrabee, a Bureau of Indian Affairs official who is the center’s fire and fuels analyst.This year got off to an ominous start when wildfires in Texas and Oklahoma burned more than a million acres.“We just don’t get a million acre fires in February,” Larrabee said.In the past several weeks, there have been many major blazes in the Pacific Northwest and California. Now, the Great Basin and Northern Rockies are lighting up, too. About 3.8 million acres have burned in the U.S. this year, above the average over the past 10 years of 3.4 million acres.Larrabee tracks metrics of the dryness of dead trees and vegetation. He is concerned that the numbers seem okay but they aren’t really corresponding with the “spectacular fire behavior” now showing up in parts of the West.“These things that are usually fire barriers, like green vegetation, they’re not working like fire barriers like they normally do,” he said.The biggest crisis right now is California’s Park Fire, near Chico, which has grown more than 300,000 acres in less than three days. Officials suspect an arsonist started the inferno that now threatens thousands of homes. Evacuation orders are in place for several communities including for what’s rebuilt of Peterson’s hometown of Paradise.“It will be one of the largest (if not the largest) and one of the most devastating fires on record in the country when it is all said and done in the fall,” Peterson said on Saturday.Amid all this, the coordination center must steer desperately needed firefighting resources around a constantly shifting map.On Friday, firefighters from the Great Basin, with 26 new fires igniting the day before, said they needed all types of fire crews and aviation support. Meanwhile, the Northern Rockies, battling 77 new fires, wanted smoke jumpers and people who rappel from helicopters.Shortages at such a time become more glaring. All of the 27 contracted caterers to feed fire camps have already been committed, so beyond that, crews will have to buy whatever food they can find.The prior day had reached a high-water mark for demand this year for infrared flights to map fire perimeters and help new fires, with 81 requests. And the federal government’s 91 single-engine air tankers — used to drop water or retardant on fires — were also all spoken for, with zero available, staff here reported.There are 26,020 firefighters deployed just on large fires, the most so far this year. More help was needed.Peterson met on Thursday with officials from Australia and New Zealand, longtime firefighting partners of the United States. Those countries agreed to send 80 people, including sorely needed middle management positions such as division supervisors and task-force leaders, into the fray arriving in early August.The most critical shortage, Peterson said, was in local fire dispatch centers, where there are more than 100 vacancies. These grueling jobs field 911 calls and coordinate the response to new and growing blazes.“Nobody wants to do it anymore because they’re just burned out,” he said. “It never stops.”And there’s no respite ahead. Red flag warnings were peppered across the West with wind gusts expected up to 45 mph. Smoke from Canada’s fires, also raging, had finally reached Europe, one staffer noted, just as the Olympics were starting. Outside the nation’s fire fighting command center, yellow smoke hung low over Boise.At the end of the morning briefing, Peterson reminded his staff to take care of themselves.“This is going to be a marathon,” he said."
WaPo_33,"Wait, is PowerPoint cool now?",https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/of-interest/2024/07/28/powerpoint-night-parties/,2024-07-28 20:00:02.957222,,"D.C. consultant Seamus O’Neill stood before an attentive audience and cleared his throat. “Some of you may be wondering how rats got to D.C.,” he began. “Like most residents, rats came to D.C. for work.”The crowd laughed, as O’Neill, 24, continued in earnest. “You may think I am joking,” he said. “But indeed rats are very resourceful creatures, and they have followed humans wherever we have gone for millennia.”As O’Neill spoke, slides of a PowerPoint presentation flashed across the screens of mounted TVs around the room, visualizing his arguments with graphs and short bullet points: How rats became more interconnected through the Silk Road and trade routes. How they carried the bubonic plague, wiping out between 30 and 60 percent of the population of almost every country between China and Portugal. How some of these rodents found fame (including Remy from “Ratatouille” and Stuart Little). How he calculated the rat-to-human ratio in D.C. (allegedly 3:2) and it was worse than New York City’s (allegedly 1:2). And how he imagined the media (including this publication) would craft their headlines “if they covered the rat issue with the level of attention and analytical analysis that it truly deserves.”O’Neill wasn’t addressing a neighborhood town hall. Or city council members. Or a Tomcat boardroom. He was speaking to a group of about 20 or so bar-goers huddled over beers and half-priced burgers at a pub in Adams Morgan.In recent months, O’Neill and other locals have convened at Tight Five Pub to deliver presentations about their niche interests, hidden pastimes and hot takes. That July night, his “Oh, Rats” slideshow was accompanied by another presenter’s pitch deck on how he ghosted his girlfriend and started a new dating app; a guide to impressions in French; a math lecture on infinite sets; and a thorough breakdown of what might have happened if Richard M. Nixon had defeated John F. Kennedy in 1960.“It’s nice to take a load off after work,” O’Neill said. “It’s basically a free comedy show, and maybe you’ll learn something too.”PowerPoints have long dredged up flashbacks of dull meetings and interminable briefings, with some even calling for it to be banned. But it’s gotten a makeover in recent years, with millennials and Gen Zers repurposing the presentation software for social entertainment: A workplace and educational tool by day has become a zany social game by night. Even PowerPoint’s developer, Microsoft, has cosigned the trend — offering a party template that participants can download (though some users are often turning to its rival tools like Canva and Google Slides) and imparting advice for creating a presentation. “Make it more visually appealing — this isn’t your Father’s PowerPoint,” notes Microsoft’s site.Indeed, a scroll through #powerpointnight TikTok uncovers thousands of unconventional, unhinged and unserious slideshows presented at different parties. There’s “Men I Talked About in Therapy.” And “How My Friends Would Undoubtedly Die In The Hunger Games.” Others are thematic, such as a PowerPoint night to “finally figure out what all your friends do for work.” While “Pitch A Friend” lets presenters create slide decks to help their single pals find potential matches in the crowd.Which friend are u #fyp #powerpointnight #friendshipgoalsBrand accounts, of course, hardly ever miss an opportunity to weigh in. “Topics are a solid 💯,” Canva commented on one viral post. On another, Microsoft wrote: “We love a Pedro [Pascal] PowerPoint (even though y’all used Google 🥲)”In more intentional moments, users have turned to the software for planning friend group trips, celebrating bachelorette parties, persuade their parents to let a friend sleep over or buy them Taylor Swift tour tickets, coming out to their family members or revealing their job as a stripper. PowerPoint even played a role in Sydney Sweeney’s booming career: The actress revealed she once made a slideshow to persuade her parents to move from Spokane, Wash., to Los Angeles.The concept was first documented in 2012 when three engineering students at the University of Waterloo started a party called “Drink Talk Learn (DTL).” It quickly spread to other cities including Toronto, Seattle, San Francisco, Edmonton and New York, one participant told BuzzFeed.The pandemic, which compelled friends to leverage workplace software tools for social engagement, gave it another boost. As Zoom happy hours persisted, PowerPoint presentations emerged, allowing hosts to rant, inform, explain, reveal or geek out about a topic or event of their choosing.“In the ‘Zoom times,’ I felt like I was presenting a lot,” said Jaibin Mathew, 23.During the event in Adams Morgan, Mathew gave a vibrant ’70s-themed Canva presentation, explaining why everyone should be wearing Silly Bandz — rubber bracelets in various shapes and colors that were especially popular among kids in the early 2010s. At one point, he playfully suggested that everyone embrace microplastics in their lives.“I have many plastics — I wear them on my arms,” he said. “I hope they reach into my bloodstream.”Growing up, Mathew always found PowerPoint to be stressful, recounting a particularly difficult seventh-grade slideshow he made about J. Robert Oppenheimer. But in the context of social settings, he appreciates how they allow him to connect with other people.On the night he gave his Silly Bandz presentation, he didn’t know a single person at the bar. But after presenting, he met a handful of locals and even gave away a few bracelets he had brought with him.“I think [the PowerPoints] are a really fun social lubricant because then they know something about you that they can ask you about,” Mathew said later in a phone interview. “And then it’s like a really great conversation starter.”Users say that what makes PowerPoint a fun format for social activities is how easily the tool can be subverted, inspiring them to rewrite the rules of presentation etiquette and dream up NSFW topics that satirize the stuffy settings from which they originated.“I think the fun part of a PowerPoint presentation is that it’s a topic you probably wouldn’t or shouldn’t present about in a lot of contexts,” Mathew said. “It’s the way a lot of fun performances are — it’s just turning something normal on its head.”The structural nature of PowerPoints (distilling research into short bullet notes and key findings) can also weed out some of the clumsy and awkward aspects of regular social conversation — where folks can stumble over words, lose their train of thought and excitedly talk over one another. With PowerPoint parties, it gives everyone the chance to have the floor without distractions or interruptions — save for the outbursts of cheers and laughter.Philip Mayer, a transportation researcher and former teacher, has hosted D.C.’s event at Tight Five Pub since May (though the venue has changed to Johnny Pistola’s every first Wednesday of the month after Tight Five Pub abruptly shuttered its doors).As a former middle school and high school teacher, Mayer, 40, would make presentations for his students. During the pandemic when schools were migrating to online classrooms, Mayer would kick off his hybrid lessons with a quick “cool thing of the day” slide deck, thrilling students with fun facts about Soviet vending machines or the ravens of the Tower of London.“Fortunately, it was good at getting people to show up on time,” he said. “Unfortunately, a lot of people would just log in, watch the cool thing of the day and then log out.”Mayer even showed one to his date when he participated in The Washington Post’s Date Lab series in 2020. “Some people were like ‘don’t do that — that’s the worst thing you possibly could do’” he said. “But she was into it, and people in the comments liked it a lot.”In D.C., where Mayer says there’s a huge appetite for trivia and stand-up comedy, PowerPoint Night is the perfect marriage of both of them.“I just need people to understand that we’re not doing, like, quarterly sales reports with the participants.”"
WaPo_34,"Pedicures have health risks, especially in summer",https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/07/28/pedicure-beach-infection-cuticles/,2024-07-28 19:00:02.957222,,"David Murgueytio had his first pedicure about two years ago in a Rockville, Md., nail salon. It also was his last.The pedicurist pushed his cuticles back with a sharp little scooped tool — “he dug in deep — and it hurt,” he says. The next morning, the big toe on his right foot was red and swollen. Two weeks later, when he finally went to a doctor, the toe had turned an alarming shade of dark green — “nearly black,” he says, “and I could hardly walk.”Murgueytio, 40, a personal trainer from Clarksburg, Md., recovered after a 14-day course of antibiotics and a warning from his doctor about taking too long to be seen, risking an infection that could spread to the rest of his body. He learned his lesson. “I’m doing my own toes now,” he says.The cuticle is a thin layer of clear dead skin at the intersection between the nail bed and skin, and serves as a barrier against dirt or debris and infectious agents such as bacteria, yeast or fungi.Nail salon technicians often trim or cut cuticles, which can lacerate the skin and give easy access to irritants and dangerous microorganisms. The potential resulting infection, known as paronychia, also can occur in fingernails after a manicure, according to experts.With summer underway, it’s often tempting to go barefoot, especially at the pool or beach. This can be risky after a pedicure if the cuticles have been recently cut or trimmed, experts say.“I wouldn’t walk through the sand barefoot,” says Adam Friedman, professor and chair of dermatology at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences. “Little particles of sand can get in, causing irritation and inflammation, and introducing bacteria and other microorganisms.” (This is true for any open cuts or wounds, not just from pedicures.)After a pedicure or manicure where the cuticles have been cut or pushed, Friedman recommends applying a healing ointment, such as Aquaphor or Cetaphil, on the fold — the area below the cuticle at the base of the nail — to act as a sealant against germs. “An important point: A little goes a long way,” Friedman says. “You don’t want to be dripping with it.”Bacterial paronychia often causes redness, swelling and pain around the skin fold of the nail, sometimes with puslike drainage, says Olabola Awosika, a dermatologist with Pinnacle Dermatology in Detroit. She treats such infections with oral antibiotics and recommends soaking the fingers or toes in a water and white vinegar solution — one part vinegar to two parts water — for 10 to 15 minutes three times a day. The solution is both anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial.Repeated infections also may require a topical steroid, she says. “With chronic recurrence, there can be complete loss of the cuticle and potentially permanent damage to the associated nail, such as discoloration, lifting of the nail plate and horizontal lines,” she says.Washington, D.C., podiatrist Sheldon Laps says he sees many nail injuries resulting from “overzealous” nail technicians “who want to push the cuticle back and end up lacerating the skin.” He, too, treats them with antibiotics and at-home soaks — he prefers Epsom salts dissolved in warm water — twice a day for 10 minutes for five to seven days.“In severe cases, we have to remove the toenail,” he says, which usually is done in the office.These infections can be especially dangerous for diabetics with peripheral neuropathy, which occurs when nerves leading to the hands and feet are damaged. They can’t feel pain in their feet caused by an infection, says Laps, also assistant clinical professor of surgery at GW Medical Faculty Associates. “They usually don’t come in until it’s severe,” he says. “They either see pus or redness or smell an infection.”If the infection manages to spread to the bone under the toenail, known as osteomyelitis, surgery may be necessary, he says.“The soft tissue of the toenail is directly above the bone,” Laps explains. “Occasionally, the bone becomes infected and we do surgery on the bone to clean it out. If that doesn’t work, we may need to amputate the toe. It’s rare, but it happens. That’s why we tell diabetic patients not to have pedicures.”How can you prevent infections resulting from pedicures or manicures? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the following:If your toenails are significantly thick or distorted, making them difficult to cut yourself, avoid nail salons and see a podiatrist, Friedman says, “which is much safer.”Friedman says he wishes people would avoid pedicures and manicures entirely but realizes this is unrealistic. “You have to find a compromise,” he says. “To say ‘don’t do it’ doesn’t work.” Instead, he says, “make sure you go to a reputable place where they sterilize their tools. Tell them to leave the cuticles alone or gently trim them, don’t rip them.”Awosika agrees, adding: “Always make sure your manicurist or nail technician is using clean tools, being gentle with your nails and surrounding skin,” she says. “If it hurts or is uncomfortable, that’s not normal and you should speak up. I find that when skin conditions result in relation to these practices, often patients were uncomfortable during the procedure but thought it was normal — so listen to your skin.”"
WaPo_35,"They have jobs, but no homes. Inside America’s unseen homelessness crisis.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/28/homeless-lack-of-affordable-housing-economy/,2024-07-28 19:00:02.957222,,"They are plumbers and casino supervisors, pizzeria managers and factory workers. They deliver groceries, sell eyeglasses and unload trucks at Amazon.And they’re the new, unlikely face of homelessness: Working Americans with decent-paying jobs who simply can’t afford a place to live.Homelessness, already at a record high last year, appears to be worsening among people with jobs, as housing becomes further out of reach for low-wage earners, according to shelter interviews and upticks in evictions and homelessness tallies around the country. The latest round of point-in-time counts — a tally of people without homes on one given night — show a discernible uptick in homelessness in many parts of the United States, including Southeast Texas (up 61 percent from a year ago), Rhode Island (up 35 percent) and northeast Tennessee (up 20 percent).While there is no federal data on unhoused workers, shelter administrators and local groups report a spike in first-timers with jobs. In Tulsa, for example, where homelessness rose 26 percent this year, lack of affordable housing ranked as the top reason people said they were homeless, beating out mental health struggles or job loss.“I work 50 hours a week, and it’s still really hard to keep up,” said Aaron Reed, 22, who makes $21 an hour at an Amazon warehouse near Nashville, and returns to his mother’s Hyundai SUV to sleep. He shares the back seat with their black Lab, Stella, while his mom sleeps up front.Years of fast-rising rents and a shortage of affordable housing have created a situation where even a strong labor market and rising wages haven’t been enough to offset the financial strains of inflation.“We are pushing working people into homelessness because they just can’t afford the rent,” said Margot Kushel, director of the Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative at the University of California at San Francisco. “The general public doesn’t see these folks as homeless — they’re not as visible as the people who occupy public spaces, who have substance abuse issues or mental health problems. But it’s a catastrophe, and it’s happening just under our eyes.”While homelessness may not be a central issue in the upcoming presidential election, high housing costs continue to show up as a big reason Americans are frustrated with an otherwise strong economy. A recent CNN poll found that Americans pointed to housing costs as a top economic problem facing their families, ranking just after food prices but ahead of gas, health care, student loans and child care.More cities and states, too, are citing homelessness as among their most pressing concerns. In California, where nearly 70 percent of people without homes live outside, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) on Thursday ordered officials to clear homeless encampments on state land, saying “it’s time to move with urgency.”Among those who are homeless, inflation continues to play a major role. In interviews with 30 people in 17 states who recently became homeless while employed, nearly all said exorbitant rents had not only tipped them into homelessness, but were preventing them from securing new housing.Deborah Bower, a dog groomer in San Ramon, Calif., has been homeless since October, after breast cancer treatments wiped out $100,000 of her savings. These days she either sleeps in her small SUV, which she parks in a movie theater parking lot, or in $95-a-night hotel rooms, where she often brings along her own dog, Bean, as well as others she’s watching overnight for clients.“I’ve always been the one to help people, and now I’m the one who needs help,” said Bower, 60. “But I don’t want anyone to know I’m homeless. It’s embarrassing, like somehow I’ve failed society.”Many who spoke with The Washington Post said they’re trapped in an impossible position — making too much money to qualify for food stamps and other types of government assistance, but not enough to secure housing.All said they were working toward saving enough to cover first and last month’s rent, plus a security deposit, required by many rentals, but were hampered by everyday livings costs. Many also cited poor credit scores from evictions or unpaid bills as yet another hurdle to qualifying for housing.Plus, everything costs more when you’re homeless, said Reed, the Amazon warehouse worker. He and his mother spend $50 a day to fill the gas tank, so they can leave the air conditioner running overnight in 99-degree weather. There’s no way to cook, so they eat prepackaged foods or takeout for every meal. And without access to running water, they spend about $80 a month on large jugs of bottled water they keep in the trunk.“Every day, it’s like, ‘Which bills can we actually pay?’” said Reed, who works 11-hour shifts at the warehouse. “We’re behind on our car payments, then we’ve got gas, insurance, phones.”The pair have been homeless since October, when Reed’s mother was hospitalized for covid and lost her job at a department store beauty counter, forcing them out of the extended-stay hotel where they’d been living for seven months.A spokesman for Amazon said the company offers resources, including counseling, for employees facing homelessness and other hardships. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Post.)A record 12.1 million Americans — or about 1 in 4 renters — are spending at least half of their incomes on rent and utilities, putting them at increased risk of eviction and homelessness, according to Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies. Meanwhile, there is hardly anywhere in the country where a person working a full-time minimum-wage job can afford a one-bedroom rental, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition.As a result, homelessness has picked up after an early-pandemic lull as rent moratoriums, stimulus checks and other government support dried up.The rise in homelessness “is the unfortunate but predictable result of ongoing rent increases,” said Gregg Colburn, a professor at the University of Washington and author of “Homelessness is a Housing Problem.” “And now it’s happening not just in our big coastal cities, but all over the place — in Phoenix and Denver and Atlanta.”Marie, a hotel and casino supervisor in Biloxi, Miss., who is being identified by her middle name because she fears losing her job, said her family was making do until their van’s transmission went out late last year. By the time they paid for repairs, they’d run out of money for rent, forcing them to leave their two-bedroom apartment for a patchwork of temporary arrangements. These days, she makes $900 every two weeks — and spends $710 of that on a hotel room she shares with her husband and 84-year-old father-in-law, who are both disabled. To save on gas, she takes a 90-minute bus ride to work instead of making the 20-minute drive herself.“I am blessed to make $15 an hour but the cost of living is high, and $15 an hour barely covers rent and utilities,” said, Marie, 28. “With everything going up … we cannot save to even get a place to rent.”Rents, which have risen more than 32 percent in four years, have recently started to stabilize, according to Zillow. That cool-down has been uneven. While some parts of the country have seen prices fall, rents have spiked by more than 30 percent in Clinton County, Ill., Brooke County, W.Va., and Franklin County, Tenn., according to real estate data firm CoStar Group.Nelfreed McKay, 34, was spending about $1,200 a month, or nearly his entire monthly income, on rent before it got to be too much. Since May, he’s been sleeping in Central Park each night after finishing his shift as a server at a Manhattan bakery.McKay, who makes $18.50 an hour, plus tips, is hoping to save up $5,000 by September so he can cover rent and deposits on a permanent room. He works overtime when he can and has been forgoing meals to save up. “There are times when you get so tired of it. You want to snack on something but it’s like, ‘No, I can’t afford that right now.’ I need to save up this money for what I really want: to sleep in a bed again.”It is difficult to get an accurate snapshot of homelessness, especially when it involves people who may be staying with a friend, living in their car or patching together weekly motel rooms. Even so, the number of people without a home hit a record 653,100 last year, up 12 percent from the year before, according to federal data.The Biden administration said it has taken sweeping measures to “end homelessness,” by allocating billions to emergency housing vouchers and rental assistance, and increasing the supply of affordable housing. But homelessness experts say it hasn’t been enough to make up for decades of failed policies and under-building of homes. The recent influx of migrants has also worsened the problem, they said, as has the spike in rental costs in the wake of the pandemic.As a result, housing affordability and homelessness have become especially fraught issues in the run-up to the presidential election. The Supreme Court last month ruled that cities can ban people from sleeping outside in parks, streets and other public spaces, adding to a wave of rules criminalizing homelessness. Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, has vowed to go even further, by forbidding urban camping and creating “tent cities where the homeless can be relocated.”But advocates on the ground said those rules can often backfire, making it even harder for people to get back on their feet. Instead, policies should focus on boosting rental assistance, revamping local zoning and land-use laws, and building more low-income housing, experts said. There should also be a larger push, they said, to keep people from losing their homes in the first place.“High rents are the singular factor driving homelessness, so that’s what we need to address,” said Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of San Francisco’s Coalition on Homelessness. “It’s pretty cost-efficient to give people a subsidy if they’re having trouble affording rent. If you don’t do that, that person becomes homeless and that’s much more expensive and inhumane to solve for, because now they’re also going through all of this extra trauma.”Homeless workers who spoke to The Post detailed how they keep up appearances to keep their jobs, stashing their stuff in storage, showering at gyms, washing clothes at truck stops and buying movie tickets so they could rest in a dark, air-conditioned room a few hours at a time. It was imperative, they said, that their workplaces not know about their living situations because they worried about discrimination and job loss.“If you saw me right now, you would think I was just some college kid with a backpack, walking to McDonald’s,” said Jordan Godlesky, who until recently made $25 an hour managing an ice cream shop in San Leandro, Calif., while sleeping outdoors. “There are so many of us who don’t fit into the box of what you’d think is homeless.”But it was difficult to sustain, he said. He often left work at 10:30 p.m. — too late to access the area’s homeless shelters — and spent his nights walking around town because he worried for his safety. If he slept at all, it would be during the day, on a park bench. “Finally, the lack of sleep caught up with me,” Godlesky, 26, said. “I wasn’t able to physically handle it anymore.”After too many absences at work, he lost his job a couple of weeks ago. Since then, he’s been to multiple interviews and is in the final stages for a store manager position at a cookie chain.The job, which would pay about $28 an hour, would offer a steady paycheck, health insurance and stability. But what Godlesky is looking forward to most, for now, is having a bed to sleep in: The company’s two-week training program comes with free lodging."

Amid the chuckles, the evening has a serious side. Most start-up businesses fail, so it’s important to identify and address problems early on, the panelists and their start-up founder victims say. And yet, brutally honest feedback can be surprisingly hard to come by in Silicon Valley.The San Francisco Bay Area is the nation’s capital of start-up investment — and every deal starts with a pitch like those on display at “Snark Tank.” In the second quarter of 2024 alone, $18.7 billion in venture capital poured into young companies in the region, according to data firm PitchBook, compared with $16.5 billion in the New York area and $2.5 billion in the Los Angeles region.Despite so much money streaming in, many young businesses flounder. “What people never talk about is that Silicon Valley is Death Valley,” Paul Jurcys, 40, a frequent “Snark Tank” attendee and a start-up founder himself, says after the show. “Many founders come here to figure out that their product has been created already or that their idea is meaningless — or that they don’t have the competitive edge.”In addition to facing mockery, founders brave enough to pitch at “Snark Tank” get coached on the basics, such as the importance of making eye contact and holding the microphone close to their mouth. And they get grilled on the big stuff, such as: What problem are you attempting to solve? How big is the potential market for this product? And, uh, what is it that your start-up does exactly?The show’s vibe resembles a comedy show crossed with a tech industry networking event. Attendees, who can ask questions of the founders after the comedians have their fun, sport Patagonia activewear and Wharton Business School lanyards. One audience member wore a monogrammed jacket proclaiming “IDEA to IPO.”The event was conceived by Elizabeth Swaney, a 39-year-old former recruiter and Olympic skier turned Starbucks barista and stand-up comedian.Swaney said she wants to make tech more accessible to the average person in hopes of making the industry more inclusive. She finds that other tech events where founders earnestly pitch their businesses to potential investors are “informative, but they’re often dry, one-note events that don’t capture people’s attention,” Swaney said in an interview. She now frequently hosts shows in Los Angeles and New York in addition to the Bay Area.Swaney’s golden rule for roasting start-up founders is to give genuine feedback on their business — and leave their clothing or appearance out of it. She admits to making an exception for the laundry start-up founder who presented while wearing a markedly wrinkled outfit.Panelist AJ Gandhi, a private-equity investor and venture capitalist, said the show succeeds by taking something “super-boring” and turning it into entertainment. “The only fun thing in Silicon Valley is making fun of Silicon Valley,” he said.The companies pitched at last month’s show included BioSieve, which is working on AI software aimed at identifying drug candidates for biotech companies; PigPug, creator of a brain-wave headset to help children control symptoms of autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; and Khoda. AI, an AI therapy app.The panel peppered them with questions and provocations such as: Your slides on drug discovery are so vague, they make a horoscope look more specific. What would happen to Silicon Valley if autism and ADHD were eradicated? And: Be honest, did this pitch deck take you more than 20 minutes to make?Even praise was delivered with a twist. “How come you had slides that were prepared and you rehearsed this and it … was coherent and a really good use of everyone’s time, why?” Heil asked Doga Makiura, founder of Degas, a microfinance platform for farmers around the world. The audience lapped it up.Rebecca Hardberger, a 45-year-old HR professional, was shocked less by the jokes than the business model of one founder who pitched Applaz, a social network for people to post content from their phone’s notes app. “I see how bad Slacks are — I can only imagine free-range notes,” said Hardberger, who keeps a private tally of all the times her husband is hypocritical, which she has no plans to make public.Constance Castillo, Applaz’s founder, said she isn’t deterred by “fear reactions” like that. “We want to make note-sharing to be about being your authentic self,” she said in an interview, adding that her platform allows users to post anonymously.Several founders said in interviews that after taking their lumps from the panel of investors and comedians, they revised their pitch decks. Ahmad Reza Cheraghi, founder of Khoda. AI, said he is rethinking his company’s direction based on the feedback he received that night.But it was Prosina’s Stellar Amenities that attracted the most attention, in part because of her pitch’s dramatic ending.As she wraps her presentation, a large image of Hal 9000, the destructive AI from the 1968 film “2001: Space Odyssey,” appears on the floor-to-ceiling projector screen.The ominous reference leads an audience member to ask a question that’s becoming more common as more AI products appear to be modeled on Hollywood’s dystopian storylines: Have you not seen the end of that movie? Prosina swears she isn’t developing an AI that will turn evil. “We are doing Hal 9000, but a good one,” she says. “One that actually helps.”Prosina, who has dabbled in stand-up comedy, said she found the event cathartic — a break from putting forth an image of being a serious founder who has all the answers.“I just knew if I did a really bad job, I can turn it into a joke,” she said. But she also got feedback that led her to update her slides to clarify the market share she’s hoping to capture and what her start-up might be worth.She’s sticking with calling her space-going chatbot Tom, though. “I’m not changing the name. I’m pretty confident with the name,” Prosina said when The Post caught up with her weeks after the event. And at least one audience member felt comfortable with the branding: After the event, Prosina was approached by someone offering a $50,000 angel investment.As for Swaney, she is in the process of turning “Snark Tank” into more than just a good night out. She has filed paperwork to incorporate her own start-up to run the show, Tech Pitch Roast Comedy LLC, and is working with a lawyer who’s served on the panel to draw up paperwork that would allow panelists to earn equity in the fledgling business.Swaney, who has also worked as a television production assistant and a movie stunt double, plans to pitch the show to potential investors and TV executives — which means she’s working on her pitch deck.What might happen if she were to present her pitch at one of her own shows? “It definitely needs work,” Swaney said. “I know I would be roasted a lot at my own show.”"
WaPo_37,Is watching TV in bed at night bad for sleep?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/07/26/sleep-tv-watching-night-bed/,2024-07-28 19:00:02.957222,,"I’m a pretty good sleeper, but occasionally I have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. Most nights I like to watch a movie or show on my laptop in bed for an hour or so. It helps me relax, but could it be hurting my sleep?As a sleep psychologist, I love this question from a patient because there is so much more to it than meets the eye. As with almost all questions about sleep habits, the answer is: It depends.If you have insomnia, the usual recommendation is not to watch TV in bed. There are at least five reasons for this advice.Conditioning:The modern bedroom is a media room, outfitted with laptops, phones, tablets, e-readers, TVs and smart speakers. These are in addition to our books, work papers, pets, kids, takeout containers, lotions, puzzles and piles of unfolded laundry.But one of the best supported components of insomnia treatment, stimulus control therapy (SCT), proscribes all activity in bed except for sleep and sex. When we reserve the bed for sleep, bed is hypothesized to become a strong conditioned cue — a green light — for falling asleep.SCT is also thought to encourage the formation of helpful associations between the bed and peaceful drowsiness while breaking harmful associations between the bed and anxious wakefulness.Content:There is no scientific consensus yet on the effect of screen content on adults’ sleep, but patients regularly tell me that certain programs stimulate emotions and thinking that interfere with their sleep. Shows can also be compelling enough to keep my patients watching beyond when they would otherwise be asleep.Biological rhythm:Late-night light conveys a false sunlight signal to the biological clock and suppresses the darkness hormone melatonin, effectively shifting our internal time zone westward.Environmental intrusion:Volume fluctuations and flashing lights from the TV can be jarring when we’re awake and can wake us up if we’ve fallen asleep. Light is also a stimulant. It doesn’t take much sound to disrupt sleep.Risk of falling asleep prematurely:Many of my exhausted patients collapse into bed shortly after work to watch TV. The TV lulls them to sleep early and then they can’t sustain sleep through the night because sleep drive, like any appetite, has its limits. Their sleep fragments, and they may lie awake for long periods in the middle of the night or wake too early.Now let’s look at the other side of the coin. There are some good arguments in favor of watching TV in bed.Conditioning:What if TV in bed is itself a conditioned inducement to falling asleep? I’ve had more than one patient who stopped watching TV in bed because they heard they were not supposed to, and stopped being able to fall asleep. Many others confess that they rely on it.Content:Now that TV is on demand, we can carefully curate what we watch. A David Attenborough nature documentary is not “Black Mirror,” the modern-day “Twilight Zone.” Having something soothing to focus on (“cognitive refocusing”) can drown out our default thoughts. Some people contain their thoughts more effectively when they watch something than when they engage with other foci. To use nothing at all would leave them defenseless.Companionship:Loneliness is harmful to sleep. Stories and their characters can be our companions late at night.Soothing sound:Perhaps relatedly, a few of my patients like to listen to the TV at minimal volume to fall asleep. They are comforted by the drone of human voices the way others are comforted by rain sounds. Conceivably, “articulatory suppression” of thinking is at play.Pleasure, rest and autonomy:It can feel good to claim some time for oneself (or with a partner) in the comfort of our bed at the end of a long day attending to obligations and others’ needs. The content we choose caters to our unique longings and interests.While there are no perfect compromises, here are some customized guidelines I might propose to patients with insomnia who want to enjoy good sleep and some TV in bed. These guidelines are not a substitute for individualized health care.Conditioning:Content:Biological rhythm:Environmental intrusion:Falling asleep too early:Companionship and soothing sound:Pleasure, rest and autonomy:I find that my patients appreciate the opportunity to adapt (within reasonable limits) standard sleep advice to their unique circumstances and needs. You might find that approach helpful, too.Lisa Strauss, PhD, is a clinical psychologist in the Boston area. She specializes in sleep disorders.Have a question about sleep?

WaPo_39,How to confront authoritarianism? With joy and unity.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/28/democracy-conference-campaign/,2024-07-28 19:44:02.957222,,"Last week, I participated in the Anti-Autocracy Conference. I was joined by a bipartisan assortment of academics, activists, whistleblowers from the Trump administration, lawyers, journalists, civil society leaders, and current and former elected officials, plus a lively audience, all to discuss the looming threat to pluralistic democracy.Many participants noted that the authoritarian threat is well underway. The MAGA GOP rationalizes a violent coup and refuses to commit to respecting the election results; its nominee dabbles in Hitlerian language; a radical, right-wing Supreme Court damages our constitutional system by granting the president broad criminal immunity; and, an array of state laws aim to suppress voters.Kicking off the proceedings, Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a leading scholar on totalitarianism, explained:She explained: “Project 2025 is a recipe for mass chaos, abuses of power, and dysfunction in government. It aligns not only with the agendas of present foreign autocracies, especially the Hungary of Viktor Orban … but also with the policies of past dictatorships.”Later, I ran through some of Project 2025’s elements: deporting 11 million people, dismantling the Federal Reserve’s independence, replacing 50,000 government workers with Trump sycophants, outlawing Mifepristone and enforcing the Comstock Act, refashioning the Justice Department as an arm of presidential power, slashing Medicaid, abolishing the Education Department and slapping 10 percent tariffs on imports. Project 2025 also reveals the degree to which MAGA leaders expect the government to enforce the precepts of White Christian nationalism.Two aspects of the conference stood out — and informed my perception of the presidential race.Broad coalitions fighting autocracy often face difficulty finding a common ground that overrides policy differences.“We have seen throughout the world that authoritarian attempts are defeated when those with ideological and policy differences nonetheless believe that the precondition for their own long-term interests is a stable democracy in which the rule of law is respected,” Michael Podhorzer, a conference participant and former political director of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, told me. “We saw that in 2020, when the Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO, who agree on almost nothing else, stood strong and together against all efforts to reverse the results of the election.”Norm Eisen, co-founder of State Democracy Defenders Action✓ — which hosted the conference together with conservative group Principles First and advocacy group Democracy Forward — told me, “There is much more that unites us as Americans than divides us.” He laid out 10 principles at the conference that “define what a long-term right, left and center coalition would look like to unify the vast majority of Americans against Trump’s authoritarianism and ensure that the American democratic tradition continues — and that Trump led autocracy is permanently banished from the American political scene.” These principles (to be released this week in expanded form) boil down to:The good news: These ideas might provide the glue to hold together the anti-autocracy coalition if they can gather support across the ideological spectrum.To my surprise, the conference was infused with camaraderie and humor, despite its serious subject. Sure, some was gallows humor (“Anyone know a real estate agent in Australia?”), but there were plenty of wisecracks about buffoonish MAGA politicians and self-deprecating jokes. It turns out high spirits and humor are essential to combating autocracy.Adam Gallagher and Anthony Navone wrote that humor “disrupts dominant discourses and challenges power ‘by disrupting the language and symbols used by those in power to represent reality in a particular way and providing alternative interpretations of that reality.’” Moreover, “Authoritarian leaders and regimes rely on projections of unshakable power; using fear to maintain control,” the authors wrote. “No wonder they hate jokes.” (Not coincidentally, Trump has said he hates being laughed at.)Americans are anxious for connection, for in-person relationships and for fun. Especially when enlisting previously apolitical people, optimism, joy and, yes, humor can help hold movements together. No wonder Vice President Harris’s laugh is already is unnerving MAGA scolds; perhaps they grasp the power of happy warriors.Harris benefits from Democrats’ sense of relief that their campaign has been reborn. But looking at the Harris campaign with fresh eyes, I now see that the joy she expresses in speeches and ads, and the lighthearted memes that have popped up serve a critical purpose. Her ebullient personality, nervy jibes at her opponents and lively social media presence aid in binding together supporters with disparate views.Harris’s campaign channels many of the anti-autocracy principles. To an ecstatic crowd in Wisconsin, she declared, “I’ll tell you why we’re not going back: because ours is a fight for the future. And it is a fight for freedom.” She also made the pitch for broadly shared prosperity: “We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead … Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency.”In a speech in Indianapolis the next day, Harris incorporated several more anti-autocracy principles:Fortunately, democracy and its byproducts (freedom, prosperity, equal justice) happen to be very popular. While many voters might not see her speech as a “pro-democracy,” she is delivering the joyous spirit and the intellectual principles essential to firing up anti-autocracy forces. It’s telling that Harris’s first ad is entitled “We Choose Freedom.”"
WaPo_40,"IDF strikes deep in Lebanon after rocket attack, stoking fear of wider war",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/28/israel-hamas-war-news-gaza-lebanon/,2024-07-28 20:00:02.957222,,"Israel’s military said it struck Hezbollah targets deep inside Lebanon and in the country’s southern region Sunday, after a rocket strike from Lebanon killed 12 people, mostly teenagers and children, on a soccer field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.Amid increased fears of an all-out war, the Lebanese government asked the United States to urge restraint from Israel, the country’s foreign minister, Abdallah Bou Habib, told Reuters.Israel’s military said it targeted Hezbollah weapons caches and militant infrastructure in Lebanon overnight, including in the areas of Chabriha, Borj El Chmali, Beqaa, Kfarkela, Rab El Thalathine, Khiam and Tayr Harfa.Israel blamed the Saturday strike in Majdal Shams on Hezbollah, citing military intelligence and an assessment of the scene, and described it as the deadliest single attack on Israel since Hamas’s Oct. 7 assault. Hezbollah denied any connection to the attack. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and top Israeli officials promised to retaliate against the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group, raising fears of a wider escalation in regional hostilities.Netanyahu returned to Israel on Sunday from his visit to the United States and is set to meet with his security cabinet later in the day.In a Sunday morning tweet, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant mourned the victims of the Majdal Shams attack and said all people living in the area “suffer” on account of Hezbollah. “We will ensure Hezbollah, the proxy of Iran, pays a price for this loss,” he wrote. Earlier, Netanyahu warned: “Hezbollah will pay a heavy price for this that it has not paid so far.”“We are deeply saddened by the loss of life,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters at a Sunday news conference in Tokyo, where he has been meeting his Japanese counterparts. “Every indication is that indeed … the rocket was from Hezbollah,” he added.While the Biden administration believes Hezbollah carried out the attack, the working assumption is that it was an accident, a senior U.S. official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive assessments. The person cautioned that U.S. officials don’t yet have a definitive conclusion about the intention behind the attack.Fighting along the Lebanon-Israel border has intensified in recent months, with regular exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israel’s military. For months, the United States has pushed to de-escalate hostilities on that front. Blinken reiterated Sunday that he and other top U.S. policymakers “don’t want to see the conflict escalate,” and that they were working to ease tensions and bring about a cease-fire deal in Gaza, which he said would reduce flare-ups on the Israel-Lebanon border.Bou Habib, the Lebanese foreign minister, told Reuters that the United States had asked the Lebanese government to pass on a message of restraint to Hezbollah, too.Hundreds of mourners gathered in Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights, home to the Arabic-speaking ethnic Druze community, on Sunday for the funeral of those killed in the rocket attack. The spiritual leader of the community, Sheikh Muwafek Tarif, described it as a day of mourning in an interview to Israeli news outlet Ynet. He said there was a lot of anger in the community and questioned what the Israeli government had done for the area’s security.“Harming civilians is a black line. The government must bring security to the residents,” he said.Assad Abu Saleh, who lives in Spain but was visiting relatives in Majdal Shams when the strike occurred, said several of the victims belonged to his extended family. “It’s a catastrophe,” he told The Washington Post during the funerals Sunday. He saw “parts of bodies” and people without heads at the site, he said.“This war, this stupid war, has to come to an end,” he said. But he could not see the end. “Both sides are too stubborn to settle for negotiations.”Majd Abu Saleh, an engineer, said he was about 160 feet away when the projectile landed. “All our children, all the time, they are playing” in the soccer field. His 9-year-old daughter left the field about five minutes before the strike, he said, and three of her friends were killed.Video he recorded when he arrived showed a terrible scene: at least nine children in soccer jerseys and cleats, motionless, their bodies contorted or pierced by shrapnel on the green field.“I wish to be finished with this tragedy and this crazy war,” said Fawzi Abu Jaber, 72, who said he has lived his whole life in Majdal Shams. The United States, he said, “must back peace, not the war, and not the Israeli government, which doesn’t want peace. Not in Lebanon and in Gaza but in all the Middle East.”Paramedics arrived at the soccer field Saturday to a “very difficult scene,” said United Hatzalah, an Israeli volunteer-based emergency medical services organization. Dozens of children lay injured. Nine of the victims were declared dead on the scene because of the severity of their injuries, the group said in an email. Israel’s military said those injured and killed were between 10 and 20 years old.The Golan Heights, where Majdal Shams is located, is a 500-square-mile strip along the border between Syria and Israel that was seized by Israel in 1967 and formally annexed in 1981. In 2019, President Donald Trump upended years of the status quo by making the United States the only country apart from Israel to recognize it Israeli territory.“There is no doubt that Hezbollah has crossed all the red lines here, and the response will reflect that,” Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Channel 12 on Saturday, adding: “We are nearing the moment in which we face an all-out war against Hezbollah and Lebanon.” A 34-day-war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 left hundreds of soldiers and civilians dead and injured on both sides. Hezbollah has since received large shipments of rockets and drones from Iran and produced its own weapons and has air defense capabilities.Iran’s Foreign Ministry warned Israel against any “new adventure” in Lebanon and backed Hezbollah’s assertion that the group was not behind the Majdal Shams attack. Spokesman Nasser Kanani said Israeli claims that Hezbollah is responsible for the strike are a “fake scenario” attempting to divert attention from the war in Gaza, according to a Foreign Ministry statement Sunday. The United States and the United Nations have a “moral responsibility” to prevent Israel “from starting a new fire whose flames will spread,” Kanani said.German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock condemned the Majdal Shams strike on Sunday, adding, “It is important to act with cool heads. Far too many people have died already in this conflict.”The attack in Majdal Shams followed a deadly strike in central Gaza, where local health authorities said at least 30 Palestinians were killed when Israel bombed a school that was sheltering displaced people. The Israel Defense Forces said it targeted a Hamas command and control center inside the Khadija school compound.At least 39,324 people have been killed and 90,830 injured in Gaza since the war began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack, including more than 300 soldiers, and says 329 soldiers have been killed since the launch of its military operation in Gaza.Heidi Levine, Kareem Fahim, Michael Birnbaum, Alon Rom and Lior Soroka contributed to this report."
WaPo_41,Why fruit flies are smarter than you think,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2024/07/28/fruit-flies-intelligence/,2024-07-28 21:00:02.791245,,"Have you ever wondered how a fruit fly finds that rotting banana in your kitchen? Scientists at the University of Nevada at Reno have some answers.While it might seem like flies flit aimlessly around your home just to annoy you, a study published Friday in the journal Current Biology revealed that fruit flies are actually employing intentional movements to search for the source of a delicious smell.Fruit flies, or Drosophila melanogaster, are some of the most widely studied organisms because they offer a cheap and accessible platform to research biological processes. Though they could not seem more different from humans, fruit flies share 75 percent of our disease-causing genes, which is why scientists have used them to better understand human illness.Researchers documented long ago that these small insects carry out a deliberate strategy, known as cast and surge, to find food sources in windy environments. With this technique, a fruit fly catches a whiff of something yummy, surges upwind to follow the smell and casts side to side when it loses the scent to find it again.Scientists explained that catching a scent in the wind does not mean the source is nearby. Rather, the breeze probably carried the smell from some distant point. As a result, a cast and surge technique is an effective way to track down the origin of a scent in the wind.So what happens when there’s no wind?“They have another trick up their sleeve,” said Marcus Stensmyr, an associate professor of sensory biology at Lund University who was not involved in the study.The trick when there is no wind: Flies perform a sink and circle movement. The authors found that when flies encountered and then lost an odor in still air, they spiraled downward in an attempt to find the source of the smell.This behavior may not be shocking — most cartoon depictions of flies show them circling around a stinky mound of food. Yet, this is the first time scientists have documented how fruit flies behave in still air environments, confirming long-held human intuition.In still air, catching a scent indicates that the source is probably nearby, making a sink and circle approach more useful.Some researchers proposed that dogs and rats exhibit similar behaviors when they sniff high and low to close in on a scent.To conduct their study, the authors first had to figure out a way to trigger a fly’s sense of smell in a windless environment. But how do you deliver odors without wind? David Stupski, lead author on the study and a postdoctoral researcher in biology and engineering at the University of Nevada at Reno, described the scientists’ approach as “a virtual reality for the sense of smell.”They used genetically modified flies that had light-activated neurons in their antennae, which is essentially a fly’s nose. As a result, the authors could trigger a fly’s sense of smell using red flashes of light instead of actual odors. The light based approach allowed researchers to bypass the difficulty associated with delivering controlled odor clouds, which are hard to locate in space.The authors could easily turn the lights on and off to precisely deliver light as a surrogate for smell. The researchers conducted their study in a custom-built wind tunnel with 12 cameras to track a fly’s movement in three dimensions. Monitoring insects in their natural, flying state is notoriously difficult, which is why a lot of research is done on walking flies, as their motion spans two dimensions instead of three.After observing that the fruit flies moved differently based on air conditions, the authors deduced that fruit flies can sense both the presence and direction of wind.“If you stick your head out the window of a car while driving, can you tell if there’s any wind or not?” asked Floris van Breugel, principal investigator of the study and assistant professor of mechanical engineering. Detecting a gentle breeze while moving through the air is hard, but fruit flies excel at it anyway.The authors suggest that the flies slow down and turn when they encounter an odor to determine if there is wind and where it is coming from.“This is a pretty complex computation that’s happening in this super tiny — supposedly simple — brain,” said Elizabeth Hong, a professor of neuroscience at the California Institute of Technology who was not involved in the study.According to Richard Benton, a professor at the University of Lausanne with expertise in neurobiology, understanding how fruit flies track down smells can help scientists better understand harmful pests, such as mosquitoes. Scientists are especially interested in inhibiting mosquitoes’ ability to find and feed on humans to limit disease transmission.Fly olfaction can also inform the next generation of tracking devices designed to find the source of an indoor chemical leak.Perhaps this study can garner some respect for fruit flies. After all, they have figured out how to thrive alongside humans by tracking down scents inside our windless homes.“They have a tiny little brain,” Benton said, “but they do so much with it.”"
WaPo_42,The picture of early-human origins in Africa grows more complex,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2024/07/28/human-ancestors-dna-africa/,2024-07-28 21:00:02.791245,,"For decades, scientists who studied early modern humans believed that our ancestors initially inhabited only small areas of Africa, the savannas of the eastern and southern part of the continent, and then moved north into Asia, Europe and beyond. In this view, early humans bypassed West and Central Africa, especially tropical forests. These areas, the argument went, were populated much later.But now, a growing group of researchers has cast doubt on this narrative. Working in Senegal, Cameroon, Malawi and elsewhere, they are uncovering evidence that early humans spread across much more of Africa before venturing elsewhere. This work has moved the field beyond the old out-of-Africa narrative and is transforming our understanding of how multiple groups of early modern humans intermingled and spread across the continent, providing a more nuanced picture of our species’ complex origins.“It’s becoming more and more clear that humans didn't originate in a single population in one region of Africa,” says Eleanor Scerri, an archaeologist at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Jena, Germany. “If we really want to understand human evolution, we need to look at all of the African continent.”Most researchers agree that early modern humans emerged in Africa between 200,000 and 300,000 years ago. About 60,000 years ago, they spread to other parts of the world. Until recently, though, most experts thought these humans populated West and Central Africa, especially the tropical forests there, only within the past 20,000 or so years.For some researchers, this narrative made little sense. “Humans like to move around a lot,” says University of Pennsylvania geneticist Sarah Tishkoff, who has been working to unravel Africa’s deep genetic lineage for more than two decades. “They had this beautiful continent, they could move all over, go to different niches, with different resources.”The reason no one found evidence of early human settlement in West and Central Africa, Scerri and others say, is that few people had looked there. For many decades, most researchers tended to focus on low-hanging fruit — areas of the continent where fieldwork was less difficult. Because the climate is dryer and cooler in East and South Africa and the terrain is more open, fossils are easier to find and date. Most of West and Central Africa is hot and humid, so bones and DNA degrade more quickly. In addition, that region can be a challenging place to work, not only because much of it is thickly forested, but also because some areas are enmeshed in long-running and chaotic conflicts.Some research suggests that cultural bias may also have played a role. “Most research has been spearheaded by people from the global North,” says Yale University paleoanthropologist Jessica Thompson. “And their perspective is, ‘Well, we want to know how people got out of Africa, to where we come from.”As a result of all these factors, most scientists have focused largely on sites in South and East Africa. This has contributed to the idea that early modern humans primarily inhabited these regions. Frustrated that the academic establishment didn’t take their ideas seriously, a few researchers began trying to uncover evidence that supported their views. Over the past decade or so, they’ve found it.Last year, a group that included scientists from Senegal, Europe and the United States reported that modern humans had lived at a site on the coast of Senegal 150,000 years ago. Previous estimates put the earliest human habitation in West Africa at 30,000 years ago.Moreover, the site was in a mangrove forest, rather than the typical grassland or sparse savanna usually associated with early-human habitation. Scerri says her latest research in Senegal, not yet published, may push this date back even further. “It’s clear that there were different people in different places doing different things,” she says. “And they were there for a long time. A lot longer than we realized.”Another study, from 2022, analyzed DNA from the bones of 34 people who lived across sub-Saharan Africa between 5,000 and 18,000 years ago. Examining such ancient DNA is important because it offers a much clearer window onto the structure of more ancient African populations. The research showed that from 80,000 to 20,000 years ago, populations that had been fairly isolated from one another began to interact across large swaths of the continent. These links spanned thousands of miles, from Ethiopia, through Central African forests and down to South Africa.“People were clearly moving quite broadly across Africa,” says Thompson, one of the study’s co-authors. “They were not staying in these little isolated populations.”And a paper published four years ago in Nature examined the remains of two children found at a rock shelter in Cameroon, in the western part of Central Africa. One of the children lived 3,000 years ago, while the other lived 8,000 years ago. The researchers, from Harvard and other institutions, managed to collect DNA from the two — the first ancient human DNA ever sequenced from Central Africa. They detected four separate human lineages between 60,000 and 80,000 years ago, including a previously unknown lineage — what they called a “ghost population” — that probably lived in West Africa. The results provide more support for the idea that humans have been in West Africa for far longer than previously realized and adds to the evidence that humanity’s roots exist across more than one region of Africa.Experts say it’s important to note that close relatives of modern humans — Neanderthals, Homo erectus and several other species — had already spread beyond Africa to Europe and Asia, in some cases millions of years ago. But these groups contributed relatively small amounts of DNA to the modern human lineage.Because it can be so difficult to find fossils and retrieve ancient DNA in many parts of Africa, scientists have had to develop innovative approaches to establish early-human habitation. For instance, Thompson and her colleagues studied sediments around Lake Malawi in the northern part of the country. Over thousands of years, the lake shrank and grew, depending on the amount of rainfall. During wetter periods, the number of trees around the lake would expand significantly.But Thompson found that during a wetter period starting 80,000 years ago (and continuing today), the number of trees did not increase nearly as much as expected. Instead, the scientists found an abundance of charcoal. Thompson says this shows that humans were living in the region, perhaps in fairly large numbers, and were burning wood on a significant scale, either to modify the environment for hunting or to cook or keep warm — or all three.A key aspect of this new understanding is the Pan-African hypothesis: Scerri and others argue that modern humans probably evolved from the intermingling of different groups from a range of areas of the continent. “There were a number of modern human populations living in different regions of Africa, and we emerged over time from the complex interactions between them,” Scerri says. “Basically, we’re a mix of a mix of a mix of a mix.”In research published last year, University of California at Davis population geneticist Brenna Henn and her colleagues examined the genomes of almost 300 Africans from across the continent. By analyzing and comparing the genetic data, they were able to construct a model for how humans originated within the continent over the past several hundred thousand years. They found that modern humans descended from at least two distinct populations who lived in different parts of the continent. She and her colleagues are now analyzing genomes from 3,000 people, mostly Africans but also people of African descent who live elsewhere, as well as Indigenous Americans and others.Scerri has also found evidence to support the Pan-African idea. She has shown that Middle Stone Age culture persisted in West Africa until quite recently, less than about 11,000 years ago. This culture, a particular way of making stone tools, disappeared much earlier in other parts of the continent, 30,000 to 50,000 years ago. This is important, she says, because it is precisely what the Pan-African theory predicts: “In this model, you’d expect that each region would have its own distinctive cultural trajectory, due to periods of isolation. This research shows how this was possible.”Not everyone is convinced. Richard Klein, a paleoanthropologist at Stanford University who has spent decades studying early modern human origins and migration in Africa, says, “I don’t understand the evolutionary mechanism behind” the pan-African origins theory.Pontus Skoglund, a population geneticist at the Francis Crick Institute in London who has collaborated with Scerri, says that the Pan-African idea is plausible, but that he isn’t fully persuaded. “To me, it also seems possible that a large portion of present-day people’s ancestry might be found in a single region,” he says. “But we don’t know.” He says there is still “a lot of uncertainty” about who was where and when.Scerri agrees that more research is needed. But after years of fighting skepticism, she says she feels vindicated that the new perspective has caught on. “Right now, this is such an exciting area to work,” she says. “It’s really an incredible story, one that’s emerging before our eyes.”"
WaPo_43,"A legend in Suriname, Anthony Nesty calms the waters as U.S. swim coach",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/28/anthony-nesty-us-swimming-coach-suriname/,2024-07-28 20:53:02.791245,,"NANTERRE, France — On this business trip across the Atlantic where his mission is to marshal as many American swimmers as possible to the Paris Olympics medal podium, Anthony Nesty is much more interested in making history than he is in talking about it.“I just don’t dwell on the past,” he said by way of explanation. “My thing is, I live in the here and now.”Nesty won’t parade around the pool deck waving his athletic résumé, chase after NBC cameras to revisit the past or feel the need to remind anyone, really, that 36 years ago he made Olympic history when he chased down one of the sport’s biggest stars, becoming the first Black swimmer to win an Olympic gold medal and the first athlete from Suriname to medal at all.“He doesn’t talk about his achievements as a swimmer or as a coach,” said Katie Ledecky, one of his star pupils. “Not many coaches out there who can say they’ve been through what we’ve been through, putting in the work to get to that Olympic level and winning a gold medal.”Nesty’s fingerprints are, of course, all over the United States’ pool prospects here. He’s the head coach of the men’s team in Paris and will help set the relay teams. If the Americans are able to fend off the charging Australians for medal dominance, Nesty will be among those deserving credit. He’s also the personal coach of some of the Americans’ best medal threats — Ledecky, Caeleb Dressel, Bobby Finke — back in Gainesville, Fla., where he heads up the booming University of Florida program.He doesn’t need to remind his swimmers that he knows what Olympic waters feel like, and he remembers how the nerves and excitement can wash over you on the starting block and how the elation of being the first to the wall sticks with you forever. Nesty, 56, is the rare swim coach who has won an Olympic medal of his own and still stands as one of the most celebrated underdog stories in Olympic lore.Nesty was born in Trinidad and Tobago, and his family moved to Suriname when he was just a few months old. Like most South American countries, Suriname is soccer crazy, but Nesty’s father wanted his son to take up an individual sport and settled on swimming.“I hated it at first,” Nesty said. “But as time progressed, I got better at it.”He won bigger meets and posted faster times, eventually qualifying for the Pan American Games in 1983 and the Olympics a year later, when he was all of 16. At the Los Angeles Games, he posted the 21st-fastest time in the preliminary heats of the 100-meter butterfly, 0.34 seconds away from advancing.He showed plenty of promise but needed a change of scenery to continue his development. At the time, Suriname had just one Olympic-size pool, and the family decided to send him to the Bolles School, a prep school in Jacksonville, Fla., where he blossomed as an athlete.Nesty entered the Seoul Olympics in 1988 feeling confident he could make the final of the 100 butterfly, but Matt Biondi was the king of the pool there, with hopes of matching Mark Spitz’s then-record seven gold medals at a single Olympics.Nesty had the third-fastest time entering the final and knew if he could just hold that position, he would reach the medal podium. Biondi jumped out to a big lead to no one’s surprise — he would go on to win five gold medals in Seoul and break four world records — and Nesty was in fifth place at the turn.He started to make up ground but was still more than half a body length behind Biondi with about 25 meters remaining. Nesty thought if he kept pushing, he could finish third, maybe second. He closed the gap in a matter of seconds.At the finish, Biondi appeared to glide into the wall, while Nesty squeezed in one final stroke. Nesty pulled up his goggles and found the scoreboard overhead.“You turn around, and you see the number one next to your name,” Nesty recalled. “Just an awesome feeling.”Nesty set an Olympic record, finishing in 53 seconds. Biondi settled for silver, just 0.01 seconds behind, surely doomed by his mistimed final strokes. “'Maybe if I had grown my fingernails a little bit longer,” Biondi reportedly said at the time.The result was stunning — “an almost obscure swimmer from an obscure nation” as the New York Times reported the next day. Olympic officials scurried to find the Suriname anthem to play for the medal ceremony, and reporters had to scramble to an atlas to learn about this country of about 380,000 people.Thirty-six years later, Nesty is understated when asked to look back on the significance of being the first Black swimmer to win Olympic gold.“I don’t dwell on that stuff, but obviously it’s history,” he said. “Just being lucky at the right place at the right time in my career.”In Suriname, Nesty was feted as a hero. The country put his face on a postage stamp and a gold coin. At a celebratory parade, fans showered him with money. A local stadium was named after him, as was a jet from Surinam Airways.He’s still the lone Olympic medalist Suriname has ever produced, and he remains popular there today. “The older people recognize me,” he said. “The younger ones have no clue.”Nesty returned to the 1992 Olympics and won bronze in the 100 fly. He retired not long after and went into coaching, eventually getting the Gators men’s job in 2006 and adding the women’s program in 2021.“What I’m most proud of is the improvement of the athletes, from Year 1 to Year 2 to Year 3,” Nesty said. “So I kind of made that my passion, and here we are, years later.”He remained close to the Olympics after hanging up his goggles, serving as an assistant coach for Suriname in 2004 and its head coach in 2008. He also was the country’s flag bearer at the Opening Ceremonies in Beijing, remarkably selected over any active athletes.Nesty was an assistant coach on the U.S. staff at the Tokyo Olympics, where his four Florida swimmers won nine medals, including five golds by Dressel. Following those Games, Ledecky, with seven Olympic titles already to her name, decided to relocate to Gainesville and train under Nesty, too. She said she was struck by the coach’s “quiet confidence.”“The way he carries himself rubs off on his athletes,” Ledecky said. “You want to give your best effort for him. Everyone in that program stays very hungry, whether they’ve won Olympic gold or they’re trying to make the SEC team. Everyone’s always striving for more. That’s just the standard he sets.”Coaching in the Olympic Games is different than swimming in them, of course. The swimmer has to perform. The coach has to prepare. Nesty looks back on his long career around the pool, and in many ways, he said, he feels that’s what he always has done best.“I truly believe my history and where I come from and my approach in handling the athlete — I think all those years have really prepared me for the biggest stage of my career,” he said.Dave Sheinin contributed to this report."
WaPo_44,He rescued a kitten from a recycling compactor and named her Squishy,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2024/07/28/kitten-rescue-recycling-truck-jersey/,2024-07-28 20:05:02.791245,,"Mark Motta was checking the hydraulics on a recycling truck just past 7 a.m. when he noticed two shiny eyes looking at him from behind the compactor’s crushing mechanism.Motta took a close look and saw that a tiny gray and white kitten was stuck in the hopper, where recyclable materials are loaded and compacted. The kitten was covered in oil and shaking in fright.The driver of the truck, Moses White, had already started the engine to head out on his rounds in Burlington County, N.J., that day, July 8. Motta told White to turn off the engine, then he climbed into the truck’s bin and delicately pried the kitten free from the hopper.“I’ve had cats my whole life, and I know that when they’re babies, if you grab them by the skin on their necks, it makes them think they’re being carried by their mother,” he said. “So that’s what I did.”The kitten didn’t fight him.“She was really scared, but she seemed happy to be rescued,” he said.Motta used his bright yellow safety shirt to wipe the kitten off the best he could, then he called safety officer Samantha Stamile to let her know what had happened.Stamile told Motta to put the kitten in a box, then she rushed to her office.“I got there, and there’s this sweet little kitten, absolutely saturated in some kind of oil from inside the truck,” she said. “She also had a green eye discharge, and she was wheezing. We decided to clean her up right away.”Stamile and Motta took the kitten to the fleet mechanic shop and gave her several baths with Dawn dish soap to remove the oil.“The first bath did nothing — she needed quite a few,” said Stamile, noting that she also cleaned the kitten’s eyes with a saline solution and gauze.Motta decided there was only one name that suited the cat: Squishy.“I thought it was perfect, because if I hadn’t seen her that morning, there would have been no saving her,” he said.Stamile gave Squishy some cat food, then took her to All Creatures Veterinary Care Center in Sewell, N.J., where she was examined at no charge and given antibiotics for an upper respiratory infection. The vet said she appeared to be about 2 months old.Otherwise, the kitten was fine, Stamile said, so she contacted Rise Again Animal Rescue, a New Jersey animal foster and adoption nonprofit. The Asbury Park Press was among several local news organizations to cover the happy rescue.“I told them I’d like to foster Squishy until she’s old enough to be spayed, vaccinated and put up for adoption,” said Stamile, 30, who has fostered cats for four years for the animal rescue.Ekaterina Sedia, a founder of Rise Again Animal Rescue, said she added Squishy to her adoption list.“We know how easily a cat — or especially a young kitten — can get hurt,” Sedia said. “Unless people interfere, an accidental injury is often a death sentence for a cat on the streets.”Stamile said her two daughters, Arabella, 7, and Adelyn, 2, were delighted when she brought Squishy home and introduced her to the family’s other cat, Rascal.“My kids have always loved fostering cats, and it instills the importance of treating all life kindly and with respect,” Stamile said.Squishy is a good fit with the household, and she now enjoys romping around with Rascal and playfully jumping on everyone’s bare feet when they wiggle their toes, she said.“She’s now completely oil-free, and when you hold her, she’s an absolute cuddle bug,” Stamile said. “She’s becoming more and more social with time.”It isn’t known how Squishy ended up trapped inside the recycling truck, but Stamile speculates she might have been a feral kitten who climbed in after the driver’s previous run.Motta said he was happy that Stamile could take in Squishy.“I don’t think I could have another cat right now because I already have a male cat at home,” he said. “His name is Stinky.”"

The U.S. men’s basketball team has made its own accommodations since Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and the original “Dream Tam” took Barcelona by storm in 1992.USA Basketball doesn’t publicly disclose its travel preparations to protect the security and privacy of its players, their families and program staffers.To maximize their time in Paris, this year’s team will hold practices in the capital city and then travel by private train to Lille, which is about an hour north, on the day before their three group stage games against Serbia, South Sudan and Puerto Rico. Much like a road trip during the NBA season, the team will stay the night before their games at a five-star hotel in Lille, just a short walk from the city center, and then depart for Paris shortly after the games.Lille, which has a population of nearly 230,000, sits near the Belgium border and is the largest city in northern France. The city’s downtown boasts two train stations and La Vieille Bourse, an iconic stock exchange building that dates to the 17th century.The basketball tournament’s group stage is being held at Pierre Mauroy Stadium, a converted soccer facility that sits in Villeneuve-D’Ascq, about 15 minutes east of central Lille. The arena’s basketball configuration seats 27,000 fans and has appeared sold out throughout the first two days of play. Pierre Mauroy Stadium has hosted EuroBasket, a major international tournament in 2015, but the presence of American basketball stars was viewed as a big deal throughout the city. Posters promoting the Olympics dotted the city’s streets and basketballs appeared in many shop windows.Preparations for U.S. basketball’s stay in Lille before Sunday’s opener against Serbia began last week, when staffers arrived at the hotel, which boasts a spa and art gallery. Hotel staffers decorated the hotel’s entryway with American flags and a full-sized basketball hoop, and they hung USA Basketball jerseys on walls near the lobby. Security staffers watched the front door around the clock, and a barrier near the entryway to create a pathway for the players to walk from their bus to the hotel’s front door.Even though the players themselves weren’t yet in town, dozens of basketball fans and autograph seekers spotted a large private bus shuttling team staffers and crowded around the hotel’s front entrance last week in hopes of seeing the basketball stars.Rooms in the hotel featured wood-lined walls, marble bathtubs and long windows with views of private courtyards. Hotel employees also spoke excitedly about the possibility of seeing the team, and one predicted James would get the property’s premier suite. Guests were instructed to check out by noon Saturday to accommodate the team’s arrival.Though one of the arson attacks on France’s subway system took place on the line between Paris and Lille, the men’s basketball tournament has come off without a hitch. Several reporters arrived late to France’s opening win over Brazil on Saturday due to the subway disruptions.The men’s basketball tournament will shift back to Paris’s Bercy Arena for the quarterfinals on Aug. 6. That Arena, one of the Olympics’ premier facilities, is hosting gymnastics this week."
WaPo_47,"Greek salad is perfect, if you make it right. Here’s how.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2024/07/28/greek-salad-classic-diane-kochilas/,2024-07-28 22:00:02.818667,,"The first thing Diane Kochilas does when our conversation starts is turn her laptop around so I can see what she sees: the waters of the Aegean Sea. She is just back from a swim on the remote Greek island of Ikaria, her hair is damp and her smile is wide. On my end of the Zoom, the view is of my home-office wall, so let’s just say my jealousy is palpable.Kochilas, prolific cookbook author and host of the public-television series “My Greek Table,” was born and raised in Jackson Heights, Queens. But her familial roots are on Ikaria, famous for being one of the world’s “Blue Zones,” where residents enjoy particularly long and healthy lives and where she spends time (and teaches classes) every summer. As I have written before, some of the biggest commonalities among the “Blue Zones” have to do with food; among other things, the regions share a focus on a primarily plant-based diet.Get the recipe: Classic Greek SaladThat’s the focus of Kochilas’s latest book, “The Ikaria Way,” which demonstrates the richness and variety of its plant-based cooking, traditional and modern. “We always associate Greek cuisine with lamb souvlaki, meatballs, things like that,” she tells me. “And in Greek restaurants, that’s basically what’s represented most. But this really is one of the great plant-based traditional cuisines of the world. … It’s just that people don’t really think about it in that context.”1/3As much as I could talk to Kochilas all day about all manner of vegan and vegetarian dishes, this call has a sharper focus. I want to get her thoughts on what I consider one of Greece’s greatest gifts to the world: a classic that we know merely as Greek salad but is called horiatiki salata in its native land. The name translates to “village salad,” Kochilas explains, but its origins aren’t in the villages at all.At least according to one story, in the 1960s, in the Plaka neighborhood of Athens, she tells me, restaurateurs started adding a block of feta to the top of a simple tomato-cucumber salad. Why? Because there were government price controls on menu items, and the cheese took the salad into a higher-priced category.Since then, as it made its way onto restaurant menus seemingly everywhere, it has sometimes lost its way, as lettuce — and more — came into the picture. Kochilas talks about how in a Greek enclave in Florida, a scoop of potato salad became de rigueur.While there are some regional variations on the salad in Greece — mostly regarding the exact type of cheese — Kochilas advocates a purist’s approach for home cooks. After trying her recipe rather than just winging it like I usually do with this dish, I am a convert. When the vegetables, particularly the tomato and cucumber, are in high season and at their peak flavor, and when you use the best-quality olive oil and feta and olives you can find, you’ll understand. Also crucial: Layering in thinly sliced red onion and green pepper, and sprinkling with oregano and maybe some optional pepperoncini. The result is a harmonious balance of bracingly acidic flavors, rich creaminess, glorious vegetal earthiness and outstanding crunch.Kochilas does occasional restaurant consulting work, and she tells me that she often finds herself pleading with chefs: Don’t serve Greek salad in January. “Only make it in July, August, September,” or whenever tomatoes near you are at their best, beautifully fragrant and ripe.Her other rules:Kochilas tells me that even as we speak, her garden is bursting with tomatoes and cucumber, and she’s able to have Greek salad for breakfast, lunch and dinner. And then she shares her favorite part of eating it: dipping crusty bread into the bottom of the bowl to soak up those juices.At that mouthwatering mention, she and I utter the same words at the same time: “It really is the perfect salad.”Get the recipe: Classic Greek Salad"

WaPo_49,Why is a convicted child rapist at the Olympics? No answer is sufficient.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/28/steven-van-de-velde-netherlands-paris-olympics-beach-volleyball/,2024-07-28 22:49:02.803090,,"PARIS — Let’s get to the most important part first. Somewhere in Milton Keynes, England — or maybe in some remote corner of the globe, should she be seeking an escape — there is a woman in her early 20s who has lived for a decade with a vile, unspeakable crime against her. She was 12 years old. She met a Dutch man online. He flew to meet her. And he raped her.No amount of punishment to her assailant — not the four years he was sentenced to, and certainly not the 13 months he served — can change that. What thoughts must she wake with every day? Let’s hope they’re serene, happy, forward-looking. But who’s to say?The focus at the Paris Olympics is on the rapist. He is Steven van de Velde, and he is here representing the Netherlands in beach volleyball — in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, in a stunning setting that blends the thumping bass of modern sport with the sky-scraping ode to the French Revolution — because Dutch Olympic officials made a choice.He had done his time, they said. He was remorseful, they said. He earned the spot, they said.Asked about the optics of appearing to be protecting a child rapist, Jon van Vliet, a spokesman for the Dutch team, said, “We are protecting a convicted child rapist to do his sport as best as possible, and for a tournament which he qualified for.”Read those words again, if you can.“We are protecting a convicted child rapist to do his sport as best as possible.”Sunday morning, under the first blue sky of these Games, van de Velde and his playing partner, Matthew Immers, took to the sandy court with the tower as its backdrop. The stands were nearly full. When the public address announcer introduced him — “At a ginormous 6-foot-6, making his Olympic debut, Mr. … Steven … van de Velde!” — a smattering of boos rippled through a venue that, every four years, is typically among the Games’ most buoyant.“I didn’t hear it,” Immers said. “I think the crowd is also far away. So you hear a lot of cheering.”In the first set, van de Velde, now 29, and Immers were on the cusp of winning, when their Italian counterparts …Come on. None of this matters. This guy should not be here.The review of the facts, and we’ll try to be brief: In 2014, when he was 19, van de Velde met an English girl on Facebook. He flew to her town northwest of London, raped her, and then advised her to get a morning-after pill. When she tried, the clinic alerted authorities.Because she was 12.The judge in the case, upon sentencing van de Velde to four years, told him this was “plainly a career end.”He served a year of his sentence in England before being transferred to the Netherlands. There he served another month.From there … Take it away, Dutch Olympic officials.“Van de Velde has fully engaged with all the requirements and has met all the stringent risk assessment thresholds, checks and due diligence,” the Dutch Olympic Committee wrote in a statement before the competition. “Experts have stated that there is no risk of recidivism. Van de Velde has consistently remained transparent about the case which he refers to as the most significant misstep of his life. He deeply regrets the consequences of his actions for those involved. He has been open about the personal transformation he has undergone as a result.”Yes, it’s possible to have second chances and to reform. Van de Velde has a wife and a child. He is free and living his life. Isn’t that enough?“I think Steven is a really good example from how he is right now,” Immers said in English after their opening match. “I am enjoying it very much to play with him. What is in the past is in the past. He had his …” and he fumbled for a word here, before van Vliet, standing by his side, said, “punishment.”“Punishment,” Immers picked up, “and now he’s really, really kind. For me, that’s a big example that you grew.”Everyone is for growth. Should that include the right to seek gold, too?Back to the survivor.“The lifelong consequences are for the child he raped,” the Brave Movement, a global organization that aims to end child sexual violence, wrote in an open letter about van de Velde’s case. “Perpetrators move on. Those they abuse are left searching for healing and justice. We need a world centered around survivors, not perpetrators.”The International Olympic Committee said before the Games began that the decision to allow van de Velde to compete was up to the Dutch. Dutch officials clearly knew this would be an issue, because they arranged for van de Velde to stay outside the Olympic Village, and they do not require van de Velde to walk through the “mixed zone,” the area at each venue where athletes can be approached by the media. He has not spoken publicly.“We are here to create an environment for all our athletes in which they can perform well,” van Vliet said. “We were aware that this was going to be a special situation, so we made our own measurements to make them play the best as they can in the environment which is best for them.”The Netherlands has made others choices about whom it wants representing its country and whom it doesn’t. Joost Luiten, a 38-year-old veteran of the DP World Tour, met the qualifications to play in the Olympic men’s golf tournament. He wrote on social media that the Dutch federation wouldn’t send him because, he said, they didn’t feel he had a good chance of a high finish. He went to court and won — but by that point International Golf Federation officials had given his spot to another player.We know whom the Dutch committee will make special arrangements for and who they won’t.On Sunday, van de Velde and Immers lost to two Italians. They next play a team from Chile on Wednesday. The focus will return.But if that match crosses the television screen, forget the competition. Think of that girl, not the then-19-year-old who preyed on her. Think of the survivors of similar atrocities who could be triggered just by hearing his story and watching him perform. For them, the Olympics aren’t to be celebrated. They’re a reminder of their own suffering."
WaPo_50,"An injury scare, a packed house — and an ‘amazing’ day for Simone Biles",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/28/simone-biles-injury-scare-paris-olympics/,2024-07-28 22:23:02.803090,,"PARIS — The last time Simone Biles stood on the vault runway at the Olympic Games, her body betrayed her. Since then, she’s been unstoppable, proving, in routine after routine, that she has worked past the mental block that derailed her three years ago in Tokyo — and that she is still the world’s best gymnast. But during her first competitive performance in Paris, in the qualifying round here Sunday, Biles’s body threatened to thwart her again.This time, it was a physical ailment, rather than the dangerous mind-body disconnect that rattled Biles amid the pressure of the last Olympics. But it still seemed like déjà vu, with Biles alongside the team doctor as questions lingered about whether the sport’s biggest star would be able to continue. During warm-ups before floor, Biles felt minor pain in her left calf, a reemergence of an issue that first appeared a couple of weeks ago, her coach, Cecile Landi, said afterward. Wrapping her lower leg with tape was enough to help Biles push through. But while she warmed up her vaults soon after, she at one point crawled alongside the runway and hopped on one foot. She then practiced her difficult Yurchenko double pike and landed short, an unusual error for Biles — and a sometimes painful mistake.The uncertainty lingered briefly, palpable in an arena packed with thousands of fans and few A-list admirers, including Tom Cruise, Ariane Grande and Jessica Chastain. But Landi said finishing Sunday’s competition was never in doubt for Biles. (Biles did not talk to the press afterward.)When it counted, Biles sprinted down the runway and soared off the vault, flipping twice in a pike position. It’s the hardest vault in women’s gymnastics, yet Biles makes it look easy — even amid an injury scare. As she headed to bars, “she started to feel better,” Landi said. Biles hit another routine to post a 59.566 all-around total, her second-best mark since Tokyo.Biles’s performance was “pretty amazing,” Landi said, adding that she does not have concern about whether Biles will be able to continue competing. Despite the injury and some missteps, Biles managed to lead the U.S. women through the meet as a steadying force. She stepped out of bounds on floor, just after the calf pain flared up, and she ended up having too much power on vault, despite not rotating enough in warm-ups, so she took two big steps backward.The other Americans had more nervy moments: All the gymnasts who joined Biles in the beam lineup wobbled on multiple skills, particularly 16-year-old Hezly Rivera in her Olympic debut. And Jade Carey, who said on social media that she hasn’t been feeling well, bailed out of her final tumbling pass on floor, leading to a low score that will keep her from defending her Olympic gold medal on the apparatus.i haven’t been feeling the best the past few days but i gave it everything i had today. thank you for all the support i have received. i’m so grateful ❤️❤️ https://t.co/52r9JtsXkNEven with the mishaps, the U.S. team’s mark of 172.296 was plenty to lead the field with three sessions to go. The Americans will be the heavy favorites to win the team gold Tuesday, particularly given the absence of Russia, a longtime power in gymnastics, whose athletes are banned from team competition here. The athletes from the Russian Olympic Committee won the gold ahead of the Americans in Tokyo after Biles’s withdrawal led to a chaotic team final.In the qualifying round, Sunisa Lee, the reigning Olympic all-around champion, edged Jordan Chiles by less than one-tenth to earn a spot in the all-around final. Though Chiles’s 56.065 is the third-best mark so far, countries cannot have more than two gymnasts in each final, and Lee (56.132) narrowly prevailed.Biles, expected to win the all-around gold, will be the headliner each time she competes. But Landi has said that having three other returning Olympians on this team eases the pressure on Biles. And together, the gymnasts have described this Olympics as their “redemption tour.” All four returners — Biles, Lee, Carey and Chiles — have something they want to achieve that they missed out on three years ago, nobody more so than Biles. The injury, no matter how minor, only adds to the curiosity around how Biles will manage this massive spotlight.In her first test, though, Biles excelled. She tallied the best score of the day so far on vault and floor, as well as the second-best mark on beam. After she finished her final routine, she waved to the crowd and then danced with Chiles to celebrate. The calf issue has added uncertainty to Biles’s Olympic quest, which could end with up to five gold medals, but her dominant performance amid the trouble resembled all of her other outings since Tokyo. One after another, Biles’s brilliant routines washed away the concern."

WaPo_52,"After Simone Biles crawls, an Olympics holds its breath",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/28/simone-biles-calf-injury-paris-olympics/,2024-07-29 00:50:02.841335,,"PARIS — The most scrutinized lower leg in the Paris Olympics was covered in a nylon Team USA suit Sunday morning. So as it paraded around an assembly of reporters, who were standing and waiting behind barriers, the only sound heard was a swishhh swishhh swishhh. Every eye followed that famous left leg, or truly, whom it was attached to. Watching Simone Biles walk had never seemed more imperative.Biles didn’t stop to talk. Instead she kept stride with her U.S. teammates as they walked past all credentialed media, Biles more gingerly than the others. Still, she smiled and waved. Most reporters didn’t reciprocate, instead keeping their gaze on her leg.Is she okay? Was that a hitch? Are her pants making so much noise because she’s struggling to walk?!Three years ago, it was Biles’s mind. Now, the concern focused on her calf.Biles created the most unforgettable scene of the zombie Olympics in Tokyo as she walked away from her first vault, her lips pursed and eyes flushed with fear. The lasting image from Sunday might be of Biles crawling — yes, literally crawling.“She felt a little something in her calf but, um, yeah, that’s all,” U.S. coach Cecile Landi said, answering the first of many questions about Biles’s health.Landi said Biles started feeling “a little pain in her calf” on her floor routine. That’s when the energy in the building shifted at the opening chords of distortion from Taylor Swift’s “ … Ready For It?” Like every other awe-stuck fan inside the packed arena, Tom Cruise, Snoop Dogg, Ariana Grande and Anna Wintour stared at the floor. The A-listers didn’t need to legitimize this moment. A master was about to begin, and all eyes were on her.However, on Biles’s first pass, twisting, tucking, launching herself skyward to superhuman heights, she stumbled a bit out of bounds. She finished the routine — with “unbelievable difficulty,” the public address announcer informed the crowd, a reference to the demands of the skills. However, she rested on the top step and spoke to one of her coaches. Before moving on to vault, Biles would get her lower leg wrapped.Asked if there had been any consideration of Biles not continuing, Landi responded, “Never in her mind. No.”But soon, after her warm-up vaults, a strange sight: The master couldn’t even walk. She was crawling on all fours, dragging her body along the Paris 2024 logo, then rising to her feet and hopping on her right leg.Landi gave a nothing-to-see-here vibe while providing a medical update, before eventually shutting down further inquiries by telling reporters, “I will not be answering any more questions about her calf. If you want to talk about the whole team, I’ll be happy to tell you.”But USA Gymnastics technical lead Chellsie Memmel did not mask her unease. When asked if she wondered about Biles continuing on through the final two rotations, Memmel answered: “I did.”Like Cruise and Snoop and everyone else in the building, Memmel surely witnessed the shaky moment down the runway. The G.O.A.T. crawling like a baby. However, Biles continued.She waited for her turn, sitting placidly at the end of the row of seats, three empty spaces between her and the team doctor while teammate Jade Carey completed her two vaults. When Biles sat up, cameras zoomed in. On the overhead scoreboard, we could see the white on her toenails, even the scrunch on her face for reasons only she would know. Then, as another country’s gymnast began her floor routine with the dramatic intro of a Fall Out Boy song, Biles sprinted down the runway. No limp, no quirk in her gait, only a powerful stride. She performed a Yurchenko double pike, but needed a big step back to catch herself. That left leg, soon to be most important appendage in Paris, stabilizing her.Biles completed a second vault, then concluded the competition on the uneven bars. Overall, she earned a score of 59.566, well on her way to qualifying for the all-around final and capping a storybook comeback. In 2021, Biles could not be herself, she felt disoriented while flipping in the air, so she withdrew from the Tokyo Games. Protecting her mental health proved to be a greater priority than seeking yet another gold medal.The average sports fan might understand a strained calf more than a bruised mind. Especially when considering the atmosphere three years ago, when in some circles, Biles faced criticism for “quitting.” However, just like in Tokyo, Biles is “playing hurt.” It’s the same sirens for alarm wailing through Team USA, but now Biles must overcome a physical ailment.Asked if she was concerned, Memmel said, “I am, but I’m going to talk to her.“I haven’t even gotten [a chance] to speak to Simone. I need to speak to our team, our medical team, so I don’t have an answer about that. First and foremost, I want to make sure she’s physically okay, and then we’re just going to go from there.”Memmel faced reporters minutes after the U.S. gymnasts had completed their silent walk-through. In this pointless formality for the gymnasts to at least appear in front of media, all five Americans made a sharp right turn, then walked on the other side of the closed-off area, and toward the backstage of Bercy Arena. No comments.Biles remained mum even as a man tried to get a response by applauding. Then, the crew went away, out of sight. As she turned the corner, Biles appeared to have a slight limp. Probing eyes followed that lower leg. She walked past them all, and into the first moment of uncertainty of these Paris Olympics."

WaPo_54,"The trade deadline is looming, but Lane Thomas doesn’t want to ‘play GM’",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/28/lane-thomas-trade-deadline-nationals/,2024-07-29 00:40:02.841335,,"Earlier this month in Milwaukee, there was a frantic dash in the visitors’ clubhouse as the Washington Nationals  gathered their belongings, preparing to catch the team bus to the airport for the all-star break. Outfielder Lane Thomas walked by a few of his teammates on the way out. “I’ll see you guys in five days,” he said. And then he paused, and added, “hopefully.”Thomas, 28, is still a National, but his deadpan comment underscored an uncomfortable reality. For the second straight season, Thomas’s future with Washington is in limbo ahead of the MLB trade deadline. Thomas enjoyed the best season of his career in 2023, with a first half that made him worthy of all-star consideration. His numbers have dipped this season, but he remains an intriguing trade piece ahead of Tuesday’s deadline. “I feel fine,” Thomas said Tuesday. “There’s still games to play, whether it’s here or somewhere else. I got to still be ready to play every day like I can. … I try not to think too far down the road, wherever it’s at. It’s happened to me before so it’s nothing I haven’t had to deal with before.”Thomas landed in the Nationals at the 2021 trade deadline, when St. Louis sent the outfielder to Washington in a deal for aging starter Jon Lester. The 28-year-old, who is under team control through 2025, entered Sunday on a 24-game on-base streak. He is also third in MLB with 27 stolen bases, only behind Cincinnati’s Elly De La Cruz and Milwaukee’s Brice Turang. Thomas, who missed a month of the season with an MCL sprain, is batting  .250 with a 110 OPS+. His .399 slugging percentage is down from .468 in 2023 and he has just eight home runs. Thomas is being more patient this year — his chase percentage is down to 20.4 percent; league average is 28.3 percent. Defensively, he still has elite arm strength, but his range has taken a step back from 2023.As the deadline looms, Thomas’s comments on the team and his future sound about like what one would expect from a player who has been in this spot before. Teams wanting him is a privilege, he says, it means he is playing well. He wants to see Washington’s rebuild through — a point he’s previously emphasized. He knows he has no say in all this. For Thomas, it’s simply business as usual — a mindset Nationals Manager Dave Martinez remembers from his playing days.“I didn’t really think about it,” said Martinez, who was traded five times in his career. “I always said to myself, I love the team I play for and I’m gonna play as hard as I can. If they decide that they’re going to go in a different direction, I’m going to put the uniform on and love that team just as much.”“It’s not my job to, what’s the word, play GM,” Thomas said. “I just got to keep doing what they’re paying me to do.”Washington, which on Saturday traded outfielder Jesse Winker to the New York Mets, could have moved Thomas last season, but opted to keep him patrolling the outfield at Nationals Park. Thomas isn’t on an expiring deal this year, so the Nationals could do that again. But in just a year, the landscape has changed, as Washington’s minor league system improved. The Nationals have outfield depth in the minors —  Dylan Crews, the No. 2 overall pick of the 2023 draft, is in Class AAA Rochester. Robert Hassell III, Daylen Lile and Andrew Pinckney are all in Class AA Harrisburg, though Hassell is rehabbing from a wrist injury.With Crews knocking on the door and more behind him, Washington could maximize value for Thomas. And a return of controllable minor leaguers, or even big leaguers, for Thomas would bolster Washington’s minor league system even more.Thomas has dominated left-handed pitching in his career, but has been less effective against righties. His numbers suggest he would be best in a platoon role, but Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo recently reiterated that he views Thomas as an everyday player, which would garner a bigger return. If a platoon return doesn’t meet Rizzo’s asking price, he’d be less inclined to pull off a trade. But if there’s a team desperate for outfield help, it’s possible it could offer something better.Thomas has also grown into a clubhouse leader during his time in Washington. Outfielder Jacob Young called him  “the face that I believe you’d want to lead the organization.” Young remembers being nervous  when he was called up last season, hoping someone would show him how to be a big leaguer. That someone became Thomas, who Young said led by example.Over the past year, Thomas has taught Young the little things, like what to wear on the road, how to establish a routine and how to carry himself in the clubhouse. Young said Thomas is always keeping things loose with his humor — even about himself. Young said Thomas has been joking in recent weeks about how he has to pack in case he is traded. “You don’t want to see guys like that go,” Young said. “He’s the right guy for us young guys to look at for how to play the game and what to do. Luckily, he was here for long enough that, if he does get traded, he showed us the ropes and how to lead the next group of guys … But it would definitely be a tough scene to watch him go if it does happen.”"

WaPo_56,Why the Park Fire exploded so quickly,https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/28/park-fire-fast-spread-fuels/,2024-07-29 01:55:02.717222,,"Wildfire experts knew the Northern California region where the Park Fire sparked was ready to burn, but no one expected how fast it would go up in flames. In just three days, the fire exploded into the state’s seventh-largest wildfire on record.It consumed about 5,000 acres per hour after first igniting Wednesday, scorching 150,000 acres on Friday alone and racing far to the north to threaten towns that earlier seemed well out of reach. As of Sunday morning, it had spread to more than 350,000 acres, with evacuation orders spanning four counties.“This region is no stranger to fast-moving and high-intensity fires,” Neil Lareau, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Nevada at Reno, said in an email. “This fire is right up there with the fastest growing fires in history.”Multiple wildfire experts and historians — including Zeke Lunder, a veteran wildfire and fuels management expert who lives in Chico, Calif., near where the Park Fire started — said they don’t recall another wildfire that reached 350,000 acres in 72 hours. In 2020, the Bear Fire, part of the North Complex Fire, which burned the town of Berry Creek, came close, he said. The Santa Ana wind-fueled Cedar Fire in 2003 torched 280,000 acres around the San Diego area in the time period.While each fire is unique, climate and fire scientists have a general sense of when one will be bad and why. The Park Fire, however, has been exhibiting extreme behavior and “moving in ways we aren’t yet used to seeing,” Lunder said.A volatile mix of ingredients combined to make this particular blaze one of the most extreme the state has seen. Here’s why it has grown so big, so quickly.Heat waves have been plaguing California since early May, after the last real rainstorm moved through the state. But the heat this month has been off the charts.Much of California is on track to see its warmest July on record. That includes Red Bluff, a city just west of where the fire is burning, which also just recorded its all-time hottest 21-day stretch, from July 3 to July 23, according to the National Weather Service in Sacramento.“Record setting antecedent heat in early July throughout the West set the stage for the explosion of fires we’re seeing now,” Lareau said.The heat rapidly dried grasses, brush and trees, causing the fire danger to skyrocket.“What climate change is doing is just adding more energy into the system and amping up what’s there,” said Stephen Pyne, an emeritus professor and fire historian at Arizona State University.Butte County, where the Park Fire ignited, sits at the epicenter of the state’s wildfire crisis amid increasingly hot fire seasons as global temperatures rise. Many of California’s most shocking recent blazes have roared through this area: 2018’s deadly Camp Fire, 2020’s North Complex Fire that wiped out a town and killed 15, and 2021’s million-acre Dixie Fire.But this fire is “near the top of the list in terms of the extraordinary, record-breaking, paradigm-shifting fire characteristics that we saw,” UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain said in a Friday briefing.After sparking in Chico’s lush Bidwell Park on a triple-digit afternoon last week, the fire exploded around Butte County and, with the help of strong winds, rapidly moved north through all that fuel. Given the highly flammable conditions, any winds were going to be a problem.“Winds haven’t been extreme … but they’ve been ‘just right’ to produce high-intensity spread,” Lareau said.At a news conference Saturday morning, Cal Fire officials discussed the extreme conditions they were witnessing, explaining that this blaze is a “plume-dominated fire.” That means the power of the fire is stronger than the wind, and it produces its own convection columns filled with gases, smoke, ash and other fire particles.Firefighters were dealing with multiple large, fortified plumes, and when those columns rise, “you get a strong inflow of wind,” officials said. When those combine, they can create erratic, gusty winds, which can throw embers far ahead, creating new spot fires that can also take off.“Independently, a plume-dominated fire is very dangerous. With this one, we have multiple plumes working together,” Scott Weese, a fire behavior analyst with Cal Fire, said Saturday.In briefings throughout the week, fire officials described how these conditions drove the fire’s fast spread.“It’s been growing 5,000 acres an hour since the inception,” said Billy See, incident commander for Cal Fire. “Just to put that into perspective, we’re looking at almost 8 square miles an hour this thing is taking out.”The fire is burning so hot in part because there is so much dry vegetation to consume, with a high fuel load and abundant grasses in the region. And much of where the fire is burning has never burned in modern history, experts said, meaning the fire is ripping through very dense fuels that have accumulated.“There’s areas out there that have no fire history, a lot of ‘dead and down’ and a lot of logging slash,” Weese said.Pyne wasn’t surprised to see a blaze like this in this area, given all of the grass growth from two wet winters and then a serious heat dome to dry it all out. California has gone from the lush green of the wet season to severe wildfires in a few short months.“The cadence [of the fire season] is there, it’s just being compressed and exaggerated,” Pyne said. “So, things shift, but further than they would have in the past.”"

Shaw wasn’t a fan of any NFL team in 2012, but he told himself that whichever team selected Robert Griffin III in the draft that year he would adopt as his own.More than 12 years later, Shaw is still a Washington fan and tries to travel down annually for training camp. This year, however, had a different feel.It did for Ty Laurie, too. Laurie drove 12 hours from Montreal to be able to stand alongside Shaw outside the Commanders’ training facility at 4:30 a.m. The two were the first among nearly 3,000 fans to attend the team’s first camp practice open to the public, giving them the earliest glimpse of new quarterback Jayden Daniels — and one of his limited autographs. (The team restricted the capacity to 3,000 because of limited space during ongoing construction at the Ashburn facility.)“It means everything,” Shaw said. “I feel like a little kid again.”Landon Shaw of Massachusetts (center)  and Ty Laurie of Montreal, Canada (were the first in line for Commanders camp today. Shaw drove 6 hours and Laurie 12 hours to be there at 4:30 a.m.They got the last autographs from Jayden Daniels after practice. pic.twitter.com/T9iZeOHWyCShortly before the Commanders began their 75-minute workout, Coach Dan Quinn addressed the fans who packed it in along the practice field to express his appreciation.Then he gave his signature “Let’s get it rocking” to kick off a workout that included the usual array of individual periods, special teams work and team drills — seven-on-seven, 11-on-11 and red zone.Although the crowd was subdued throughout much of the session, the renewed hope and excitement was palpable.“There is,” Quinn agreed. “Honestly, I felt it earlier this morning driving in and seeing people parking up on the grass to get there early. It’s such a cool reminder of how historic this franchise is. … It definitely brought up a good feeling of what is next here.”Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) attended the workout and spoke at various points with Commanders minority owner Mark Ein, general manager Adam Peters and media members to give his sales pitch for keeping the team’s stadium in Maryland. Then he made his way to the fans.“They see and they’re taking notice that I was here on the first day,” Moore said. “That’s how excited I am, not just about what I think the team can do on the field but what I think we can do together off of the field.”The Commanders’ workout was more of a mixed bag. Daniels appeared sharp, but his supporting cast raised some red flags. Right tackle Andrew Wylie did not participate in 11-on-11 drills, two days after rookie Brandon Coleman closed out practice in his place. Wylie said afterward that he is dealing with some tightness (he didn’t specify where), that the team is “being smart” about it and that he expects to be back Monday.Quinn typically mixes starters with reserves in team drills, so the offensive line often rotated. But the group as a whole had at least four false start penalties.Kicker also remains a need for the Commanders; the team signed Ramiz Ahmed in June to replace Brandon McManus, who was released after allegations of sexual assault. Ahmed was strong in the early going of camp, but has struggled to connect on anything from more than 50 yards out. Another long attempt during team drills Sunday hit the upright.Commanders training camp practice doesn’t start for another hour or so, but fans are already looped around the parking lot waiting to get in. pic.twitter.com/rTgJ1BTW5nBut the focus was clearly on the fans. Quinn spoke to some youth flag football players after the workout while players signed autographs and took selfies with supporters.Daniels started at the standing room only section of fans and spent close to 15 minutes after the workout signing jerseys, towels, mini-helmets, T-shirts and even a fan’s shoe, ensuring a team staffer armed with a handful of Sharpie pens stayed close.“He’s done a great job,” backup quarterback Marcus Mariota said of Daniels’s handling of the fan interest. “And it’s not easy. When you’re coming in to be the guy to revitalize a franchise, it’s tough.”Before being ushered away to the locker room, Daniels pulled out a pen for one final sign that read: “I DROVE FROM MASS TO MEET MY FAVORITE TEAM!”Shaw stood speechless as Daniels signed his name and thanked him for coming.“I just kind of blacked out,” Shaw said. “I didn’t know what to say. I’m shaking right now. I might cry, honestly. That’s my guy.”"
WaPo_58,Kevin Durant’s return powers U.S. men to opening win over Serbia,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/28/usa-basketball-serbia-paris-olympics/,2024-07-29 01:25:02.717222,,"VILLENEUVE-D’ASCQ, France – Three weeks ago, Kevin Durant slumped by himself in the corner of UNLV’s gym with his hooded sweatshirt pulled tight over his head. The 35-year-old star had missed USA Basketball’s first training camp that day with a calf injury that hadn’t yet been disclosed to the media, and he looked frustrated in his self-imposed detention.As LeBron James and Stephen Curry stole the headlines throughout the U.S. team’s run up to the Paris Olympics, Durant was listed as day-to-day but kept missing games. The three-time gold medalist never appeared in any of the Americans’ five exhibition games, not even when they endured close calls with Australia, South Sudan and Germany.But Durant’s long-awaited return to the court came in triumphant fashion Sunday, when he scored 23 points and made his first eight shots in the Americans’ 110-84 victory over Serbia in its Olympics opener. The victory over Nikola Jokić and the Serbians, who are among the medal favorites, puts the United States on the fast track to the quarterfinals, as their remaining Group C games will be against South Sudan and Puerto Rico, who both rank outside the top 15 in the FIBA World Rankings.U.S. Coach Steve Kerr elected to bring Durant off the bench rather than use him in the starting lineup during his first game action since his Phoenix Suns were swept out of the first round of the playoffs in April. Durant promptly sank his first shot attempt — a three-pointer from the right angle — and proceeded to go 8-8 from the field, including 5-5 from beyond the arc, in the first half. He led all scorers at the break with 21 points, and he helped the Americans erase an early 10-2 deficit to take a 58-49 halftime lead.Durant’s return brought better flow and spacing to a U.S. offense that struggled with turnovers and stilted play throughout its exhibition slate. James added 21 points, 7 rebounds and 9 assists in the victory, receiving loud ovations from the international crowd with each successive dunk and driving finish. To accommodate Durant, Kerr removed Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum from his rotation for the first time this summer.After the Americans dismantled the Serbians 105-79 in a July 17 exhibition, Sunday’s contest was a much more intense affair. The Serbian fans left a big imprint on their highly-anticipated opener against the United States, shooting off air horns during live action and loudly chanting “MVP” for Jokić, who finished with a team-high 20 points to go with four rebounds and seven assists.Meanwhile, U.S. center Joel Embiid heard loud boos throughout the night, presumably from French fans disappointed he decided to play for the U.S. instead of France, where he also holds citizenship. Embiid struggled in his Olympic debut, tallying four points and two rebounds in 11 minutes while getting pulled from the court during his first rotation less than three minutes into the game. The 2023 NBA MVP also committed an unsportsmanlike foul in the third quarter, and the Americans were minus-eight with him on the court and plus-18 when he was on the bench.For the United States, which knew its biggest test of the opening round would come in its first game, the blowout victory should provide the chance to breathe a sigh of relief. Through its first two days, the men’s basketball tournament has been dominated by favored teams and has featured relatively few surprises. That’s good news for James, Curry, Durant and company, who are hoping to capture the United States’ fifth consecutive gold medal in Paris on Aug. 10."

The coming-of-age novel told of two young women escaping their stifling parochial upbringing to find liberation and sexual freedom in Dublin.The book poured out of her in three weeks, and Ms. O’Brien seemed to have emerged from nowhere fully formed as a writer, producing lyrical prose whose tone and detail perfectly captured her characters’ inner lives and desires and presaged the sexual revolution.Literary scholars today view “The Country Girls” as deeply influential. “By turns beautiful and bawdy, funny and haunting, ‘The Country Girls,’ often referred to as the quintessential tale of Irish girlhood, is not the novel that broke the mould: it is the one that made it,” Irish novelist Eimear McBride observed.The novel, released before Ms. O’Brien turned 30, received critical accolades in Britain and the United States but was banned in Ireland. Her mother, who claimed that a local priest had publicly burned the book, kept a copy but redacted the passages she found devilish, the author recalled, “with good, deep, black ink.”Ms. O’Brien seemed resigned to, even bemused by, the pariah status her early books conferred on her back home in County Clare.“I believe that mental disturbance by literature is a healthy and invigorating thing,” Ms. O’Brien told the British newspaper the Guardian in 1965. “We have plenty of comfortable and easy prose all around us, but it’s by abrasion that people’s prejudices are aroused.”Ms. O’Brien grew up in a newly independent and staunchly Catholic Ireland with firm ideas about the roles of women, who had no lawful access to abortion, contraception or divorce. In much of her work, Ms. O’Brien limned characters who yearned to break free of “the stranglehold I grew up with” but who often fell victim to their desires and dreams.She took pains to say her work, which included plays, screenplays and short stories, was not strictly autobiographical — she wrote a 2012 memoir titled “Country Girl” — but if she needed inspiration for her tales, her life would have been a gold mine.She quested for romance, but her relationships did not last. In her late 70s, she told a BBC radio interviewer: “I don’t think I have ever learned the game of men and women. To this day I regret the fact that it’s like a dance I couldn’t learn.”After a failed love affair in the 1980s, she returned to the one relationship that would abide — with the written word — and she was still turning out handwritten manuscripts in her late 80s.Like her hero James Joyce, she chose to write about Ireland from self-exile. She spent most of her life in London, and, young and famous, did her bit to define the Swinging Sixties and drag the decade into the Sagging Seventies. She bought a big house in London’s bohemian Chelsea neighborhood, where she held legendary gatherings.Her party guests included Princess Margaret, Jane Fonda and Sean Connery. She was friends with former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and author Gore Vidal. She never denied rumors of a fling with the Hollywood star Robert Mitchum.One night, actor Marlon Brando, the worse for drink, slept in her kitchen. Paul McCartney once drove her home and sang a lullaby to her children.Ms. O’Brien was an ageless Celtic beauty, a point not lost on a procession of feature writers who described her as auburn-haired, milky-skinned and with soulful gray-blue eyes.Robert Gottlieb, Ms. O’Brien’s longtime editor at Alfred A. Knopf in New York, wrote that she “was a glory … with her pale white skin, spectacular red hair, and exotic outfits: ankle-length gossamer skirts, vivid antique-lace blouses, and layers of baubles, bangles, and beads. She dangled and wafted.”In time, she came to fear that this image would overshadow her work. “I don’t want to be remembered as this lightweight who gave parties and had love affairs. It is ridiculous,” she wrote. “I have written more than 25 books.”Ms. O’Brien returned time and again to themes of pain and isolation in star-crossed protagonists, but her canvas broadened in mid-to-late career as she explored political strife, including violence in Ireland, the Balkans and Nigeria.Maureen O’Connor, a professor of English at University College Cork and an authority on Ms. O’Brien, described the author’s books as “pellucid, sane, and honest, while at the same time devastatingly lyrical, always vivid.”In an email, O’Connor added that the “rich variety of her voice is one of its distinctive qualities, something that has emerged especially powerfully in her late work, in which the narrative speaks through characters young, old, male, female, across the classes, and of many nationalities.”Josephine Edna O’Brien was born in Tuamgraney, County Clare, on Dec. 15, 1930, and was the youngest of four children. Her father, a horse trader, gambled and drank away much of his inherited fortune, and she and her mother lived in fear of his alcoholic furies.Her heightened imagination was stirred by the pageant of life in East Clare, including troupes of itinerant actors that passed through her village, and she attempted a first novel at 10.The next year, she left home to attend a Catholic boarding school in County Galway. At first, with naive aplomb, Ms. O’Brien wanted to become not just a nun but a saint. The calling passed. As for her writing talent, the nuns “hated it,” she said.She went to Dublin at 18 and trained as a pharmacist. She fell in love with an Irish writer of Czech descent named Ernest Gebler, who had just divorced. They eventually eloped. She said she was “duty-bound” to marry him after a posse consisting of her father, her brothers and a bishop followed them to the Isle of Man. By then, though being chased, she was not chaste. Gebler “had been roughed up a little bit,” she told an interviewer.In the 1950s, the couple had two sons and lived in County Wicklow before settling in London. But it was not a happy marriage, Ms. O’Brien said, and it worsened when “The Country Girls” brought her success that sparked his jealousy. She walked out and spent two years in a bitter custody battle.After “The Country Girls” she wrote two sequels, “The Lonely Girl” (1962) and “Girls in Their Married Bliss” (1964), tracing the marriages and divorces of her protagonists, Baba and Caithleen. These titles were also banned in Ireland, along with her next four novels.Her female protagonists sought to navigate misogyny and their own passions, and they often foundered. In Ms. O’Brien’s universe, liberation comes with a price. An early critic likened her lovelorn protagonists to lemmings in search of a cliff.In “August Is a Wicked Month,” published in 1965, a woman estranged from her husband seeks pleasure on the French Riviera. She contracts a venereal disease and loses her son in an accident. The book was used as evidence against her, unsuccessfully, in her divorce and child-custody case.Ms. O’Brien also wrote the screenplay to “Girl With Green Eyes” (1964), based on “The Lonely Girl,” and “X, Y & Zee” (1972), starring Elizabeth Taylor and Michael Caine as a couple whose marriage has become a sadomasochistic combat zone.In the 1980s, she stopped writing for several years while she had a long, unfulfilling affair with an unnamed British political figure she called “Lochinvar” in her memoir. “I had fooled myself, living on emotional crumbs,” she wrote. Her finances fell into disarray, and she had to sell her grand home in Chelsea.“I was a little foolish to myself,” she said on the BBC radio show “Desert Island Discs.” “It was a lesson to me never to let a day pass that I didn’t keep with my vocation.”In her late 80s, Ms. O’Brien traveled to Nigeria for research on her book “Girl,” a novel based on the kidnapping and sexual abuse of schoolgirls by Boko Haram jihadists. Shortly after its 2019 publication, she was awarded the David Cohen Prize for Literature, which recognizes the lifetime achievement of British and Irish writers.Mark Lawson, a judge on the Cohen Prize panel, wrote that Ms. O’Brien “achieved a rare arc of brilliant consistency, her literary skill, courage, and impact as apparent in a novel published as recently as September as in her first book, which appeared 60 years ago.”She had two sons, Carlo Gebler and Sasha Gebler. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.Ms. O’Brien had a vacation home designed by her architect son Sasha on the picturesque Irish coast near Donegal, but she sold it, saying the rooms were too large and sunny for writing. She also said she feared that if she returned to Ireland permanently the intensity of her Irishness would fade, to the detriment of her work. She never lost her brogue, which seemed to become stronger if more wistful as she aged.“I wish in my early life I had stood up a bit more,” Ms. O’Brien told the Financial Times in an interview at the age of 86. “But all things considered I was pretty brave. You know, if you start off with a pretty terrifying start, you have many handicaps. … I would say, as regards my inner self, I am happier than I ever was while naturally aware of death and decay and decrepitude. I am full of darkness, but I am also full of light. Do you know what I mean?”"
WaPo_60,"Israel strikes deep in Lebanon after rocket attack, stoking fear of wider war",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/28/israel-hamas-war-news-gaza-lebanon/,2024-07-29 01:35:02.717222,,"MAJDAL SHAMS, Golan Heights — Israel’s military said it struck Hezbollah targets deep inside Lebanon Sunday after a rocket strike from Lebanon killed 12 people, most of them teenagers and children, on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, raising the specter of all-out war.Sunday’s strikes, on what the Israeli military said was Hezbollah weapons caches and infrastructure, fell short of the furious response Israeli officials threatened after the strike Saturday on a soccer field in the Golan where children were playing. Diplomats worked feverishly Sunday to blunt any Israeli retaliation. Lebanon’s government, which would suffer from any escalation, entreated the United States to urge restraint from Israel, Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib told Reuters.Israel, citing military intelligence and an assessment of the scene, blamed the strike in Majdal Shams Saturday on Hezbollah. Hezbollah denied any connection to the attack.Israel described it as the deadliest single attack on Israel since Hamas rampaged through several communities near the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7, drawing Israel’s military response there. The shocking scenes from the Golan — the bodies of children in weekend soccer clothes, blown apart — followed a flood of warnings from the United Nations and other diplomats that months of largely contained fighting between Hezbollah and Israel along the border could ignite if given a deadly spark.Egypt’s foreign ministry warned Saturday of the “dangers of opening a new war front in Lebanon” that could push the Middle East into a regional conflict, echoing admonitions from other Arab states over the dangers of failing to secure a cease-fire in Gaza. Hezbollah has said it would end its attacks against Israel in the event of such a cease-fire.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who returned to Israel Sunday from his visit to Washington, was set to meet with his security cabinet.In a Sunday morning tweet, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Sunday said he mourned the victims in Majdal Shams. “We live side by side and all suffer from Hezbollah’s terror,” he said in a message posted on X. “We will ensure Hezbollah, the proxy of Iran, pays a price for this loss.” Earlier, Netanyahu warned: “Hezbollah will pay a heavy price for this that it has not paid so far.”U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also expressed sorrow for the loss of life. “Every indication is that indeed … the rocket was from Hezbollah,” he told reporters in Tokyo, where he has been meeting with his Japanese counterparts.While the Biden administration believes Hezbollah carried out the attack, the working assumption is that it was an accident, according to a senior U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive assessments. The official cautioned that the administration hasn’t reached a conclusion about the intent behind the attack.Fighting along the Lebanon-Israel border has intensified in recent months with regular exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israel’s military. The United States has pushed to de-escalate hostilities there. Blinken said he and other top U.S. policymakers were working to ease tensions and bring about a cease-fire Gaza, which he said would reduce flare-ups on the Israel-Lebanon border.Bou Habib, the Lebanese foreign minister, told Reuters that the United States had asked the Lebanese government to pass on a message of restraint to Hezbollah, too.The daily tit-for-tat violence has already claimed dozens of lives. Before the strikes this weekend, at least 94 civilians and more than 300 Hezbollah fighters had been killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon, according to figures compiled this month by The Washington Post.Hundreds of mourners gathered Sunday in a community center in Majdal Shams, a predominantly Druze town in the Golan, for the funeral of those killed in the rocket attack. Sheikh Muwafek Tarif, spiritual leader of the Arab-speaking ethnic Druze in Israel, said it was a day of mourning. There’s much anger in the community, he told the Israeli news outlet Ynet, and he asked what the Israeli government had done for the area’s security.“Harming civilians is a black line,” he said. “The government must bring security to the residents.”Assad Abu Saleh, who lives in Spain but was visiting relatives in Majdal Shams when the projectile struck, said several of the victims belonged to his extended family. “It’s a catastrophe,” he told The Post during the funeral Sunday. He saw “parts of bodies,” he said, and headless torsos.“This war, this stupid war, has to come to an end,” Abu Saleh said, but he was not optimistic. “Both sides are too stubborn to settle for negotiations.”Majd Abu Saleh, an engineer, said he was about 160 feet away from the strike. “All our children, all the time, they are playing” on the field. His 9-year-old daughter had left about five minutes before the strike, he said, but three of her friends were killed.Footage he recorded when he arrived, which The Post reviewed, showed a terrible scene: at least nine children in soccer jerseys and cleats, motionless, their bodies contorted or pierced by shrapnel on the green field.Fawzi Abu Jaber, 72, said he has lived his whole life in Majdal Shams. “I wish to be finished with this tragedy and this crazy war,” he said. The United States, he said, “must back peace, not the war, and not the Israeli government, which doesn’t want peace. Not in Lebanon and in Gaza but in all the Middle East.”Paramedics arrived at the soccer field Saturday to a “very difficult scene,” said United Hatzalah, an Israeli emergency medical services organization. Dozens of children lay injured. Nine victims were declared dead on the scene based on the severity of their injuries, the group said. Israel’s military said the victims were between 10 and 20 years old.The Golan Heights is a 500-square-mile strip along the border between Syria and Israel that Israel seized in 1967 and formally annexed in 1981. In 2019, President Donald Trump upended years of the status quo by making the United States the only country apart from Israel to recognize it as Israeli territory.“There is no doubt that Hezbollah has crossed all the red lines here, and the response will reflect that,” Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Channel 12 on Saturday. “We are nearing the moment in which we face an all-out war against Hezbollah and Lebanon.” A 34-day-war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 left hundreds of soldiers and civilians wounded or dead on both sides. Hezbollah has since received large shipments of rockets and drones from Iran and produced its own weapons. It has air defense capabilities.The Israeli Foreign Ministry said Sunday that the last diplomatic chance to avert a wider war was to push Hezbollah forces away from Israeli territory as stipulated by the 18-year-old U.N. Security Council measure that ended the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war.Resolution 1701 calls for the removal of armed personnel and weapons, apart from those belonging to the Lebanese army or a U.N. force, from an area between the temporarily negotiated border, the Blue Line, and Lebanon’s Litani River, which runs roughly parallel to the frontier about 18 miles north.An Israeli official familiar with internal deliberations said the militant group has long violated the resolution’s ban on forces and weapons in the area, encroachments that grew more blatant after the start of the Gaza war. Some Hezbollah positions are within yards of the Blue Line.“We pulled back across the Blue Line,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive deliberations. “They are in gross violation. They need to pull back and this is pretty much the last minute for them to.” Lebanon has accused Israel of thousands of violations of 1701, including routine and provocative Israeli encroachments of its airspace, and continuing to occupy Lebanese territory in the border area.Iran’s Foreign Ministry warned Israel against any “new adventure” in Lebanon and backed Hezbollah’s assertion that the group was not behind the Majdal Shams attack. Spokesman Nasser Kanani said Israeli claims that Hezbollah is responsible for the strike are a “fake scenario,” attempting to divert attention from the war in Gaza, according to a Foreign Ministry statement Sunday. The United States and the United Nations have a “moral responsibility” to prevent Israel “from starting a new fire whose flames will spread,” Kanani said.Both Britain and Germany condemned the Majdal Shams strike on Sunday. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the United Kingdom was “deeply concerned about the risk of further escalation,” while German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said that “far too many people have died already in this conflict.”The attack in Majdal Shams followed a deadly strike in central Gaza, where local health authorities said at least 30 Palestinians were killed when Israel bombed a school that was sheltering displaced people. The Israel Defense Forces said it targeted a Hamas command and control center inside the Khadija school compound.Lebanon’s main airline delayed some flights to Beirut on Sunday. Middle East Airlines flights from London, Dubai and Copenhagen were among those rescheduled to Monday. In a post on X Sunday, the airline cited “technical reasons related to the distribution of insurance risks for aircraft between Lebanon and other destinations.”At least 39,324 people have been killed and 90,830 injured in Gaza since the war began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry, which is run by Hamas, does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but says the majority of the dead are women and children. Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, including more than 300 soldiers, and says 329 soldiers have been killed since the launch of its military operation in Gaza.Pannett reported from Wellington, New Zealand, Masih from London and Fahim from Beirut.

WaPo_64,"Once again, Olympic arrows point up for South Korean women archers",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/28/south-korea-womens-archery-paris-olympics/,2024-07-29 03:16:03.436867,,"PARIS — Would the greatest dynasty of this Olympic era really suffer an unprecedented hiccup over Napoleon’s dead body? It looked like it might. Then it looked again like it might. Then it did not. When it did not, the numbers screamed bloody wonder.As three more South Korean women turned to each other and beamed with joy and maybe even relief, they had joined a near-superhuman lineage of mastery in a sport so finicky about precision. Their exhilaration meant that since the Olympics saw fit to include the fastidious and ruthless pursuit of women’s team archery in 1988, the event has happened 10 times, and South Korea has won the gold medal 10 times.The 10th saw more stress than most and ended in a Sunday afternoon shootout with China, three arrows each, which South Korea won with an infinitesimal edge and a 29-27 score in front of a giddy crowd with bouncing Korean flags.“First of all, as a Korean athlete, I’m very proud of being a Korean athlete,” 30-year-old Jeon Hun-young said.Yeah, why not? After all, whatever team of any kind anyone supports, it’s not as good as hers. She and 21-year-old Lim Si-hyeon and 19-year-old Nam Su-hyeon had just joined the Olympics’ most exacting parade, which already had gone through Seoul, Barcelona, Atlanta, Sydney, Athens, Beijing, London, Rio de Janeiro without quivering into the ticklish realm of silver. It just hadn’t yet won with the Eiffel Tower as a backdrop and right in front of the Dome des Invalides, home of Mr. Bonaparte’s tomb.Come 2028, it can go for 11 somewhere near the HOLLYWOOD sign.For now, they’re 24 South Korean women from 10 three-woman South Korean teams. One of the 24 won on three different teams, and four of them won on two. Six have reached their 50s, six their 40s, six their 30s, five their 20s and, because they apparently lacked a teen, here’s 19-year-old Nam, who won’t reach 20 until next January.Just listing their names can cause digital fatigue while signifying what a marvel this thing has become: Kim Soo-nyung, Wang Hee-kyung, Yun Young-sook, Cho Youn-jeong, Lee Eun-kyung, Kim Jo-Sun, Kim Kyung-Wook, Yoon Hye-Young, Kim Nam-soon, Yun Mi-jin, Lee Sung-jin, Park Sung-hyun, Yun Ok-Hee, Joo Hyun-Jung, Choi Hyeon-ju, Ki Bo-bae, Chang Hye-jin, Choi Mi-sun, An San, Jang Min-hee, Kang Chae-young, Jeon Hun-young, Lim Si-hyeon and Nam Su-hyeon.From 70 meters (almost 230 feet) aiming for scornful little concentric circles, they’ve won again and again and so many more agains.“For South Korea,” Lim said, “it’s very important to keep the first place. And also, we have changed a lot of teams. And I’m very happy about keeping this place in Korean archery history.” She soon added, “Other countries have progressed a lot, but we will do our best to keep our place.”She said this, of course, with ample calm and zero hubris.The Koreans won near the Acropolis at Athens 2004, when the cicadas chirped outside and anyone present felt lucky and South Korea trailed China 240-231 with one arrow to go, before Park Sung-hyun would tell of just leaving it to divine will as her closing bid seared right smack into a gasp of a 10. They won on Lord’s Cricket Ground at London 2012 when it went to the last arrow against China again with Ki Bo-bae needing a 9 and getting a 9 for a 210-209 win. They have beaten, in finals, China, Germany, Ukraine, China again, China again, China again, Russia, a collection of Russian athletes, and China again. It’s no wonder China hired a Korean coach. “He told us to really be ourselves,” China’s Li Jiaman said.Of course he did.The selves they brought beneath the impressionist-painting Parisian sun looked plenty good enough to nick the 10-Olympiad phenomenon. Then again, the Koreans had to wriggle out of more thickets than ever. Since the format went to playing sets with six arrows per side at Rio de Janeiro 2016 — two points for a set win, one for a draw, and five points wins — the two most recent South Korea teams had played 18 sets, won 14 and drawn four.In the three rounds Sunday, South Korea lost five sets and benefited from some opposing nerves. Chinese Taipei almost snared the first set in the quarterfinals, needing just an eight to win, but registered a six to lose. It won the second set anyway, but then South Korea started off 10-10-9 and started off to a 6-2 win.The Netherlands, then, put the Koreans in a semifinal deficit, two sets to one, after the Dutch surmounted a 29-point ask when all three of them — Quinty Roeffen, Gaby Scholesser and Laura van der Winkle — forged 10s. Well, South Korea went ahead and spent the fourth set going 10-10-10-10-9-10. Who does that? They do, of course. It, too, went to a shoot-off, and the Koreans had the steadier hand, going 9-10-7 to win 26-23.With the final about an hour after the semi, the Koreans looked unbeatable and went ahead 4-0. That prompted the cringe of one of the more unfortunate human sports habits, that of having live announcers at events offering perspective. If the Koreans could understand passages in North American English such as “can etch their names in stone forever” and “a legacy to carry on their shoulders,” just as they prepared to clinch, they might have regretted their English lessons.And as much of the match went on with the sounds of happy Mexican fans out on the street between the venue and the dome, for Mexico had claimed the bronze, China promptly won the next two sets to reach 4-4, and the dynasty teetered. But when Jeon and Nam sandwiched 10s around Lim’s 9 and Li finished with an 8 while needing a 10 to tie, another four years of preparation ended with another gold.“We are always concentrating on the training,” Jeon said, “and we all like the challenge to a new objective. So we, all of us, did our best, and that’s the key to success.”So they all three got a flag, rotated to greet various stands and posed for photos with all their fingers held up to signify the 10. Come Los Angeles 2028, that act might get tricky."

WaPo_66,Swifties report for Chiefs training camp. It may never be the same.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/28/travis-kelce-swifties-chiefs-training-camp/,2024-07-29 04:49:02.944290,,"ST. JOSEPH, Mo. — Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs’ star tight end, weren’t even dating during preseason training camp last year.This year, her fans have got it covered.Long before the Chiefs began reporting last week to the quiet campus of Missouri Western University, Swifties were posting design concepts for Kelce’s camp dorm room on social media and speculating whether the players would have “sleepovers.” When players showed up toting their own circulating fans, Swifties took umbrage at Coach Andy Reid’s spartan conditions. They’re planning “Taygate” parties for the season home opener against the Baltimore Ravens on Sept. 5.On Sunday, dozens of newly minted Chiefs fans braved a broiling sun for their first training camp experience, clutching “87” jerseys, tiny footballs and Swift merchandise, and hoping to get a glimpse of their new favorite player.Some had come from far away, like Hannah Calhoun, who traveled with her parents more than 600 miles from Lexington, Ky. The 16-year-old was wearing a T-shirt that read “Who’s Travis Kelce Anyway?” Trademark Swiftie friendship bracelets encircled her wrists. She approves of the tight end because of the gentlemanly way he treats Swift.“He actually opens the door for her and stuff like that; a lot of her exes didn’t do that,” she said.The famous pair had yet to connect at this point last year, with Travis complaining to brother Jason on their “New Heights” podcast that Swift had shot him down. He said he was “butt hurt” that the singer wouldn’t see him after her recent Kansas City show, in part because he had made a bracelet he wanted to give her. It had his phone number on it.Six weeks later, the couple made their budding relationship public when Swift appeared in the Kelce family suite for the Chiefs’ season home opener at Arrowhead Stadium. After the game, they hopped into his Chevelle convertible and headed off into the sunset — for real.The fairy-tale romance mirrored his team’s 2023 fairy-tale season, which not only saw a merger of two great forces in American culture — Taylor Swift and NFL fans — but also culminated in an overtime Super Bowl victory against the San Francisco 49ers. During the celebration, Kelce and Swift kissed and embraced on field as red and gold confetti rained down.“I can’t believe it. I can’t believe you,” Swift told him. “Oh my God.”In the offseason, “TNT” — as Travis and Taylor are now known — have had a Hot Couple Summer, with Kelce jetting across the pond to support his girlfriend at Eras Tour stops in Amsterdam, Germany and London. He even appeared onstage at Wembley Stadium (she in a white couture gown, he in a black tux and top hat) during her new song “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.”The Chiefs’ offseason, on the other hand, has been anything but glamorous. In April, rookie wide receiver Rashee Rice was arrested after he crashed his Lamborghini while speeding on a busy Dallas freeway, injuring four and abandoning the scene, leaving his playbook behind. In May, kicker Harrison Butker went viral for his comments at a Catholic college’s commencement address that disparaged LGBTQ people and career women. When the team unveiled its diamond-encrusted Super Bowl rings in a glitzy ceremony in June, they had a typo.Now football fans say it’s time to get back to the business of #winning. Some hope for a 3-Peat, a third consecutive Super Bowl victory, which has never happened in NFL history. Others are pining for a “TNT” engagement.“Maybe they will get married,” said Grace Clark, a 9-year-old from Mendon, Mo., who was attending camp for her first time with her family. “Did they already get married?” she asked a groundskeeper, who laughed and said he didn’t think so.“She’s a famous singer. He’s a famous football player. It just works,” Grace declared.“I think they might be secretly engaged already,” said Chelsie Hahn, 27, a first-grade teacher from Liberty, Mo. She’s a lifelong Chiefs fan and saw Swift at the debut show of her Eras Tour last year. For her, Swifties are always welcome in Chiefs Kingdom.“I don’t care as long as they’re supporting my team!” Hahn said. But, she added, “I worry about what will happen if they break up. You don’t want Swifties turning against your Chiefs.”A small knot of fans gathered in the northern end zone. The scrimmage continued for more than two hours. Misting tents offered only scant relief.“This is the longest practice I have ever been to,” sighed Marley Bergen, 15, from Leavenworth, Kan.A few moments later, Kelce obligingly caught a short pass from quarterback Patrick Mahomes just yards away. A cheer went up.Ryan Carter, 34, a construction worker, was following the plays. He’s been watching Chiefs games since he was nearly 4 and is amused by all the new people coming to Chiefs games and events. He can always distinguish the “bandwagoners” and the “die-hard fans.”“A bandwagoner will just yell out ‘Taylor,’ and that’s all they yell,” he said. “I don’t dislike her, but she’s not the one out there on the field.”“She stole my man,” quipped his girlfriend, Amanda Berry, 35, a paralegal from Blue Springs, Mo. “I like her songs as much as the next person, but I’m not a die-hard Swiftie and I’m jealous she got him and I didn’t.”As practice ended, fans surged to the barricade surrounding the field hoping Kelce — who was scheduled to give autographs along with the rest of the receivers — would stop and sign.“Travis! Do it for your girlfriend!” hollered 11-year-old Molly Chambers, a Chiefs flag and Taylor Swift picture book in her hands.Eric Gold, who dates Molly’s mother, Jill Chambers, was nearby blasting “Karma” on a personal speaker, thinking the song — the one in which Swift had modified the lyrics to say “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs …” — would entice Kelce to stop.Alas, no. Kelce sauntered over to the opposite end of the field and greeted fans there. Molly had to content herself with another tight end, Noah Gray, who signed her Chiefs flag and accepted a friendship bracelet.“I did my best,” she told her mother.“You did awesome,” Mom replied."

WaPo_68,Caitlin Clark would get ‘high consideration’ if U.S. team were picked now,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/28/caitlin-clark-team-usa-olympics-dawn-staley/,2024-07-29 04:38:02.944290,,"If Dawn Staley could time travel, the most popular player in the WNBA might just be on Team USA.The decision to leave Clark, whose popularity sent women’s college basketball and the WNBA soaring, off Team USA was met with criticism last month. Staley, a member of the team’s selection committee, told NBC’s Mike Tirico on Sunday that Clark “would be in really high consideration” if the roster were chosen today.“You’re charged with putting together the best team of players, the best talent,” Staley said. “Caitlin is just a rookie in the WNBA, wasn’t playing bad but wasn’t playing like she’s playing now. If we had to do it all over again, the way that she’s playing, she would be in really high consideration of making the team because she is playing head and shoulders above a lot of people — shooting the ball really well.“She is an elite passer, she’s got a great basketball IQ and she’s a little more seasoned [now] in the pro game.”Dawn Staley, a member of the USWNT selection committee, asked about Caitlin Clark.“If we had to do it all over again, the way that she’s playing, she would be in really high consideration of making the team because she is playing head and shoulders above a lot of people.” pic.twitter.com/hMYqTsPWzcThat comment comes a little over a week after Clark and a WNBA all-star team made up of others who were not on the U.S. team, like Angel Reese and Arike Ogunbowale, scored a statement win, beating Team USA, 117-109.In her rookie season with the Indiana Fever, Clark has a number of significant individual accomplishments in addition to the attendance records her team has set. They include a recent game against the Mystics in which she became the first player in the NBA or WNBA to record 29 points, 13 assists, five rebounds, five three-pointers, five steals and three blocks in a game.The Olympic squad was announced June 11, when Clark had not yet fully adjusted to the WNBA. At that point, she was in the midst of a tough stretch of 11 games in 20 days against many of the league’s best teams. In addition to South Carolina’s Staley, a former Team USA coach, the selection committee included three-time Olympian and LSU assistant Seimone Augustus; two-time Olympian and Old Dominion Coach DeLisha Milton-Jones; Connecticut Sun team president Jennifer Rizzotti; and WNBA head of league operations Bethany Donaphin.Asked about what many considered to be a snub, Clark, the No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft, took the high road.“I’m excited for the girls that are on the team,” she told reporters Sunday. “I know it’s the most competitive team in the world, and I know it could have gone either way — of me being on the team or me not being on the team — so I’m excited for them. I’m going to be rooting them on to win gold. I was a kid that grew up watching the Olympics, so it will be fun to watch them.“Honestly, no disappointment. I think it just gives me something to work for. It’s a dream. Hopefully one day I can be there. I think it’s just a little more motivation. You remember that. Hopefully when four years comes back around, I can be there.”The U.S. squad, coached by Cheryl Reeve of the Minnesota Lynx, has no players younger than 26-year-olds Sabrina Ionescu and Jackie Young. The team also features five-time gold medalist Diana Taurasi, Brittney Griner (playing internationally for the first time since her 10-month detainment in Russia in 2022), Breanna Stewart, A’ja Wilson, Napheesa Collier, Kahleah Copper, Jewell Loyd, Alyssa Thomas, Kelsey Plum and Chelsea Gray.Clark said last month that she would welcome the break but planned to “work on things that I want to get better at” — including time in the weight room.“It’s going to be really nice,” she said. “I’ve loved competing every single second, but it’s going to be a great month for my body, first of all, to get rest and get healthy and just get a little time away from basketball and the craziness of everything that’s been going on — just find some peace and quiet for myself.”"

Last week: Manhattan prosecutors filed their response to Trump’s appeal of the guilty verdict, saying the Supreme Court’s immunity decision does not have any bearing on the case.
Trump’s lawyers argued that some evidence from 2017 presented to the jury involved extensions of the then-president’s official duties. Prosecutors disputed that claim and argued that even if the judge agrees with Trump’s lawyers, there is “other overwhelming evidence of defendant’s guilt” that still justifies the verdict.The details: 34 charges connected to a 2016 hush money payment.Why it’s stalled: A jury already found Trump guilty.

We don’t expect much activity until Smith files his appeal by the Aug. 27 deadline.Q: A three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit will be assigned to hear the prosecution’s appeal of Cannon’s decision to dismiss the case. Can that panel of judges decide to boot Cannon from the case — even if neither of the parties ask for that?
A: The threshold for removing a judge from a case is quite high, and an unexpected decision like the one Cannon made is not necessarily grounds to do so.
But technically, yes, the 11th Circuit has supervisory authority over the district judges in its jurisdiction, which includes Cannon’s courthouse. That means that the appeals judges could decide on their own to remove Cannon, according to Jeffrey M. Cohen, an associate professor at Boston College Law School. But Cohen said that would be extremely rare.
“They would rather embarrass her by writing a firm opinion than removing her from the case,” Cohen said. “You want to be kind to the district court.”
It’s more common for one side to request that the judge be removed. A lawyer can argue that a judge is biased, has a pattern of wrongheaded decisions — or has become too immersed in a case and it would benefit from fresh eyes. In 2006, for example, the Justice Department successfully asked an appeals court to remove the judge overseeing a case involving billions in Native American oil and gas royalties, saying the judge seemed biased against the Interior Department.Q: A three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit will be assigned to hear the prosecution’s appeal of Cannon’s decision to dismiss the case.

WaPo_70,The tiniest skateboarder from Tokyo’s Olympics grows tall in Paris,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/28/rayssa-leal-street-skateboarding-paris-olympics/,2024-07-29 04:26:02.944290,,"PARIS — She was a child three years ago standing before the empty seats at the Tokyo Olympics, just 13 years old with a helmet too big for her head and a skateboarding silver medal around her neck. And when Rayssa Leal, Brazil’s tiny street skateboarder, left the stadium that day, she said that all she wanted to do was “go back to being the little girl I am.”On Sunday afternoon, she stood in another street skateboard final in another Olympic stadium, this one in the center of Paris, completely filled with fans, half of them in Brazil’s colors jumping and shouting her name. At 16, she was taller now, with long waving hair and the more defined features of a high-schooler. Brazilian music pounded her earphones. She was down to her last trick, more than 80 points out of third place and another medal. She needed a miracle. She looked up. The Brazilians roared.Later, Leal would say the trick she landed off the railing to win bronze, a kick flip frontside board slide, was one she had never done in competition. She wasn’t sure she wanted to try. But the shouts were so loud, the noise booming around Place de la Concorde, she jumped.And when she landed her skateboard on the ground, still standing upright, the Brazilian fans howled as if she had won the whole event. Her final score of 253.37 was not going to be enough to get her past Japan’s Coco Yoshizawa and Liz Akama, who would win gold and silver. Yet listening to the Brazilians in the crowd, it felt as if her bronze medal was the biggest victory of the day.“The fact they have a Brazilian playing in the Olympics means everything,” she said afterward through an interpreter when asked why so many people from her country had come to this event. “They know if you dream high your dreams can come true.”No sport missed the fans in Tokyo’s pandemic Games more than skateboarding. So much of skateboarding’s vigor comes from noise around it. Tokyo’s empty temporary stadium next to Tokyo Harbor left the sport’s Olympic debut silent and sluggish. Skaters said the vacant seats just never felt right.On Sunday, inside the temporary venue with metal seats in la Concorde and views from the stands of the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe, the Seine and the Grand Palais, the world finally saw how much a crowd matters in Olympic skateboarding.Every time Leal prepared to try a jump or a trick, the Brazilians stood, they waved flags, they jumped, they called her name, They chanted “Brazil, Brazil, Brazil.” At some point during the final, with the sun beating down, they did the wave.“They’re going to run out of green and yellow fabric in Brazil,” the arena announcer shouted on the speaker at one point.When the last trick had been done and it was certain Leal would medal, the fans surged down from the seats, onto the concourse that rings the skateboard park. They chanted, “Rayssa, Rayssa, Rayssa.” She waved. They chanted her name again.Soon the medals were brought into the stadium, and Paris 2024 officials tried to start the ceremony, but rules prohibited them from doing so until the fans were in their seats. The arena announcer shouted for everyone to leave the concourse, but the dancing Brazilians would not listen.Finally, security guards in gray shirts arrived to push into the throng of Brazil fans, ushering them back to their seats. The medals were handed out, Japan’s anthem played, and then the Brazilians surged back onto the concourse, leaning against the railings. Leal held her medal. They shouted. She pulled out a phone and took a selfie with the two Japanese skaters. She laughed. The fans laughed.Then to the horror of the minders who were trying to urge her to leave the stadium, Leal ran up the skate ramps to the edge of the north stands. She slapped hands with the Brazilians, took their phones and snapped selfies. They danced together. She went to the edge of the stands on the south side and did the same thing. She took a Brazil flag and draped it around her shoulders.The roar felt it could go on all night. Almost an hour after the end of the competition, the last Brazilian fan exited the Place de la Concorde. Not long after, Leal went to the tent for another Olympic news conference, three years after the one in Tokyo.Back then, she looked little on the big stage with all the television lights beaming down on her. The answers she gave that day came in a teeny voice. Her words were tentative. The moment felt so huge.On Sunday, she sat straight in her chair, looking like a precocious teenager who has seen the world. She showed Yoshizawa and Akama how to work their earpieces. Someone asked whether she was surprised to “make history at 16.” She smiled at the question.“I think we make history every day in our daily lives,” she said through the interpreter.She leaned back and flipped her hair, the tiniest skateboarder wanting to go back to being a little girl no more."

WaPo_74,U.S. women’s soccer routs Germany to clinch Olympic quarterfinal berth,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/28/us-soccer-germany-women-olympics/,2024-07-29 05:38:02.765913,,"MARSEILLE, France — The United States-Germany women’s soccer match Sunday seemed better suited for the Olympic medal round, not the second day of group play before a small crowd far from the merriment of Paris. Looking away for an instant during an intoxicating first half meant you risked missing something wonderful between teams that have won trophies and admirers for their excellence over decades.During a 45-minute rush of fun featuring four goals, Sophia Smith showed no ill effects from an ankle injury suffered in the opener, scoring twice before intermission as the Americans stormed to a 4-1 victory and a quarterfinal berth.A victory or draw by the Americans (2-0-0) on Wednesday against Australia (1-1-0) in Marseille would secure Group B’s top slot and a quarterfinal place Saturday in Paris. Germany (1-1-0) will face Zambia (0-2-0) in the other match. Two teams will receive automatic berths, and one could advance as a third-place team.Smith opened the scoring in the 10th minute. After Germany drew even, Mallory Swanson scored her third goal in two matches and Smith struck again just before halftime. Lynn Williams, Smith’s late replacement, added an 89th-minute goal.Germany is ranked No. 4, one slot ahead of the United States, which is at its lowest spot since FIFA launched the women’s rankings in 2003. The substandard U.S. showing at the World Cup last year prompted the hiring of Emma Hayes, a renowned British club coach without international experience.After completing her work with Chelsea, Hayes took over in earnest in May. She named several young players to the Olympic squad and left veteran striker Alex Morgan, among others, off it.Her first Olympic test got off to a sensational start against Zambia on Wednesday with three first-half goals before puttering out. Including two tuneup games, the Americans squandered an enormous number of chances against badly overmatched opponents and scored just four goals.Sunday’s first-half breakout came against a German side that had rolled to a 3-0 victory over Australia in its opener.With Smith cleared to play after leaving the opener with a first-half ankle injury, Hayes did not make any changes to the lineup. With her team comfortably ahead of Zambia, Hayes did not want to risk inflaming Smith’s injury and losing a key player for the Germany showdown.Front-line depth is a concern because of small game-day rosters — 18 instead of 23 like at the World Cup — and the absence of Jaedyn Shaw, who was unavailable again with a leg injury.The U.S. defensive unit — featuring defensive midfielder Sam Coffey and the back line of Emily Fox, Naomi Girma, Tierna Davidson and Crystal Dunn — was close to perfect handling Zambia star Barbra Banda. (The 24-year-old striker had a hat trick and an assist in a 6-5 loss to Australia on Sunday.) Germany posed a diversified threat, led by captain Alexandra Popp.The United States had not crossed paths in the Olympics with the 2016 gold medalists since the 2004 Athens Games. It has dominated the series with a 23-5-7 record, but Germany won a 2022 friendly in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and eight of the previous 10 meetings were decided by one goal or ended in a draw.Germany had a brilliant opportunity to crack the match open in the fourth minute after Lindsey Horan’s giveaway in midfield. Alone inside the penalty area, Lea Schüller did not place her shot well enough, allowing Alyssa Naeher to make a fine leg save.Six minutes later, the Americans went ahead on a goal featuring superb buildup and execution. Emily Fox, Trinity Rodman and Rose Lavelle worked the ball on the right side. Lavelle’s pass liberated Rodman flashing past her marker. As Rodman crossed, Swanson’s near-post run caused distraction. On the back side, Smith met the ball for a simple one-timer.Germany answered in the 22nd minute. Pushed forward, right back Giulia Gwinn was afforded time and space to drive a 25-yard shot with perfect placement beyond Naeher’s stretch and into the far corner.The Americans needed just four minutes to reclaim the lead. Smith won the ball beyond the penalty area and ripped a rising shot. Ann-Katrin Berger made a two-handed save but failed to hold the ball or push it out of danger. Swanson got to it first, stabbing the rebound past Berger for her 37th career goal.The U.S. team lost Davidson to an apparent knee injury late in the half. Emily Sonnett entered.As Davidson was making her way to the bench, Smith scored again. Initially, she whiffed on a left-footed one-timer. She stuck with it, pushed the ball along the top of the penalty area and tagged a right-footed shot that caromed off defender Felicitas Rauch, took flight, flew over Berger, hit the right post and spun across the line for her 22nd international goal.Early in the second half, Germany pushed hard. Jule Brand nicked the right post, and Naeher blocked Sjoeke Nüsken inside the six-yard box.The U.S. team regained its composure and saw out the victory. Smith left to a standing ovation in the 85th minute — four minutes before Swanson set up Williams on the left side of the box for an angled shot into the far corner."

Since then, she has been unstoppable as she proved, in routine after routine, that she has worked past the mental block that derailed her three years ago in Tokyo — and that she is still the world’s best gymnast.But during her first competitive performance in Paris, in the qualifying round here Sunday, Biles’s body threatened to thwart her again.This time, it was a physical ailment, rather than the dangerous mind-body disconnect that rattled Biles amid the pressure of the previous Olympics. But it still seemed like déjà vu, with Biles alongside the team doctor as questions lingered about whether the sport’s biggest star would be able to continue.During warmups before floor, Biles felt minor pain in her left calf, a reemergence of an issue from a couple of weeks ago, her coach, Cecile Landi, said afterward. Wrapping her lower leg with tape was enough to help Biles push through. But while she warmed up her vaults soon after, she at one point crawled alongside the runway and hopped on one foot. She then practiced her difficult Yurchenko double pike and landed short, an unusual error for Biles — and a sometimes painful mistake.The uncertainty lingered briefly, palpable in an arena packed with thousands of fans and a few A-list admirers, including Tom Cruise, Ariana Grande and Jessica Chastain. But Landi said finishing Sunday’s competition was never in doubt for Biles, who did not talk with reporters afterward.When it counted, Biles sprinted down the runway and soared off the vault, flipping twice in a pike position. It’s the hardest vault in women’s gymnastics, but Biles makes it look easy — even amid an injury scare. As she headed to bars, “she started to feel better,” Landi said. Biles hit another routine to post a 59.566 all-around total, her second-best mark since Tokyo and the highest score in the qualifying round.Biles’s performance was “pretty amazing,” Landi said, adding that she does not have any concerns about whether Biles will be able to continue competing.Despite the injury and some minor errors, Biles managed to lead the U.S. women through the meet as a steadying force. She stepped out of bounds on floor, just after the calf pain flared up, and she ended up having too much power on vault, despite not rotating enough in warmups, so she took two big steps backward.The other Americans had more nervy moments: All the gymnasts who joined Biles in the beam lineup wobbled on multiple skills, particularly 16-year-old Hezly Rivera in her Olympic debut. And Jade Carey, who said on social media that she hasn’t been feeling well, bailed out of her final tumbling pass on floor, leading to a low score that will keep her from defending her Olympic gold medal on the apparatus.i haven’t been feeling the best the past few days but i gave it everything i had today. thank you for all the support i have received. i’m so grateful ❤️❤️ https://t.co/52r9JtsXkNEven with the mishaps, the U.S. team’s mark of 172.296 led the field and was more than five points ahead of second-place Italy. The Americans will be the heavy favorites to win the team gold Tuesday, particularly given the absence of Russia, a longtime power in gymnastics, whose athletes are banned from team competition here. The athletes from the Russian Olympic Committee won the gold ahead of the Americans in Tokyo after Biles’s withdrawal led to a chaotic team final.In the qualifying round, Sunisa Lee, the reigning Olympic all-around champion, edged Jordan Chiles by less than one-tenth to earn a spot in the all-around final. Though Chiles’s 56.065 was the fourth-best mark overall, countries cannot have more than two gymnasts in each final, and Lee (56.132) narrowly prevailed. Rebeca Andrade of Brazil will be Biles’s top challenger in the final, but she trailed Biles by close to two points in the opening round of competition.Biles, expected to win the all-around gold, will be the headliner each time she competes. But Landi has said that having three other returning Olympians on this team eases the pressure on Biles.And together, the gymnasts have described this Olympics as their “redemption tour.” All four returners — Biles, Lee, Carey and Chiles — have something they want to achieve that they missed out on three years ago, nobody more so than Biles. The injury, no matter how minor, only adds to the curiosity around how Biles will manage this massive spotlight.In her first test, though, Biles excelled. She tallied the best score of the day on vault and floor, as well as the second-best mark on beam. After she finished her final routine, she waved to the crowd and then danced with Chiles to celebrate. The calf issue added uncertainty to Biles’s Olympic quest, which could end with up to five gold medals, but her dominant performance amid the trouble resembled all of her other outings since Tokyo. One after another, Biles’s brilliant routines washed away the concern."
WaPo_77,Police in Montgomery County continue searching for lost autistic child,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/28/missing-autistic-child-gaithersburg-fawzan-hassan/,2024-07-29 06:52:02.721535,,"Six-year-old Fawzan Hassan and his family arrived at a Montgomery County park Saturday afternoon for a community event. The 3-foot tall youngster, who is nonverbal, autistic and loves to climb, hit the playground.“His family looked to the playground,” an assistant police chief said Sunday, “and no longer saw him there.”As of Sunday evening, Fawzan was still missing, despite 27 hours of searching by more than 100 police officers, firefighters and volunteers in and around Bohrer Park in Gaithersburg.“We are committed to locating Fawzan and locating him safety,” Montgomery County Assistant Police Chief Nicholas Augustine said Sunday, speaking a news conference and appealing to help from the public.“We’re hopeful. He could be hunkered down and just scared,” said Montgomery County Police Officer Laurie Reyes, who specializes in working with families of autistic children and helping find them when they go missing.Fawzan, who weighs 42 pounds, was last seen wearing a green shirt, blue jeans and white and silver sneakers.Bohrer Park is bordered by neighborhoods on the southwest and southeast sides; by Frederick Avenue  on the northeast side; and by Gaithersburg High School on the northwest side.Police urged residents in the area to diligently search their property, including under porches and decks, and inside unlocked cars and sheds.Officers warned people not to approach the child because he may run away but to instead call 911.People with autism who go missing often are drawn to bodies of water,  Reyes said. The Montgomery County Fire and Rescue Service searched ponds in the area on Saturday and Sunday, said Pete Piringer, an agency spokesman.Officers with the Montgomery County Police Department, Gaithersburg Police Department, Maryland State Police and Maryland-National Capital Park Police have helped in the search, officials said. Drones with infrared sensing technology were flown over the area into the night.Police officials encouraged residents to print out a Missing Child flier for Fawzan from the department’s social media pages and hang it up in the Gaithersburg area. When in stores, Augustine said, people should check dressing rooms and bathrooms. Those driving down the road should call police if they see a young child sitting alone.“We’re asking for everyone’s help to come together to locate Fawzan safely,” Augustine said.Montgomery police offered this advice when approaching nonverbal Autistic children:It is important to approach them calmly and slowly; avoid making sudden movements or loud noises that might startle them. Speak in a gentle, reassuring tone, even if the child does not respond verbally. Nonverbal autistic children might not respond to their name, so try to use other cues, such as visual signals or familiar objects, to get their attention.Most importantly, police said, ensure the child’s safety and wait for law enforcement to arrive.More information can be found at the Department’s Autism/Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD), Alzheimer’s and Dementia Outreach Unit."
WaPo_78,Mark Meadows takes bid to toss Georgia election charges to Supreme Court,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/07/28/mark-meadows-georgia-supreme-court/,2024-07-29 06:34:02.721535,,"ATLANTA — Mark Meadows, Donald Trump’s former White House chief of staff, took his battle to throw out the Georgia election interference case against him to the U.S. Supreme Court, asking the high court to overturn a lower-court ruling that rejected claims that his alleged conduct was tied to his official federal duties.The move comes more than seven months after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit upheld a lower-court ruling from September that found Meadows had not proved his alleged conduct charged as part of the sweeping criminal racketeering case was related to his official duties as Trump’s most senior White House aide.Meadows’ petition to the Supreme Court, dated Friday, sharply criticizes the 11th Circuit decision, describing it as “the first court ‘in the 190-year history of the federal officer removal statute’ to hold that the statute offers no protection to former federal officers facing suit for acts taken while in office.”The filing contends the appellate decision was “egregiously wrong, wholly unprecedented, and exceptionally dangerous” and points to the Supreme Court’s recent decision granting Trump immunity for official presidential acts in his federal election interference case as reason for the court to intervene in Meadows’ case. The Washington Post obtained the petition, which was first reported by CNN.“That decision makes clear that federal immunity fully protects former officers, often requires difficult and fact-intensive judgment calls at the margins, and provides not just a substantive immunity but a use immunity that protects against the use of official acts to try to hold a current or former federal officer liable for unofficial acts,” the filing states. “All of those sensitive disputes plainly belong in federal court.”Meadows was indicted along with Trump and 17 others in August on charges they illegally conspired to try to overturn Trump’s 2020 election loss in Georgia. Meadows, who has pleaded not guilty, had sought to move his case to federal court, claiming protections under a federal statute that allows federal officials to move legal cases against them from state to federal court when the charges are tied to official duties.A three-judge appellate court heard oral arguments in December on the issue and appeared skeptical of Meadows claims that his alleged actions outlined in the Fulton County indictment were tied to his official government duties.In a Dec. 18 opinion written by Chief Judge William Pryor, a noted conservative jurist, the panel rejected Meadows’ arguments, writing the federal removal statute “does not apply to former federal officers, and even if it did, the events giving rise to this criminal action were not related to Meadows’s official duties.”Meadows’ attorneys later asked the full 11th circuit appellate bench to reconsider, but the request was denied.The appeal comes three months after Meadows and other several other Trump allies were indicted in Arizona on similar charges of seeking to overturn Trump’s 2020 loss in that state. Meadows pleaded not guilty to those charges in June.The developments come as the Georgia election case is largely on pause, as Trump, Meadows and several other co-defendants seek to overturn a ruling allowing Fulton County District Attorney Fani T. Willis (D) to continue prosecuting the case amid claims she had an improper romantic relationship with the now-former lead prosecutor on the case.That appeal is now pending before the Georgia Court of Appeals, which has scheduled oral arguments for Dec. 5 — a month after the November election."
WaPo_79,Torri Huske steals the show with a shocking gold in the 100 butterfly,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/28/torri-huske-gold-medal-paris-olympics-100-butterfly/,2024-07-29 06:31:02.721535,,"NANTERRE, France — The story of 100 meters can’t really be explained in 55.59 seconds. Certainly not in 0.04 seconds, and definitely not in 0.01 seconds. Three years? Maybe. A lifetime? We’re getting closer.So forgive Torri Huske for poking her head out of the water and looking a little stunned when she spotted the scoreboard on the opposite side of Paris La Défense Arena on Sunday night. It was a lot to take in. Just three years after she missed the podium by a hair, Huske’s name was atop all the others, making her the surprise Olympic champion in the women’s 100-meter butterfly. She leaned against the pool wall, mouth agape, eyes welling. “Just very surreal,” she would say later.Missing out on an Olympic medal by 0.01 seconds was unbelievable.Winning Olympic gold by 0.04 seconds? Incredible.“I didn’t know how to process it,” said Huske, a 21-year-old from Arlington, Va. “It’s just very overwhelming when you’ve been dreaming of this moment for so long.”Huske edged U.S. teammate Gretchen Walsh, the world record holder, at the wall on a memorable night at the pool that was filled with pageantry, fireworks and joyful tears. With Leon Marchand swimming his first final of the Games, it felt as though all of France had crammed into the arena for the men’s 400 individual medley. The swim meet morphed into a boisterous, patriotic party when he won gold in 4:02.95, nearly six seconds better than Japan’s Tomoyuki Matsushita (4:08.62) and American Carson Foster (4:08.66), who took bronze.There was no shortage of highlights: American swimmers bagged four medals as chief rival Australia failed to find the podium. Nic Fink, a 31-year-old engineer from New Jersey, won silver in the men’s 100-meter breaststroke; he tied Britain’s Adam Peaty, the two-time Olympic champion, in 59.05 seconds, just 0.02 behind Italy’s Nicolò Martinenghi.The raucous crowd was still celebrating Marchand’s performance when Huske and Walsh stepped to the starting blocks. The fans were expecting a world record. They were not expecting Huske to steal the show.Walsh, a 21-year-old University of Virginia star, had the slowest reaction time off the blocks, but it didn’t matter. One night after she set the Olympic record in the semifinals, Walsh burst out of the water and blasted across the pool. She was first at the turn, needing all of 25.40 seconds to cover the first 50 meters.Huske was third, but Walsh was very much in control. It wasn’t until the final 10 or 15 meters that Huske appeared to be reeling in the world record holder. The margin shrank with each stroke, and when Huske touched the wall and saw the red light in her lane came on a nanosecond before the others, time seemed to stop entirely.“I felt like I was hyperventilating a little bit maybe,” Huske said. “I felt like my body had a reaction. I couldn’t control anything that was going on it. It was all happening so fast.”It was nothing like the Olympic race three years ago. In Tokyo, Huske was second at the turn but was passed in a mad dash to the wall, where the naked eye had no chance sorting out the winner. Huske finished fourth, 0.01 seconds off the podium.She was disappointed to be so close. But also — she was so close.“The goal didn’t change,” said Greg Meehan, her coach at Stanford. “… She was a hundredth off of a medal, but she was also only [0.14] off of a gold medal — her motivation never wanes. It was kind of easy to get right back into it.”“I’m not going to lie — that was devastating,” Huske recalled Sunday night. “But I think that really fueled me. I think that did make me better.”The struggles were also lessons. A year later at the world championships in Budapest, she broke through and won the 100 fly and claimed five other medals. But then she was slower at last year’s worlds in Fukuoka, Japan, finishing third in the 100 fly. She took a break from school to focus on Paris preparations.The result: She arrived here a better athlete and a smarter swimmer, with a new perspective on what it takes to reach the wall first.“I don’t know why, but I think I was a little bit naive last time going into it,” she said. “Like: ‘I’m on Team USA; Team USA always medals. I will get a medal. I will get my hand on that wall, and I will be on that podium.’ It’s a lot tougher than that.”She worked with Meehan on race strategy and knew she needed to close stronger. An Olympic champion must put together a complete race.On Sunday night, she had to chase down the best and covered the last 50 meters in 29.98 seconds, finishing with a gold medal-winning time of 55.59. Walsh, the heavy favorite after her otherworldly performances at the U.S. trials, covered the last half in 30.23 seconds, taking silver in 55.63.“I was definitely nervous before,” Walsh said. “There was a lot of pressure on me, just getting the world record [last month], the Olympic record last night. And I just wanted to try to execute the race as best I could.”Huske’s tear-filled reaction in the pool lit up the crowd and caught her teammates by surprise.“Torri never, never gets emotional like that,” said Lilly King, a breaststroke star who was preparing for her semifinal. “So I was definitely trying to keep it together before my race.”Walsh and Huske took in the celebration together. They were teammates on the 4x100-meter freestyle relay team that won silver Saturday. With new medals hanging around their necks, they stood side by side on the top platform as the national anthem played. Huske’s eyes welled up again before the twilight’s last gleaming.Afterward, she shared an emotional moment with Meehan, then found her family and friends from Virginia, exchanging tear-filled hugs with her mother, Ying; her father, Jim; plus classmates from Yorktown High and family friends. They all made the trip to Paris, and they all knew the path to the podium was a long, winding story.“It was a really hard road,” she said, “but I had an amazing support system.”"
WaPo_80,"Vice-presidential wannabes parade for the cameras, and Harris campaign",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/28/walz-buttigieg-kelly-harris-vice-president/,2024-07-29 06:13:02.721535,,"The time-honored American tradition of the vice-presidential audition period is here.If you turned on your television this weekend — mainly cable news, of course — you would have a difficult time not seeing it: a parade of Democrats vying, fairly overtly, to join Kamala Harris on the presidential ticket. These would-be running mates are mainly White men, a demographic some believe Harris should choose from because she is the first Black woman likely to be nominated to a major party ticket.The possible No. 2s include Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who joined CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday to talk about why he has labeled Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), “weird”; and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who guested on “Fox News Sunday” in his personal capacity, arguing that Trump is “older and stranger” than he used to be.Walz and Buttigieg are partaking in the not-so-subtle campaign of running to be the running mate, an exercise that’s been honed by prospective vice-presidential candidates, with varying degrees of success, throughout modern political history. From operating covert draft operations to appearing on a nominee’s favorite morning show, those on the veep shortlist are tasked with selling themselves, their record and their ability to effectively message — all without looking too thirsty or desperate.This year’s crop of possible running mates is not shy, and their cases are being made especially publicly because of the abbreviated picking season given the sudden emergence of Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket following President Biden’s announcement he would not seek reelection just a week ago. The vice-presidential contenders are blitzing the airwaves and campaign trail to showcase their credentials and try on the role of Harris’s No. 2.Over the weekend, Walz, Buttigieg and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker appeared on Sunday television shows, while Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear (D) and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro hit the campaign trail to stump on behalf of Harris.In his TV hit, Walz coyly declined to say whether he had received vetting materials after forcefully defending his record in a state where Trump and Vance attended a rally the day before.“What a monster,” Walz said during his CNN appearance, responding facetiously to potential attacks on him as a big-government liberal. “Kids are eating and having a full belly so they can go learn and women are making their own health-care decisions. And we’re a top-five business state and we also rank in the top three of happiness.”Over on Fox, Buttigieg made the case that voters shared his concerns about Trump’s age and mental acuity, a day after telling the New York Times that he didn’t think it was “appropriate” to say whether he would be a good vice president or wanted to be vice president.Harris is considering roughly a dozen vice-presidential candidates. But three Democrats have risen to the top, The Washington Post has previously reported, including Shapiro, Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D). Kelly and Cooper appear to have kept a low profile over the weekend, not making the Sunday show circuit.The unprecedented timeline for settling on a No. 2 has turbocharged the search for Harris’s replacement as the party’s vice-presidential nominee, as she is well on her way to the Democratic presidential nod after locking up over two-thirds of the delegates needed to become the official nominee over the course of her week-long candidacy. Those involved with the process cautioned that the search is in its early stages — though Harris is expected to make a decision by Aug. 7, in line with the Democratic Party’s plans to nominate a ticket virtually.Harris made her own headlines over the weekend when she announced Sunday morning that she had raised $2o0 million since entering the race, two-thirds of it from first-time donors.Several of the contenders deployed a new line of attack against Trump and Vance, adopted by Harris in recent comments and campaign statements: Trump and Vance are “just plain weird,” an attack on the Republican ticket that Walz debuted.“They’re just weird, I mean they really are,” Pritzker said on ABC News’ “This Week,” calling out Trump for being “afraid of windmills” and Vance for advocating for higher tax rates for childless adults.Buttigieg, who also appeared on MSNBC on Sunday, argued that Vance’s “weird or insulting” characterization of the Democratic Party as “childless cat ladies” also leads to “weird policies,” referencing Vance’s 2021 proposal to bolster the political power of families by giving parents the ability to cast  votes on behalf of their children.Though not on the Sunday shows, Shapiro rallied for Harris in central Pennsylvania on Saturday before hundreds of voters. Ticking through the vice president’s record, Shapiro argued that she was well-positioned to lead the country and defeat Trump, and warned voters of what would happen if Trump returned to the White House.“Y’all go crack open that Project 2025,” said Shapiro, referencing a 900-page blueprint for a second Trump term put together by former — and likely future — leaders of the Trump administration. “That is chock-full of some crazy ideas, some dangerous ideas, but ideas that he plans to carry forth if he is given the keys to the White House again.”Beshear, the twice-elected Democratic governor of a deep-red state, delivered a keynote address at the Iowa Democratic Party’s Liberty & Justice Celebration on Saturday night where he sang Harris’s praises before heading to Forsyth County, Ga., on Sunday morning to headline a campaign event for her. Beshear has also repeatedly attacked Vance for trying to profit off Kentuckians with his novel “Hillbilly Elegy” and for misrepresenting Appalachians.“JD Vance is a phony, a fake,” Beshear said on CNN’s “The Source” last week. “The problem is JD Vance has no conviction, but I guess the problem is his running mate has 34.”Some options from different demographic backgrounds have been mentioned as potential options to join Harris on the ticket, including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. Both have shut down claims that voters are not ready for two women on the ticket.But the conventional political wisdom that has crystallized is that if Harris — the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India — wants to win, she’d be wise to pick a counterweight to broaden her appeal to voters: in other words, a white man from a swing state.That wisdom has spawned a flood of memes since Harris emerged as the likely Democratic nominee. “Who will the VP be?” a user posted on X, the website formerly known as Twitter, atop a picture of a “white mystery” Airheads candy. “Kamala’s VP options”: another user posted to describe a picture of an array of white paint samples labeled “Trustworthy Whites: 40 of our best whites.”If there is one criteria that Democrats have started to coalesce around, it’s that Harris could benefit from picking a candidate from one of the swing states that are likely to decide the election.Last week, the Arizona Democratic Party endorsed Kelly for vice president, the Philadelphia Democratic Party endorsed Shapiro, and the North Carolina Democratic Party endorsed Cooper. Asked about the trend Sunday, Pritzker conceded that “winning those battleground states is most important” — but not definitive, he added.“But I think we’ve seen over the last decades that who you pick as your vice president doesn’t determine whether you’re going to win a state or not,” he said. “What it does determine is whether you’ve got the message right across the board.”"

WaPo_82,"With Vance’s rocky debut, Republicans ask if Trump’s VP bet will pay off",https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/07/28/vance-debut-rocky/,2024-07-29 06:06:02.721535,,"Until the very end, some people close to Donald Trump tried to talk the former president out of picking Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) as his running mate.Aboard Trump’s plane en route to Milwaukee for the Republican National Convention, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) argued that Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) would be better than the untested Vance because the Cuban American senator might attract more votes in battleground states. He tried to recruit others on Trump’s plane to support his position, according to people with knowledge of the discussions.Another adviser argued in a phone call a couple of days earlier that Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) or Rubio would be a better choice because of Vance’s previous comments opposing abortion, asking Trump how he would defend some of the senator’s positions that seemed further to the right than his.An array of senators, donors, conservative media personalities and other supporters called Trump in the final 48 hours before the announcement, lobbying for Rubio or someone other than Vance because they said other candidates could attract additional voters to Trump’s coalition, according to five people familiar with the talks who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.Trump listened as each person made their case, but they said the former president said his gut had been with Vance for many weeks, if not months — liking his Rust Belt upbringing, foreign and economic policy positions, pugnacious TV appearances and academic pedigree. Vance had influential backers, including Donald Trump Jr. and tech billionaires.Trump later said choosing Vance was a difficult pick, likening it to “The Apprentice,” his former reality television show, in a meeting with Florida’s delegates in Milwaukee. But Trump said it was partially about securing the future of the Republican Party after he was gone. “He is going to be a superstar in the future,” Trump told the Florida delegates huddled inside the Baird Center, according to an attendee.Whether that bet — one of the most consequential Trump will make this year — pays off remains unclear. In the nearly two weeks since, President Biden has dropped out of the race and Vice President Harris is now the likely Democratic nominee, energizing Democrats. Vance, meanwhile, had a rocky first full week on the campaign trail since departing the convention, attracting unwanted attention to the Republican ticket.The Trump campaign has spent the past week trying to clean up after Vance’s controversial comments, including previous interviews in which he mocked “childless cat ladies” or took a position on abortion much stronger than Trump’s.In addition, previous emails between Vance and a friend reported by the New York Times show Vance saying he hated the police because they mistreated people, calling Trump a “morally reprehensible human being” and saying that “the more white people feel like voting for Trump, the more Black people will suffer.” A Trump adviser called the emails “not ideal.”Vance has come under attack from friendly quarters, as well, including the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial board, social media personality Dave Portnoy and conservative media star Ben Shapiro. Some question the vetting from Trump’s team and are asking if picking Vance could now backfire.Some Republican strategists said they fear Vance could hurt the ticket with suburban women — a group where Trump saw significant erosion in his 2020 loss after his 2016 win. Among Trump allies, there has been “constant discussion about whether the president made a bad choice,” according to one longtime adviser. Text message chains have blown up with his “awkward public appearances,” the person said.Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung defended Vance’s performance as Trump’s running mate. He said the criticism is “nothing more than musings from out-of-touch individuals who have no idea what’s going on. They are so out of the loop, they might as well be living in a different universe.”Trump’s campaign aides say the former president remains confident in Vance. The two appeared together at a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago Thursday evening and at a Minnesota rally Saturday. Vance flew to Oklahoma City on Friday, where he headlined a fundraiser with oil baron Harold Hamm that was said to have raised more than $2 million. He is expected to keep a busy travel schedule — both appearing in Midwestern states and raising money. The campaign has also been pleased with Vance’s sharp attacks against Harris in recent speeches.“President Trump is thrilled with the choice he made with Senator Vance to be his running mate, and they are the perfect team to take back the White House,” Cheung said. “Meanwhile, Democrats are in complete disarray after their coup that forcibly removed Biden from the campaign, proving they are the real threats to democracy.”Trump was aware, advisers said, that Vance had been critical of him in the past. People familiar with the vetting said that Trump’s team was aware of some, but not all, of his previous comments that have drawn attention — and expect more revelations to come. Top advisers to Trump watched many of his previous interviews, read his book, “Hillbilly Elegy,” and asked him questions, along with a more formal paperwork process, a Trump adviser said.“A thorough and exhaustive vetting obviously took place and there was no doubt Senator Vance was absolutely qualified to be the next Vice President of the United States. In politics, people usually cower in fear and curl up in a ball when things get tough. Not Senator Vance and certainly not President Trump,” Cheung said.Kevin Madden, a spokesman for Mitt Romney’s presidential campaigns, said the Trump-Vance campaign appears to have been “caught flat footed with past comments.”“Every single day on a presidential campaign, you are getting a political colonoscopy,” Madden said. “But what’s compounded here in this case, we’re talking about a 39-year-old who is one-third of the way through his Senate term and that’s why you’re seeing the sort of bumpy start.”The particularly rough start for Vance has come as a welcome surprise for the Harris campaign, according to a Harris aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private conversations. Although they had expected Vance to face some questions over his past critiques of Trump, the Harris team had not expected some of the harsh internet buzz.“We did not expect we would have cat lady news cycles,” the aide said. “This is organically happening without us pushing. … I’ve never seen anything like it. It’s so weird.”The Harris campaign has tried to highlight other past comments, such as Vance’s positions on abortion — an issue Trump has often sought to avoid and that polls show is a vulnerability for Republicans with the general electorate. People close to the Harris campaign say the selection of Vance makes the arguments easier.KamalaHQ, the Harris campaign’s rapid-response X account, has repeatedly posted old Vance content. In one video clip from a 2021 talk about no-fault divorces, Vance says that divorces, even after domestic abuse, maybe “worked out for the moms and dads, though I’m skeptical. But it really didn’t work out for the kids of those marriages.”In an audio clip from a 2022 podcast, Vance advocates for a “federal response” to restrict women traveling across state lines for abortions. And in a 2016 video of Vance on the speaking circuit after his book release, he says Trump is “a really bad candidate and frankly I think he’s a really bad person.”Vance has said those clips about policy positions were taken out of context and that his position on Trump has evolved since he saw Trump in action as president.Vance has drawn significant mockery and derision for having said on Fox News in 2021 that women politicians like Harris who haven’t given birth are “childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives.” He added that they have “no direct stake” in America’s future.Vance went on Megyn Kelly’s show and tried to clarify these previous comments. “I’ve got nothing against cats. I’ve got nothing against dogs. I’ve got one dog at home and I love him,” he said. “People are focusing so much on the sarcasm and not on the substance of what I actually said, and the substance of what I said, Megyn — I’m sorry, it is true. It is true that we’ve become anti-family. It is true that the left has become anti-child.”Vance spokesman William Martin said it was “no surprise” that Democrats were attacking Vance and that Vance was planning instead to highlight the Biden administration’s record on inflation and immigration. “Those are the issues voters actually care about, no matter how much the leftwing media wishes otherwise,” Martin said.Vance was pushed by Trump Jr., the former president’s eldest son, and a range of influential others, including tech billionaires such as Elon Musk and media personalities such as Tucker Carlson.One of Trump’s goals in the pick was to have a candidate with Midwest roots who could “camp out” in states like Pennsylvania and talk to blue-collar voters. Trump is underperforming with White men and Vance could help shore up that base, advisers say.Another goal was to tap into Vance’s significant donor network, including in Silicon Valley. And Trump liked Vance on television, advisers said.“JD’s book is number one on Amazon right now. People are paying him to read his life story. The Harris campaign will have to pay TV networks and social media platforms to tell her life story,” said Justin Sayfie, a Florida lobbyist who has raised money for Trump.David Urban, a longtime Trump ally in Pennsylvania, said he believed Vance’s personal story would resonate with blue-collar voters.“If he goes and says to people at a town hall, or at a rally, how many people have been affected by drugs and alcohol? How many people in this crowd have worked two or three jobs and feel like they can’t get ahead? How many people in this crowd have joined the military to further yourself?” Urban said.So far, Vance has received warm, if far smaller, welcomes than Trump.One of the first bumps in the campaign trail came as early as Vance’s rally Monday in his hometown of Middletown, Ohio. The auditorium of the high school he attended filled with a few hundred people, including those he had known from childhood — among them his mother and beloved math teacher — chanting “J-D!”When an audience member shouted at Vance about requiring identification to vote, the candidate, new to the national stage, got distracted. The diatribe that followed became the most watched moment from the whole event.“It is the weirdest thing to me, Democrats say that it is racist to believe — well, they say it’s racist to do anything. I had a Diet Mountain Dew yesterday and one today; I’m sure they’re going to call that racist, too,” he said.Greg Hieser, 68, watched the event and said he still believed Trump and Vance would win — even if he had some misgivings about Vance’s speaking style.“He’s still green about it,” Hieser said, “but he’ll get the hang of it.”"

WaPo_84,"For fencer Lauren Scruggs, an Olympic silver and a piece of history",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/28/lee-kiefer-lauren-scruggs-fencing-paris-olympics/,2024-07-29 07:32:02.850358,,"PARIS — If his life had not made other plans, Peter Westbrook would have been here Sunday inside Grand Palais. He would have watched Lauren Scruggs, a young woman he loves, fence under the nave and glass ceiling and make the kind of history he once did.Westbrook has stage-four liver cancer, so he cannot be around crowds. The first Black man from the United States to win an Olympic fencing medal stayed home. He watched on television with his wife as Scruggs — 40 years after his achievement — became the first Black woman from the United States to win an Olympic fencing medal.Westbrook’s condition comes with doctor’s orders: He is not supposed to move in a way that jostles his liver. That would not stop him.“Hell, no,” Westbrook said by phone Sunday night, chuckling at the question. “I did jumping jacks.”A rising senior at Harvard from Queens, Scruggs won the silver medal in the women’s foil at the Paris Olympics. After her semifinal victory clinched a medal, Scruggs covered her face with her right arm, one of the few moments of stillness all day. She fenced with audacity and performed with sheer confidence, setting the terms against bigger, more experienced opponents, screaming after points and exhorting family members in the crowd.Scruggs lost only to fellow American Lee Kiefer, who defended her gold medal from Tokyo with a 15-6 victory in the final. Before Kiefer claimed gold at the Tokyo Olympics, the United States had never won an individual medal in the women's foil. Sunday, Americans took gold and silver. Kiefer became the second American woman after Mariel Zagunis to win two fencing golds.Scruggs made the kind of history that could have lasting impact. Westbrook recalled more Black men entering the sport after he won his bronze medal at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. He sees the same effect coming after Scruggs’s triumph. “They tried fencing because of me,” Westbrook said. “They’re going to try fencing because of Lauren.”“Fencing has largely certainly been a non-Black sport,” Scruggs said. “I hope that people who look like me, girls who look like me, feel they have a place in this sport.”Scruggs started fencing at about age 7. Her brother, Nolen, loved “Star Wars” as a kid and viewed fencing as his way to duel with a lightsaber. Their mother spotted an ad for a local club and signed him up. Nolen wanted to quit after a few lessons, but their mother already had paid for the equipment and wouldn’t allow it. Scruggs kept tagging along.Scruggs realized she was good right away. Today, she views the barriers to expanding the pool of fencers as both financial and cultural. It is an expensive sport associated with prep schools and the Ivy League. Black kids who sign up at a club may not see people who look like them.“From a young age, I really had to prove myself to get respect,” Scruggs said. “It’s the little things. Maybe no one’s cheering for you, things like that.”As she won tournaments, her stepdad, who is White, contacted Westbrook through her coach, Sean McClain. In Westbrook’s recollection, Scruggs’s stepfather wanted Westbrook to provide a Black male influence for her.Westbrook accepted Scruggs into the Peter Westbrook Foundation, which Westbrook started in 1991 to support and mentor underrepresented youth through fencing. More than 4,000 kids have come through the program, which touts a 100-percent graduation rate. Scruggs still returns every Saturday when she is home from Harvard to volunteer and coach. When she walked onto the piste Sunday morning, Scruggs became the 17th Olympian produced by Westbrook’s foundation.Through Scruggs was an Olympic rookie, she arrived with a full resume. She won the 2020 junior world championship and the 2023 NCAA championship. She has made all-American all three years of her college career and entered the Olympics ranked 11th in the world.Just 21, Scruggs refused to back down. She attacked every match, every point with confidence derived from growing up in New York City. She locked in before bouts by blasting music in her headphones. She danced across the piste in bright red shoes. During one timeout, she sipped a bottle of Coca Cola — “sugar and caffeine,” she said.In the round of 16, Scruggs beat Canadian Jessica Guo, the Harvard teammate who beat her in the NCAA title match this year. After she won, Scruggs slashed the air with her weapon, then pressed her face into a television camera on the corner of the piste and screamed into the lens. In her boldness, Scruggs carried Westbrook’s presence to Paris.“A lot of the energy you saw tonight is the energy he tells us to bring at the tournaments,” Scruggs said. “He’s a very energetic guy. A lot of charisma and machismo. So I brought that energy today. I was thinking him about him while I was fencing.”For a moment, it appeared Scruggs had been eliminated. In a heart-racing quarterfinal, Scruggs seized an 8-2 lead over world No. 2 Arianna Errigo of Italy, then watched it wither to 14-14. The next point would win. Scruggs and Errigo lunged at one another, and as is constantly the case in fencing, it was unclear who struck first. The judge awarded Errigo the match.Scruggs pulled off her mask and pointed at the replay screen on an end wall, certain the attack had been hers. Errigo celebrated, equally certain. Judges reviewed the point. The head referee brought the fencers to the center and notified them they had reversed the call. Errigo dropped to her knees and shrieked at the judges. Scruggs dropped her mask and raised her foil, pacing toward the far corner where her family was sitting.The victory pushed Scruggs to an epic stage. When introduced during the medal rounds, fencers emerged from behind an arched wooden door, waved their weapons from a gilded balcony and traipsed 50 steps down a curved staircase made of stone. They walked through a tunnel to a piste under a spotlight, 150 feet beneath the great glass dome. When a fencer scored, neon lights on their side of the floor glowed.In the semifinal, Scruggs dominated Canadian Eleanor Harvey. After fencing to a 5-5 tie, Scruggs won seven straight points and won, 15-9. Scruggs pulled off her mask. She had clinched a medal, one that one man understood more than anyone else could.“When you do something like that, man, there’s so many layers,” Westbrook said. “You do it for your country. You do it for your sport. You do it for Black people. You’re uplifting so many different levels.”At the medal ceremony, Scruggs stood on the podium and placed her right hand over her heart. She stared at the American flag as the “Star-Spangled Banner” played. She had won a medal that may inspire people who look like her to follow. She had uplifted a sick man she knows well and loves very much.“Oh, my gosh,” Westbrook said from back in New York. “I’m just so proud.”"
WaPo_85,"DJ Herz feels a breeze, but Nats fall short of a sweep in St. Louis",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/28/dj-herz-nationals-cardinals/,2024-07-29 07:27:02.850358,,"ST. LOUIS — DJ Herz doesn’t have elite velocity. His fastball averages a little under 94 mph — good enough to get him to the major leagues but unlikely to wow anyone with a radar gun these days.Yet that’s what made his outing in the Washington Nationals’ 4-3 loss Sunday afternoon at Busch Stadium all the more impressive. Many of the St. Louis Cardinals’ swings made it appear Herz was throwing 100. No matter how many times he attacked with his fastball, the Cardinals almost always were a tad late.Herz struck out eight in five innings and was in line to earn the win after James Wood tripled and former Cardinal Juan Yepez drove him in with a sacrifice fly to break a 2-2 tie in the sixth. But the Cardinals responded with a run in the seventh before Paul Goldschmidt slugged a walk-off homer against Dylan Floro, who hadn’t allowed a home run since September, in the ninth.“A hitter like Goldschmidt, I’ve faced him quite a few times,” said Floro, whose 2-2 sinker got too much of the plate. “He kind of knows, has an idea, and when I don’t execute a pitch, that’s what’s going to happen.”Floro entered in the seventh but threw just 10 pitches before the ninth, so Manager Dave Martinez stuck with him instead of going with closer Kyle Finnegan. The loss denied the Nationals (49-57) a sweep of the Cardinals (54-51), but they still won the series after getting swept by San Diego at home. And they got a strong performance from their rookie left-hander, who has allowed two runs in each of his two outings since the all-star break.“[Herz] didn’t rely on his off-speed stuff,” Martinez said. “He got ahead and stayed with the fastball, which was good. Our [scouting] reports were to try to get the ball up on some of these guys, and he did a great job, especially those lefties. … He was very, very effective.”In the first inning, Herz allowed a second-deck solo homer to Willson Contreras. Pedro Pagés followed with an RBI triple in the second to extend the Cardinals’ lead to 2-0. The Nationals answered in the third when CJ Abrams hit an RBI groundout before Lane Thomas laced a double down the left field line to even the score. By that time, Herz noticed his fastball had extra life on it.“I could feel it out of the hand. I could see it,” he said. “... I told [catcher Riley Adams], and then we kind of rode with it. Pretty much majority fastball, and when we needed to flip in an off-speed or a change-up, we did.”Entering Sunday, Herz had induced whiffs on 32.1 percent of swings at his fastball, a very strong mark. But he was better than usual Sunday: Of the 79 pitches Herz threw, 49 were fastballs. The Cardinals swung at 27 of the fastballs and whiffed on 15. Six of his strikeouts came on the pitch.Herz seemed to get better as his outing rolled along — he struck out the side in the third and fifth innings and retired 10 of the final 11 batters he faced. His change-up — typically his best pitch — and his slider were effective, too. He finished his outing by striking out Masyn Winn with a slider.The Nationals optioned out Herz ahead of the all-star break to get extra bullpen help — and to give him a breather. He threw 111⅓ innings a season ago, including a stint in the Arizona Fall League. After Sunday, he is up to 80⅔ this season.As the Nationals head down the stretch, Martinez has reiterated that his team will be careful with its young pitchers while also pushing them to pitch the whole year. He has hinted at a six-man rotation. He said he’s limiting Herz to 80 pitches (or five innings) as he builds him up after the all-star break. But Herz will have every opportunity to prove he’s worthy of being in the rotation beyond this season.“I’m getting ahead. I’m attacking. I’m being efficient,” he said. “That’s all the things I want to see for myself, and that’s their main goals for me. ”On Sunday morning, the Nationals announced they acquired right-hander Tyler Stuart from the New York Mets for outfielder Jesse Winker. Stuart, 24, has spent this season with the Mets’ Class AA affiliate, where he had a 3.96 ERA in 17 starts.The Mets selected him in the sixth round of the 2022 draft out of Southern Mississippi, where he primarily was a reliever. As a pro, he has made 41 appearances — 40 of them starts — with a 3.09 ERA. Stuart, who stands 6-foot-9, uses a fastball, slider, change-up and cutter. His slider is considered his best pitch."
WaPo_86,Autistic child found dead in Maryland pond after 26-hour search,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/28/missing-autistic-child-gaithersburg-fawzan-hassan/,2024-07-29 07:37:02.850358,,"Six-year-old Fawzan Hassan and his family arrived at a Montgomery County park Saturday afternoon for a community event. The 3-foot tall youngster, who is nonverbal, autistic and loves to climb, hit the playground.“His family looked to the playground,” an assistant police chief said, “and no longer saw him there.”A day later, after frantic searching from police officers, firefighters, volunteers and family members, the worst outcome arrived at 5:25 p.m. Sunday. The body of a child surfaced on a nearby pond. Police soon confirmed the death and  said it was Fawzan.“Our hearts go out to the family,” said Shiera Goff, a Montgomery County Police spokeswoman, speaking Sunday evening after police had led a 26-hour search of the area. “We all had been hoping for a different outcome.”Lt. Kristina Hedgepeth said watching children is always difficult, and only more so when children have special needs.“It’s a tough thing to say to anyone in this situation,” Hedgepeth said, “but I just know as a parent myself, you’re head’s got to be on a swivel. You have to constantly be watching. And it’s even harder when you have a child with special needs.”More than 100 police officers, firefighters and volunteers had spent more than a day searching in and around Bohrer Park in Gaithersburg. Officials who called a news conference earlier Sunday  struck a confident tone.“We are committed to locating Fawzan and locating him safety,” Montgomery County Assistant Police Chief Nicholas Augustine said Sunday, appealing to help from the public as the search was extended outward from the park.“He could be hunkered down and just scared,” said Montgomery County Police Officer Laurie Reyes, who specializes in working with families of autistic children and helping find them when they go missing.Fawzan, who weighed 42 pounds, had last been last seen wearing a green shirt, blue jeans and white and silver sneakers.Bohrer Park is bordered by neighborhoods on the southwest and southeast sides; by Frederick Avenue on the northeast side; and by Gaithersburg High School on the northwest side.Police had urged residents in the area to diligently search their property, including under porches and decks, and inside unlocked cars and sheds.Officers warned people not to approach the child because he might run away but to instead call 911.People with autism who go missing often are drawn to bodies of water, Reyes said. The Montgomery County Fire and Rescue Service searched ponds in the area on Saturday and Sunday, said Pete Piringer, an agency spokesman.Officers with the Montgomery County Police Department, Gaithersburg Police Department, Maryland State Police and Maryland-National Capital Park Police had helped in the search, officials said. Drones with infrared sensing technology were flown over the area into the night.Police officials had encouraged residents to print out a flier from the department’s social media pages and hang it up in the Gaithersburg area.  Those driving down the road were asked to call police if they saw a young child sitting alone.Montgomery police offer this advice when approaching nonverbal Autistic children:It is important to approach them calmly and slowly; avoid making sudden movements or loud noises that might startle them. Speak in a gentle, reassuring tone, even if the child does not respond verbally. Nonverbal autistic children might not respond to their name, so try to use other cues, such as visual signals or familiar objects, to get their attention.Most importantly, police said, ensure the child’s safety and wait for law enforcement to arrive."
WaPo_87,Exit polling in Venezuela shows opposition beating Maduro by wide margin,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/28/venezuela-election-maduro-gonzalez/,2024-07-29 07:37:02.850358,,"CARACAS, Venezuela — The Venezuelan opposition was hopeful of an election victory Sunday that could bring an end to the authoritarian government of Nicolás Maduro and the socialist state that has controlled this crisis-stricken South American nation for a quarter-century.Exit polling released after voting centers began to close Sunday evening showed opposition candidate Edmundo González taking 65 percent of the vote, more than doubling Maduro’s 31 percent, Edison Research reported. Venezuelans were waiting for official results.The opposition, suffocated by Maduro’s autocratic rule and historically hobbled by infighting, sees its best chance in more than a decade to unseat the strongman, whom many here blame for this oil-rich country’s economic collapse and the exodus of millions of migrants, hundreds of thousands of them to the United States.Maduro has barred the opposition’s chosen candidate, arrested campaign workers and blocked access to state media. Still, the opposition says it can win — and by a landslide. A high turnout could provide a significant boost; by 4 p.m., González’s campaign estimated that 11.7 million Venezuelans had voted, a participation rate of more than 54 percent.But in a country where the electoral council, courts and military are controlled by Maduro, the outcome remained far from certain. He and his team were confident they can win, according to people familiar with their conversations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the conversations. If he loses the vote, he’s not expected to cede power willingly.There were reports of blocked access, delays and some violence. In Maturín, a state capital some 350 miles east of Caracas, local opposition leaders said a voting center coordinator and her mother were demanding access for opposition poll watchers when members of a colectivo — armed Maduro supporters on motorbikes — rode up and shot the mother in the leg.Voting centers were scheduled to open 6 a.m. Sunday, but at a school in the Chacao neighborhood of Caracas, a group of 18 people arrived three hours early. They would wait for more than six hours, amid delays opening some voting tables.By 9 a.m., some of the hundreds of people began to chant: “We want to vote!” Esther Pérez Villegas, whose husband was among those waiting, stepped in to help organize the lines. “Anxiety is high, very high, because of all of the uncertainty we feel,” she said.Noemi Tovar, 61, had been in line since 3 a.m. “If I have to wait all day, I’ll wait all day,” she said.“We’ve made lines here for many things — for food, for gasoline,” said Martha Salas, 62. “This is for so much more — for a vote.”Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said problems at voting centers “were exceptions to a process that is developing peacefully.”“The way things are going, I think we are going to have, as they say, irreversible results,” she said at a voting center in Caracas.Somerville, N.J.,-based Edison Research, which interviewed more than 6,800 voters at 100 locations, said González outpolled Maduro among men and women, rural, suburban and urban voters, and every age group.“Our exit poll projects a resounding victory for Edmundo González,” executive vice president Rob Farbman said. “The opposition candidate had broad support across nearly all demographic backgrounds.”The opposition was betting it could turn out voters for a victory so overwhelming that Maduro will be forced to accept the results and begin to negotiate his exit.The number of eligible voters for the election is estimated at about 17 million. Several voting centers saw long lines. It was not possible to determine whether this reflected the greater turnout that the opposition had said would be its key to victory, but some voters in Caracas said they hadn’t seen such long crowds in many years.“I haven’t seen this kind of voter intention since Chávez,” said Vladimir Ramos, a 60-year-old engineer waiting in line. Hugo Chávez, Maduro’s mentor and predecessor, founded Venezuela’s socialist state in 1999 and led it until his death in 2013.“I think people are no longer afraid,” said Natalie Moreno, 47.By 12:40 p.m., Maduro addressed the nation to announce the activation of Operation Remate — a word meaning “finish it off” — a government-led effort to rally supporters to the polls. Maduro campaign staff and supporters called people to pressure them to vote and offer food and supplies.“Let’s mobilize ourselves with force,” Maduro said in a message aired by state television. “Let’s vote with strength as was planned, and with the force of the” social programs.The government aid was flowing in the rural eastern state of Delta Amacuro. In an Indigenous community there, people were being offered bags of food in exchange of support, said Yoxsamar Jiménez, a poll watcher for the opposition.“But that’s normal here,” she said. More concerning, she said: Poll watchers were not allowed inside, and the center’s coordinator hit Jiménez.“To avoid violence, we couldn’t do anything so we had to leave the table,” Jiménez said. “The table is alone, and they’re doing whatever they want in that center.”If Maduro loses, the United States could play a critical role in a potential negotiated transition, offering legal incentives and relief from sanctions to give Maduro a way out that doesn’t lead him straight to prison.The United States stands ready to “consider measures that would facilitate a peaceful transition of power,” a senior Biden administration official said Friday, speaking on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the administration.A Maduro defeat would be a significant foreign policy win for the Biden administration. U.S. officials negotiated a deal last year in which Maduro pledged to hold a competitive election in exchange for some sanctions relief. With irregular immigration at the center of the U.S. presidential campaign, success in Venezuela could boost Vice President Harris’s bid against former president Donald Trump.Venezuela’s opposition candidate, the former diplomat Edmundo González, was unknown to most Venezuelans just months ago. Now polls predict he could beat Maduro by double digits. He is a stand-in for longtime Maduro critic Machado, the “Iron Lady” who draws tens of thousands of Venezuelans to her near-messianic campaign caravans — and has been disqualified from running by Maduro’s supreme court.Her campaign focuses on a simple message: Vote for us, and your loved ones can come home.“The central theme is family, in the sense that this could be the last opportunity to reunite our families,” she told The Washington Post. “This is not just an electoral campaign. This is a redemption movement, for liberation.”Maduro’s campaign has portrayed the opposition as an extreme, right-wing threat that would bring instability.Some voters in Caracas seemed to agree. Hector Trujillo, a 79-year-old retired architect, said he was voting for “peace” and the continued improvement of the economy. He blamed U.S. sanctions for the country’s troubles. He feared the opposition would “eliminate everything,” including the country’s welfare benefits.The run-up to the election was far from free and fair. European Union observers who planned to monitor the vote were disinvited, leaving only small teams from the Atlanta-based Carter Center, a U.N. panel of experts and a grass-roots group of thousands of ordinary Venezuelans who have been training to watch polling centers.Machado gave a call to action last week: Vote early, stay near the polls and alert the opposition to any suspicious activity. “We will all become citizen reporters,” she said.Ana Rosas, 26, voted Sunday for the first time in her life. Rosas, who now lives in El Salvador, is among the millions of Venezuelans dispersed across the world — and among the scores who returned home to vote.“I have goose bumps,” she said. “I still can’t believe I’m able to vote. I hope it makes a difference.”In Miami, dozens of Venezuelans, unable to vote from abroad, gathered at the Dolphin Mall to watch coverage of the election. Many wore shirts of red, yellow and blue, the colors of the Venezuelan flag, that read “Venezuela Libre.”“God willing, today the country will be free,” said Lennyn Padilla, 47, tears in his eyes. “I’m emotional because when I speak about it my throat closes up. It makes me so sad.”Victor Manuel Morina Parra, a 59-year-old bus driver in Caracas, said he has noticed discontent among his passengers. He moved from his farm in the countryside to the Katia neighborhood of the capital, he said, because his rural town was “in a state of total abandonment.”“We no longer have help from the government. There’s no fuel, the electricity goes out every eight hours,” he said. “That’s why we want change. For our children, for our grandchildren.”Venezuelans are watching the armed forces and how they respond to any attempt to manipulate the election.Leopoldo López, an opposition leader, said members of the military should consider their own interests, “their own stability, their own future.”“Today, with Edmundo, a transition could be a better source of stability,” he said, “rather than Maduro telling them to go out to kill, to repress, to impose the state.”Maduro has warned of a “bloodbath” if he loses.“The destiny of Venezuela depends on our victory,” he told rallygoers this month. “If we want to avoid a bloodbath or a fratricidal civil war triggered by the fascists, then we must guarantee the biggest electoral victory ever.”Maduro’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López, said last week he would uphold the law. He called for “the one who won to take charge of his government project and the one who lost, go to rest.”"

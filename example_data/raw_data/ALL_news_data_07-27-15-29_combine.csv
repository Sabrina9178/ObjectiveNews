NBC_1,"Elon Musk’s transgender daughter, in first interview, says he berated her for being queer as a child",https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/elon-musk-transgender-daughter-vivian-wilson-interview-rcna163665,2024-07-26 08:00:02.590294,,"Vivian Jenna Wilson, the transgender daughter of Elon Musk, said Thursday in her first interview that he was an absent father who was cruel to her as a child for being queer and feminine.
Wilson, 20, in an exclusive interview with NBC News, responded to comments Musk made Monday about her and her transgender identity. On social media and in an interview posted online, Musk said she was “not a girl” and was figuratively “dead,” and he alleged that he had been “tricked” into authorizing trans-related medical treatment for her when she was 16. 
Wilson said that Musk hadn’t been tricked and that, after initially having hesitated, he knew what he was doing when he agreed to her treatment, which required consent from her parents.
Musk’s recent statements crossed a line, she said. 
“I think he was under the assumption that I wasn’t going to say anything and I would just let this go unchallenged,” Wilson said in a phone interview. “Which I’m not going to do, because if you’re going to lie about me, like, blatantly to an audience of millions, I’m not just gonna let that slide.” 
Wilson said that, for as long as she could remember, Musk hasn’t been a supportive father. She said he was rarely present in her life, leaving her and her siblings to be cared for by their mother or by nannies even though Musk had joint custody, and she said Musk berated her when he was present. 
“He was cold,” she said. “He’s very quick to anger. He is uncaring and narcissistic.” 
Wilson said that, when she was a child, Musk would harass her for exhibiting feminine traits and pressure her to appear more masculine, including by pushing her to deepen her voice as early as elementary school. 
“I was in fourth grade. We went on this road trip that I didn’t know was actually just an advertisement for one of the cars — I don’t remember which one — and he was constantly yelling at me viciously because my voice was too high,” she said. “It was cruel.” 
Musk didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Wilson and her twin brother were born to Musk’s first wife, author Justine Musk. The couple divorced in 2008, and Wilson said her parents shared custody between their homes in the Los Angeles area. 
Musk, 53, is among the wealthiest people in the world through his stakes in Tesla, where he’s CEO, and in SpaceX, which he founded. He has also become a significant political figure, having endorsed former President Donald Trump this month for another term in the White House. Musk has 12 children, including Wilson. 
Now a college student studying languages, Wilson has never granted an interview before and has largely stayed out of public view. She did, however, attract attention in 2022 when she sought court approval in California to change her name and, in the process, denounced her father. 
“I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form,” she said in the court filing. 
She told NBC News that at the time, she was surprised by the media attention to the court filing, which she submitted when she was 18. She said in the interview that she stands by what she wrote, though she said she might have tried to be more eloquent had she known the coverage it would get. 
Wilson said that she hadn’t spoken to Musk in about four years and that she refused to be defined by him. 
“I would like to emphasize one thing: I am an adult. I am 20 years old. I am not a child,” she said. “My life should be defined by my own choices.” 
Musk threw a spotlight on Wilson on Monday by speaking about their relationship in a video interview with psychologist and conservative commentator Jordan Peterson streamed live on X, saying he didn’t support Wilson’s gender identity. 
“I lost my son, essentially,” Musk said. He used Wilson’s birth name, also known as a deadname for transgender people, and said she was “dead, killed by the woke mind virus.” 
And in a post on X, Musk said Monday that Wilson was “born gay and slightly autistic” and that, at age 4, she fit certain gay stereotypes, such as loving musicals and using the exclamation “fabulous!” to describe certain clothing. Wilson told NBC News that the anecdotes aren’t true, though she said she did act stereotypically feminine in other ways as a child. 
Wilson also addressed Musk’s recent comments in a series of posts Thursday on the social media app Threads. 
“He doesn’t know what I was like as a child because he quite simply wasn’t there,” she wrote. “And in the little time that he was I was relentlessly harassed for my femininity and queerness.”
“I’ve been reduced to a happy little stereotype,” she continued. “I think that says alot about how he views queer people and children in general.” 
In recent years, Musk has taken a hard-right turn into conservative politics and has been waging a campaign against transgender people and policies designed to support them. This month, he said he was pulling his businesses out of California to protest a new state law that bars schools from requiring that trans kids be outed to their parents.
On X, Musk has for years criticized transgender rights, including medical treatments for trans-identifying minors, and the use of pronouns if they are different from what would be used at birth. He has promoted anti-trans content and called for arresting people who provide trans care to minors. 
After Musk bought X, then known as Twitter, in 2022, he rolled back the app’s protections for trans people, including a ban on using deadnames. 
Musk told Peterson that Wilson’s gender transition has been the motivation for his push into conservative politics. 
“I vowed to destroy the woke mind virus after that, and we’re making some progress,” he said. 
Wilson was also mentioned in a biography of Musk by author Walter Isaacson — a book that she told NBC News was inaccurate and unfair to her. The book refers to her politics as “radical Marxism,” quoting Musk’s sister-in-law Christiana Musk, but Wilson said she’s not a Marxist, though she said she does oppose wealth inequality. The book also calls her by her middle name, Jenna. 
Wilson said Isaacson never reached out to her directly ahead of publication. In a phone interview Thursday, Isaacson said he had reached out to Wilson through family members. 
Christiana Musk didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday.
Wilson told NBC News that for years she had considered speaking out about Musk’s behavior as a parent and as a person but that she could no longer remain silent after his comments Monday. 
She said she had never received an explanation for why her father spent so little time with her and her siblings — behavior that she now views as strange. 
“He was there, I want to say, maybe 10% of the time. That’s generous,” she said. “He had half custody, and he fully was not there.” 
“It was just a fact of life at the time, so I don’t think I realized just how abnormal of an experience it was,” she added.
Wilson said she came out twice in life: once as gay in eighth grade and a second time as transgender when she was 16. She said that she doesn’t recall Musk’s response the first time and that she wasn’t present when Musk heard from others that she was transgender, because by then the pandemic had started and she was living full-time with her mother. 
“She’s very supportive. I love her a lot,” Wilson said of her mom.
The pandemic was a chance to escape Musk’s cruelty, she said. 
“When Covid hit, I was like, ‘I’m not going over there,’” she said. “It was basically very lucky timing.” 
Musk told Peterson in the interview that he had been “tricked” into signing documents authorizing transgender-related medical treatment for Wilson — an allegation Wilson said isn’t true. 
“I was essentially tricked into signing documents for one of my older boys,” Musk said, using her birth name.
“This was before I had really any understanding of what was going on, and we had Covid going on,” he said, adding that he was told she might commit suicide.
Wilson said that, in 2020, when she was still a minor at 16, she wanted to start treatment for severe gender dysphoria but needed the consent of both parents under California law. She said that her mother was supportive but that Musk initially wasn’t. She said she texted him about it for a while. 
“I was trying to do this for months, but he said I had to go meet with him in person,” she said. “At that point, it was very clear that we both had a very distinct disdain for each other.” 
When she eventually went and gave him the medical forms, she said, he read them at least twice, once with her and then again on his own, before he signed them. 
“He was not by any means tricked. He knew the full side effects,” she said. 
She said she took puberty blockers before she switched to hormone-replacement therapy — treatments that she said were lifesaving for her and other transgender people. 
“They save lives. Let’s not get that twisted,” she said. “They definitely allowed me to thrive.” 
She said she believed the requirements to obtain such treatments remain onerous, with teenagers pressured to say they’re at extreme risk of self-harm before they’ll be approved. She said she felt judged by Musk and Peterson, in the Monday interview, for not being at a high enough risk in their eyes. 
“I have been basically put into a point where, to a group of people, I have to basically prove whether or not I was suicidal or not to warrant medically transitioning,” she said. “It’s absolutely mind-boggling.” David Ingram is a tech reporter for NBC News."
NBC_2,"It's OK for 'boneless' chicken wings to have bones, Ohio Supreme Court rules",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ok-boneless-chicken-wings-bones-ohio-supreme-court-rules-rcna163758,2024-07-26 09:00:02.619717,,"Consumers cannot expect boneless chicken wings to actually be free of bones, a divided Ohio Supreme Court ruled Thursday, rejecting claims by a restaurant patron who suffered serious medical complications from getting a bone stuck in his throat.
Michael Berkheimer was dining with his wife and friends at a wing joint in Hamilton, Ohio, and had ordered the usual — boneless wings with parmesan garlic sauce — when he felt a bite-size piece of meat go down the wrong way. Three days later, feverish and unable to keep food down, Berkeimer went to the emergency room, where a doctor discovered a long, thin bone that had torn his esophagus and caused an infection.
Berkheimer sued the restaurant, Wings on Brookwood, saying the restaurant failed to warn him that so-called “boneless wings” — which are, of course, nuggets of boneless, skinless breast meat — could contain bones. The suit also named the supplier and the farm that produced the chicken, claiming all were negligent.
In a 4-3 ruling, the Supreme Court said Thursday that “boneless wings” refers to a cooking style, and that Berkheimer should’ve been on guard against bones since it’s common knowledge that chickens have bones. The high court sided with lower courts that had dismissed Berkheimer’s suit.
“A diner reading ‘boneless wings’ on a menu would no more believe that the restaurant was warranting the absence of bones in the items than believe that the items were made from chicken wings, just as a person eating ‘chicken fingers’ would know that he had not been served fingers,” Justice Joseph T. Deters wrote for the majority.
The dissenting justices called Deters’ reasoning “utter jabberwocky,” and said a jury should’ve been allowed to decide whether the restaurant was negligent in serving Berkheimer a piece of chicken that was advertised as boneless.
“The question must be asked: Does anyone really believe that the parents in this country who feed their young children boneless wings or chicken tenders or chicken nuggets or chicken fingers expect bones to be in the chicken? Of course they don’t,” Justice Michael P. Donnelly wrote in dissent. “When they read the word ‘boneless,’ they think that it means ‘without bones,’ as do all sensible people.”"
NBC_3,Son of 'El Chapo' and Sinaloa Cartel co-founder 'El Mayo' arrested in Texas,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/son-el-chapo-another-sinaloa-cartel-leader-arrested-texas-rcna163757,2024-07-26 10:01:02.688339,,"The son of jailed Sinaloa Cartel boss Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera and a cartel co-founder who helped lead it for three decades were arrested Thursday in El Paso, Texas, Attorney General Merrick Garland said.
Joaquín Guzmán López and Sinaloa Cartel co-founder Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada García have both been indicted in the U.S., and they face “multiple charges” in connection with the Mexico-based criminal organization, “including its deadly fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking networks,” Garland said in a statement.
The crime kingpin known as ""El Chapo"" was arrested in Mexico and extradited to the U.S. and is serving a sentence of life plus 30 years that was handed down in New York in 2019.
The Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels ""are at the heart"" of the synthetic drug crisis in the U.S., which includes fentanyl and methamphetamine, the Drug Enforcement Administration said in its 2024 National Drug Threat Assessment.
""Fentanyl is the deadliest drug threat our country has ever faced, and the Justice Department will not rest until every single cartel leader, member, and associate responsible for poisoning our communities is held accountable,"" Garland said in the statement.
Another son of ""El Chapo,"" Ovidio Guzmán López, who was also alleged to be a cartel leader, was arrested in Mexico in January 2023 and has been extradited to the U.S. to face drug and money laundering charges. He pleaded not guilty in September.
A federal grand jury indicted Joaquín Guzmán López and Ovidio Guzmán López in 2018 on charges that alleged a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana into the U.S. 
A federal grand jury also indicted Joaquín Guzmán López, Ovidio Guzmán López and two other sons of ""El Chapo"" last year, the Justice Department said at the time.
The two other sons, Iván Guzmán Salazar and Alfredo Guzmán Salazar, have not been apprehended. The four sons are known as the ""Chapitos,"" federal officials said, and they took over their father's drug trafficking networks and his faction of the cartel.
Four criminal organizations make up the Sinaloa Cartel, the DEA says, including ""Los Chapitos,” which was run by the four ""El Chapo"" sons.
The brothers promoted making fentanyl a larger part of the cartel's business, the DEA said in the 2024 report.
""The Sinaloa Cartel has been producing bulk quantities of fentanyl since at least 2012, but the Chapitos faction is responsible for pushing the importance of fentanyl to the cartel’s 'bottom line,'"" the report says. 
Zambada García, known as ""El Mayo,"" co-founded the cartel and was a co-head of the criminal organization for three decades, according to the DEA. He controls one of the four factions making up the cartel.
Zambada García was a partner of ""El Chapo,"" but more recently he has been involved in an internal battle with the ""Chapitos,"" the agency said.
Zambada García has also been charged in the U.S. He was most recently charged in a superseding indictment in February that accuses him of a conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, the Justice Department announced at the time.
There were an estimated 107,543 drug overdose deaths in the U.S. last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most of which — an estimated 74,702 — were from synthetic opioids, which include fentanyl. The second most were from psychostimulants like methamphetamine, with an estimated 36,251 deaths, it said.
The Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels make fentanyl in labs in Mexico and then ship it into the U.S., the DEA said in this year's report.
Both cartels are alleged to have ordered subordinates last year to stop trafficking in fentanyl, and the ""Chapitos"" made a public show about it, but the DEA concluded that ""the ban is probably a public relations stunt.""
""Throughout 2023, fentanyl was seized at the border in equal or higher quantities as in previous years, and no DEA field office reported that fentanyl is less available or more expensive, either of which would point to a decrease in the supply,"" it said.Phil Helsel is a reporter for NBC News."
NBC_4,Team USA flag bearers LeBron James and Coco Gauff rebuke this classic Fox News complaint,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/lebron-james-coco-gauff-are-perfect-team-usa-flag-bearers-rcna163245,2024-07-26 18:00:02.884520,,"LeBron James is about to make history yet again. The 39-year-old NBA superstar, about to compete in his fourth Olympics, will be one of two flag bearers for the U.S. Olympic team in Paris on Friday. (Coco Gauff, the 20-year-old reigning U.S. Open champion, will be the woman athlete carrying the flag.) Surprisingly, James will be the first men’s basketball player to carry the flag for the U.S. As he is arguably the greatest player to ever lace them up, he is a fitting first.
It’s an incredible honor to represent the United States on this global stage, especially in a moment that can bring the whole world together.
LEBRON JAMES
“It’s an incredible honor to represent the United States on this global stage, especially in a moment that can bring the whole world together,” James said in a Team USA statement. “For a kid from Akron, this responsibility means everything to not only myself, but to my family, all the kids in my hometown, my teammates, fellow Olympians and so many people across the country with big aspirations. Sports have the power to bring us all together, and I’m proud to be a part of this important moment.”
Floating in a boat on the Seine in Paris while waving the American flag is indeed a long way from Akron, Ohio.
James was voted to carry the flag by the other Olympians on Team USA. This is a vital detail, because the flag bearers are not usually the competitors with the most fame but the most game: the people whose athletic performances inspire documentarians for decades. But James, while certainly having the game, is a different kind of figure. He’s not so much an athlete as he is a brand, an institution, a corporation and a political lightning rod. It’s that last point that makes members of Team USA choosing him to represent them particularly significant.
In 2012, James helped organize his then-Miami Heat team to speak out against the killing of Trayvon Martin by the self-appointed neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman. He has spoken out forcefully against police brutality and racism. He was perhaps the most famous voice to say “Black lives matter.”
The choice of James is particularly fascinating when one considers the amount of time the GOP, Fox News and Donald Trump have spent vilifying him. In their minds, James refusing to uncritically “back the blue,” calling out anti-Black racism and defending the right of athletes to express their dissent by kneeling during the national anthem was proof that he didn’t love his country. Fox News’ Laura Ingraham infamously suggested that he “shut up and dribble.” We saw the same criticism lobbed at Colin Kaepernik, who was then a quarterback with the San Francisco 49ers. When he initiated the national anthem protests that inspired other athletes including James, Trump said he needed to “find another country.”
James’ ventures into politics haven’t always gone smoothly. The NBA’s lucrative relationship with China is a topic James has fumbled, as his own financial entanglements have kept him from speaking out against the injustices of the Chinese government. But James has rarely, if ever, looked afraid to put himself out there. This has been in sharp contrast to the player against whom LeBron will always be measured: Michael Jordan. When Jordan was playing, he eschewed involvement in political matters.
Coco Gauff, who like James was also chosen by Team USA, has also been politically brave.
It must be mentioned that Gauff, who like James was also chosen by Team USA, has also been politically brave. She gave an extemporaneous speech at a Black Lives Matter rally in her hometown of Delray Beach, Florida, when she was just 16. And in a May interview with The Associated Press where she talked about preparing to vote for the first time, she sharply criticized Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ leadership. She called it “a crazy time to be a Floridian, especially a Black one at that.” She said, “We aren’t happy with the current state of our government in Florida, especially everything with the books and just the way our office operates.”
By selecting James and Gauff, this generation of young athletes — some of whom weren’t born when James began his illustrious career in 2003 — are rejecting the template set forth by the right wing that dissent, protest or even tolerance is inherently against the best interests of the country. Choosing James and Gauff is a rebuke to the forces of division. It’s a reclamation of the idea that marching forward is preferable to looking — and acting — backward. And it’s a rebuke of the idea that criticizing what’s happening in your country doesn’t mean you don’t love it.Dave Zirin is sports editor of The Nation.

NBC_5,The 2024 Paris Olympic opening ceremony is the most ambitious yet,https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/olympics/opening-ceremony-olympics-paris-2024-summer-games-rcna162281,2024-07-26 18:00:02.884520,,"PARIS — After a global pandemic and with at least three ongoing wars, the organizers of Friday’s opening ceremony for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games hope to provide relief, positivity and perhaps even some unity in a world increasingly beset with tension.
There has never been a celebration so ambitious during the 128-year history of the modern Olympiad. Rather than parade inside a stadium, around 10,500 athletes will sail in a 3.5-mile flotilla of 94 boats down Paris’ iconic Seine River. It could be a blockbuster return for the summer sporting festival, which will host spectators for the first time in eight years after the coronavirus-plagued days of Tokyo in 2021.
The spectacle of the opening ceremony typically draws viewers who may not even follow athletics, and this year’s open-air extravaganza promises to be no different. The arrival of Céline Dion and Lady Gaga in the City of Lights has led to speculation that one — or both — of the pop stars could even take the stage Friday.
France has heightened its security ahead of the games, following a terrorist attack in Moscow in April. The raised threat level “is absolutely warranted,” said François Heisbourg, one of France’s top terrorism experts.
Stream every moment and every medal of the 2024 Paris Olympics on Peacock, starting with the opening ceremony at 12 p.m. ET Friday.
“Security is a perennial concern for any large international or global gathering, so when you’re talking about the Olympics, security concerns tend to be extraordinarily vivid,” said Heisbourg, who has advised successive prime ministers.
Those fears came into focus hours before the festivities started when France’s state-owned high-speed rail network was hit with “several simultaneous” arson attacks disrupting travel for 800,000 people, government operator SNCF said.
“We ask all passengers to postpone their trip and not to go to the station,” the company said in a statement Friday.
Friday is one of the busiest calendar dates for French vacationers and many Parisians, particularly those unenthused by the Olympics, are planning to leave town. High-speed TGV trains going east and west were “very disrupted,” SNCF said. The southeast route was spared, with the operator saying a “malicious act has been foiled.”
Organizers say the city itself will provide an unforgettable backdrop, with events interspersed among its most recognizable landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower. At the same time, they say the Games will be the most environmentally friendly yet, with 95% of buildings either temporary or already standing — and no air conditioning systems installed in the athletes village bedrooms.
Much of the format of the Games will be familiar. More than 200 national teams are competing across 329 events held over 19 days (some handball, soccer and rugby events took place Wednesday). And in an attempt to appeal to younger audiences, there will be four new disciplines: sport climbing, skateboarding, surfing and break dancing (officially known as “breaking”).
Not all events will be held in the capital, with sailing in the southern Mediterranean city of Marseille; handball and basketball in Lille, to the north; and surfing posted on the other side of the world, on the French Polynesian island of Tahiti.
American supporters will be eager to see if returning superstars such as Katie Ledecky and Simone Biles can add to their medal hauls in swimming and gymnastics, respectively. Or whether the likes of LeBron James and Steph Curry will light up the basketball court.
The nearly 600 athletes on Team USA comprise a talent-loaded roster, with women outnumbering men 314 to 278. There are plenty of new faces, too, including gymnast Hezly Rivera and transgender runner Nikki Hiltz.
With great talent comes expectations, and the United States is forecast to top the table, with 123 medals overall to China’s 87, according to Nielsen’s Gracenote Sports, which supplies statistical analysis for sports leagues around the world.
This pioneering edition of Games is not without its risks or criticisms, however.
The sprawling nature of the opening ceremony and the densely packed events have meant an extensive and imperious security operation. Some 40,000 army and police personnel are deployed across the country, and Paris is replete with stringent checkpoints and blanket surveillance.
The Games have stirred mixed emotions among Parisians. A survey last month by the pollster Odoxa found that some 40% of French people do not think the Games are “a good thing,” which has risen by more than 10% over the past three months.
And while the Games’ $10 billion budget is far below that of previous iterations, some French people say this is a waste of money when government debt is spiraling and some economists are sounding the alarm over the country’s finances.
All of this is against the backdrop of a political crisis in France. Recent parliamentary elections saw centrist and leftist coalitions block the far right from power, but in doing so created conditions for a political stalemate that could grip the country for years. (President Emmanuel Macron’s second term ends in 2027.)
The Seine itself is meant to be a star of the show. But even that has been rife with problems. A 1.5 billion-euro ($1.6 billion) upgrade to the city’s antiquated sewage system has struggled to get the river’s pollution levels low enough to host the swimming leg of the triathlon and the marathon swim.
In a report issued last week, Paris officials said two heavy downpours in Paris had a “detrimental effect” on water quality, though the quality of the Seine quickly rebounded and “conformed to safety thresholds set by the EU” at the Olympic site for six days over the course of a week.
Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, as promised, took a swim in the river earlier this month and insisted it was clean enough for the start of the Olympics.
“The water is wonderful,” Hidalgo told NBC News after she emerged from the water, adding that it was “very cool and very nice.”
In the wake of a deadly virus, grinding wars and rising political division, the world may be eager for some hope and escapism. The organizers of the Games are betting that spectators around the world are ready to take the plunge.

Trump is going on offense by painting new presidential campaign rival Harris as the face of a chaotic U.S. border, seizing on an assignment President Joe Biden gave her in 2021 to work with Central American countries to tackle the “root causes” of migration.
Trump labeled the vice president the “border czar” no fewer than six times in a fiery rally speech Thursday in North Carolina, centering his criticism of her on the overwhelmed asylum system. “Under border czar Harris, illegal aliens are pouring in by the millions and millions and millions,” Trump said, drawing jeers from the crowd as he called Harris “crazy.”
The term, which Republicans has used widely to criticize Harris, traces back to March 2021, when Harris was charged with addressing the surge of Central American migrants, who came mostly from the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, where violence and organized crime have driven millions to flee the region. The terms “czar” and “border czar” did not appear in White House materials, but they caught on among critics.
But Harris’ assignment was misunderstood: It was a diplomatic task to devise a regional strategy to mitigate the need for migration, not a security task to oversee domestic border enforcement.
The White House immediately sought to clarify that Harris’ mandate was not “the border” and that it was narrowly focused on the forces driving migrants out of the Northern Triangle. But with a crisis unfolding that was fueled by those migrants, the title stuck.

A fundraising call last night targeting white women to mobilize for the Harris campaign raised more than $2 million, according to organizers.
Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, said more than 100,000 people joined the Zoom call. Watts said so many people logged onto the Zoom that organizers moved late arrivals to YouTube after the Zoom conference call crashed twice.
Speakers included singer the Pink, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., former basketball player Sue Bird and former soccer player Megan Rapinoe.
Last night’s Zoom call followed a similar effort Sunday aimed at garnering support from Black women that drew 44,000 people and raised more than $1.5 million, organizers. said. There was also a call last night aimed at mobilizing men for Harris’ campaign.

Rep. Emilia Sykes, a vulnerable Democrat from Ohio and former competitive gymnast, has re-released an ad featuring her beam routine to coincide with the start of the Paris Olympics.
“In elections, you know the routine: The other side will make up lies about me, and they’ll put them on air,” Sykes says in the 30-second spot, which first aired in 2022 and is being backed this time by a five-figure digital advertising buy. “They’re hoping you’ll forget that I worked with both parties to raise pay, keep us safe and cut taxes. And they definitely don’t want you to know that I have a plan to lower costs and keep more money in your pocket.”
“They’ll twist everything to scare you. But the only thing that’ll stick,” Sykes adds, as the camera shows her completing a perfect spin off the beam, “is my landing.”
Sykes, a former state champion gymnast who competed in the Junior Olympics, represents Ohio’s 13th Congressional District, which includes Akron and Canton. In a recent House floor speech, she noted that the district also is the birthplace of three Team USA members: basketball stars LeBron James and Steph Curry and BMX freestyle cyclist Marcus Christopher.
“Her record speaks for itself, and in the Birthplace of Champions voters know she will always put working families first,” Sykes spokesperson Maddie Summers said in a statement. “The Olympics is an opportunity to put politics aside and come together to root for American excellence and this ad is an opportunity to showcase another champion for Northeast Ohio.”
Sykes, who is seeking a second term, faces Republican Kevin Coughlin, a former state lawmaker, in November. She is part of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's Frontline program for members in tough races.

The White House immediately sought to clarify that Harris’ mandate was not “the border” and that it was narrowly focused on the forces driving migrants out of the Northern Triangle. But with a crisis unfolding that was fueled by those migrants, the title stuck.

A fundraising call last night targeting white women to mobilize for the Harris campaign raised more than $2 million, according to organizers.
Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, said more than 100,000 people joined the Zoom call. Watts said so many people logged onto the Zoom that organizers moved late arrivals to YouTube after the Zoom conference call crashed twice.
Speakers included singer the Pink, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., former basketball player Sue Bird and former soccer player Megan Rapinoe.
Last night’s Zoom call followed a similar effort Sunday aimed at garnering support from Black women that drew 44,000 people and raised more than $1.5 million, organizers. said. There was also a call last night aimed at mobilizing men for Harris’ campaign.

Rep. Emilia Sykes, a vulnerable Democrat from Ohio and former competitive gymnast, has re-released an ad featuring her beam routine to coincide with the start of the Paris Olympics.
“In elections, you know the routine: The other side will make up lies about me, and they’ll put them on air,” Sykes says in the 30-second spot, which first aired in 2022 and is being backed this time by a five-figure digital advertising buy. “They’re hoping you’ll forget that I worked with both parties to raise pay, keep us safe and cut taxes. And they definitely don’t want you to know that I have a plan to lower costs and keep more money in your pocket.”
“They’ll twist everything to scare you. But the only thing that’ll stick,” Sykes adds, as the camera shows her completing a perfect spin off the beam, “is my landing.”
Sykes, a former state champion gymnast who competed in the Junior Olympics, represents Ohio’s 13th Congressional District, which includes Akron and Canton. In a recent House floor speech, she noted that the district also is the birthplace of three Team USA members: basketball stars LeBron James and Steph Curry and BMX freestyle cyclist Marcus Christopher.
“Her record speaks for itself, and in the Birthplace of Champions voters know she will always put working families first,” Sykes spokesperson Maddie Summers said in a statement. “The Olympics is an opportunity to put politics aside and come together to root for American excellence and this ad is an opportunity to showcase another champion for Northeast Ohio.”
Sykes, who is seeking a second term, faces Republican Kevin Coughlin, a former state lawmaker, in November. She is part of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's Frontline program for members in tough races.Rebecca Shabad

Obama endorsed Harris for president today, just days after she launched her campaign after Biden withdrew from the race.
“Michelle and I couldn’t be prouder to endorse you and to do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office,” Obama says in a video that shows Harris getting a call from the Obamas.
Michelle Obama says in the approximately one-minute video: “I can’t have this phone call without saying to my girl Kamala: I am proud of you. This is going to be historic.”

NBC_7,Harris aims to open Silicon Valley checkbooks after tech donors had drifted to Trump,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/harris-aims-open-silicon-valley-checkbooks-tech-donors-drifted-trump-rcna163714,2024-07-26 21:15:02.823388,,"WASHINGTON — As Kamala Harris’ campaign looks to re-engage Democratic donors who held back support from President Joe Biden, it is finding renewed interest from a sector that has increasingly favored Donald Trump: Silicon Valley.
Democrats say the suggestion tech sector donors were moving toward Republicans was overstated. But they agree Harris — who started in politics in the Bay Area in California — has helped unlock support that was on the sidelines.
“The pivot that has occurred in the last three days is dramatic,” said Steve Westly, a venture capitalist and who ran for governor of California in 2006. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen such a surge of enthusiasm in any campaign I’ve been involved with.” 
Biden administration accomplishments welcomed by tech industry voters include the CHIPS Act and a climate bill Westly called the “biggest green stimulus in human history.” Harris has a strong track record on issues that Silicon Valley donors care about, he said.
“She’s been out front on R&D tax credits and all the things that have supported [the industry] from the Internet to GPS. Trump is out there saying the most outlandish things imaginable,” he said, pointing to his criticism of green energy initiatives and electric vehicles. “The big picture is, most people in tech and most people in business want stability. They don’t want to see mobs attacking the Capitol.”
Westly has regularly hosted high-dollar events for Democratic candidates at his Atherton, Calif., home, including one with Biden in June 2023. He said there were already efforts underway to schedule new events in response to the surge of demand to support Harris, but acknowledged that the compressed timeline makes things difficult.
“We raised $50,000 within an hour of sending out our first email and we don’t even have a date,” he said. “Everyone knows that time is precious. [Events] will need to be two to three times bigger than usual.
Ron Conway, a venture capitalist and Democratic donor, was among those who had expressed concern about Biden’s June 27 debate performance and implored Democratic leaders to pressure Biden to step aside. In a statement provided to NBC News, he said praised Harris. 
“I believe our country is at its strongest when we are looking forward, not backward, when we are innovating and growing. Vice President Harris shares that view and Donald Trump does not,” he said.
“That is why I’m confident that the vast majority of the tech ecosystem in Silicon Valley and beyond will stand firmly behind her as part of a broad coalition that will send her to the Oval Office to keep our country moving in the right direction.”
But it’s not just reliable Democratic donors who have to be convinced to turn the spigot back on after cutting off Biden. There are also donors who are being lured away by Trump. 
Perhaps the biggest name in the tech sector right now, Elon Musk, has pledged millions in support of Trump’s candidacy through a super PAC also supported by the Winklevoss twins and Joe Lonsdale, a venture capitalist.
Conway, fellow Democratic donor Reid Hoffman and others have been working the phones to try to sway tech contributors from going to Trump’s corner, according to CNBC.  Some in the tech community have felt the Biden administration has overregulated their industry, with particular concerns from those leaders in cryptocurrency and AI.
Harris could be the Trump alternative wary tech executives have been looking for, as she’s had a mixed record on government regulations targeting tech. While a senator of California, Harris said in 2019 that “we have to seriously take a look at [a Facebook breakup],” according to Fortune. Asked if she supports the Biden administration’s support for legislation that could lead to a ban on TikTok, a Harris spokesperson pointed to an ABC News interview earlier this year. 
“We do not intend to ban TikTok. That is not at all the goal or the purpose of this conversation. We need to deal with the owner, and we have national security concerns about the owner of TikTok,” she said. 
Biden signed a bill that could ban TikTok from use in the United States, but only if its parent company, China-based ByteDance, agrees to sell the social media asset by early 2025.
Harris has, for years, maintained a close allegiance with some tech leaders. She raised over $500,000 during her 2019 Democratic primary from those working at Amazon, Alphabet, AT&T, Comcast, Microsoft and Apple, according to FEC filings.Mike Memoli is an NBC News correspondent. "
NBC_8,Mexicans flee to Guatemala after drug cartel shootouts,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/mexicans-flee-to-guatemala-drug-cartel-violence-rcna163786,2024-07-26 21:07:02.823388,,"When a 72-year-old Mexican farmer heard the bullets from the most recent cartel shootout landing close to his home, he knew it was time to go. He collected his children and grandchildren and fled on foot across the border to Guatemala.
They left behind their animals, documents, money and took off running, among nearly 600 people who fled various communities of Amatenango la Frontera this week to escape warring drug cartels that have terrorized the rural borderlands of southern Mexico.
“I left my home because of the shooting, and out of fear,” said the farmer, who requested anonymity for his family’s safety. “The cartels kill even the innocent.”
They walked more than 2 miles (4 kilometers) over the mountains and through thick brush until they found a path that brought them to Ampliacion Nueva Reforma, an impoverished Guatemalan hamlet in the Cuilco municipality.
In this single community, more than 200 Mexican refugees have arrived in recent days. Locals have scrambled to shelter them in their modest school and collect donations of food and water.
“Thank God they gave us a hand, gave us a tea to calm our fear,” the man said. “We’re afraid to return. There’s no authority to fight them. What we ask of the government is to intervene and help us out and send the Mexican army.”
Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo said Wednesday his administration would coordinate the humanitarian response though there was little sign of it yet. Still, that was more than came from the Mexican side where authorities did not respond to requests for comment about the situation and President Andrés Manuel López Obrador did not even mention it during his daily briefing Thursday of more than three hours.
A 42-year-old woman who identified herself only as Karla to protect her family, said she fled Sunday with her four children.
“With the shootouts you couldn’t leave your home to look for food, imagine what I could give my children to eat,” she said. “We don’t know how much longer this is going to last. We don’t know if we’ll be able to return.”
Noel Pérez, mayor of Ampliacion Nueva Reforma, was preparing for what might be an extended stay. He said the refugees needed basic supplies, hygiene products and a large tent. “So far, not the mayor (of Cuilco), nor the government has given us help and it’s urgent that they they attend to these people.”
Catholic Church leaders in southern Mexico made their own plea for the Mexican government to protect the communities from cartels, which extract protection payments and use locals as human shields.
A letter dated Wednesday and signed by Bishop Emeritus Jaime Calderón of the Tapachula Diocese, which includes parishes near the border with Guatemala, begged for government help.
Two of Mexico’s most powerful cartels from the northern states of Sinaloa and Jalisco have been battling for control of smuggling routes in the area for more than a year causing multiple displacements.
On Wednesday, Arévalo said his administration was coordinating with the local governments near the border to attend to the Mexicans “who are escaping conflict between groups that is taking place on the Mexican side.”
A Guatemalan government report obtained by The Associated Press described accounts from the refugees of having to abandon their homes because of a lack of food and fighting between organized crime groups. They arrived in communities of the Cuilco municipality. Among the 580 people were men, women, children and elderly.
The diocese’s letter says communities long mired in poverty and ignored by the government must now also suffer being “hostages in their communities, paying extortion to the corresponding cartel based on where they live, being forced to take shifts at roadblocks that impede free transit.”
Residents have to use what little money they have to pay for scarce items at elevated prices because the shopkeepers also are being extorted. And between July 20-22, the situation worsened as residents were “intimidated, threatened and forced to be human shields in the clashes between drug cartels.”
The letter does not refer specifically to those who fled to Guatemala, but it said that while Mexico’s military and National Guard are present, they do nothing to intervene to protect the communities.
“What do we have to do or say so that the government carries out its duty, at least, to protect and watch out for the security of the communities?” the letter asks.
In June, some 5,000 people were displaced by violence in another part of Chiapas after armed men set houses on fire in the town of Tila.
In September of last year, Mexico’s president conceded the cartels had cut off electrical power in some Chiapas towns near the border with Guatemala, and forbidden government workers from coming in to the largely rural area to fix power lines.
On Thursday, the Mexican government’s silence continued."
NBC_9,Race against time to clear oil spill in Philippines as Typhoon Gaemi wreaks havoc in Asia,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/oil-spill-manila-philippines-typhoon-gaemi-havoc-rcna163771,2024-07-26 21:05:02.823388,,"The Philippines is bracing for the “worst case scenario” as the country's coast guard raced to contain an oil spill just a few miles off its capital, Manila.
The MT Terra Nova was carrying 370,000 gallons of industrial fuel when it departed early Thursday from Limay, Bataan, a port town across the bay from Manila. Barely 4 miles away from the shore, the 270-foot-long tanker sank after encountering choppy seas, the coast guard said in a statement Friday.
The crew tried to steer the ship back to the port, but could not prevent it from sinking. One crew member was killed, the statement said. Sixteen other crew members were rescued.
“We are still preparing for the worst-case scenario to address the potential negative impact to the marine environment,” coast guard Rear Adm. Armand Balilo said in a statement Friday, as authorities raced against time to “avoid a marine environment catastrophe.”
He added that an oil slick, which could be spilling from the engine, was already stretching for more than 2 miles across the bay. 
But fears are growing that the cargo hold itself could burst, sending thousands of gallons of dangerous fuel into the water and threatening the shores of Manila. 
“It will be a major disaster,” Charitha Pattiaratchi, a professor of coastal oceanography at the University of Western Australia in Perth, told NBC News. “It is mostly going to hit tourism. The bay does not have many coral reefs.”
The capital’s shoreline is a major tourism and business hub, with the Philippines' main sea and fish ports, the U.S. Embassy, upscale hotels and restaurants, as well as residential communities. The metropolitan area of 13 million people is prone to floods and typhoons and is battling a rapid rise in sea levels. Still, major land reclamation projects are underway in the polluted bay to host more tourism complexes and casinos.The sinking came as heavy monsoon rains worsened by Typhoon Gaemi flooded Manila, grounding flights, shuttering schools and offices, and setting off landslides. 
At least 34 people were killed, including 11 in the Manila metropolitan area, The Associated Press reported. More than 1 million people have been displaced, according to data from the country's disaster agency.
Gaemi has also wreaked havoc elsewhere the region. 
In Taiwan, at least seven people have been killed and almost 800 people were injured, water supplies have been knocked out for more than 160,000 households, Taiwan’s Central News Agency reported. On Thursday, another cargo tanker sank off the coast of Taiwan with nine crew members on board; three have been rescued and six remain missing.
The typhoon moved northward toward mainland China, making landfall in the southeast Chinese province of Jiangxi on Thursday, affecting more than 600,000 people in Fujian, according to the state media CCTV. No casualties have been reported and forecasters predicted the typhoon is expected to weaken as it moves further inland.
Back in the Philippines, Balilo said the tanker had sunk at a shallow depth of just over 110 feet. 
He added that the oil from the cargo hold can be extracted quickly, as long as it doesn't burst. 
Three ships for containment have been deployed, the coast guard said, aiming to finish the extraction in a week. Dispersants to collect the already spilled oil have been laid out in the affected area.
“It’s very much in shallow water. People can dive, which means that they can attach a pipe onto the ship and actually siphon off the oil as long as the weather is good,” Pattiaratchi, the professor, said.
And officials are aware of what’s at cost here.
The Philippines’ last major oil spill, from the MT Princess Empress, was carrying much less fuel and sank off the coast of a provincial island south of Manila in February last year. The spill took three months to contain and caused enormous damage to the coral reefs and mangroves in the area, affecting thousands of fisherman and beach resorts.
At the time, the U.S. Navy and Japan extended support for cleanup and rehabilitation efforts.
“The longer the oil is down in the bottom, the bigger your risk is,” Pattiaratchi said.Mithil Aggarwal is a Hong Kong-based reporter/producer for NBC News."

For Australian field hockey star Matt Dawson, he gave up more than most: the top part of a finger on his right hand. 
The 30-year-old athlete badly broke his finger after he was hit by a hockey stick during a training session in Perth two weeks ago, perilously close to the Paris 2024 games. 
“First quarter maybe only six minutes in, opposition went to drag flick the ball in and mishandle and unfortunately my stick and hand was in the end of his swing zone and pretty much took my finger off, which is yeah, pretty crazy,” he said from Paris on the podcast “Parlez Vous Hockey” on July 20. 
“The injury turned out to be a bit more serious than first thought,” he explained. “I tried to stand up pretty quick and eventually sort of passed out lying on the change room floor, probably in a bit of shock to be honest with you.”
Doctors said his injury would take four to six months to recover, meaning he’d have to miss the games. Or, he could amputate his finger and make it to the competition. Dawson chose the latter.
He said he called his wife after talking about the amputation with a surgeon and she warned him against making a “rash decision.”
“With all the information I had to make the decision, in a pretty short period of time, I still decided to take it and I can still have a pretty good functioning life with just a little less finger to worry about,” Dawson said on the podcast.
The surgery ultimately took off about an inch off the end of his right ring finger, just below the top knuckle. 
“If taking the top of my finger was the price I had to pay, that’s what I would do... (If) we get the gold in the end, it’s not a really big price to pay then.”
Now Dawson is in Paris for his third Olympic appearance with the Kookaburras. Australia’s men’s hockey team will play Argentina Saturday at at the Yves-du-Manoir Stadium in Paris.
They're vying for the next gold — the last was in Athens in 2004. With a record of four silver medals (including at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics) and five bronze in the past.Breaking News Reporter"

Monarrez was 28 and living with her parents in 2015 when Gizmo, then 2 years old, slipped past a faulty gate in the backyard of their home in Las Vegas.
The decade that followed brought a lot of change. Monarrez, now 37, moved into her own home, earned a master’s degree in English, and began her teaching career in higher education. But throughout the years, Monarrez said, she never stopped trying to find Gizmo.
Now, she was climbing into her car to drive across town to meet Gizmo at an animal hospital. Monarrez was later told that a woman had found the now 11-year-old dog and dropped him off at the vet, where they scanned his microchip, triggering the email notification that sent Monarrez to her knees, crying.
Within hours of receiving that email on July 17, Gizmo was back in his owner’s arms. Monarrez called it “a miracle.”
“Hindsight is 2020,” she said. “I’m so glad I registered his microchip.”
Their reunion came at the same time a new Las Vegas city ordinance requiring pet owners to microchip their cats and dogs is set to take effect Aug. 1.
Monarrez said Thursday that Gizmo’s first week back at home has brought mixed emotions.
It’s clear, she said, that the nine years they had spent apart had changed Gizmo, too. The 8-pound Chihuahua had grown afraid of shadows, heights and birds, and Gizmo now walked with a limp. Monarrez said both of the dog’s eyes were also severely infected, and some of his teeth were missing.
“Even though he looked so different, when I looked in his eyes I knew immediately it was Gizmo,” Monarrez said, recalling the moment they were reunited at the vet’s office. “And as soon as I said his name, he tilted his head and he didn’t stop staring at me.”
While Monarrez and her parents can’t stop thinking about what Gizmo endured after he went missing, their focus now, she said, is on addressing his health issues and “showering him with all the love that we were holding onto for all those years.”The Associated Press"

The recall affects produce sold at select Walmart and Aldi stores, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in a news release Monday. It is an expansion of the Wiers Farm July 12 recall.
The original recall was for a limited number of whole cucumbers and bagged salad cucumbers. The product was not grown or harvested by Wiers Farm, but was ""handled and distributed"" by the company, the FDA said. 
Retail packaged items such as poblano, cubanelle, green beans, organic bell pepper, serrano, jalapenos and squash are included in the expanded recall, according to the updated news release. The items were sold at Aldi and Walmart locations in states including Delaware, Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, New York, West Virginia, and Connecticut. The full list can be viewed here. 
""ALDI puts the safety and integrity of the products it sells first,"" the company said in a news release. ""If customers have products affected by this recall, they are advised to discard it immediately or return it to their local store for a full refund.""
A Walmart spokesperson told NBC News on Friday the contaminated products have been removed from the stores and the company is ""working with the supplier to investigate the cause. ""
""The health and safety of our customers is always a top priority,"" the spokesperson said. 
Bulk vegetable items sold individually or by the pound, as well as bulk herbs including cilantro and parsley, have also been recalled. 
Listeria, a bacteria that can contaminate many foods, most often causes sickness in pregnant women and their newborns, people with a weakened immune system or people aged 65 or older, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
It can cause intestinal illness such as diarrhea and vomiting that typically starts 24 hours after exposure, the CDC said. If the bacteria spreads beyond the intestines, symptoms can include fever, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and seizures. The CDC estimates that Listeria is the third leading cause of death from foodborne illness in the United States.
The FDA said there have been no illnesses or consumer complaints reported due to the contamination.Minyvonne Burke is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News."
NBC_13,Companies are slashing prices to woo consumers. It's working.,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/discounts-are-keeping-consumers-spending-summer-rcna163034,2024-07-27 01:10:02.779274,,"Companies are offering deep discounts this summer, and consumers are cashing in on them.
From Amazon to McDonald’s and Best Buy to JetBlue, major brands are ramping up efforts to get price-pressured customers to keep opening their wallets, and recent data shows it’s working.
The U.S. economy grew a solid 2.8% in the second quarter, according to government estimates released Thursday. Federal researchers pinned much of that unexpectedly strong jump on consumer spending on goods and services alike — from cars and furniture to vacations.
During the tenth anniversary of Amazon's two-day Prime Day summer sales event last week, shoppers spent a record $14.2 billion across U.S. online retailers, up 11% since last year’s Prime Day, according to Adobe Analytics. And the higher sales totals weren’t due to higher prices, according to Adobe. Instead, the analytics firm’s data shows e-commerce prices have fallen for 22 months straight, and those discounts have helped juice demand.
For the first time in a long time, we’re seeing order volumes turn positive and discounting is high.
Caila Schwartz, director of consumer insights, Salesforce
“You have a heightened level of promotion, heightened levels of discounts, and that makes for a perfect storm where the consumer feels like, ‘This is a really great opportunity for me to buy. I’m excited about spending,’” said Vivek Pandya, Adobe’s lead insights analyst.
Cooling prices throughout the consumer economy are helping inflation continue trending downward. A closely watched inflation gauge fell, to 2.5% in June from 2.6% in May, according to data released Friday.
Retailers like Best Buy and Nordstrom also ran sales during Prime Day. Salesforce, which tracked online spending across retailers other than Amazon during the shopping event, found more generous promotions on offer elsewhere, too. Discounts jumped 10% since Prime Day last year to an average of 22% off of list prices, and U.S. sales grew 3%.
“For the first time in a long time, we’re seeing order volumes turn positive and discounting is high,” said Caila Schwartz, director of consumer insights at Salesforce. “The lesson is a simple one: If retailers deliver on discounting and providing true value, they will release that pressure valve of built-up demand and see incredible success. If they don’t, retailers may risk losing out as shoppers will go elsewhere.”
While consumer spending has powered the economy out of the pandemic — and held up under inflation pressures better than many economists expected — there are signs of distress under the surface.
Citigroup flagged “an overall resilient U.S. consumer” in its latest earnings call, but Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason noted the strength is mainly among those with solid finances and credit.
“When we look across our consumer clients, only the highest-income quartile has more savings than they did at the beginning of 2019, and it is the over-740-FICO-score customers that are driving the spend growth and maintaining high payment rates” he said. Those with lower credit scores “are seeing sharper drops in payment rates and borrowing more, as they are more acutely impacted by high inflation and interest rates,” he said.
Philadelphia Federal Reserve officials found credit card delinquency rates hit their highest level in nearly 12 years as of the first quarter this year. While both the total number of accounts past due and the size of card balances ticked down a bit, the researchers noted that “account holders who are behind have larger balances left unpaid.”
This and other consumer credit data in recent months highlights “the struggle that millions of households are engaged in just trying to make ends meet,” Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride told NBC News Wednesday.
Companies have been taking note of these pressures and dangling promotions to reverse or forestall rebellions over price.
In May, Target announced price cuts on 5,000 popular items like meat, breads and paper products, and Walgreens made a similar move of its own. Walmart launched a low-cost private-label food brand this spring, with prices ranging from $2 to $15 for fridge and pantry staples.
The discounting has gone well beyond grocery aisles. JetBlue and Southwest airlines are also rolling out limited-time deals, with some domestic flights starting at $49 during certain weeks this summer. After racing to add capacity to meet soaring demand, many airlines now have more seats than they can fill, and fliers are benefiting from cheaper tickets.
Restaurant chains are getting in on the action, too. McDonald’s is extending a $5 value meal that was originally planned to last just four weeks, as rivals dangle offers like Burger King’s $5 “Your Way Meal” and Starbucks’ pairing menu starting at $5.
Data that the location analytics firm Placer.ai released this month suggests these gambits are working. Foot traffic at McDonald’s jumped 8% on June 25, the day the value meal launched, compared to an average Tuesday up to that point this year, and stayed at least 5% higher for each subsequent day that week.
Weekly visits to Chili’s have been elevated since the chain updated its “3 for Me” deal this spring, Placer.ai found, jumping as much as 27.7% at one point in the middle of May compared to 2023.
Younger consumers are fueling some of the spending, according to American Express, which said millennial and Gen Z cardholders boosted their spending by 13% in the second quarter.
“These younger card members continue to demonstrate strong engagement, and we see that they transact over 25% more, on average, than our older customers,” Chief Financial Officer Christophe Le Caillec told investors last week. “In some categories like dining, they transact almost twice as much.”
After the last few years’ inflation rollercoaster, many shoppers are paying closer attention to price swings, Adobe’s Pandya said.
“They understand how quickly the winds can change,” he said. “They’re going to really take advantage of these moments to spend when the value is good.”Haley Messenger is a producer at NBC News covering business and the economy.

NBC_14,'We're not going back': Some Never-Trump Republicans embrace Harris' 'top cop' persona,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/-not-going-back-never-trump-republicans-embrace-harris-top-cop-persona-rcna163747,2024-07-27 01:00:02.779274,,"WASHINGTON — The surge of excitement around Kamala Harris has locked in powerful interest groups and unions, cemented titans of Wall Street and Hollywood, and captured ""coconut-pilled"" progressives and Joe Biden campaign aides alike. 
But Harris’ rapid ascent to the top of the Democratic ticket is also animating another important coalition of voters: former Republicans more desperate than ever to turn the page on Donald Trump. 
Biden, with a decadeslong record in office, had offered them a moderate who promised to court compromise in Washington. Now, those anti-Trump Republicans are measuring up Harris, trying to determine whether she, too, can appeal to the center with her own policy proposals and with her pick for a running mate. 
Already, Harris has notched Republican support from former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan. 
Former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican, endorsed Biden in 2020. After launching a third party in 2022, Whitman said she is now all in for Harris. 
“It’s a totally different race, and the idea of a prosecutor against a convicted felon is a very appealing one from an ad point of view,” Whitman said. 
Others, too, are finding plenty to embrace about California’s former top cop. 
“I loved her line: ‘I’m a prosecutor. I know how to deal with people like Donald Trump,’” said former Rep. Christopher Shays, a Republican critic of Trump from Connecticut. “She didn’t say Donald Trump’s a hateful, despicable man — ugly. She didn’t have to.”
Shays said that after meeting Biden, he decided he would not vote for him despite believing he had done a good job. He worried Trump might be able to increase his support after the failed assassination attempt but now thinks the effort to moderate him has quickly fallen away. In Harris, he sees a path forward.
“I just love everything she’s done so far,” Shays said. “She doesn’t speak for an hour and a half, and she nails it. We’re not going back.”
After the president's announcement Sunday that he would step aside, Harris worked the phones to win over key Democrats as her team worked on swaying Biden's delegates. Then, she burst into the spotlight, decades Trump’s junior, flicking away the former president’s jabs and challenging him to debate on the terms he had agreed to with Biden. 
At times, the response has bordered on gleeful.
“Republicans have had five weeks of really good luck. That ended on Sunday,” said Rick Wilson, a longtime Republican strategist and co-founder of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project.  “They don’t have a Plan B: Their campaign is framed around young versus old, and Harris automatically walks in the door with a huge strategic advantage in that regard.” 
Harris may also get a boost from Trump. 
“He’s going to do a lot of the work for her,” Wilson said. “The fundamental of this race has not changed. The fundamental is still, ‘This is a referendum on Donald Trump.’” 
To Wilson’s point, a new advertising campaign targeting conservative-leaning swing voters by the group Republican Voters Against Trump trains its spotlight squarely on the former president, highlighting his actions on Jan. 6, court cases, threats of retribution against enemies, and voters’ worries he would pull out of NATO. 
This $500,000 pitch from anti-Trump voters isn’t so much a push for Harris as it is against Trump, part of an effort to mobilize what John Conway, the director of strategy for the group Republican Voters Against Donald Trump, calls the largest coalition in U.S. politics.
It wasn’t always this way for Harris, who, in 2020, faced off against Biden and more than a dozen other Democrats as the party lurched to the left. 
“Running in a Democratic primary at the height of the racial reckoning in 2020, her background as a former prosecutor, I think, hurt her,” said Conway. “In 2024, the country is in the mood for a candidate that has her background and can go on offense against Donald Trump.”
First, Harris has to reintroduce herself and, in the process, reassure moderates, Republicans looking to her said. While Conway,  Whitman and Shays all plan to vote for Harris, others may need more to come on board. 
And there are potential pitfalls awaiting her. Shays said he remains concerned about the rate of migration across the southern border, a swell that the vice president was tasked with curbing soon after taking office. Instead, numbers have skyrocketed, and Harris has been on defense, fighting back against the title of “border czar” that her team said was never the plan. Regardless, if Harris wants the top job, she can't wave off the concerns, Shays and others said.
“Immigration is a liability,” said Shays. “It’s the one challenge she has.” He said he hopes she tackles the issue head-on “and pursues common sense.”  
Asked by reporters about the “prosecutor vs. felon” message, Steven Cheung, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, quickly dismissed it. “Doesn’t matter,” he said. “Kamala Harris is soft on crime.”
Harris' pick for a running mate could also be a factor for some Republicans who might be swayed from Trump. 
“She’s got to pick a moderate,” said Amanda Stewart Sprowls, a former Nikki Haley supporter from Maricopa County, Arizona, who identifies as a “pro-choice moderate.”
She said Biden’s candidacy offered her a candidate whom she could get behind in 2020, and she is eager for this again. Stewart Sprowls said women she knows may have even considered Trump had he picked someone other than JD Vance, whom she perceives as an extremist on women’s issues. 
“If Trump had picked a moderate, this would have been in play,” she said.
Now Stewart Sprowls and others like her are looking to Harris and her vice presidential pick to offer a more balanced ticket. 
“I am definitely a Republican, but I cannot vote for Trump,” she said. “We just want normal.”
Whitman is clear-eyed about the challenge of putting at ease voters who may have reservations about Harris’s liberal record and stances. “It’s going to be tough,” Whitman said. “A lot’s going to depend on who she picks as vice president. Even though she’s not way-left, that’s how they’re going to paint her, and that’s how she’s going to be perceived.”
A “solid” vice presidential pick will save her from spending time on defense, helping to deflect any criticism, Whitman added. Katherine Doyle is a White House reporter for NBC News. "
NBC_15,Chipotle says restaurants will give bigger servings after complaints over measly portions,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/chipotle-ceo-says-restaurants-will-serve-bigger-portions-complaints-rcna163816,2024-07-27 00:00:02.779274,,"Tired of measly Chipotle bowls? The company's CEO said Wednesday all restaurants will serve bigger portions following social media complaints against the Mexican grill chain over smaller servings. 
Brian Niccol, the head of the company, said during an earnings call to investors that “there was never a directive to provide less to our customers,” but the company noticed the concerns about portion size on social media. 
“Getting the feedback caused us to relook at our execution across our entire system,” he said. “We have focused in on those outlier portion scores based on consumer surveys.”
He noted about 10% of restaurants were outliers that needed to be retrained up to the “right standards.” The chain has about 3,500 locations in the U.S. 
“We are re-emphasizing training and coaching round ensuring we are consistently making bowls and burritos correct. We have also leaned in and re-emphasized generous portions across all of our restaurants,” he added, noting that “it is a core brand equity of Chipotle.” 
He said the company is already beginning to see those actions “positively reflected” in consumer scores. 
Earlier this year, several people posted videos to TikTok complaining about Chipotle portions.
Food influencer Keith Lee made a video for his 16.3 million followers in May doing a taste test review of three items on the menu. In that clip, he complained about a lack of chicken in his bowl. 
Another TikToker, who goes by Jack’s Dining Room, said in a video also in May: “When I get a bowl and they give me two pieces of chicken, I’m like, ‘Can you just add one more scoop?’ and they’re like, ‘You want double meat?’ and I’m like, ‘No, I just want the chicken I asked for.’ ... Like, am I crazy? Is that not fair?”
Following a flurry of critical videos, some TikTok users began posting videos showing themselves recording Chipotle workers as they were making their food, insinuating the pressure of the camera yields bigger portions. However, that too faced backlash for harassing workers.
But the complaints do not appear to have hurt the company's business. Chipotle reported quarterly earnings and revenue Wednesday that topped analysts’ expectations as it saw higher traffic at its restaurants, bucking an industry slowdown.
Shares of the company rose about 13% in extended trading before losing most of those gains and settling around 3% higher. As of Wednesday’s close, Chipotle’s stock had slid 17% this month, hurt by investor concerns about the health of the restaurant industry. In late June, the company executed a 50-for-1 stock split.
Demand for its food peaked in April, Niccol said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Wednesday. Same-store sales settled around 6% higher in June. 
Traffic to its restaurants increased 8.7% despite the backlash on social media.Breaking News Reporter"
NBC_16,Sonya Massey autopsy report confirms she died from a gunshot wound to head,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sonya-massey-autopsy-report-released-confirms-died-gunshot-wound-head-rcna163803,2024-07-27 01:11:02.779274,,"An autopsy report released Friday confirmed that 36-year-old Sonya Massey died from a gunshot wound to the head after being shot by a Sangamon County deputy.
In a six-page document, the Sangamon County Coroner's Office says that Massey was shot beneath her left eye. 
""Based on the information available to me, and on the autopsy findings, it is my opinion that Sonya Massey ... died as a result of a gunshot wound to the head,"" the report states. 
Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Massey's family, said the findings confirm that ""this was just a senseless, unnecessary, excessive use of force."" 
""Completely unnecessary,"" he added. ""Certainly not justified. I mean, how can you justify this?"" 
Massey was shot inside of her Springfield, Illinois, home on July 6 after Sangamon County deputies responded to her 911 call about a possible prowler. 
Body camera video released Monday shows Deputy Sean Grayson and his partner speaking with Massey outside her home. The footage then shows the deputies inside.
Massey is seen in the video walking to her kitchen and taking a pot of boiling water off the stove. Grayson curses at Massey, telling her ""you better f---ing not. I swear to God I will f---ing shoot you right in your f---ing face."" Both deputies then scream at Massey to drop the pot before Grayson opens fire. 
Court records state that Grayson did not render aid after the shooting and discouraged his partner from doing so.
Grayson was fired by the department and indicted on charges of first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct. He pleaded not guilty at his arrangement last week and a judge ordered he remain in custody without bail. 
Sheriff Jack Campbell called Grayson's actions ""unjustifiable"" and ""reckless."" 
""Grayson had other options available that he should have used,"" Campbell said in a statement Monday after the body camera footage was released. ""His actions were inexcusable and do not reflect the values or training of our office. He will now face judgment by the criminal justice system and will never again work in law enforcement.""
Crump had said news of Grayson's firing and arrest was ""a step toward justice for Sonya's loved ones, especially her children, who have endured unimaginable pain and suffering since they were notified of this tragedy.""
An Illinois State Police summary of the shooting says that a car found at Massey's home appeared to have been broken into. The deputies found Massey to be ""distraught and not thinking clearly,"" according to the summary. 
Once inside her home, Grayson motioned to a container on the stove, the summary says. It says that Massey turned off the burner, picked up the pot, carried it to the sink and turned on the faucet. 
Massey asked the deputies what they were doing, according to the summary, and Grayson responded that he was moving away from the boiling water. 
""I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,"" Massey said twice, according to the summary. Grayson then threatened to shoot Massey in the face, it says. 
According to the summary, after Grayson drew his firearm and ordered Massey to drop the pot, she let go of it and ducked below a line of cabinets in the kitchen. 
Court documents state that she put her hands in the air and apologized before ducking. According to the summary, as Grayson approached her, she quickly stood, grabbed the pot and threw steaming hot water on a chair next to the cabinets. Grayson fired three times, striking her once in the face, it says.
Crump said Friday that Massey had struggled with her mental health. Weeks before her death, it was determined that her two children would live with their fathers while she sought help, he said. 
""She needed a helping hand, not a bullet to the face,"" Crump said. ""She just needed those officers to extend an ounce of humanity, not to kill her.""
Her son, Malachi Massey, told reporters that deputies had been to his mother's home on July 5, a day before the shooting. She drove herself to a hospital that day following an incident, he said. Massey said he did not know why deputies responded to the home or what happened before he arrived at his mother's home. 
""The whole week, before all of this happened, I had been trying to get her into a mental health [facility],"" he said.  
Raymond Massey, Sonya's uncle, remembered her as someone who was rarely angered.
""She was a beautiful Black queen,"" he said. ""She was the only family member, me and my wife were talking last night about, I’ve never once seen her angry or mad. She was always full of love and she loved her kids and God.""Minyvonne Burke is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News."
NBC_17,Team USA's Asian American table tennis stars say the sport is a sleeping giant,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/olympic-table-tennis-us-asia-respect-paris-2024-rcna162725,2024-07-27 00:00:02.779274,,"With Team USA table tennis heading to the Paris Olympics, its members are looking to net more love for their craft.
Members of the Olympic team say that though table tennis has long enjoyed popularity around the world, particularly in Asia, it continues to lack the respect and interest that basketball and other more mainstream sports command in the U.S. As the all-Asian American roster looks forward to playing on the world stage after Friday’s opening ceremony, pros Kanak Jha and Lily Zhang said they’re hoping to drive more awareness and smash misconceptions around the game. 
“A lot of people — they don’t really understand the sport, which is why they might not respect it as much as other traditionally American sports,” Zhang, 28, told NBC News. “They don’t realize how much physicality and athleticism and mental training goes into table tennis.”
Jha and Zhang, along with teammate Amy Wang, will begin competing Saturday, when the singles matches kick off, hoping to bring home the United States’ first medal in the sport.The all-Asian American team reflects table tennis’ popularity in the community, one that’s been growing for the past few decades. Experts have mentioned that as people from China, India and other Asian countries, who value the sport, immigrate to the U.S., their children are in large part leading the charge in drawing more eyes to it. They’ve led to more complexes being built and bigger dreams in the field. 
Still, however, most in the U.S., including some within the Asian American community, continue to regard table tennis as a hobby played in family basements or at bars, rather than a game that requires rigorous preparation, the athletes say. Jha, who moved to Europe at 15 years old to pursue table tennis professionally, said the sport involves heavily physical and tactical aspects. So his training regimen is no joke, involving a mix of “explosive” speed training and strength training like weightlifting. 
“Your legs need to be, in particular, extremely fast and explosive. And you require a lot of heavy rotation as well, especially because you’re rotating side to side. You need a very strong core,” Jha, 24, explained. “Everything is reacting in milliseconds. … A lot of athletes focus on their reaction time, they work on reflexes, they work on balance and coordination, they work on endurance.”
Zhang similarly said she maintains a strict regimen, practicing different drills that key in on footwork technique and game strategy in addition to regular hourslong sessions at the table. She also keeps a healthy diet, getting the protein, grains and carbs needed to perform, without forgetting the good stuff, she said. 
“As an Asian American, I feel like food is such an important part of our culture,” she said, laughing. “I like having a little treat for myself — going to get boba, Korean barbecue and hot pot.” 
When fans watch table tennis, it’s immediately apparent just how demanding and captivating it is, Zhang said. But part of what’s been holding the sport back is the lack of funding and media attention, she said. 
“I don’t know if it’s because we have never been able to medal in the sport,” Zhang said. “But then it becomes a cycle. If we don’t have the funding, it’s hard to improve and grow the sport to be able to medal. We can never really burst out of that bubble.” 
Jha noted that the sport is also much more difficult to access in the U.S. Without table tennis teams in schools to pique kids’ interest, many aspiring pros are left investing in coaches or seeking out clubs themselves. In his case, Jha, who is originally from Milpitas, California, said when he was starting out, his coach happened to have moved near his house. Later on, his parents gave him their blessing to move abroad to better pursue the sport. 
“There is a degree of luck involved — that you live in a place where there are clubs and perhaps there’s also coaches who are in a high-enough level to teach you proper technique, footwork and the technical skills involved,” Jha said. “It’s a private lesson-based sport in the beginning, which makes it not accessible to too many kids. They need parents that will financially invest in them.” 
Zhang said that with little publicized about the team, she’s endured some difficult moments at the table. 
“There’s a lot of misconceptions that we’re not true Americans. I’ve experienced a lot of comments from people or even on social media, where people were like, ‘Of course, the U.S. imported these people from China,’” Zhang said. “They don’t understand we were born here. We were raised here. We grew up here. We’re just as American as any other athlete on the team.” 
Now, she has a chance to help change that perception, one point at a time. 
“Being able to represent the U.S., if that even helps one young boy or young girl out there see me and realize that they can also do that, or feel more represented out there, I think that’s a beautiful thing,” Zhang said.

Most recently, 44-year-old Desiree Sanchez was erroneously released from the jail Wednesday. Sanchez was booked into the facility a week earlier on preventative detention for charges related to armed robbery and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, officials said in a news release. 
""MDC staff are working with local law enforcement officials in an effort to bring Sanchez back into custody,"" they said. 
An unidentified man was released from the facility on July 17 before fulfilling the pretrial services required for his conditional release. 
""MDC staff contacted the inmate and advised him of the outstanding release conditions,"" county officials said in a news release. ""He, in turn, reported to Pretrial Services and fulfilled the remaining requirements of his release.""
Another inmate, Anthony James Jaramillo, is also at large after he was released from MDC on July 3. 
""MDC learned of the erroneous release after Metro Court officials notified facility staff on Wednesday, July 10,"" Bernalillo County officials said in a statement.
Local law enforcement are looking for Jaramillo, who was brought to the facility for a felony charge of possession of a controlled substance. 
The MDC's Office of Professional Standards is investigating all three incidents, according to county officials. 
They added that a “new protocol” ordering a double-check of inmates’ release information was implemented following the July 17 incident. Bernalillo County officials have not responded to questions about how another inmate could be mistakenly released after improved protocol was put in place. Breaking news reporter"

Vance doubles down on 'cat ladies' dig, says Democrats' future controlled by childless people",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/jd-vance-doubles-childless-cat-ladies-dig-got-nothing-cats-rcna163857,2024-07-27 03:07:02.753319,,"Sen. JD Vance, the Republican nominee for vice president, is doubling down on remarks he made in 2021 about ""childless cat ladies"" running the country that sparked backlash this week.
Vance told ""The Megyn Kelly Show"" in an interview that aired Friday: “Obviously, it was a sarcastic comment. I’ve got nothing against cats"" and then blamed the media for ""focusing so much on the sarcasm and not on the substance of what I actually said.”
Vance made the remarks in 2021 on Tucker Carlson's Fox News show, referring to Vice President Kamala Harris, now the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, as one of the “childless cat ladies” running the nation who “want to make the rest of the country miserable too."" 
The Ohio Republican added, ""If you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children.”
Vance told Kelly in Friday's interview, “It’s not a criticism of people who don’t have children. I explicitly said in my remarks ... this is not about criticizing people who for various reasons don’t have kids. This is about criticizing the Democratic Party for becoming anti-family and anti-child.”
Vance also accused the media of wanting ""to attack me and [wanting] me to back down,"" before adding that ""what this is fundamentally about [is] the Democrats in the past five to 10 years, Megyn, they have become anti-family.""
Vance's 2021 remarks resurfaced this week and quickly drew criticism from celebrities, politicians and members of Harris' family. Some of the criticism drew comparisons between Vance's ""childless"" comments and his stance on abortion rights and reproductive health care.
Earlier this week, after Vance's 2021 comments resurfaced, actress Jennifer Aniston was one of the highest-profile names to criticize the senator, posting on her Instagram Stories: ""I truly can’t believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States.""
""All I can say is ... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too,"" Aniston added.
Harris' stepdaughter, Ella Emhoff also posted on Instagram, writing ""How can you be ‘childless’ when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I?,"" referring to her brother Cole Emhoff.
Ella Emhoff added, ""I love my three parents.""
Her comments were posted over an image of a statement her mother, Kerstin Emhoff, gave to news outlets, saying: ""For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I. She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it.”Alexandra Marquez is a politics reporter for NBC News.

NBC_21,How to clean your window air conditioner,https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/how-to-clean-window-air-conditioner-rcna163835,2024-07-27 03:02:02.753319,,"We don’t always have the answers, but we have some people on speed dial who do — which is why we present to you our series FYI where we have experts explain if lip balm is actually bad, how often you should wash your hair and more. 
Similar to buying a mattress, shopping for a powerful air conditioner is a great, albeit pricey, way to make a home feel complete. This is especially true if you don’t have central air and rely on a window unit to get you through the sweltering summer heat. If you want to make sure your appliance keeps your home cool for years to come and doesn’t develop potentially harmful bacteria, it’s important to know how to clean your window air conditioner. “Cleaning your window air conditioner helps prevent mold/mildew and other debris from building up and helps to keep the air blowing into the room cleaner,” says Carl Prouty, a sales specialist at Abt Appliances and Electronics. “Generally you’ll want to clean the entire unit once a year, and you’ll want to clean the filter every 2-4 weeks throughout.” 
To find the best way to clean a window air conditioner, I spoke with Prouty and Mike Mayer, co-founder of the air conditioner brand Windmill, for their guidance and product recommendations. 
There are many different types of air conditioners available, such as window, portable and large outdoor units. For this article, I’m mainly focusing on window air conditioners. I’m going to stick to more of a surface-level clean of your window air conditioning unit, such as cleaning the outside parts and the filter as well as removing dust, rather than a more in-depth clean that might require taking the inside of the air conditioner apart, cleaning out the coil, etc. Some units even have a light that turns on when the filter of the air conditioner needs to be cleaned, according to Prouty. If you want to do a more thorough cleaning of your entire air conditioning unit, I’d recommend consulting an HVAC expert to ensure you don’t accidentally damage the unit in the process. 
There are a few easy steps to follow when cleaning your window air conditioner at home. Here’s how our experts recommend going about it:
All of the products below have at least a 4-star average rating from 500 reviews or more on Amazon and/or are cleaning products I or other NBC Select staff members have tried themselves. Some of the products are also ones that experts have recommended for similar cleaning stories. 
A handheld vacuum is helpful when cleaning small messes, especially ones on upholstered surfaces like couches. It also happens to be good at removing the dust from your air conditioner’s filter. While you can manually remove the dust from the filter directly into your trash can, you’ll probably end up with dust blowing into the air and a filter that’s still not thoroughly clean. This powerful and cordless Black & Decker Dustbuster Cordless Handheld Vacuum has a 4.4-star average rating from 51,799 reviews on Amazon. It also has multiple attachments as well as a dirt bowl you can clean in the sink.
Small cleaning brushes are sometimes the best way to clean the small crevices in and around your air conditioning unit, including the side panels and the surrounding window sill, which tends to collect a lot of debris. This set, which has a 4.3-star average rating from 15,793 reviews on Amazon, includes a curved brush, a small bristled brush with a dustpan and a gap tool for cleaning in between the vent of the air conditioner grill. 
These cleaning cloths are great for wiping down areas all over your home, including your air conditioning unit. I’ve used these before and they’re the perfect size for cleaning the outside of a window air conditioner by hand. All you have to do is dampen it slightly with water and/or use it to dry off the filter after cleaning it. They’re extremely absorbent, lint- and scratch-free and you can clean them in the washing machine. 
This popular item is great for so much more than cleaning dishes. It’s commonly recommended by cleaning experts for tasks like cleaning the inside of your refrigerator or cleaning the filter of your dishwasher. You can also use it to clean the filter of your air conditioner once you remove it from the unit. Spray it on, scrub and thoroughly rinse before allowing it to dry. 
While a lot of window air conditioners differ in style, design and energy level (known as BTU, or British thermal units), many have the same parts. Below, I briefly explain some of the parts of a window air conditioner, mainly the ones you’d clean in a surface-level job. 
In terms of cleaning a window air conditioner, no, it’s not recommended to spray water or other liquids directly onto or into the unit. That’s because it could potentially damage important parts inside. “A soft cloth with warm water and a mild cleaner will do the trick,” says Mayer. “Just be sure the air conditioner is unplugged and that no water or liquid gets inside the vents.”
Our experts recommend against using any harsh chemicals such as bleach or all-purpose cleaner to clean your air conditioner. Like with water in general, these products can damage and corrode the unit, according to Mayer. “An aggressive cleaner can corrode key internal parts, like the evaporator. And, depending on the unit, could damage the metal or plastic housing,” he says. “For the filter, just use warm water under the sink.”
You don’t have to change your air conditioner’s filter (unless it’s broken), but you should clean it out regularly, according to Mayer. “We recommend cleaning the reusable mesh filter once every month during the summer season,” he says. “If the filter is not cleaned properly, the AC won’t be able to pull in the room air efficiently, and the unit can break.”

NBC_22,"Boar's Head recalls more than 207,000 pounds of meat due to listeria concerns",https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/boars-head-recall-deli-meat-listeria-rcna163797,2024-07-27 04:00:02.869542,,"Boar’s Head has recalled more than 207,000 pounds of deli meat, including liverwurst and ham products sold nationwide, because they may contain the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes.
The company initiated the recall after liverwurst at a store in Maryland tested positive for listeria. The sample was collected as part of an investigation into a multistate listeria outbreak that had sickened 34 people across 13 states as of Thursday. 
All but one of those people were hospitalized and two died: a patient in Illinois and another in New Jersey.
Health authorities say the outbreak is most likely linked to sliced meat sold at deli counters, as many of those affected reported eating  items like turkey, liverwurst or ham.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service, which announced the recall Friday, said further testing is ongoing to determine if the Maryland sample is connected to the outbreak.
The recall includes Boar’s Head ready-to-eat liverwurst produced from June 11 to July 17 (view the product labels here), as well as other deli meat products that were manufactured on the same machinery around the same time, such as beef salami, bologna and ham.
A Board’s Head spokesperson said the company is conducting its own investigation and cooperating with government authorities.
“The health and safety of our customers is our top priority. As soon as a Listeria adulteration was confirmed in our Strassburger Brand Liverwurst, we immediately and voluntarily recalled the product,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
“Out of an abundance of caution, we also made the decision to voluntarily recall additional products that were produced on the same line and on the same day as the liverwurst product.”
People who bought the affected products should throw them away or return them to the store, and also clean out their refrigerators, the USDA said, since the bacteria can grow in cold temperatures and spread to other foods.
Listeria is the third-leading cause of death from food poisoning in the U.S. 
Symptoms usually appear within two weeks of eating contaminated food, but they can sometimes develop right away or up to 10 weeks later. The initial signs include fever, muscle aches, tiredness, headache, stiff neck and confusion. In severe cases, the bacteria may cause a blood infection or meningitis.
The infection is most dangerous for people who are older or have weakened immune systems. Pregnant people with listeriosis can pass the infection to a developing fetus, increasing the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth or premature birth.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises those who are pregnant or otherwise vulnerable to avoid foods with a high risk of listeria contamination, such as deli meat, smoked seafood and soft cheeses made with unpasteurized milk. 
Most healthy people who get infected don't become seriously ill, however. 
“For every one case that gets reported, there’s 15, 20, 25 cases that go unreported because there’s so many people who get sick and they go, ‘Oh, it’s a stomach bug, I’ll get over it,’” said Darin Detwiler, a professor of food regulatory policy at Northeastern University.
Sliced deli meat is considered high risk for a few reasons: For one, listeria that enters a manufacturing facility spreads easily among equipment and surfaces. Second, the meat is often stored in refrigerators and consumed cold, so there's not enough heat to kill the bacteria. 
Deli meat poses a lower risk if reheated until steaming hot or to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.
Detwiler said no company is immune to failures in food safety. In theory, he said, even “a small error when it comes to sanitation in a production facility can result in what we’re seeing play out right now.""
The CDC estimates that around 1,600 people get listeriosis each year, and about 260 die. Most cases aren't linked to outbreaks, but there are usually a few outbreaks in a given year.
Earlier this year, the CDC identified a listeria outbreak linked to queso fresco and cotija cheese that led to 23 hospitalizations and two deaths.Aria Bendix is the breaking health reporter for NBC News Digital."
NBC_23,'Make Bitcoin Great Again': Specter of Trump — and absence of Harris — hangs over annual crypto gathering,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/bitcoin-crypto-conference-nashville-trump-speech-what-happened-details-rcna163418,2024-07-27 06:37:02.626987,,"NASHVILLE — Charlene Brown arrived at the first full day of Bitcoin 2024 at the Music City Center convention complex with two signs in hand: “Orange Man Good” and “Bitcoin Don.” 
Similar symbols of a recent and sudden shift in the politics of bitcoin could be spotted elsewhere in the Nashville crowd. “Make Bitcoin Great Again” caps — not to mention knockoff “Make America Great Again” hats that eventually were seized by organizers for violating conference rules — dotted the convention hall as the year’s biggest bitcoin event got rolling. 
Brown, who publishes Tokens Magazine, a pro-cryptocurrency publication, was perhaps the most visibly pro-Trump bitcoin advocate at the Nashville confab.
“I love that we now have a president who supports Bitcoin,” said Brown, referring to former President Donald Trump. “Now everyone is jumping on the bandwagon,” she said. 
Interviews with others in attendance confirmed a clear, if less outwardly apparent, support of the former president. 
Bitcoin Conference, a long-running event centered around the most popular cryptocurrency, has taken on national significance virtually overnight thanks to Trump’s recent embrace of bitcoin. Starting Friday and running through the weekend, the schedule is dotted with GOP power players.
Trump is slated to deliver an address on Saturday, just weeks after he officially made supporting cryptocurrencies an official plank of the GOP’s platform. He will be preceded by one current and three prospective Republican elected officials: South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, Pennsylvania Senate candidate Bernie Moreno, Nevada Senate candidate Sam Brown and Massachusetts Senate candidate John Deaton.  
Plenty of other high-profile Republicans are scheduled to speak, including former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy and Sens. Marsha Blackburn, Bill Hagerty and Cynthia Lummis. Representative Ro Khanna of California was the only high-profile Democrat on the agenda.  
The speaker list reflects the growing coterie of the crypto world and tech writ large that has taken a hard-right turn. Other prominent crypto investors now backing Trump include Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, co-founders of Gemini crypto exchange; and Elon Musk, a longtime crypto fan who has also begun aggressively backing the GOP candidate. 
The conference also welcomed Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is making  a third-party run for president. He pledged to build a reserve of 4 million bitcoins — worth about $272 billion as of Friday — if elected.
Some in the GOP have also floated building a U.S. bitcoin reserve, pitching it as akin to the government’s strategic reserves of oil and other precious commodities.
Silicon Valley was also instrumental in selecting JD Vance as Trump’s running mate; the Ohio Senator disclosed in 2021 that he owned $100,000-worth of bitcoin and has called crypto “one of the few sectors of our economy where conservatives and other free thinkers can operate without pressure from the social justice mob.”
The crypto crowd has historically been skeptical of politicians and institutions thanks in part to its origins among the cypherpunk community, which embraced the technology as a way to use the internet to embrace decentralization. But with the perception among many in the cryptocurrency community that the Biden administration has stifled the technology, convention attendees told NBC News that Trump would be a step in the right direction.
“With Trump, it’s not even that he’s necessarily pro-Bitcoin — it’s just that he’s going to be willing to allow it to even exist,” said Adam McBride, a crypto entrepreneur based in Costa Rica. McBride compared the current administration’s stance to being “held underwater, not allowing us to breathe.”
Trump, too, once kept the community at arms length, at one point saying he was “not a fan” of crypto.
But he signaled a sea change last month when he announced his support of the Bitcoin mining industry; pledged to commute the sentence of the founder of the Silk Road online underground marketplace; and wrote his support of crypto in the GOP’s 2024 platform. 
“We will end Democrats’ unlawful and unAmerican Crypto crackdown and oppose the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency,” the platform document states, referring to discussion of creating a centralized digital token, an idea that has sparked vigorous opposition by crypto supporters. “We will defend the right to mine Bitcoin, and ensure every American has the right to self-custody of their Digital Assets, and transact free from Government Surveillance and Control,” the document reads. 
Crypto enthusiasts say Trump has said all the right things so far — but some conference attendees said they were still not ready to proclaim that crypto has gone fully MAGA.
Garett Curran, an associate at Qubic Labs, a Boston-based organization that supports blockchain and Web3 technology companies, said Trump’s appearance showed there was an opportunity to overturn the current regulatory posture of the U.S. government, which many in the crypto world see as overly restrictive.  
But he also mentioned the prospect of more positive overtures toward the community from Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, referring to recent remarks in Politico from Mark Cuban, who said people in the vice president’s orbit have signaled a greater openness to crypto. 
“The bitcoin community actually has power,” Curran said.  
And a handful of attendees said that despite Trump’s newfound embrace of crypto, they still could not in good conscience support him.  
Sarai Mora, a multimedia artist known as “Creatress” and who gave a live art performance at a nearby bar Thursday night, said that Trump’s other views remained antithetical to her own as a woman of Mexican descent.
“I’m hoping the female candidate wins — it’s time to try something new,” she said. “I’m not saying anyone’s perfect, but I think it’s time to try something different.” Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com."
NBC_24,Harvard’s fencing program aims to show off its meteoric rise in Paris,https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/olympics/harvards-fencing-program-charging-olympics-scene-8-athletes-set-compet-rcna162240,2024-07-27 06:27:02.626987,,"Harvard University is known for a lot of things — but being an Olympic powerhouse hasn’t always made that list.
However, its fencing program has been dominating a niche in the sports world. Of the 20 fencers headed to the Olympics for the U.S., six are past, current or soon-to-be Harvard athletes. And two more Harvard fencers are set to compete in Paris as part of Canada’s national team.
Of the six Crimson athletes on the U.S. team, four are alumni — three of whom graduated only two months ago — one is a rising college senior and the other is a high schooler committed to the university. 
While the Ivy League athletic conference has generally ruled the fencing world, Harvard was a relative underdog until recently. The eight Harvard fencers going to the Olympics this year outnumber the seven previously sent in the school’s entire history.
The six Harvard-affiliated athletes who will represent the U.S. are Lauren Scruggs, Eli Dershwitz, Filip Dolegiewicz, Colin Heathcock, Mitchell Saron and Elizabeth Tartakovsky.
At the center of the program’s newfound success is a former Ivy League fencer turned coach who has reconceptualized the program’s core approach to the sport.
Daria Schneider, an athlete representative for the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Harvard’s new fencing head coach, said her philosophy to creating a good athlete is synonymous with forming a good person.
Schneider, a five-time national team member and World Fencing Championships bronze medalist, fenced for Columbia University as a student. She became the first female coach of a men’s fencing team when she took the role at Cornell University in 2016.
In 2019, she took over the Harvard program. Shortly before that, the team had been under scrutiny as allegations that the former coach had accepted more than a million dollars in kickbacks in exchange for recruiting students to Harvard’s team.
(That coach, Peter Brand, was arrested and indicted on bribery charges in 2020 and acquitted two years later.)
In the four years since Schneider took over, the program won its second national title and has changed its approach to training, focusing more on working with athletes' existing strengths, strict conditioning and mental health. 
There isn’t a secret formula to the school's success, Schneider said. A combination of little things add up to a different coaching panorama than the one Schneider knew as an athlete.
“I would say that it’s more creating an environment where there is opportunities for people to both figure out what they need to do to be training at the highest level they can,” Schneider said.
Fencing coaching at the collegiate level had previously focused on getting athletes to fit a specific mold. Schneider and her staff have rethought that.
“One of my main considerations as a head coach, and something I really asked my coaching staff to focus on, is what are ways we can help someone become a better version of themselves as a fencer without trying to remold them into some specific image of what we think makes the best fencer,” Schneider said. “We don’t break them down and remake them with the type of technique we think is best or the exact on guard position that we think is best.”
Still, Schneider says, her coaching is more strict than others on preventative physical therapy and mental toughness, which she  describes as a way of preparing for a rainy day mentally.
“A lot of people who are starting to achieve mastery in something will seek out the ‘flow state,’” Schneider said. “And we do not seek out the flow state.”
“We prepare ourselves mostly for the days we will not enter a flow state,” she said.
Among the athletes expected to compete in Paris is Lauren Scruggs, a junior at Harvard.
Scruggs, who specializes in foil, is one of two Black U.S. fencers — male or female — to have won an individual world title. 
A first-time Olympian, Scruggs has had a busy summer leading to  Paris. Not only because of her preparation for the Games, but also because she is working as a full-time intern in wealth management.
Scruggs said having multiple things going on outside of the sport helps her keep focus.
""You get too messed up when you're solely focused on something,"" she said.
Scruggs maintains the same attitude as a college athlete, taking a full course load while balancing her fencing responsibilities. To her, like Schneider, it’s about balance and viewing students as a whole person rather than as an athlete first.
She met Schneider during her first Worlds competition, when Schneider was captain of the fencing team. They kept in touch, and when the time came to choose a college, Scruggs picked Harvard in large part because of Schneider’s recruiting efforts.
Still, it was a leap of faith. Harvard was not yet the fencing powerhouse it is in 2024.
One of the former assistant coaches at Harvard will also be repping Team USA in Paris. Dershwitz, a contender for medaling in men’s saber, coached Harvard athletes under Schneider.
Schneider praised Derwshitz as a leader.
“It is so rare in a sport like ours where it’s mostly individual that someone takes as much pride and and takes it as personally as he does, how the team does,” Schneider said. “Sometimes you might get someone who’s a very good team fencer, and maybe they perform really well on the team and they’re a great team leader, team captain, but they don’t quite have the individual results that they’re able to help the team achieve — and he does both.”
The job is not done yet for the U.S. fencers, though. 
The U.S. has only won multiple fencing medals at six Olympic Games — including two at the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Olympics, six at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and its record of 10 at the 1904 St. Louis Games. 
But in Paris, it has a chance to challenge and even surpass that Beijing total with medal contenders in the team events, as well as men’s individual foil, men’s individual saber, and women’s individual foil.
This year’s fencing team is the strongest American team in recent Olympic history.
Five of the six American disciplines (all but men’s epee) finished the 2022-2023 season ranked in the top five, according to the International Fencing Federation standings.
The men’s saber team of four is made up entirely of Harvard athletes, including Dershwitz. 
He will see a tough battle against Hungary’s reigning Olympic saber champion, Aron Szilagyi, who could join Michael Phelps and only a few other Olympians who have won the same individual event four times.
Dershwitz defeated Szilagyi during the semifinals of the 2023 World Championships. If Dershwitz comes out victorious, he would be the first American to win gold for men’s saber in the history of the sport."
NBC_25,Sonya Massey's family questions how deputy was hired given past: 'There were so many red flags',https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sonya-masseys-family-questions-deputy-was-hired-many-red-flags-rcna163872,2024-07-27 06:16:02.626987,,"Sonya Massey’s family questioned how the deputy charged in her death was hired by the Sangamon County Sheriff’s Office after he had been employed by six agencies in a four-year period, admitted to driving under the influence and was the subject of two previous complaints.
“I feel like he never should’ve been hired,” Massey’s cousin, Shadia Massey, said Friday in an interview with NBC News. “How did he even ... reach this point?”
Massy’s uncle, Raymond Massey, said “there were so many red flags.”
Former Sangamon County deputy Sean Grayson was indicted on charges of first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct in Massey’s death. He pleaded not guilty last week was ordered to remain in custody without bail.
The Sangamon County Sheriff on Friday said that the deputy’s application was reviewed and certified by the state’s Merit Commission. 
“He was also interviewed by more than one person,” Sheriff Jack Campbell said. “The Illinois Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board (ILETSB) reviewed the information, which included the DUI convictions. ILETSB certified Grayson for hire and advised that he had been certified several times in the past despite the history of the DUIs.  Grayson passed a drug test, criminal background check, and psychological evaluation and graduated from a 16-week training academy before serving as a Sangamon County Deputy.”
 Grayson was indicted on charges of first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct in Massey’s death. He pleaded not guilty last week was ordered to remain in custody without bail.
Grayson worked at six agencies since 2020, including short stints as a part-time officer at three small Illinois police departments and full-time employment at two sheriff’s offices and one police department.
Records provided by four of his previous employers do not include any complaints or disciplinary action against Grayson.
He was disciplined, however, during his tenure at the Logan County Sheriff’s Office after he hit a deer with his squad car during a chase that violated department policy, according to records from that department. (NBC News requested records from all six departments but received them from only five agencies.)
Personnel records from the Logan County Sheriff’s Office also show that two people filed complaints against Grayson. One woman accused him of “inappropriate” behavior during her arrest, while her fiancé, an inmate at the county jail, accused Grayson of “abusing his power” and harassment when Grayson questioned the man in jail.
Grayson denied any wrongdoing in both complaints, which are marked as “unfounded” in his file.
The records state that he left the Logan County Sheriff’s Office in “good standing.”
Before his employment in Logan County, Grayson worked simultaneous part-time jobs at police departments in Kincaid and Pawnee. Kincaid Police Chief DJ Mathon said he was let go by the Village of Kincaid Board in May 2021 when he refused to live within a 10-mile radius of the village.
He was hired by a department in Virden shortly after he left Kincaid and while still working at Pawnee, records show. Grayson worked in Virden for several months and left for unknown reasons. A department official said Grayson “just stopped covering shifts.”
His separation date from the Virden Police Department was December 2021, a few months after he began working at a department in Auburn. On his application for Auburn, Grayson said he left Virden to become a full-time officer.
He left Auburn in May 2022 and worked in Logan County for a little less than a year before joining the Sangamon County Sheriff’s Office, records show. Grayson was fired from Sangamon County on July 17, nearly two weeks after he fatally shot Massey in her Springfield home while responding to her 911 call about a possible prowler.
Shadia Massey said that stricter background checks should be required for officers.
“I feel the department needs to have different policies and protocols,” Raymond Massey added. “I mean, he would not have been hired. I mean, I think everyone agrees with that.”
Records further show that Grayson was a wheeled vehicle mechanic in the Army and separated under alleged “misconduct, (serious offense).” It’s not clear what led to his discharge.
Grayson also had some run-ins with the law. According to court records, he twice pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of driving under the influence of alcohol, in 2015 and 2016.
Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Massey’s family, said at a news conference Friday that questions surrounding Grayson’s past and how he was able to get hired will “only get louder.” 
“With the two DUIs, with the reprimand from the Army over serious misconduct, with the six different law enforcement agencies in four years ... were there red flags missed? And should he have been hired in the first place by the sheriff’s department?” Crump said.Minyvonne Burke is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News.

NBC_26,Harris could present a new challenge for Netanyahu: From the Politics Desk,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/harris-new-challenge-netanyahu-israel-politics-desk-rcna163886,2024-07-27 06:12:02.626987,,"Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the campaign trail, the White House and Capitol Hill.
In today’s edition, chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell explores the new dynamic between Vice President Kamala Harris and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Plus, we look at how JD Vance spent his first full week as Donald Trump's running mate on defense.
Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to Washington expecting a platform for his Gaza policy. 
Instead, he found all attention in the U.S. was on President Joe Biden’s decision to end his campaign — and the new Democratic front-runner, Vice President Kamala Harris, who has placed more emphasis on how Israel conducts the war and its devastating toll on civilians than Biden has, at least until recently.
And when the Israeli leader got to the White House for an Oval Office meeting he had been seeking for more than three years, the price was a second session listening to the complaints of American hostage families. They had already called his visit “political theater,” saying he should have stayed in Israel to focus on getting their loved ones home.
The wily Israeli politician also may have gone too far in publicly trying to tip the scales of the U.S. election. After maneuvering to be invited by the Republican House speaker to deliver a speech to Congress — an unprecedented fourth by a foreign head of state — he made a side trip to Mar-a-Lago on Friday and sat quietly at a televised photo opportunity as Trump called Harris a “radical left person” and a “destroyer,” adding that he didn’t know how a person who is Jewish could vote for her.
Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, is Jewish and has been making speeches around the U.S. decrying the rise in antisemitism. Netanyahu also did not object when his hard-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, endorsed former President Donald Trump’s candidacy this week, a breach of protocol.
As for Harris, who had only met Netanyahu once before when she visited Israel as a senator in 2017, she showed her own political toughness in their first face-to-face matchup. After their meeting, Harris — not her Israeli visitor — made remarks, delivering a pointed summary of their talks. She went on television to declare her commitment to the defense of Israel, but emphasized that the war needed to end because of the catastrophic toll on the civilian population. A senior Israeli official later criticized the vice president anonymously to reporters, accusing her of overly stressing the importance of ending the war.
But in the end, Netanyahu may have been outmaneuvered by a rare American politician he barely knew. Harris’ approach toward balancing military goals versus rescuing the hostages is more in tune with public opinion in the U.S. and Israel than the veteran Israeli leader’s.
Sen. JD Vance has not had much of a honeymoon. 
In his first week on the campaign trail as Trump’s running mate, the Ohio Republican had to compete for attention with a shake-up atop the Democratic ticket.
Much of the buzz surrounding Vance has ranged from distracting to unflattering. Progressives pounced on his nearly 3-year-old comments about “childless cat ladies” — a critique he extended to Harris, a stepmother of two. Pundits dwelled on polling data that suggested many voters are not yet sold on Vance. Others engaged in largely baseless speculation about whether Trump was already regretting his choice for vice president.
Meanwhile, left-leaning activists and internet personalities have been hammering Vance on social media, mostly ignoring Trump in the process. And Harris’ fledgling White House campaign has kept a particularly sharp focus on the No. 2 candidate on the GOP ticket. The headline of one campaign news release Friday attacked Vance for his anti-abortion views and pronounced him a “creep.”
Running mate rollouts and nominating conventions are two of the best opportunities for a presidential campaign to earn a bounty of positive news coverage, as well as a bounce with voters. Polling shortly after Biden picked Harris as his running mate in 2020, for example, found that a majority of voters approved of the selection, providing a jolt to their campaign.
But a New York Times/Siena poll of registered voters after last week’s Republican National Convention found that 38% of the respondents — a plurality — had a somewhat or very unfavorable view of Vance. Early reviews were more positive in 2016 for Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence, who scored a net favorable rating in a Gallup poll at the time.
A Republican strategist, speaking on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment, said Vance is in danger of violating the basic requirement of a running mate: “Rule No. 1 of being VP is do no harm.”
“It’s going from Double-A baseball to the major leagues,” the strategist added. “There’s an adjustment period. Some people can handle it and some people can’t.”

Four rockets struck Thursday near Ain al-Asad airbase in Iraq, which houses U.S. troops, but there were no reported injuries, and there was no damage to the base, Fox News has learned. 
A U.S. defense official told Fox News none of the rockets landed inside the base. 
The attack comes just days after U.S. and Iraqi officials met at a Pentagon summit to discuss when the coalition against ISIS in Iraq could end and transition to a bilateral security relationship with some U.S. troops likely remaining.

Iraqi factions aligned with Iran have called on all 2,500 U.S. troops that remain in the country to withdraw. 
The attack on the airbase also comes just one day after fighter jets intercepted two Russian Tu-95 ""Bear"" bombers and two Chinese H-6 bombers off the coast of Alaska.

FOX_2,GREG GUTFELD: We didn't get any answers from Biden's Oval Office address,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/greg-gutfeld-we-didnt-get-any-answers-from-bidens-oval-office-address,2024-07-26 12:03:02.639584,opinion,"'Gutfeld!' reacts to President Biden's Oval Office address following his withdrawal from the 2024 race.
So last night, in a primetime address from the Oval Office, Joe Biden said it was time to step aside, which is the most exercise he's had in a while. In the roughly ten minute address, Biden attempted to list his accomplishments. That left him with ten minutes. 
During the address, Biden said he's passing the torch to the next generation, but is that really necessary? It's not like young Democrats haven't already been doing a phenomenal job burning everything to the ground. Of course, Joe has a long history with fire. Whenever he's in the room, people are always lighting matches. But still, he's passing the torch. Guess he doesn't want to be cremated, or maybe he does. Skeptics claim the address wasn't live because the time on his watch didn't seem to match the time of the speech. But at this point, who really knows?
BIDEN ENDS BID FOR 2ND TERM IN WHITE HOUSE AS HE DROPS OUT OF HIS 2024 REMATCH WITH TRUMP
The White House aides are just excited that Joe Biden outlived his watch battery. They had a camera during the speech on several of Joe's family members, including his kids, Hunter and Ashley, and wife Jill. Keeping them off camera was the only way to ensure Hunter kept his clothes on. 
Meanwhile, Biden's seventh grandchild, Navy, was there, too, about 750 miles off camera. If you were looking for any answers from Joe Biden's address last night, fat chance, he never answers questions. He only generates more of them. Here's one. Why did his team give him the same spray tan as Trump? He looks like he's wearing a ‘Biden’ mask. He looks like a jack o'lantern in the hot sun with a burnt out candle. Was the local embalmer going on vacation and told Jill, hey, I better put a coat on him in case something happens while I'm in Aruba. 
As for the point of the speech, good luck finding one. He's doing so great, that he asked to withdraw just to end on a high note. Hey, my life's so great, I think I'll just kill myself. Joe talked about George Washington, Abe Lincoln, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, but he seems more like William Henry Harrison, or Zachary Taylor, or Warren Hardy. He talked about honesty, decency, respect and other things he couldn't pronounce and rarely practiced. Hell, he could have talked about skydiving, pole-vaulting, and power lifting, and it would have been more believable. As usual, he promised to tell us the truth. He would've crossed his fingers, but he can't. Here's a whopper.
GOP SENATOR DEMANDS CABINET INVOKE 25TH AMENDMENT AGAINST BIDEN AFTER SUSPENDING HIS RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN 
PRESIDENT BIDEN: We're also securing our border. Border crossings are lower today than when the previous administration left office.
No. At this point, viewers wish they got shot in the ear. What he didn't do is answer the one question on everyone's mind, well, besides, are you wearing pants behind that desk? Why did you drop out of the race on Twitter but still stay on as president? He didn't say. I mean, that's like making a speech about the sexiest TV host without mentioning me. He did say something about passing the torch to a new generation, which we all know is a JFK line. Well, if he came in plagiarizing, might as well go out that way too.
So he's passing the torch, but more like passing the wind. Joe's staying, because although the presidency is in a kingdom, it's about saving democracy. He uttered democracy seven times, and each time it meant less and less. He did to the word democracy what TuPac did to the n-word. But it's just his way of saying Trump is a threat to democracy without being blamed if another nut shoots him. 
AFTER BIDEN DROPS OUT OF RACE, DOCTORS REVEAL WHY THE DECISION MAY HAVE BEEN BEST FOR HIS HEALTH
Did you see D.C. yesterday? The party that keeps promising to save democracy sure does love to attack people and vandalize ---- and also not have fair primaries. The party that wants to save democracy pushes illegals to vote, which diminishes yours. It eliminates safe spaces for women, bans gas stoves and one day, cars, and suppresses stories on social media if they hint at dissent. 
Meanwhile, they expand the rights of criminals, which limits your freedoms to live. So Biden all but admits he's too old to run, but not too old to be president. They can't come up with a good excuse for him leaving the race without it, meaning he must resign, but also, he's got too much left to do. Perhaps because he didn't do squat while in office. He even promised to cure cancer by January.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: I will keep fighting for my cancer moonshot so we can end cancer as we know it, because we can do it.
No, no you're not. The only thing he's going to do in the next six months is scrape his dinner plate into his sock drawer and try to turn the TV on by pointing his shoe at it. No, I bet he accidentally votes for Trump. So he mangled the scripted speech, even forgetting what sentences were even about. Like this mulch.
JOE BIDEN WITH COVID AT AGE 81: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE RISK THE VIRUS POSES TO OLDER ADULTS
PRESIDENT BIDEN: And that day I told you as I stood in that... winter... we are stood in a winter of peril and winter of possibilities. Peril and possibilities.
He sounds like a ---- faced weatherman. And and we're supposed to be fine with him continuing to serve as president. He couldn't serve as a coat rack, but still the media fond.
NBC: This was a speech for the history books, just as when LBJ announced he wasn't going to run for reelection in 1968. And we have seen those clips played and replayed throughout time. This is the type of speech that will be replayed for decades to come.
Yeah. Replayed for decades at medical schools to teach students what dementia looks like, continue.
CNN: Yes. The question, does character still matter? Well, it does tonight. It does tonight. The kid with a stutter did good. He did good. That's a good man. He fell on the sword. He fell on his sword.
CNN: This moment puts him, you know, with a bunch of American greats. You know, the sort of George Washington's of the world.
MSNBC: This was selfless on a level I think that's important in a way that we talk about George Washington being selfless.
BIDEN HEALTH CONCERNS PERSIST AS HE MAKES FIRST APPEARANCE AFTER ENDING CAMPAIGN
No, no, no. The only thing he has in common with George Washington is body temperature. If the media spent any more time on their knees, they'd be stars on Pornhub. What does Doctor Jill think about all this? The one who hid him from the public and the sun. She tweeted: Thank you for the trust you put in Joe. Now it's time to put that trust in Kamala. Then she fled to France to watch the Olympics. Well, she is a fan of the deadlift. So the woman who lied to us about Joe's health wants us to trust the other woman who lied to us about Joe's health. Sorry, I've been lied to by women enough. Not to mention people who told me they were women. But you know what the family did afterward? They all had ice cream, which is what you do after you get your tonsils out. The problem is this tonsil is still there, a lump of tissue that gets easily infected and one you can easily do without.

Gen. Jack Keane reacts to Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to joint meeting of Congress on 'Your World.'
JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is slated to meet former President Trump on Friday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in an effort to repair a fractured relationship.
After President Biden defeated Trump in the 2020 presidential election, Netanyahu congratulated President-elect Biden, prompting Trump to call out the Israeli leader and was quoted as saying ""I haven’t spoken to him since,"" according to comments released from an interview with Israeli journalist Barak Ravid. ""F--k him,"" Trump added.
In his tweet, Netanyahu said, ""Congratulations Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Joe, we’ve had a long and warm personal relationship for nearly 40 years, and I know you as a great friend of Israel,"" Netanyahu wrote on Twitter. ""I look forward to working with both of you to further strengthen the special alliance between the US and Israel.""

Netanyahu is now working to repair his relationship with Trump. During his Thursday speech to Congress, the prime minister paid tribute to Trump’s accomplishments in the Middle East.
""I want to thank President Trump for his leadership in brokering the historic Abraham Accords. Like Americans, Israelis were relieved that President Trump emerged safe and sound from that dastardly attack on him, dastardly attack on American democracy. There is no room for political violence in democracies,"" said the Israeli leader.
Trump and his Mideast team brokered the Abraham Accords, a series of diplomatic normalization agreements between Israel and the Sunni Arab countries of the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco.
Netanyahu continued in his speech ""I also want to thank President Trump for all the things he did for Israel, from recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, to confronting Iran’s aggression, to recognizing Jerusalem as our capital and moving the American Embassy there. That’s Jerusalem, our eternal capital never to be divided again.""
Michael Makovsky, president and CEO of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America, told Fox News Digital, ""It’s very important for both men and both the U.S. and Israel that Netanyahu and Trump have a very positive meeting tomorrow, and I’m sure that will be the case. They had a close relationship when Trump was president, but then Trump expressed dissatisfaction with Netanyahu a couple of times. Still, Trump knows the Republican base is very pro-Israel, with the latest example being all the Republican-led standing ovations yesterday during Netanyahu’s speech to Congress.""

""Trump can also pick up some independent or Democratic voters upset about Biden’s shift on Israel this year and the concern over [Vice President] Kamala Harris’ views toward Israel,"" Makovsky said. ""Anyway, Trump is fundamentally pro-Israel. And Netanyahu keenly understands that strong U.S. backing, both in public and private, is pivotal to Israel addressing its many post-10/7 threats in Gaza, Lebanon, Iran, Yemen, etc., and the chances of normalization with Saudi Arabia; and if Trump is re-elected, they need to have close personal ties, which is critical for Trump. In any case, it’s critical for U.S. national security interests for the U.S. to have close ties with Israel.""

The new chapter in Trump-Netanyahu relations looks to already be unfolding, with Trump welcoming the Israeli leader’s recognition of his Mideast diplomatic breakthroughs.
Trump told ""Fox & Friends"" on Thursday that Netanyahu was ""very nice to me yesterday. He mentioned me in the speech very nicely, and I appreciated that he's coming to see me.""
The former president, however, warned the Israeli leader that he needs to put the prosecution of the war against the U.S.-designated terrorist movement Hamas on the fast track: ""I want him to finish up and get it done quickly. You got to get it done quickly because they are getting decimated with this publicity. And, you know, Israel is not very good at public relations.""

Trump also said that Hamas’ mass slaughter of nearly 1,200 people, including more than 30 Americans, on Oct. 7 in southern Israel would not have happened if he had been re-elected in 2020: ""Oct. 7th would have never happened if I was president. There was no chance. Iran was broke, they had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah. It just wouldn't have happened, zero chance.""
Trump said the nine-month war in Gaza to root out Hamas terrorists has lasted too long: ""I'd make sure that it gets over with fast. You have to end this fast. It can't continue to go on like this. It's too long, it's too much. You got to get your hostages back.""
Hamas continues to hold more than 100 hostages in Gaza, including eight Americans.

""This is a very tricky moment for a foreign leader to come to the United States. Asking for meetings with Biden, Harris and Trump was the appropriate way to handle it,"" Richard Goldberg, who served on the National Security Council during the Trump administration, told Fox News Digital.
Goldberg, who is now a senior adviser for the Washington, D.C.-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, continued, ""I think you’d probably see a return to a formula that best promotes security, stability and peace: maximum pressure on Iran and maximum support to Israel.""

FIRST ON FOX: A conservative think tank has launched an eight-figure effort to highlight VP Kamala Harris’ record on parental rights and transgender issues that the group’s founder will show that the presumptive Democratic nominee is an ""extremist"" on those issues.
""American Principles Project just launched our $18 million, seven states, 7 million voter, Every Family Votes campaign in the most important swing states in the country and it's important for the presidency, but also to make sure that we have a Senate majority once President Trump wins,"" Terry Schilling, President of the American Principles Project, told Fox News Digital. 
""It's very clear to us and to millions of other Americans who care about the American family that this November is going to be the most important election that we've had in a very long time for parental rights and for the innocence of our children, especially in light of Kamala Harris' positions and actions that she's taken over the years,"" Schilling said. ""We're going to make sure that voters all across the country know just how extreme Kamala Harris is when it comes to protecting our kids, when it comes to protecting normalcy and decency, and when it also comes to protecting parental rights.""
Schilling told Fox News Digital that ads that have already been released examining Harris’ record, including a viral ad from Pennsylvania GOP Senate candidate Dave McCormick, are the ""tip of the iceberg.""

""For example, a lot of people don't know that Kamala, as AG of California, oversaw the first ever taxpayer funded gender transition for an inmate,"" Schilling said. ""She gave an inmate, who was convicted of murder, taxpayer funded gender transition and put him on parole in order for him to transition his gender. It's absolutely crazy.""
Schilling continued, ""Kamala is opposed to parental rights when it comes to protecting children from these radical ideas about gender. And from these procedures, she's against protecting girls' sports. The list goes on and on, and we're going to make sure that every persuadable voter knows just how crazy and radical Kamala Harris is.""

Issues that the group will focus on, according to Schilling, are Harris’ support of the Equality Act ""which would put gender identity into Civil Rights law, and the Biden administration’s support of biological males in girls' sports.""
Schilling says his group ""is going to be looking at and exposing her record over the past four years.""
""In the Biden administration, we're going to make sure that voters know that she was part of the Biden war on families,"" Schilling said, adding that the ""lamestream media’s"" unwillingness to cover these issues makes APP’s work even more important.

""Our job is to make sure that every voter in the country knows that Kamala Harris will take away your rights as a parent to protect your children from all these nefarious influences in our culture,"" Schilling said. 
""She won't protect our schools. She won't. She won't fix our schools, let alone that, but we're going to make sure that every voter knows we're going to do the job of the mainstream media and make sure that voters know just how radical and extreme Kamala has been when it comes to the American family.""
Schilling also told Fox News Digital he was inspired by how focused former President Trump is on the issues that APP plans to highlight.
""President Trump's all in on protecting the American family,"" Schilling said. ""The issue of protecting our kids and protecting parental rights is something that he's been passionate about and has led on from the very beginning, and so it's a no-brainer for us to get behind him and support him with such a campaign and such a large campaign as what we're doing right now.""

FOX_5,FLASHBACK: Biden being replaced on ticket was 'fantasy' dismissed by media,https://www.foxnews.com/media/flashback-biden-being-replaced-ticket-fantasy-dismissed-media,2024-07-26 17:01:02.644297,politics,"ABC's George Stephanopoulos clashed with GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley over her repeated argument that President Biden would not finish his term.
Many members of the media were quick in the past to dismiss the notion that Vice President Kamala Harris, or anyone, would be replacing President Biden at the top of the Democratic Party's ticket.
""First of all, a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for Kamala Harris. You know that and I know that. There’s no way Joe Biden is going to finish his term. I think Kamala Harris would become the next president and that should send a chill up every American’s spine,"" former GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley told a skeptical George Stephanopoulos on ABC last August. 
""Do you think he’s going to finish his term? Do you think that he’s actually going to finish what he started? We look at the decline he’s had over the last few years. You have to be honest with the American people, George. There’s no way Joe Biden’s going to finish out a next term,"" the then-GOP presidential candidate said. 
""We can’t have an 81-year-old president. We have to have a new generational leader. The Senate has become the most privileged nursing home in the country. We have got to start making sure we have a new generation,"" Haley told Stephanopoulos, who demanded more evidence, and repeatedly asked Haley, ""what is that based on?""

KAMALA HARRIS SPENT MONTHS SHOOTING DOWN CONCERNS OVER BIDEN'S MENTAL COMPETENCY AHEAD OF THE DEBATE
Prominent Democrats have quickly rallied behind Harris after Biden decided he would drop out of the race for the presidency. He endorsed Harris soon after announcing his decision on social media on Sunday. 
After many in the media started speculating that Biden would withdraw from the race following his disastrous debate performance in late June, Haley took to social media and reacted to a video of the initial exchange. 
""Believe me now, George?"" Haley asked. 
NBC News reported that replacing Biden on the ticket was a ""quiet conspiracy theory"" in October 2023. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., were both cited in the report and both argued the ""Democrat kingmakers"" were going to tap in someone else for Biden at their convention in August.
Both Republican senators initially doubted it would be Harris, arguing that it would be Michelle Obama who would take Biden's place. Cruz recently argued during an interview that it would be either Obama or Harris that would replace Biden. 
Michelle Obama's office shut down any notion that she might be pursuing the Democratic nomination in March 2024.
A member of the president's campaign also told NBC News at the time that Republicans were pushing ""blatantly false conspiracy theories.""

Politico's Playbook authors, on July 3, also said that Harris was having a ""genuine moment"" in discussions about possibly being the ""more competitive nominee"" in the weeks following the debate.
However, the authors added, ""Harris has weak approval and favorability ratings compared to other possible alternatives. Nearly everyone we spoke to believes a Harris-led ticket remains firmly in the realm of fantasy.""
""Joe Biden won the Democratic nomination,"" veteran Democratic consultant and ABC contributor Donna Brazile told Politico at the time. ""To undermine the voters in this country at this hour would be the worst thing the Democratic Party could ever do.""
The Boston Globe's Kimberly Atkins-Stohr wrote in a July 1 column that replacing Biden on the ticket was a ""pipe dream.""
""The Biden-must-go movement relies on a number of things falling magically into place without a hitch. Biden would have to agree to end his campaign. Another candidate, so perfect that the vast majority of the Democratic electorate falls almost instantly behind them, would have to emerge and get Biden’s blessing,"" she wrote, roughly three weeks prior to Biden's resounding endorsement of Harris. 
She continued, ""Then the 4,000 pledged Democratic convention delegates, who are nearly unanimously behind Biden, would all have to declare in unison: 'No problem! We are behind this candidate that 10 minutes ago we had no intention of supporting!'""
Further describing the scenario that appears to currently be taking shape, she added, ""there is that pesky little wrinkle of convincing the Democratic electorate that overwhelmingly supported Biden in the primary to willingly accept mass disenfranchisement and let the Democratic apparatus tell them, ‘Tsk-tsk, settle down. We know better than you.’""

Cornell Belcher, a former pollster for President Obama, told the Los Angeles Times in February that the idea of replacing Biden on the ticket was ""absurd.""
""No one who’s done this at this level thinks that removing the sitting president of the United States, who’s a Democrat, from your ballot is remotely plausible,"" he said. ""It’s completely absurd.""
Some news outlets tossed around the notion of Biden being off the ticket after Special Counsel Robert Hur's brutal report in February that questioned his mental acuity. However, liberal media outlets largely rallied around him against so-called ""cheap fake"" videos that appeared to show Biden having senior moments and a Wall Street Journal report about his declining behind-the-scenes abilities.

FOX_7,"Around the world, parents resonate with Elon Musk as victims of trans ideology",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/around-world-parents-resonate-elon-musk-victims-trans-ideology,2024-07-26 17:01:02.644297,opinion,"'Domestic Extremist' author Peachy Keenan and Dr. Sheila Nazarian joined 'Fox News @ Night' to discuss why he is ditching the Golden State and their take on the Secret Service failures following the Trump assassination attempt. 
The victims of trans ideology are many. As Elon Musk’s revelation Monday in an interview with Dr. Jordan Peterson showed, the harms inflicted spread even beyond the children who, cruelly convinced they were born ""wrong,"" mutilate their bodies and risk permanent infertility.
The ""woke mind virus,"" as christened by Musk, has a horrific impact on the family members strewn apart in collateral damage. The wives who lose husbands due to self-indulgent auto-gynephilia. The children who lose fathers. The parents who lose their sons or daughters as they reinvent themselves into a different identity altogether.
Opening up about his grief following his son Xavier’s attempted ""transition,"" Musk said:
Elon Musk called the term ""gender affirming care"" a ""terrible euphemism."" (Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) 
""I lost my son, essentially. They call it deadnaming for a reason. 
MUSK SAYS TRANS CHILD WAS FIGURATIVELY 'KILLED BY THE WOKE MIND VIRUS,' VOWS TO DESTROY IT: 'MY SON IS DEAD'
""The reason it's called deadnaming is because your son is dead. My son Xavier is dead, killed by the woke mind virus.""
Musk was convinced to give his son puberty blockers under the threat that preventing him would make him likely to commit suicide – a manipulative myth pedaled by gender ideologues, which has now been dispelled. Musk said it wasn't explained to him that puberty blockers are ""actually just sterilization drugs"" when he gave his consent for his son to undergo the treatment. He called the term ""gender affirming care"" a ""terrible euphemism.""
In a culture where self-identification has become the dogma of our day, children have been given the autonomy of adults in demanding permanent, life-altering changes to their body – while parents’ concerns are infantilized and demonized.
Even in countries where toxic ""puberty blockers"" are now being halted – such as England and Scotland – ""conversion therapy"" bills are looming, threatening to criminalize parents who prevent ""social transition"" – in other words, who don’t allow their 11-year-old son to attend school in sparkly heels and lipstick.
VIMEO SCRUBS 'DEAD NAME' DOCUMENTARY PROFILING FAMILIES UPENDED BY TRANSGENDER IDEOLOGY
Meanwhile, in California, last week, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law a new bill preventing school districts from requiring staff members to disclose students’ ""sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression"" to their parents.
Musk has previously blamed his son Xavier’s ""progressive"" school for indoctrinating him into believing he was born in the wrong body. 
Where kids need reassurance and affirmation, teachers guide them down a path to bodily harm. Where parents could step in with concerns and guidance, they are brushed aside as bigots. Encouraging kids to mutilate their bodies just to ""be themselves"" is surely the greatest crime of the 21st century.
Musk reacted to California’s new law with a simple but foreboding response: ""The state will take away your kids in California."" Alarmist? Not really.
NEWSOM'S SCHOOL GENDER IDENTITY LAW MANDATES 'TEACHERS MUST LIE TO PARENTS,' PARENTAL RIGHTS GROUPS SAY
One need only look to what is happening in Switzerland – the ""transgender capital of the world"" – to see the end result of these policies that pit parents against child. 
The teenage daughter of parents living in Geneva, Switzerland, has been separated from her family for over a year by court order after they objected to her gender ""transition."" 
Concerned that their daughter was being pushed to make hasty and potentially irreversible decisions, the parents declined ""puberty blockers"" and explicitly rejected her school’s attempt to ""socially transition"" her. 
NY BALLOT INITIATIVE COULD BLOCK PARENTS FROM SAY IN CHILD'S TRANS SURGERY, CRITICS WARN IN FIERY CAMPAIGN
The parents wanted to support her to feel loved and confident in her own body. In clear violation of parental rights, the school set her on the path to identify as a boy anyway, and have collaborated with state authorities to remove her from the care of her family.
Now, for seeking to protect the health and well-being of their daughter, they face a legal standoff over their fundamental rights as parents to care for their child who, residing in a government shelter since April 2023, is being encouraged to pursue dangerous medical interventions.
After all, the Cass Review made clear that social transition is not a ""neutral act."" In fact, most children who are encouraged to socially transition head down a one-track pathway to puberty blockers and surgery.

The tragedy of this family, torn apart by the state, has sent shock waves across the Twittersphere. If it can happen in Switzerland, it can happen anywhere. This is a timely warning against ""conversion therapy"" bills, such as the one posed in the King Charles III’s speech last week. 
Parents, not schools nor the state, have the primary responsibility to care for their children. At a time when she needed her parents the most, Swiss authorities cooperated to block this girl from the love of her family. 
Any ideology that operates in the shadows, unbeknownst to parents, should trigger massive alarm bells. The Swiss case shows how even actively involved parents can be completely shut out when powerful actors coalesce around the rabid promotion of gender ideology.

From Elon Musk, to parents in ""human rights capital"" Geneva, to those fearfully observing the future of the U.K. – gender ideology is claiming countless victims. While the tide turns on puberty blockers – which are being banned for children in Britain, Finland, Denmark, Norway and elsewhere – we mustn’t compromise on opposing policies that stand between loving parents and their children. 
Our kids’ future – and that of their families – is at stake.

FOX_8,"When Secret Service puts DEI first, its protectees are endangered",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/when-secret-service-puts-dei-first-lives-endangered,2024-07-26 17:01:02.644297,opinion,"Fox News congressional correspondent Aishah Hasnie has the latest on the resignation of Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle on 'Your World.'
The dust has barely settled following Tuesday’s surprise resignation announcement by U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle as ongoing investigations ramp up, exploring the colossal security failings at a campaign rally for former President Trump on July 13. 
The beleaguered presidential appointee was seemingly successful in uniting our political divisions as politicians from both major political parties clamored for her removal in the wake of a near-miss assassination attempt that left one man dead and two others seriously wounded.  
To witness Cheatle’s mechanical testimony in front of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability on Monday was an exercise in frustration and futility. What little empathy she might have wrung out of the grilling was mitigated by her steadfast refusal to answer basic questions – topics she had previously addressed during media appearances. Her underwhelming responses portend increased scrutiny for a discreet agency suddenly thrust into the national spotlight.

The colossal failure of her agency during the near-miss assassination attempt on Trump a little over a week ago was captured by news cameras and rally attendees’ cellphones. How an untrained 20-year-old could access a rooftop some 130 years away from a former president and current candidate for the office is baffling and the subject of an internal Secret Service review, an FBI investigation, and an independent inquiry announced by President Biden. 
SECRET SERVICE CHIEF CHEATLE HAS RESIGNED. THIS IS HOW WE FIX THE USSS BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE
Exhaustive government reviews can take months to complete. Meanwhile, Congress and the American public continue to demand answers that do not appear to be forthcoming. 
Concurrently, images of some undersized female agents clumsily fumbling with their sidearms during the attack in Butler, Pennsylvania, and reports that Cheatle may have won the position via support from Jill Biden during the director selection process have led to claims that assignments and advancements due to DEI may be at play here. 
Cheatle’s LinkedIn profile spans her 26-year Secret Service career and highlights senior-level positions within the agency. Yet her mishandling of the deserved scrutiny for the security failings before and during the assassination attempt makes one wonder how she could have been the best available candidate for the Service’s top position. 
At Monday’s hearing, Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wis., directly questioned Cheatle regarding the 30x30 initiative and the Service’s becoming a signatory during her tenure at its helm. This DEI-inspired pledge aims to increase female representation in federal law enforcement agencies 30% by 2030. Curiously, Cheatle denied advocating for the Secret Service to be comprised by one-third female agents, a goal also promoted by her boss, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. 
TOP FIVE MOMENTS FROM SECRET SERVICE DIRECTOR'S HOURS-LONG GRILLING AFTER TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT
The Secret Service is joined as signatories on the 30x30 pledge that was championed by the advocacy group Women in Federal Law Enforcement (WIFLE) by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, FBI, IRS Criminal Investigations Division, U.S. Capitol Police, Customs and Border Protection, Marshals Service, Diplomatic Security Service, National Park Service, DEA, et al. 
Imagine the abundant courage required of any senior executive at the aforementioned agencies to stand up and suggest it is wrong to target and reward candidates for selection or promotion as a result of immutable characteristics and not capabilities, aptitude, and performance. Good luck during their next performance evaluation – they have committed the equivalent of professional suicide. 
Thus, worship at the unholy altar of DEI has become de rigueur within federal law enforcement’s senior executive ranks. I know, having once been member of club. These days, best to remain tight-lipped about artificial, unjust and unfair recruitment and promotion policies. 
These seemingly illegal and counterproductive preferences are currently under assail from critics like Christopher Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and contributing editor for City Journal, who remains an outspoken critic of DEI practices. He has written blistering exposes related to the progressive movement to void the principles of meritocracy and instead deploy certain race or gender features as qualifications. 
TRUMP REACTS TO SECRET SERVICE DIRECTOR RESIGNING: 'SHE NEVER GAVE ME PROPER PROTECTION'
Rufo referred to the post-assassination-attempt Secret Service as ""compromised"" and points out the agency proudly acknowledges that it ""prioritizes recruiting women candidates"" and created policy – an ""affirmative action"" plan – that aggressively targets female, LQBT and other identity groups for recruitment and retention.
Which brings us back to the narrow miss of an assassin’s bullet in Butler, Pennsylvania, and the blunder that appears in not securing a gently-sloped rooftop. Were DEI preferences at play there?
Did an agency with 24% of its ranks comprised of females, striving mightily to increase that number to 30%, allow a quota mindset to drive decisions that should be predicated solely on capabilities and competence? Were more female agents assigned to Trump’s protection detail with these considerations in mind?
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
Was it wholly shocking that following the rally’s security blunder, Trump enters Republican National Convention venue in Milwaukee less than week later, flanked by a detail of tall, burly, ruggedly fit male agents? Gives one pause.
If women and men are truly equal in all regards, why then does the Secret Service (and all federal law enforcement agencies) continue to enforce drastically different physical fitness standards? Assignments to one of the presidential protection details requires agents to physically reposition a protectee and confront an attacker – or counter-assault team members scale buildings to gain access to counter-sniper perches while laden with heavy gear and equipment, so why then separate fitness standards? This remains a dangerous policy and degrades public safety. 
Of course, some will purposely twist my words and sense this an attack on female federal agents. Untrue. I served with plenty of outstanding female FBI (and Secret Service) special agents. Yet agencies like the Secret Service and FBI are disingenuous when they proudly sign onto 30x30 pledge and WIFLE’s assertions that ""the under-representation of women in policing undermines public safety."" 
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
The FBI announced this aim serves ""to improve public safety, community outcomes, and trust in law enforcement."" These initiatives actually degrade public safety and erode public trust. 
Let’s hope that in Washington, D.C. – where accountability remains in short supply – rigorous and thorough investigations will determine just how DEI policies may have played a role in the glaring security breach during the Trump assassination attempt. We will also pay keen attention as the Biden administration now sets out to appoint a Secret Service director to replace Cheatle.

FOX_9,Wisconsin Democrats say Biden needed to drop out 'far sooner' to allow primary: 'Don’t like on principle',https://www.foxnews.com/media/wisconsin-democrats-say-biden-needed-drop-out-far-sooner-allow-primary-dont-like-principle,2024-07-26 18:31:02.884520,politics,"Five Democratic voters spoke on MSNBC about their opinions on Biden dropping out of the presidential race and endorsing Kamala Harris.
A group of Wisconsin progressive voters agreed Wednesday that President Biden should have ""come to [the] decision sooner"" to drop out of the race so that there was ""more time"" to choose another nominee.
The five voters were asked their opinion on MSNBC about the president announcing he would not seek re-election on Sunday and whether they supported Vice President Kamala Harris as a candidate.
While all were enthusiastic about voting for Harris, most of them wished Biden would have given Democrats the chance to have a real primary for a candidate.
""It would have been nice if he made this decision a year ago so we could have had a primary and maybe decided who we want to replace him rather than just all flocking to Kamala Harris,"" one voter commented.

Though the voters expressed their belief that Harris could defeat former President Trump in the election, they lamented the process that led to Harris.
Another voter remarked, ""I think by trying to clear the field and ensure it was going to be Biden and…not allowing us to have an actual Democratic primary process — not saying I think Kamala Harris is going to lose, but I do think we would have benefited significantly if he figured this out far sooner, so there actually could have been more time to have internal debate, have internal democracy within the party.""
""I don’t feel like I know a lot about [Kamala]. I agree that I wish Biden had come to this decision sooner, but now that we are where we are, I think that’s the best option for the party,"" a third voter said.
""I don’t like the process either,"" a female voter said. ""This whole, we started the conversation with, there are people behind closed doors and curtains making the decisions for us, and it’s supposed to be a process. We’re supposed to be part of it. That part I don’t like on principle.""

Biden announced his decision to drop out of the presidential race on Sunday through a statement on X. He sent a separate post shortly afterward endorsing Harris. 
Harris later confirmed in a statement that she would be seeking the Democratic nomination.
""I am honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,"" she said.
Multiple Democrats have since endorsed Harris for president and she is the presumptive nominee heading into the Democratic National Convention next month.

Former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama officially endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president in a video released Friday morning, after days of silence over their support.
The announcement came as big-name Democrats have coalesced around Harris as their new choice to take on former President Donald Trump in the 2024 election. President Biden endorsed Harris this past Sunday, the same day he announced he would no longer run for a second term – but until Friday, the Obamas had kept quiet.
In the video, Barack Obama could be heard first greeting Kamala, with Michelle chiming in as well.

After weeks of warning Democrats that the American people wanted something new in place of President Biden, campaign veteran James Carville cautioned them not to get cocky about their new choice.
After Biden stepped aside under pressure and Vice President Kamala Harris rapidly ascended to become the presumptive nominee, many Democrats had a noticeable honeymoon season over their new candidate, but Carville warned that it’s not time for them to celebrate just yet. 
 ""I have to be the skunk at the garden party. This is too triumphalist, OK?"" Carville said on MSNBC. ""Everybody’s giddy. I look at the coverage and it’s great. If I had to write a play about what I think, it’d be entitled, ‘The Icepick Cometh,’ OK? Get ready, they’re coming. All right? And it’s good. Everybody should feel good and liberated and everything else. But if we don’t win the election, we haven’t done anything.
""This kind of giddy elation is not going to be very helpful much longer ’cause that’s not what we’re going to be faced with.""
BIDEN MAKES BIZARRE CALL IN TO HARRIS HEADQUARTERS HOURS AFTER DROPPING OUT OF RACE
Veteran Democratic strategist James Carville warned Democrats that they shouldn't assume they've already won, and need to work hard to beat Trump in the election. 
Carville, known for masterminding Bill Clinton's 1992 election victory, made a boxing reference referring to the medical assistant who aids a boxer in breaks in a match. 
""I think the Vice President, to put it in athletic terms, needs a really good cutman on the corner because she’s getting ready to get cut,"" he said.
He said that polls indicate that Harris is doing better in the polls, but warned not to take too much stock in polling.

""It’s still the same country. All right? It might be a different mood, and all I’m saying is good. Bang your helmets against the locker, it’s fine,"" he said. ""But still, when you go out there, you’re facing Alabama. Just get ready because these Republicans, you’re right, they got caught off guard, but they’re going to get their sea legs and we’re having to get a campaign, a whole campaign started.""

He reiterated the purpose of his commentary to the host and guest and argued, ""All I’m doing is saying watch out people, don’t get too far out there. If we don’t win this, all this good feeling is going to evaporate and be all for naught and that’s what I kinda think my role is right now.""
Carville had also spoken about Harris’ campaign on The Don Lemon Show, arguing that ""right now, she’s doing well, very well,"" but warning that the best day of her campaign is already behind her as the election heats up.

FOX_13,Nikki Haley knew Biden wouldn't 'make it to the election' and be replaced with Kamala Harris,https://www.foxnews.com/media/nikki-haley-knew-biden-wouldnt-make-election-replaced-kamala-harris,2024-07-26 19:01:05.191342,politics,"Former Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley gave her opinion on President Biden dropping out of the race and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris.
Nikki Haley remarked Thursday that she wasn’t surprised President Biden dropped out of the race and ""never thought"" he would be the eventual Democratic candidate.
Haley, who ran for the GOP nomination in 2024 before eventually endorsing Donald Trump, was asked by CNN's Jake Tapper for her thoughts on Biden deciding to drop out of the presidential race. Haley memorably called for Biden to take a mental competency test in February and predicted he wouldn't be able to finish a hypothetical second term.
""I wasn't surprised, and I didn't take happiness in it. I mean, I think through the whole campaign, I fought for mental competency tests. I wasn't doing it to be disrespectful. I wasn't doing it to be mean. I was doing it because I think it's not just Joe Biden,"" Haley responded.
She continued, ""There is an issue that we have in D.C. where people will go into office and they won't let go, and then their staffers and their family keep propping them up. And it's a problem for the American people. And so, I never thought he would make it to the election. I always said a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for Kamala Harris, and I think that's what's playing out."" 
FLASHBACK: BIDEN BEING REPLACED ON TICKET WAS ‘FANTASY’ DISMISSED BY MEDIA

Despite criticizing Democrats, however, she suggested putting out a candidate younger than former President Trump could benefit them in the race.
""The Democrats are very smart to put in a younger candidate. I think that‘s what America has craved, but I think what you look at is they put in the weakest candidate they could put in,"" Haley said.
Haley repeatedly argued throughout her campaign that everyone was aware of Biden’s mental decline leading up to the election.
""And let's be very clear if they think it's going to be President Biden, a vote for President Biden, it's actually a vote for President Harris,"" Haley told ""Fox & Friends"" in 2023. ""We are running against Kamala Harris. Make no bones about it. The New York Times knows it. Every liberal knows it. They know that it's Kamala Harris that's going to end up being President of the United States if Joe Biden wins this election.""

FOX_14,Why Putin prefers Harris over Trump in the White House,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/why-putin-prefers-harris-over-trump-white-house,2024-07-26 19:01:05.191342,politics,"Former defense intel officer Rebekah Koffler on which Biden foreign policy failures RNC speakers need to address on day three of the convention.
Two weeks ago, a U.S. intelligence official — commenting on the recent Election Security Update issued by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) — suggested that Russia prefers former President Trump to win the presidency in November. 
As a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer who specializes in Russia and Putin, I totally disagree. Like many other pronouncements made by spy agencies, this one is also dead wrong. But now that Biden is out of the race, whom would Vladimir Putin favor, Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris? 
Kamala, of course. Here’s why. 
Putin is almost certainly terrified of another Trump presidency, but Kamala not so much. The Russians have assessed her to be vapid, unintelligent and incompetent, and can be unbalanced and manipulated in Moscow’s view.
DEMOCRATS TOLD US BIDEN WAS RAZOR SHARP. WAIT TILL AMERICA GETS THE KAMALA HARRIS SPIN

The Russian media, which is almost exclusively under state control, speculated on Monday whether Harris’s ""cackling and giggling,"" ""nervous, out-of-place clapping,"" ""exaggerated gesticulation,"" nonsensical statements like ""the passage of time,"" and ""strange"" facial expressions are a result of a psychiatric disorder or being constantly ""inebriated."" 
Russian analysts expect Harris to continue Biden’s policies seeking to transform America from a society that’s based on meritocracy and competence to the one that is hyper-focused on forced equality and government regulation, typical of a socialist system. Since socialism destroyed the USSR, Moscow believes that someone like Harris leading America on the path of destruction is a good thing for Russia, which views the U.S. as its top security threat.
Vice President Kamala Harris shares an anecdote at an event in Colorado. 
Harris, like Biden, who called Putin all sorts of derogatory names such as ""war criminal"", ""killer,"" a ""murderous dictator"" and a ""pure thug"" — a sign that Putin’s actions got under his skin – also can be rattled by the former KGB operative, the Russians believe. Harris previously slammed Putin, accusing him of brutality and being responsible for the death of Alexei Navalny, his political opponent.
To the contrary, a talented statesman and astute businessman, former President Trump, always acted respectfully to Putin, realizing the Russian isn’t afraid of words. Instead, Trump pursued the most formidable anti-Russia policy since former President Reagan, having taken actions to counter Moscow’s anti-U.S. strategy.
TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT SHOWS TO PUTIN AND XI THE WEST ON BIDEN’S WATCH IS VULNERABLE, UNFOCUSED

Trump founded in December 2019 America's first entirely new armed service since 1947, the U.S. Space Force. This was 18 years after Putin established Russia’s space force, whose mission is to attack U.S. satellites, on which our military depends for every aspect of war fighting — missile warning, navigation, reconnaissance, targeting, command-and-control and precision strike efforts. 
The key mission of the U.S. Space Force is to safeguard our spacecraft and target enemies' space assets with offensive operations. 
In September 2018, Trump authorized offensive cyber operations against adversaries, enabling the U.S. military to ramp-up cyber operations targeting Russia’s power grid. This was direct retaliation against Russia, which had been hacking American networks for more than two decades and had compromised every major federal agency, including the electrical grid and nuclear facilities.

(U.S. Army photo by Spc. Zoe Garbarino via AP)
In 2018, as part of the modernization of the U.S.' nuclear arsenal, Trump ordered the development of a low-yield, nuclear-armed, sea-launched cruise missile. This was a direct counter to Putin’s ""escalate-to-de-escalate"" atomic strategy, which seeks to detonate a low-yield tactical nuclear warhead in the theater of combat operations — such as in Ukraine — to deter the U.S. from intervening. 
The Biden-Harris administration canceled Trump’s program. Now, Washington goes into a frenzy every time Putin issues a nuclear threat.

Putin is acutely aware that Trump wouldn’t hesitate to spill Russian blood to protect U.S. forces. In 2018, a small group of U.S. forces stationed in Syria were attacked by hundreds of Bashar al-Assad loyalists, which included Russian members of the Wagner group. Some 300, including Wagnerites, were killed as a small force of some 30-40 U.S. special forces heroically fought off the attack with the help of local allies. 
There was no direct retaliation by Putin. 
Similarly, Trump didn’t blink before directing U.S. forces to eliminate Iran’s Qassem Soleimani, the murderous commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who was killed on Jan. 3, 2020, outside Baghdad International Airport. For this, the Ayatollahs placed Trump on the target list for assassination, on which he remains today.
Putin knows that Trump isn’t easily fooled.

In 2017, the then-president signed into law the U.S. government’s ban on Kaspersky Lab, a Moscow-based anti-virus software firm owned by Eugene Kaspersky, a former KGB intelligence officer-turned-cybersecurity expert. 
This was a Russian cyber espionage platform that U.S. federal agencies — who famously award contracts to the lowest bidder — voluntarily installed on civilian and military networks, having paid the Russian ""businessman"" for ""protection"" against malware. It takes a street-smart New York real estate mogul to understand how shysters like Putin operate. 
Contrast this with Team Biden-Harris, who begged Iran to halt its nuclear program — having gifted the ayatollahs billions which they almost certainly re-directed toward anti-U.S. campaigns.
When it comes to Ukraine, Trump has claimed that if elected president, he would settle the Ukraine war ""in 24 hours,"" sparking concerns that he would give Putin everything he wants. The Russians are in a strong bargaining position, having prepared its military and economy for a multi-year war, while the U.S. and Europe are not postured to support Ukraine in a protracted conflict against Russia, having no industrial capacity to replenish the rapidly depleting weapons arsenal.

Putin knows this, and he will almost certainly drive a hard bargain on Ukraine, no matter who sits on the other side of the negotiating table. This being said, if there is a U.S. politician who could possibly intimidate and outsmart the Russian dictator, Trump has the best chance to do so.
Putin is not afraid of hysterical declarations made about him. What he fears is a truly strong NATO, whose military might was hollowed out during the Obama administration. Unlike Biden, who has made America carry the burden of funding Ukraine – the policy that Harris will almost certainly continue – Trump will likely compel every NATO member to cough up some euros to pay for their security. Ask an ordinary American if Germany, the richest country in Europe but who fails to pitch in 2% of its GDP toward NATO, deserves to be protected by U.S. taxpayers. 
When it comes to gangsters like Putin, the choice between Teflon Don and cackling Kamala is an easy one.

The New York Times reported that the 87% agreement statistic is among the highest levels of agreement on a Times/Siena polling question in years.
The president gave a short Oval Office address on Wednesday in which he conveyed his decision to step down and endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris.
""In just a few months, the American people will choose the course of America’s future. I made my choice. I’ve made my views known,"" Biden said from the White House. ""I would like to thank our great vice president, Kamala Harris. She is experienced, she is tough, she is capable. She’s been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country.

He continued, ""Now the choice is up to you, the American people. When you make that choice, remember the words of Benjamin Franklin hanging on my wall here in the Oval Office, alongside the busts of Dr. King and Rosa Parks and Cesar Chavez.""
Biden's decision to give up on re-election shocked the public and even Democratic Party insiders close to the president — his campaign had planned fundraising events well into August and repeatedly told Democratic lawmakers he had no intention of giving up the race.
Critics and allies alike had called for Biden to stand down from the Democratic Party ticket following his disastrous first presidential debate performance and years of increasingly concerning behavior that seemed to show mental decline.
The speech lasted roughly 11 minutes, with the president sitting at the Resolute desk in the Oval Office while touting his years in political office and decision to bow out.

The White House on Friday is pushing back against reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is upset with Vice President Kamala Harris over her remarks on the war that he believes could jeopardize a hostage and ceasefire deal – with one aide telling Fox News, ""I don’t know what they’re talking about."" 
The reported diplomatic flare-up comes after Netanyahu both met with President Biden and Harris in Washington on Thursday, ahead of his meeting today with former President Trump at Mar-a-Lago. An Israeli official told Axios that Netanyahu was unhappy with Harris mentioning civilian deaths in Gaza and the ""dire humanitarian situation there.""  
The official added that, in their view, Netanyahu was irked with Harris speaking about a hostage and ceasefire deal as a way to end the war outright, when Israel wants to be able to resume fighting after one is implemented. 
""When our enemies see the U.S. and Israel are aligned it increases the chances for a hostage deal and decreases the chances for a regional escalation,"" the Israeli official told Axios. ""When there is such daylight it pushes the deal further away and brings a regional escalation closer. We hope that Harris' public criticism of Israel won't give Hamas the impression that there is daylight between the U.S. and Israel and as a result make it harder to get a deal.""

One Israeli official also said to Axios that ""Harris' statement after the meeting was much more critical than what she told Netanyahu in the meeting."" 
But an aide for Harris told Fox News this morning that ""I don’t know what they’re talking about. 
""President Biden and Vice President Harris delivered the same message in their private meetings to Prime Minister Netanyahu: it’s time to get the ceasefire and hostage deal done. And this is what the Vice President said publicly as well,"" the aide said.

""The public comments tracked with her previous comments on the conflict. She started with underscoring rock-solid support for Israel and then expressed concern about civilian causalities and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, as she always does,"" the aide added.

In her remarks Thursday, Harris said she told Netanyahu that she ""will always ensure that Israel is able to defend itself, including from Iran and Iran-backed militias such as Hamas and Hezbollah."" 
""I also expressed with the Prime Minister my serious concern about the scale of human suffering in Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians. And I made clear my serious concern about the dire humanitarian situation there,"" she continued. 
""It is time for this war to end, and end in a way where Israel is secure, all the hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can exercise their right to freedom, dignity and self-determination,"" Harris also said, adding that ""thanks to the leadership of our president, Joe Biden, there is a deal on the table for a ceasefire and a hostage deal"" and ""as I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done.""

FOX_17,I worked for President Trump and saw what he can do. We all must do our part to help him win,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/worked-president-trump-saw-what-can-do-all-must-do-part-help-win,2024-07-26 21:00:02.823388,opinion,"Former President Donald Trump spoke with the 'Fox & Friends' co-hosts about President Biden's Oval Office address, his plan to take on VP Kamala Harris, the latest on the assassination attempt and accusations of his involvement in Project 2025.
Americans proudly celebrate our country as the land of opportunity. Opportunity, peace and prosperity, however, are not birth rights to be taken for granted. They are achievements secured by each generation through its patriotic commitment to freedom, innovation and hard work. 
This November, Americans will have the opportunity to help elect former President Donald Trump to restore peace and prosperity to our nation.  
Following the GOP’s inspiring convention in Milwaukee, Trump’s continued strong polling and the Democrats scramble to transform Vice President Kamala Harris from a punch line into a believable commander-in-chief, it might be easy for Republicans to grow complacent. 
TRUMP QUICKLY MOVES TO DEFINE HARRIS AS 'MORE LEFT THAN BERNIE SANDERS'
But the country cannot afford for us to make that mistake — the same mistake that saw so many expecting a red wave that never happened in 2022.

For all of us who support Trump, we must double down on our commitment, giving our all to ensure his victory this November. We must reach out to our fellow Americans who love this country who are yet undecided.    
Republicans have many reasons to be optimistic. Americans know the economy thrived under Trump. Inflation was low, as was unemployment, especially in minority communities. Before the pandemic, middle-class income surged by $5,003 — in real dollars. Those are just a few of the reasons a CBS news poll ""found that 65% of Americans remember the economy under former President Donald Trump as being good, compared with 38% giving the current economy under President Joe Biden the same positive assessment.""  
Americans know that the Trump presidency was a time of peace. As his strength kept foreign adversaries from starting wars, his diplomacy brought peace to the Middle East through the historic Abraham Accords.  
As Trump’s ambassador to Spain and Andorra, I saw how he pursued — and embodied — a foreign policy guided by the time-tested concept of ""peace through strength."" Donald Trump is the strongest man I have ever known. His courageous defiance in the face of the assassination attempt was extraordinary, and unsurprising to all who know him.  
Sadly, much of the peace and prosperity Trump delivered has been undone through the bad policies of the Biden/Harris administration. Their profligate spending, over-regulation, open borders and weakness abroad have battered all Americans and our allies. 
The coming election offers an opportunity for renewal. We can reverse the serious errors of Biden/Harris by re-electing Trump. As tireless and committed as Trump is, he cannot do it alone. Republicans should not take the task ahead lightly; we must fully commit to the task at hand.  
The issues are favorable to Republicans. Americans oppose the dangerous open border policies that Harris oversaw as the administration’s border czar. Americans want an end to the inflationary policies that have driven up the prices of food, gasoline and healthcare. Americans want everyone to live in peace. 
Americans know that Kamala Harris is not up to the job of being president of the United States which is why her approval rating is as low as 35%. They are against Harris’s desire to remove the Senate filibuster and pack the Supreme Court so that Democrats can impose their unpopular agenda. They are concerned that she did not earn her nomination but was anointed by party bosses and donors, reminding voters of her long history of coddling the powerful while paying lip service to the people.

Republicans may have the wind in our sails, but we would be wise to remember how it failed to push us to big victories in the 2022 midterms.  
We know that the Red State/Blue State divide means that fewer states are truly in play this fall — and the deeply partisan corporate media will continue to twist facts in an attempt to defeat Trump.   
The difficulty of a task, however, makes it more worthy. In the face of these obstacles, we must redouble our efforts to preserve the republic.  
Vince Lombardi, the iconic football coach whose greatest triumphs came just outside the RNC Convention in Milwaukee, once said that: ""I firmly believe that any man’s finest hours – his greatest fulfillment of all that he holds dear – is that moment when he has worked his heart out in good cause and lies exhausted on the field of battle – victorious.""

While growing up in small-town North Carolina, I remember my local pastor teaching us a similar lesson when he said that, in life, ""it’s not about how much you give, but it’s about how much you sacrifice.""  
No one can doubt that Trump will ""work his heart out."" That is how he is built. The question for his supporters is: will you do the same? Will you match his commitment and dedication not just to a campaign but to our country?  
The issues are favorable to Republicans. Americans oppose the dangerous open border policies that Harris oversaw as the administration’s border czar. Americans want an end to the inflationary policies that have driven up the prices of food, gasoline and healthcare. Americans want everyone to live in peace.

Marie Gluesenkamp Perez remained silent when asked if she supports Harris for president and if Harris did a good job as ‘border czar’
A pair of moderate House Democrats are co-leading a bipartisan push to crack down on noncitizens voting in U.S. elections.
Reps. Jared Golden, D-Maine, and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-Wash., joined legislation being spearheaded by Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., and Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., less than six months ahead of the November presidential election.
The pair of Democrat lawmakers’ support is significant – a bill to repeal Washington, D.C.’s policy allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections was vehemently opposed by the progressive left but wound up passing with support from 52 Democrats.

More recently, House GOP leaders ushered through legislation that would require proof of citizenship in the voter registration process earlier this month. That bill, backed by former President Trump, passed with support from five Democrats but has not been taken up by the Senate.
The bill’s introduction also comes as Republicans blame the Biden administration’s border and immigration policies for fueling the ongoing migrant crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, with some suggesting it could lead to illegal immigrants voting in American elections.
""Across the world, the awesome and exclusive rights of citizens are intrinsically linked to equally awesome and exclusive responsibilities. You cannot have one without the other. So, this bill also affirms that no matter where you live in our country, the right to vote in the United States is a right reserved for citizens alone,"" Golden said in a statement.

Perez said in her own statement, ""We need to uphold the constitutional ideal that decisions made for our country are made by citizens of our country – and this bipartisan legislation will protect the integrity of Americans’ choices at the ballot box.""
The bill prohibits states from allowing noncitizens to vote in federal elections, something that is already illegal. 
It goes a step further, however, threatening the federal funding of states that allow noncitizens to vote in state and local elections as well.

The legislation also expands voting access for Americans themselves by requiring states to allow voters who are not affiliated with a political party to participate in primary elections. Currently, some states only hold ""closed primaries,"" where people registered with a certain party can participate in that party’s primary election.
Fitzpatrick said of his bill, ""This commonsense reform is not political or controversial. It ensures every U.S. citizen, regardless of political affiliation, has the unequivocal right to vote while reinforcing election integrity by strictly prohibiting non-citizens from participating in taxpayer-funded elections.""

FIRST ON FOX: Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-Wash., considered one of the most vulnerable Democrats facing re-election in November, ignored questions on Wednesday on whether she supports Vice President Kamala Harris for president and her campaign told Fox News Digital she has ""no plans"" to endorse the vice president.
""Do you endorse Kamala Harris for president,"" Gluesenkamp Perez is asked as she walked down the street in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Washington, D.C. on Wednesday. 
Gluesenkamp Perez, who has not publicly endorsed Harris, continued walking without responding.
The congresswoman was asked several more times whether she endorses Harris, particularly since Gluesenkamp Perez is a DNC delegate, but a response was not provided, and she continued on her way.

A spokesperson for Gluesenkamp Perez's campaign told Fox News Digital her vote was ""a clear statement of her opinion on that matter"" and that she has ""no plans to endorse Kamala Harris.""
Gluesenkamp Perez’s decision to not respond to questions about Harris’ record on the border makes her at least the third member of the House to ignore that question this week. Democratic Reps. Emilia Sykes and Vicente Gonzalez have both ignored questions on the subject.
""Extreme Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez's silence speaks volumes,"" NRCC Spokesperson Ben Petersen told Fox News Digital.  
""Perez's callous dismissal of the border crisis and dodging on Kamala Harris's performance as border czar prove she's more interested in bending the knee to her Democrat Party bosses than protecting her district from the fentanyl epidemic ravaging southwest Washington.""

On Thursday, Gluesenkamp Perez did seem to answer the question about Harris' role at the border by becoming one of only 6 Democrats to vote in the House to condemn handling of the U.S.' southern border, the first piece of legislation targeting Harris since she became the Democrats' presumptive 2024 nominee.
Gluesenkamp Perez, who represents Washington's 3rd Congressional District in the southwest part of the state bordering Portland, Oregon, is widely viewed as one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the House after winning her 2022 race by less than 2 points.

FOX_20,This drone detection technology could have intercepted assassin’s drone 2 hours before Trump shooting,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/drone-detection-technology-could-have-intercepted-assassins-drone-two-hours-before-trump-shooting,2024-07-26 22:01:02.772610,politics,"Trump gunman Thomas Crooks had two ""relatively crude"" detonation devices at the Trump rally in Pennsylvania, FBI Director Christopher Wray told the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.
The FBI has admitted the assassination attempt on former President Trump was aided by a drone. The shooter apparently used the drone to get footage of where Trump was speaking.
This is a serious security lapse and something that could have been easily prevented if the security agencies had used drone detection technology at the location where the former president took the stage.
The harrowing incident unfolded at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13. A gunman, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, opened fire from a rooftop, hitting Mr. Trump in the right ear, killing one attendee and leaving two others badly injured.

FBI Director Christopher Wray provided new details on the drone that was recovered from the gunman. While speaking before the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee, Wray noted that the shooter flew a drone over the Butler fairgrounds about two hours before Trump spoke at the rally.
Wray said Crooks flew the drone around the area, roughly 200 yards from the stage, from around 3:50 p.m. to 4 p.m. Trump took the stage around 6 p.m.
""We think – but we do not know, so again, this is one of these things that is qualified because of our ongoing review – that he was live-streaming, viewing the footage [for] about 11 minutes,"" he said.
GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE
According to the FBI head, investigators have successfully reverse-engineered the drone's flight path from the day of the rally. They believe the drone footage would have provided the shooter with a view of what was behind him, essentially acting like a rearview mirror for the scene.
Wray's statement clearly indicates that the drone played an important role in informing the gunman of his surroundings and helping him plan the assassination attempt. At the time of the shooting, the drone was in Crooks' vehicle, he said, adding that the device is now ""being exploited and analyzed by the FBI lab.""

THE US AIR FORCE’S XQ-67A DRONE THINKS, FLIES, ACTS ON ITS OWN
A drone detection system could have easily alerted the Secret Service about an unidentified drone flying in the region. Such systems are already utilized by the Army and certain police departments. For example, defense company Dedrone’s airspace security solution is currently used by the St. Petersburg Police Department in Florida and the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division.
Dedrone’s official website mentions that its drone detection system can not only detect the presence of a drone but also determine the drone and pilot's location.
Drone detection systems also capture data such as the drone's manufacturer, model, time and length of activity, video verification and flight history (including flight path). This data could have been easily used to identify suspicious activity at the Pennsylvania rally and might have led to the arrest and prosecution of the gunman even before he attempted the assassination.

HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET
It’s known that counter-drone technology is currently restricted in use. Regulations limit its deployment to specific DoD (Department of Defense) personnel during narrowly defined events. However, the rally should have qualified as the kind of National Security Event that the regulations were designed to address.
If not drone detection tech, the Secret Service could have at least employed drones to capture aerial images of the site. Drones would have provided an unobstructed view of the building from which the shooter fired at Trump. Even if there were obstacles blocking a direct line of sight, drones equipped with thermal cameras could have scanned the building for potential threats.

FOX_21,NASA says no return date yet for astronauts and malfunctioning Boeing capsule 'stuck' at ISS,https://www.foxnews.com/science/nasa-says-no-return-date-yet-astronauts-malfunctioning-boeing-capsule-stuck-iss,2024-07-26 22:11:02.772610,world," Fox News senior correspondent Jonathan Serrie reports on the astronauts who are stuck in space due to issues with the Boeing Starliner on ‘Special Report.’
Already more than a month late getting back, two NASA astronauts will remain at the International Space Station until engineers finish working on problems plaguing their Boeing capsule, officials said Thursday.
Test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were supposed to visit the orbiting lab for about a week and return in mid-June, but thruster failures and helium leaks on Boeing's new Starliner capsule prompted NASA and Boeing to keep them up longer.
NASA’s commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said mission managers are not ready to announce a return date. The goal is to bring Wilmore and Williams back aboard Starliner, he added.
NASA ASTRONAUTS ‘STUCK’ IN SPACE AFTER YEARS OF COMMERCIAL STUMBLES: 6 FACTS TO CATCH YOU UP
""We'll come home when we're ready,"" Stich said.
Stich acknowledged that backup options are under review. SpaceX's Dragon capsule is another means of getting NASA astronauts to and from the space station.
""NASA always has contingency options,"" he said.

Engineers last week completed testing on a spare thruster in the New Mexico desert and will rip it apart to try to understand what went wrong ahead of the Starliner's docking. Five thrusters failed as the capsule approached the space station on June 6, a day after liftoff. Four have since been reactivated.
It appears degraded seals are to blame for the helium leaks and thruster problems — entirely separate issues — but more analysis is needed. The team will test-fire the capsule's thrusters this weekend while docked to the space station to gather more data, said Boeing’s Mark Nappi.
Each of the 28 maneuvering thrusters can fit in a hand and weighs 2 pounds. The capsule is also outfitted with bigger engines for dropping out of orbit at flight's end. All these are part of a segment that is discarded before landing, which means nothing to study for future flights.

After the space shuttles retired, NASA hired private companies for astronaut rides to the space station, paying Boeing and SpaceX billions of dollars.
This was the Boeing's first test flight with a crew aboard. The initial demo in 2019, flying empty, never made it to the space station because of bad software, and Boeing repeated the test in 2022. More issues later cropped up.
SpaceX has been ferrying astronauts since 2020. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets have been grounded for the past two weeks because of an upper-stage failure on a satellite-delivery mission. The longer the stand-down continues, the more likely upcoming crew flights will be delayed."
FOX_22,"Take it from me, Republicans: Kamala Harris is a strong candidate. Don't underestimate her",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/take-from-me-republicans-kamala-harris-strong-candidate-dont-underestimate-her,2024-07-27 01:24:02.779274,politics,"Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich reacts to President Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 race and ascension of Kamala Harris on 'The Ingraham Angle.' 
President Joe Biden told the American people Wednesday night that he graciously decided to bow out of the 2024 election because he wanted to unite his party and focus on his job as president. It was baloney.
In the most obvious display of pure political muscle, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her disciples forced President Biden into withdrawing from the presidential race.
It was an amazing performance and has no previous example in American history.
BIDEN BACKS HARRIS, PUSHES SUPREME COURT 'REFORM' IN 'PASS THE TORCH' SPEECH ABOUT ENDING 2024 BID
There is a good argument that the debate with President Donald Trump proved President Biden was not capable of a nationwide campaign. From a cognitive capability standpoint, there are good reasons to hope President Biden steps down as president, too. 
However, the way President Biden was forced out by party bosses has serious implications for the American system.
 Vice President Kamala Harris can legitimately be described as the party bosses’ candidate. She has never won a delegate. Even in her 2020 race, she dropped out early. She has no grassroots appeal. She’s attractive only to the elites, who feel she is useful in defeating Trump. 
In some ways, Pelosi’s behavior is nothing new. She has become a sort of Democratic Party super boss. Recall, this is the Democratic leader who told members of Congress that they had to vote for the Affordable Care Act before they could read it. She was a remarkably effective Speaker of the House. Her ability to get her way with a narrow majority was astonishing.
Those years of acquiring power were brought to bear to force President Biden to give up power.
Pelosi orchestrated growing pressure on Biden to convince him he had no choice.
TRUMP SLAMS BIDEN'S 'TERRIBLE' OVAL OFFICE ADDRESS ON ABRUPT EXIT FROM 2024 RACE: 'IT WAS A COUP'
President Biden was clearly coerced into withdrawing as a presidential candidate. He had no realistic alternative. Pelosi was going to unveil a wave of additional House and Senate members calling on him to withdraw this week. She had made it clear that he could go easy or go hard – but he was going to go.
One of the challenges left by Biden’s boss-led collapse is that the bosses then defined Vice President Kamala Harris’s almost certain candidacy. 
Patrick Basham of the Democracy Institute had a poll in the field while this drama was unfolding. Its results are educational and pose a significant challenge to the Democrats. Among all Americans, 61 percent believe the method used to force President Biden out was undemocratic. Only 29 percent thought it was democratic to force him out.
HARRIS' SHIFT FROM TOUGH-ON-CRIME PROSECUTOR TO SOCIAL JUSTICE ADVOCATE FACES SCRUTINY FROM CONSERVATIVE GROUP
When the follow-on question of replacing President Biden with Vice President Harris was asked, the results were similar. By 60 percent to 32 percent, Americans felt imposing Harris on the ticket was undemocratic. Interestingly, this feeling was widespread. Among Democrats, 55 percent thought it was undemocratic to have her replace Biden as the presidential candidate. Among independents, that sentiment of unfairness reached 65 percent. Of course, among Republicans, her nomination was seen as rigged by the largest majority, 79 percent. Note, however, that in this survey, majorities of Democrats, independents, and Republicans believed that nominating Harris this way was undemocratic.
Based on this polling, it is clear that Vice President Harris can legitimately be described as the party bosses’ candidate. She has never won a delegate. Even in her 2020 race, she dropped out early. This reinforces the notion that she has no grassroots appeal. She’s attractive only to the elites, who feel she is useful in defeating Trump. 
NEW POLL SHOWS TRUMP, HARRIS TIED IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE: 'CLOSE AS CLOSE CAN BE'
The dramatic changes of the last few days still leave two big challenges for the Democrats.
First, if President Biden is cognitively incapable of campaigning, how can he remain as president? His withdrawal from the presidential campaign strengthens the argument that he poses a national security risk as commander-in-chief. 
Democrats will want this issue to go away. But if the cognitive decline is progressive, and there are two or three clear examples in the next few months, the pressure to replace him may increase dramatically. It will certainly be a distraction for Democrats – and a question about which citizens will increasingly ask their representatives and senators.
Second, Vice President Harris is well to the left of President Biden. 
When she was in the Senate, she voted to the left of Sen. Bernie Sanders.

On illegal immigration, Harris is much more radical than Biden. In April 2015, she told the San Francisco Chronicle that ""an undocumented immigrant is not a criminal."" As a presidential candidate she told the Washington Post she would seek the repeal of criminal penalties for people apprehended while crossing the border."" She has been an enthusiastic cheerleader for every major Biden policy which increased the deficit and inflation.
On taxes, Harris favors a corporate rate higher than Venezuela.
However, Harris will turn out to be a much better candidate than Republicans think. As District Attorney and Attorney General of California, she was an effective litigator. In the Senate, she was an aggressive interrogator, especially with U.S. Supreme Court nominees. 
She reminds me of some athletes who are great at game time but mediocre in practice. The vice presidency was practice, and she loafed through it, letting her laugh be a primary symbol. Now she will be in the real game. She may be shockingly better than Washington Republicans expect.

Harris will also have the advantage of assembling a team of Obama veterans. The opportunity to defeat Trump will draw them to the campaign. If she listens to them, she will be formidable.
It has been an amazing stretch from the assassination attempt on President Trump to now. It is not going to get smoother or more predictable.

Vice President Kamala Harris got her start in politics at age 29, when she was just out of law school, at the Alameda County District Attorney's Office, where she met a 60-year-old kingmaker: California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown — arguably then the state's most powerful politician.
Brown, while estranged from his wife, remained married. However, socially, he and Harris were seen everywhere and never denied being close. Brown appointed Harris to several well-paid state commissions: the state Insurance Commission, the state Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board and later, the California Medical Assistance Commission.
Harris came from a learned household. She was born in Oakland, California, to an Indian-born mother and a Jamaican-born father. Both were professors — one at Berkeley, the other at Stanford. Harris' parents divorced when she was 7. Following her parents' split, she moved to Illinois, then to Quebec, Canada, alongside her sister and mother.
After high school, Harris attended Howard University, where she joined the debate team and claimed to demonstrate ""almost every weekend."" Later, she attended Hastings College of Law, where, like many of her classmates, she failed her first attempt at the California bar exam, but she passed the second time.

In 1998, Harris took a job at the San Francisco District Attorney's Office, but was later demoted after opposing a measure to try juveniles as adults for felony crimes.
After quitting, Harris took a job in the city attorney's office, and with Brown's help, raised $600,000 to defeat her former boss to become San Francisco DA. The city's campaign ethics board fined Harris $30,000 – the highest fine ever levied at the time – for violating campaign finance limits.
""I made a very conscious and deliberate decision to become a prosecutor,"" she said during a 2003 debate. ""I think San Francisco wants a progressive district attorney who is also effective.""
As San Francisco DA, she became a controversial figure for opposing the death penalty — even for cop killers — and pursued three-strikes convictions only when they involved violent felonies.

After a man murdered officer Isaac Espinoza and Harris refused to pursue the death penalty, Harris received a rare rebuke from Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
""I think this district attorney made a very big mistake. As a matter of fact, if I had known she had said that in her campaign, I never would have supported her,"" Feinsein said at the time. 
As district attorney, Harris prosecuted marijuana crimes but rarely sought prison time.

In 2010, she became the first woman to serve as California's attorney general, where she opposed the state's ban on affirmative action and asked the state Supreme Court to ""reaffirm its decision that public colleges and universities may consider race as one factor in admissions decisions."" The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled affirmative action unconstitutional. As AG, she prioritized environmental crimes, obtaining millions in fines from oil companies for failing to monitor underground storage leaks.
In 2016, she ran for U.S. senator and won by outmaneuvering Rep. Loretta Sanchez for the union and Latino vote. Harris also had the support of then-President Obama, who called her brilliant, dedicated and tough, adding, ""She also happens to be, by far, the best-­looking attorney general in the country.""

Harris’ appeal is partly demographic, but her law enforcement background also made her an appealing running mate in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests and rising crime in some cities.
In 2019, Harris dismissed criticism of her record as a prosecutor for jailing marijuana offenders and even joked about her own previous cannabis use.
""Have you ever smoked?"" she was asked on the ""Breakfast Club"" radio show in 2019. ""I have, and I inhaled. I did it, I did it, and it was a long time ago,"" she admitted. 
As district attorney, however, she pushed for higher bail for gun crimes and sought minimum 90-day sentences for possession of concealed or loaded weapons.
Later, as a presidential candidate, Harris said she would pursue universal background checks and a ban on assault-style rifles.
""I will give the United States Congress 100 days to get their act together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws and if they fail to do it, then I will take executive action,"" she said during a CNN town hall in December 2019.  
CNN anchor Jake Tapper also suggested to Harris that her ""Medicare-for-all"" proposal might eliminate private health insurance.
Harris' defense was, ""The idea is, everyone gets access to medical care, and you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them giving you approval, going through the paperwork ... let's eliminate that. Let's move on.""
Her signature tax proposal cost an estimated $3 billion. It would have provided a $3,000 tax credit for individuals and $6,000 for married couples. She also proposed lowering pay disparities by requiring large companies to pay men and women in similar jobs equally. 
Another proposal aimed at raising teacher pay by $13,500. In a 2020 campaign video she explained her economic approach, saying, ""It's about giving people the resources and the support they need so that everyone can be on equal footing and then compete on equal footing. Equitable treatment means we all end up at the same place.""

As a candidate for president in 2020, Harris dropped out before the Iowa caucuses. As a candidate, some viewed her policies as too far left, where she seemed to favor big government to solve income and gender inequality.

The presidential campaign of presumptive Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris recently hired a senior adviser with a history of sexist messages online mocking women and gay people as well as seemingly criticizing Harris on social media during her failed presidential campaign in 2019.
The Harris campaign announced earlier this week it hired Kamau M. Marshall, who has deleted thousands of old posts this week as 2024 senior adviser after he previously held positions as Joe Biden’s strategic communications director in 2020, a senior adviser for the Biden-Harris campaign and was formerly a senior adviser to Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona.
Marshall's social media for more than a decade has been littered with controversial comments, including a Christmas Eve 2011 post in which he expressed his affection for ""power women"" – as long as she ""know[s] her place"" and he can ""where [sic] the pants"", Fox News Digital previously reported.
In early 2012, Marshall inquired, ""Are all women crazy???? Lol no offense ijs [I'm just saying].""

In August 2013, Marshall observed, ""It's unattractive when a girl doesn't act classy & does not know how to control her feelings."" In 2012, he wrote: ""@kimberlyjaneece I disagree-I try not look at _or impress_Personally speaking-I enjoy the challenge & I only look & talk to CLASSY Women.""

Marshall has used the term ""no homo"" in several posts that were previously deleted and seemingly questioned the allegations of sexual abuse against comedian Bill Cosby, saying in 2015, ""It's not a coincidence that Cosby can be arraigned on allegations, yet countless police officers who gun down black bodies aren't indicted"", Washington Free Beacon previously reported.
""Bro if u see a guy around women all day more than likely he wants to be 1 or he is very fem #Imjustsaying,"" Marshall said in another post.
Additionally, Marshall appeared to criticize Harris shortly after a debate performance in 2019, posting a message that said, ""Dear Black people: Don’t be black when it's convenient. Be black 3365/24-7. Period.  Sincerely, a black man.""
The post, which was highlighted by a former reporter from The Atlantic, and deleted shortly after it was posted following one of the contentious Democratic primary debates, received backlash on social media. 
Marshall has deleted over 2,200 posts over the last few days, according to Social Blade.

FOX_25,Trump campaign dismisses left's 'absurd' criticism of JD Vance: 'We're fighting for working women',https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-campaign-dismisses-left-absurd-criticism-jd-vance-fighting-working-women,2024-07-27 02:06:02.904497,politics,"Trump co-campaign manager and GOP political strategist Chris LaCivita joins 'The Brian Kilmeade Show' to discuss Democrats' push to replace Biden, the bump in support for Kamala Harris and Trump's decision to choose JD Vance as running mate.
The Trump campaign is reaffirming the former president's confidence in running mate JD Vance and dispelling criticism of the vice presidential candidate's past comments on women. Trump co-campaign manager and GOP political strategist Chris LaCivita assured listeners of ""The Brian Kilmeade Show"" Friday that the campaign is fighting for ""working women"" and said Vance is a ""perfect representation"" of that effort.
TRUMP SAYS HE HAD ‘AUTOMATIC CHEMISTRY’ WITH VANCE DESPITE PAST CRITICISMS: ‘HE DIDN’T KNOW ME
CHRIS LACIVITA: There are 1,000,001 different interpretations. The fact of the matter is it's been blatantly taken out of context. As a matter of fact, there was a discussion today where the follow-up, the Democrats' follow-up attack is that JD Vance believes that only people with children should get certain tax breaks. Well, that's called the child care tax credit. So now we have the Democrat Party and the Kamala Harris campaign on record as opposing something that's been law for years, which is the child care tax credit. So I mean, look, we expect this kind of thing… There have been actresses like Jennifer Aniston to come out and make these attacks. Look, we just sit down. We're about fighting for the working women of the United States, the forgotten people of the middle class. JD Vance is the perfect representation of that. They know it. It scares the hell out of them. And, they're going to peddle in fiction, and we're just going to have to deal with it as we go forward.
BRIAN KILMEADE: As a campaign, you're not against childless women?
CHRIS LACIVITA: No. That's absurd. It's absolutely absurd… We're very comfortable. JD was the best pick. The president loves him. We love him. He's a great part of this team. We're going to continue fighting alongside of him to make America great again. And again, he is a very important part of this campaign. He is a central part. And we're thrilled to have him.
GEN Z INFLUENCERS RAVE ABOUT TRUMP VP PICK JD VANCE: ‘HE HAS WHAT IT TAKES TO WIN OVER MY GENERATION’
Former President Trump said he had ""automatic chemistry"" with his running mate in a Fox News interview on Monday.
Trump dismissed the pair's past disagreements as a misunderstanding before they got to know each other, saying Vance is now among his strongest allies.
""Originally, JD was probably not for me, but he didn’t know me,"" Trump said in the ""Jesse Watters Primetime"" interview. ""And then when we got to know each other, he liked me maybe more than anybody liked me.""

The former president continued, ""And he would stick up for me. And he’d fight for the worker as much as I fight for the worker. We just had an automatic chemistry.""
Vance was an early critic of Trump in 2016, when the former president was campaigning to eventually beat Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. 
At the time, Vance had dismissed Trump as ""cultural heroin"" who was leading the disenfranchised working class into a ""very dark place.""

(Credit: GPO)
Former President Trump claimed Friday that conflicts in the Middle East could escalate into a third World War if he loses the 2024 election.
The Republican nominee for president made those remarks as he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort home. Netanyahu traveled to Florida to meet with Trump after meeting with President Biden and presumptive Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris in Washington, D.C., earlier this week, following his Wednesday address to a joint session of Congress.  
At Mar-a-Lago, Trump told reporters that Harris is ""worse"" on Middle East issues and claimed Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza could expand into a wider regional conflict if she succeeds Biden, who announced Sunday that he would not seek re-election. 
""We'll see how it goes. But if it all works out, if we win, it'll be very simple. It's all going to work out. And very quickly,"" Trump said. ""If we don't, you're going to end up with major wars in the Middle East. And maybe a third World War. You are closer to a third World War right now than at any time since the Second World War. We've never been so close because we have incompetent people running the country."" 
NETANYAHU TO MEET TRUMP AS ISRAELI LEADER LOOKS TO REKINDLE RELATIONSHIP

Trump's remarks come amid a reported diplomatic flare-up between Harris and Netanyahu which occurred after their meeting Thursday. 
In comments after the meeting, Harris said she told the Israeli prime minister that she ""will always ensure that Israel is able to defend itself, including from Iran and Iran-backed militias such as Hamas and Hezbollah."" 
""I also expressed with the Prime Minister my serious concern about the scale of human suffering in Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians. And I made clear my serious concern about the dire humanitarian situation there,"" she added, calling for an end to the war and the release of all hostages held in Hamas captivity. 
Harris' criticisms of Israel's conduct in the Gaza war reportedly irked Netanyahu, according to Axios. The prime minister has repeatedly said fighting must continue until Hamas is eliminated, even if hostages are released. 
Asked about Harris' comments Friday, Netanyahu told reporters Israel still hopes for a cease-fire deal.

""We're trying to get one. And I think, to the extent that Hamas understands that there's no daylight between Israel and the United States, that expedites the deal. And I hope that those comments don't change that,"" Netanyahu said. 
The Mar-a-Lago meeting is the first face-to-face contact Netanyahu has had with Trump since the Republican nominee left the White House in 2020. Their relationship strained when Netanyahu congratulated President-elect Biden on his victory that year, which prompted Trump to call out the Israeli leader. ""I haven't spoken to him since,"" Trump told Israeli journalist Barak Ravid that year. ""F--k him,"" the former president added.
Netanyahu is now making an effort to make amends and secure Trump's support for Israel in the war against Gaza, should the Republican candidate return to the White House after the November election.

In Trump's home, the Israeli leader presented the American president with a photo of one of the Bibas toddlers, children who are still held captive by Hamas terrorists in Gaza.
Netanyahu said the picture was given to him by the toddlers' grandfather, who asked him to share it with Trump. 
""Wow, that's very moving,"" Trump said, accepting the photograph. ""We'll get that taken care of."" 
Earlier, protesters had gathered in West Palm Beach, Florida, to greet Netanyahu as his plane landed. The prime minister's visit to the nation's capital this week also sparked pro-Hamas demonstrations, which featured antisemitic slogans, calls for Israel's eradication, vandalism and heated confrontations with D.C. police.   
In his address to Congress, Netanyahu accused Iran of funding the protests and tore into the demonstrators, who have demanded an immediate cease-fire between Israel and Hamas.

At least 26 people were killed by a gang in three remote villages in Papua New Guinea’s north and eight villagers remained missing Friday in the latest violence in the South Pacific island nation relating to contested land ownership and sorcery allegations, officials said.
""It was a very terrible thing … when I approached the area, I saw that there were children, men, women. They were killed by a group of 30 young men,"" the acting police commander in East Sepik province, James Baugen, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. on Friday.
PAPUA NEW GUINEA SAYS LANDSLIDE BURIES OVER 2,000 PEOPLE ALIVE
Baugen said all the houses in the villages had been burned and the remaining villagers had taken shelter at a police station, too scared to name the perpetrators.
""Some of the bodies left in the night were taken by crocodiles into the swamp. We only saw the place where they were killed. There were heads chopped off,"" Baugen said. He said the attackers were hiding and there were no arrests yet.
Chris Jensen, country director for the aid group World Vision, said 26 people were confirmed dead, eight were missing and 51 families were displaced from their homes in Angoram district on the crocodile-infested Sepik River, the longest river on New Guinea island.

""The trigger seems to be, as it is in most cases in PNG, a combination of a couple of things. But sorcery seems to be one of the triggers along with land ownership,"" Jensen told The Associated Press.
""An individual will get accused of sorcery and they may be the people who perhaps have some control over some assets or land,"" Jensen said.
U.N. Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in a statement Wednesday that the attacks happened on July 16 and July 18.
""I am horrified by the shocking eruption of deadly violence in Papua New Guinea, seemingly as the result of a dispute over land and lake ownership and user rights,"" Turk said.
Turk said the dead included 16 children.
""This number could rise to over 50, as local authorities search for missing people. In addition, more than 200 villagers fled as their homes were torched,"" Turk said.
The Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary in the capital, Port Moresby, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.
East Sepik Gov. Allan Bird said violence across the diverse nation of more than 10 million people, who are mostly subsistence farmers, has escalated in the past decade. Police are under-resourced and rarely intervene, Bird said.
Papua New Guinea has more than 800 Indigenous languages and has been riven by tribal conflicts over land for centuries. Most of the country's land belongs to tribes rather than individuals, with no clear borders.
The conflicts have become increasingly lethal in recent decades as combatants move from bows and arrows to assault rifles. Mercenaries are increasingly becoming involved.
Blake Johnson, an analyst at the Australian Security Policy Institute think tank, said while the East Sepik slayings appeared to be a particularly gruesome event, ""it is not the first instance of mass murder this year"" in Papua New Guinea.
""Escalation of violence between groups, often leading to retaliatory murder is, at best, culturally accepted and at worst encouraged,"" Johnson said.
Law enforcement officers lack the resources and training to police most of the country, he said.
""The country is too big, too harsh and too difficult to navigate, and we don't even know how many people live in these places,"" Johnson said.
Papua New Guinea's tribal fighting attracted international attention in February, when at least 26 combatants and an unconfirmed number of bystanders were killed in a gun battle in Enga province.
Ongoing conflict complicated the emergency response in May when a landslide in the same province devastated at least one village. The government said more than 2,000 people were killed, while the United Nations estimated the death toll at 670.

Australia, Papua New Guinea's former colonial master and its biggest provider of aid, signed a bilateral security pact last year that targets its nearest neighbor's growing security concerns, while Beijing also reportedly wants to ink a policing agreement with it.

Vice President Kamala Harris publicly pressed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to ""get this deal done"" and agree to a cease-fire to end Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza, but Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, won't say whether she's also pushing terror group Hamas to relent at the negotiating table.
Harris' remarks urging Israel to make a deal, which came after her ""frank and constructive"" meeting with Netanyahu on Thursday, were lambasted by former President Donald Trump in public and, reportedly, by Netanyahu in private.
""I think her remarks were disrespectful,"" Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, told reporters while standing alongside Netanyahu on Friday afternoon. ""They weren't very nice pertaining to Israel. I actually don't know how a person who's Jewish can vote for her, but that's up to them. But she was certainly disrespectful to Israel, in my opinion.""
The current iteration of the proposed deal has two phases, Harris revealed. Phase one calls for a full cease-fire, ""including a withdrawal of the Israeli military from population centers in Gaza."" The second phase would see the Israeli military withdraw from Gaza ""entirely.""
Harris said that there was ""hopeful movement in the talks to secure an agreement on this deal,"" but when asked several times by Fox News Digital whether she is applying the same pressure to Hamas leaders to accept the terms as she is to Netanyahu and Israel, her office did not respond.

Harris also stressed a ""serious concern about the scale of human suffering in Gaza.""
Netanyahu was unhappy with Harris' mentioning of civilian deaths in Gaza and characterization of the ""dire humanitarian situation there,"" an Israeli official told Axios, adding that there was some concern that the remarks could actually impede progress toward the cease-fire that Harris apparently desires.
But an aide to Harris dismissed that notion.

FOX_29,Trump impeachment Dem pushes back on GOP concerns over possible role in assassination attempt probe,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-dem-pushes-back-gop-concerns-over-possible-role-assassination-attempt-probe,2024-07-27 05:00:02.745564,politics,"Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, elaborates on his criticism of FBI Director Christopher Wray casting doubt on whether former President Trump was hit by a bullet during an assassination attempt.
The office of a House Democrat who played a prominent role in former President Trump’s first impeachment is now pushing back against GOP-fueled criticism that he should not be on the task force investigating the attempted assassination of the former president.
Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., who came under fire last year for saying that Trump ""has to be eliminated,"" is among the Democrats being considered for a place on the bipartisan commission to study the July 13 shooting at Trump’s Butler, Pennsylvania, rally, a source familiar with the matter told Fox News Digital. 
""As someone with a lifelong commitment to democracy and the rule of law, Congressman Goldman immediately clarified a misstatement from last November to emphasize his strong condemnation of all political violence. The Congressman demonstrated with pointed questioning during congressional hearings last week that the Secret Service must be held accountable for its unacceptable security lapse, and he is determined to ensure such a failure never happens again,"" Goldman's spokesperson Madison Andrus told Fox News Digital.

Goldman first came to national prominence as Democrats’ lead counsel during Trump’s first impeachment trial. He has remained a vocal Trump critic since coming to Congress in January 2023.
His potential placement on the commission has already invoked the ire of Trump allies since first being reported in Punchbowl News on Friday morning.
Among those leading the criticism is Donald Trump Jr., who recalled that Goldman had said that Trump needed to be ""eliminated,"" in a November 2023 MSNBC interview, which Goldman has since apologized for.
""Democrats are trying to put Dan Goldman on the committee to investigate the assassination attempt. Just weeks ago he called for DJT to be ‘eliminated.’ Probably not the best person to have on this task force,"" Trump Jr. wrote on X.

Goldman wrote on X in November 2023, ""Yesterday on TV, I mistakenly used the wrong word to express the importance for America that Donald Trump doesn’t become President again. While he must be defeated, I certainly wish no harm to him and do not condone political violence. I apologize for the poor choice of words.""
Philip Letsou, deputy communications director for the Senate Republicans’ campaign arm, wrote on the site, ""Democrats are evidently planning on stacking the task force to investigate the assassination attempt on Trump with conspiracy theorists like Dan Goldman.""
The House voted to establish the commission in a unanimous 416-0 vote last week. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said the panel will have seven Republicans and six Democrats, chosen by himself and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., respectively.
As of Friday morning, Jeffries’ office told Fox News Digital that no final decisions had been made.

But a second source who spoke with Fox News Digital said that another possible contender is Rep. Glenn Ivey, D-Md., who served as State’s Attorney for Prince George's County for nearly a decade from 2003 until 2011, before coming to Congress in 2023.

On the GOP side, a senior Republican lawmaker told Fox News Digital that ""it seems like half our members want to be on the task force.""
A third source who spoke with Fox News Digital said that Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., was in strong consideration to play a prominent role on the panel. Kelly, whose district the shooting took place in, was present when the shooting occurred.
Kelly was also the leader of the resolution establishing the task force that passed the House this week.

Former President Trump said he plans to hold a campaign rally in the same Pennsylvania town where he was shot earlier this month in a failed assassination attempt. 
Trump was shot on the ear in Butler while speaking to supporters during a July 13 campaign event. The shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was shot and killed by a U.S. Secret Service sniper moments after opening fire.

The shooting shocked rallygoers as bullets flew while Trump was speaking about President Biden's immigration record. The shooter got off eight shots with an AR-style rifle in just a few seconds before he was shot and killed. 
Crooks opened fire from the roof of a nearby building near the event. One spectator was killed and two others were critically injured.

The shooting highlighted security lapses and prompted a slew of criticism of the Secret Service and its leadership over how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Kimberly Cheatle resigned as director of the agency this week amid calls from lawmakers for her to step down. 
""The Secret Service’s solemn mission is to protect our nation’s leaders. On July 13th, we failed,"" she told lawmakers on the House Oversight and Accountability Committee this week. 
Cheatle said she apologized to Trump during a phone call with the presumptive Republican nominee.

The Republican nominee for president made those remarks as he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort home. Netanyahu traveled to Florida to meet with Trump after meeting with President Biden and presumptive Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris in Washington, D.C., earlier this week, following his Wednesday address to a joint session of Congress.

FOX_32,"'White dudes for Harris' to hold call after 160,000 White women join ‘Karens for Kamala’ Zoom",https://www.foxnews.com/media/white-dudes-for-harris-hold-call-after-160000-white-women-join-karens-for-kamala-zoom,2024-07-27 06:27:02.626987,politics,"Fox News’ William La Jeunesse reports on Kamala Harris' ascent to the presumptive 2024 Democratic presidential candidate.
A virtual meeting dubbed ""White Dudes for Harris"" plans to hold a call on Monday to drum up excitement for Vice President Kamala Harris’ election bid. 
""Over 10,000 white men from all across the country are expected to join the effort this week and will be on hand to welcome Vice President Harris to the presidential race and pledge to help get her elected,"" organizers said on a sign-up form for the call. 
The call comes after 164,000 White women broke the world record for largest Zoom call on Thursday, all hopping on a meeting to show support for Vice President Harris’ presidential campaign.
The massive remote meeting – advertised as ""White Women: Answer the Call"" – featured multiple celebrity guests like U.S. Women’s Soccer star Megan Rapinoe, musician Pink, and actress Connie Britton, some of whom spoke to a horde of specifically White women, hoping to shore up support for the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.

Britton, who also spoke during the virtual event, jokingly called the meeting, ""Karens for Kamala.""
The Thursday online gathering was inspired by a previous Zoom call directed at Black women last Sunday that was organized by activist group ""Win With Black Women"" only hours after President Joe Biden announced his decision to withdraw from his re-election campaign, endorsing Harris. 
That event had around 44,000 attendees and raised more than $1.5 million for the Harris campaign, The Guardian reported.
On Monday, more than 50,000 Black men also held a call in support of Harris. 
Shannon Watts, the founder of gun-control advocacy group ""Moms Demand Action"" organized Thursday’s record-breaking meeting. Two days prior to the event, she posted on X, stating, ""Time to organize a white women conference call like the Black women and men have to support Vice President Kamala Harris. Who’s in?""

According to Reason.com, the event raised over $1.8 million for the Democratic National Committee on Thursday evening, with attendees being encouraged to blast out a fundraising link to their friends and family.
Feminist outlet The 19th reported that by Friday afternoon nearly $7 million more had been raised. 
In a speech to the virtual participants, Britton declared, ""we've got a f------ job to do, y'all."" The actress added that a future President Harris will ""listen"" as well as ""lead with empathy, integrity, and the power of the truth.""
She then gushed about the moment that Biden stepped down and the vice president assumed the mantle of presumptive presidential nominee. ""It was seismic. Cosmic, even. And since then—have you seen it? Have you seen Kamala glisten in the brilliance and shine of her true power and leadership? And what does that feel like? Feels like self-love.""
Watts, who also spoke on the call, called out White women for their previous voting patterns, stating, ""The bad news is that a majority of White women vote for Republicans, because too many of us believe, subconsciously, that it is in our best interest to use our privilege and our support systems of White supremacy and the patriarchy to benefit us.""

She urged them to break the mold and unite behind Harris. ""White women, we have 100 days to help save the world!"" she said.
Author and liberal activist Glennon Doyle also spoke to the 160,000 virtual attendees, telling them they need to ""step up and out and into the gap between democracy and fascism,"" adding that when the election is won, they can say ""we were among the women who finally united, and…we saved the goddamn world.""
Ahead of Monday's meeting, the White Dudes for Harris sign-up vowed they wouldn't be bullied by the ""MAGA crowd.""
""Together, we aren’t going to sit around and let the MAGA crowd bully other white guys into voting for a hateful and divisive ideology because we understand that under MAGA everyone loses. We know that as white dudes, we have both a strong, and positive role to play in America’s shared future, and it begins with all of us cutting through the MAGA crap and reminding the folks who have co-opted American symbols what America actually means. We are excited to join together with you in this fight.""

Ross Morales Rocketto, one of the White Dudes for Harris organizers, wrote on X that they were ""inspired by the incredible organizing by Black women, men, and others! We are doing this because for too long our community hasn’t organized itself and that’s been to the detriment of everyone.""
Harris’ entrance in the race has given Democrats a jolt of energy following weeks of uncertainty after Biden’s weak debate performance against former President Trump and a succession of calls from liberals for him to drop out. 
Other demographic-specific calls in support of Harris have included South Asians and LGBTQ+.

FOX_33,Ramaswamy warns GOP on several 'hard realities' to address before criticizing Harris: 'Hurting our chances',https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ramaswamy-warns-gop-several-hard-realities-address-before-criticizing-harris-hurting-our-chances,2024-07-27 06:22:02.626987,politics,"Former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy spoke to Fox News Digital about concerns he has with how Republicans are framing their criticisms of Vice President Kamala Harris.
Former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy issued a warning to Republicans this week that they need to be aware of some ""hard realities"" around the way they message their criticisms of Vice President Kamala Harris now that she is the presumptive Democratic nominee for president.
""The bottom line is, I think what's happened is a lot of Republicans were caught by surprise after the convention,"" Ramaswamy told Fox News Digital on Friday. ""That's resulted in some reactive steps that I don't think all make sense. And I think they're actually hurting us.""
Ramaswamy spoke to Fox News Digital about a viral comment he posted Thursday on X that was seen by over 3 million people that addressed issues and concerns he has seen with the way Republicans are talking about the matchup between Harris and former President Trump.
Ramswamy’s first point and concern is that Republicans are calling for Biden to step down or be removed from office, using the argument that if he is not capable of running for president, he isn’t capable of serving as president.

""I think this makes absolutely zero sense and here's why,"" Ramaswamy explained. ""Kamala Harris is unproven as a political leader, let alone as the U.S. president. Why put her in a position as the U.S. president with all the benefits of incumbency? Oval Office addresses, God forbid, to even change policy or foreign policy, to be able to create circumstances that make her look better. That's one of the advantages that many incumbent presidents, the sad truth is, have used throughout American history.""
Ramaswamy said calling on Biden to step down is ""another example"" of Republicans being ""reactive,"" which ends up ""hurting our chances rather than helping us.""
""It's not going to be good for America and it's not going to be good for Republican electoral prospects if Kamala Harris is the President of the United States of America for even a short period of time, for even a minute,"" Ramaswamy said. ""I don't think that's something we should want, and it doesn't make sense and that's why I called it out.""
Many Republicans have focused on Harris’ record as a prosecutor, which Ramaswamy warned could backfire if they focus too much on attacks that she ""locked up"" too many people for petty crimes.
NEW POLL SHOWS TRUMP, HARRIS TIED IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE: 'CLOSE AS CLOSE CAN BE'

""So look, this is the other category of criticisms I see coming, even from some conservatives, saying that she locked up too many people while she was a prosecutor,"" he said. ""This is the wrong line of attack. It doesn't make sense.""
Ramaswamy continued, ""In fact, one of the images that Kamala Harris is trying to project is that she's somehow going to be a law-and-order presidential candidate. I find that laughable. Look at under the Democratic regime, including policies that she has supported, clear the jails, defund the police. That's resulted in a wave of rampant crime in this country. People in the United States of America, across the aisle and both camps, are dead set against this wave of crime. But if against that backdrop, Republicans are criticizing her for locking too many people up, it doesn't make sense because it legitimizes the otherwise laughable claim that she's a law-and-order candidate.""
Republicans have also accused Harris of covering up Biden’s health issues while at the same time accusing the vice president of orchestrating a soft ""coup"" to remove him from the ticket. Ramswamy told Fox News Digital those two messages don’t mesh.
""The main point is what voters really care about is the future,"" he said. ""What are we actually going to deliver? And the more we focus on bickering on that past political missteps or whatever from the Democratic side, the more small-minded we're going to be seen as being.
""On one hand, you have Republicans saying that Kamala Harris covered up for Joe Biden. She was covering for him and telling the public that he was actually a great president, when in fact he wasn't cognitively capable. On the other hand, at the same time, we're saying that Kamala staged this coup against Biden. It doesn't make sense to many independent voters to say both of those things at the same time. They're self-contradictory. And if we say things that don't make sense, we're more likely to lose votes, which is the thing that I care most about. So I come back to the basic point. That's not how we're going to win this election. We're not going to win this election by picking at these nit-picking… ‘inside baseball’ political criticisms of Kamala. It doesn't matter. The voters don't care.""

Ramaswamy told Fox News Digital that Harris is not the ""biggest risk"" the Republican side faces, but rather the ""shenanigans on the Democratic side.""
""The voters don't love Kamala Harris on her own terms,"" Ramaswamy said. ""We know that because even when she was running in the Democratic primary, she didn't even make it to the Iowa caucus. I was an unknown 37-year-old businessman, ran for office for the first time as U.S. president last year. I have more delegates that have supported me for U.S. president than Kamala Harris ever has had. That's because voters don't find her compelling. So it's not that Kamala Harris is our biggest risk.""
When asked if some Republicans are underestimating Harris’ ability to win, Ramswamy said that ""complacency"" is always a concern.
""You got to compete like you're behind, or else you soon will be,"" he said. ""We're not up against a candidate. It's not Kamala. It's not Joe. It's not any other individual candidate. We are up against a machine and the more we understand that, we have formidable opponents. Let's take stock of some sobering realities. Republicans have lost devastating defeats relative to expectations in 2018, 2020, 2022.

""I don't want to see the same thing happen in 2024. So, you know what? ‘Fool me once. Shame on you. Fool me twice. Shame on me.’ The old adage means something for a reason. I think our movement needs to wake up and say that winning by a little bit shouldn't even be our goal. We've got to win by a landslide, and a landslide minus some shenanigans in margin is still going to be a victory. That's the attitude we need.""
Ramaswamy explained his belief that Democrats were waiting until after the Republican National Convention to have ""full information,"" and that it is understandable Republicans were caught ""flat-footed,"" but ultimately they will be victorious in November if they stay focused. 
""It doesn't matter because Kamala Harris—we can easily defeat Kamala Harris in the same landslide we were going to defeat Joe Biden on,"" he said. ""But it's not going to be by nit-picking on random political criticisms of her. I think those could backfire. I think the way we're going to do it is by articulating our own vision of who we are and what we stand for. And if so, we win this thing not only in a landslide, but we unite this country and revive our country, which is something we're hungry for.""

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
South African police arrested 95 Libyan nationals in a raid on a suspected secret military training camp on Friday and authorities said they were investigating whether there were more illegal bases in other parts of the country.
The camp was discovered at a farm in White River in the Mpumalanga province, about 360 kilometers (220 miles) northeast of Johannesburg, police said.

National police spokesperson Athlenda Mathe said in a post on the social media site X that the Libyans stated they had entered the country on study visas to train as security guards, but police investigations suggest they have received military training.
The Newzroom Afrika TV news channel broadcast pictures of the site of the arrests, showing a military-style camp with large green and khaki tents set up in a row. Dozens of men were seen lining up as they were arrested. They were wearing civilian clothing.
Local government official Jackie Macie said investigations were ongoing and the owner of the farm would be questioned. He said authorities received information that there were similar secret camps near two other towns in Mpumalanga province.

The province borders neighboring countries Mozambique and Swaziland and is an area of concern for South African authorities with regards to illegal immigration.
Police and authorities have not said whether the camps are suspected of being connected to a particular group or conflict.
Macie said investigations would establish if there was a network of camps in South Africa and show ""why they are here doing military training in our country.""
Police said the men may be linked to crimes reported in communities close to the farm in recent months.
""We have serious cases which have been opened with the police, including cases of rape and armed robberies, which complainants claim were committed by unknown foreigners who seem to be of Asian descent,"" said police spokesman Donald Mdhluli.
""We take what we have found here today very seriously because we don’t know who was training them, what were they being trained for and why that training is happening here in South Africa. It may be a threat not only to South Africa but also to the entire southern Africa region.""
Police said the operation to arrest the Libyans and close down the camp began two days ago. Macie said the Libyan nationals had been in the country since at least April.
""The 95 individuals taken into custody are all Libyan nationals and are currently being questioned by the relevant authorities,"" Mpumalanga acting provincial police commissioner Maj. Gen. Zeph Mkhwanazi said in a statement.

Mdhluli, the police spokesman, said the country's security regulator had confirmed that the kind of training that appears to have been taking place at the camp was well beyond the scope of training for security guards.

Most voters in four battleground states approve of President Joe Biden getting out of the presidential race and two-thirds want him to complete his term, according to Fox News statewide surveys in Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The polls include over 1,000 registered voters in each state and were conducted July 22-24 (after Biden dropped out and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris).
The surveys find the horserace between Harris and former President Donald Trump looks a lot like the Biden-Trump race did in April -- extremely close. Harris and Trump are tied in two states (Michigan and Pennsylvania), Trump is ahead by 1 point in Wisconsin, and Harris is up by 6 in Minnesota. 
Plus, in each of the four state surveys:

 – Trump is meeting or exceeding his 2020 vote share in the two-way race against Harris.
 – Support for Harris in the horserace exceeds Biden’s support in April surveys.*
 – Between 93-96% of Democrats back Harris in the head-to-head matchup, and between 92-95% of Republicans support Trump. 
– Fewer than one voter in five feels they are ""getting ahead"" financially, as the largest number say they are ""falling behind.""
– The economy is the top issue to twice as many voters as the next highest issues, immigration and abortion. All other issues lag those three. 
– Trump is preferred over Harris by wide margins among voters prioritizing the economy and immigration.  Harris is favored among those saying abortion is their top issue.

– Harris has a higher favorable rating than Trump, except in Michigan where they are tied.
– Biden’s favorable ratings are a bit worse than in April and well below both Harris and Trump.*
– Democratic candidates for the U.S. Senate outperform Harris’ vote share in the horserace.
– Support for third-party candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is lower than it was in April.*
– Three-quarters or more approve of Biden’s decision to end his re-election bid.
– Two-thirds want Biden to finish his term rather than resign.

The Fox News Poll is conducted under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R). The battleground surveys were conducted July 22-24, 2024, among registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file in Michigan (1,012), Minnesota (1,071), Pennsylvania (1,034), and Wisconsin (1,046). Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines and cellphones or completed the survey online after receiving a text. Results based on the full sample in each state have a margin of sampling error of ±3 percentage points. The sampling error is higher among subgroups. In addition to sampling error, question wording and order can influence results. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics are representative of the registered voter population.

Byron Donalds, R-Fla., joins 'America Reports' to discuss Kamala Harris' position on Israel, arguing she hasn't demonstrated 'clear moral authority' to deal with the unrest in the Middle East.
At this same point in the election cycle four years ago, Joe Biden was ahead of Donald Trump by 9 percentage points among Wisconsin voters in a two-way presidential matchup. Now, just days after the Republican National Convention ended in Milwaukee, a new Fox News survey shows Wisconsinites give the advantage to Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris -- by 1 point. 
Harris receives 49% support to Trump’s 50%. In April, it was 48% each for Biden and Trump, and it was also tied in January (47% apiece).  In June 2020, Biden was at 49% to Trump’s 40%.
Trump’s edge is mainly due to an expanded 14-point lead among men, up from an 8-point lead over Biden in April. He is also favored over Harris among White men without a college degree (by 20 points), rural voters (+15), and White voters (+2).
Harris receives a bit more support among Democrats (96%) than Trump gets among Republicans (93%), but he makes up the difference by having a 4-point advantage among Independents. 
HARRIS' SHIFT FROM TOUGH-ON-CRIME PROSECUTOR TO SOCIAL JUSTICE ADVOCATE FACES SCRUTINY FROM CONSERVATIVE GROUP
Some of Harris’ best groups include urban voters (+19 over Trump), Whites with a college degree (+18), and suburban women (+13). Her numbers roughly match or are a bit higher than Biden’s were in April among Whites without a college degree (+5), Independents (+5), voters under 35 (+4), women (+3), Democrats (+1), Whites (+1), and those ages 65 and over (-1).
The biggest shift is among ""double haters"" (voters with unfavorable views of both Trump and Biden). Trump was ahead by 1 point in April, but they now favor Harris by 25 points. There are too few Harris-Trump double haters to breakout by vote preference.

Trump is favored by 3 points among new voters (haven’t voted in four most recent general elections), and union households go for him by 2 points, which is different from what we see in a couple of other northern industrial states. Union voters prefer Harris by 6 points in Michigan and by 15 points in Minnesota. 
Biden’s personal favorable rating was negative by 10 points in April and now he’s underwater by 12.  It’s the reverse for Trump, who went from being underwater by 10 points to negative 5 in the new survey. Harris is more popular than both at 49% favorable and 49% unfavorable. JD Vance’s favorability is negative by 7 points, while 15% are unable to rate him. 
TRUMP TO RETURN TO PENNSYLVANIA FOR FIRST TIME SINCE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT
Fifteen percent of Wisconsin voters say they are getting ahead financially, up from 11% six months ago. Still, most continue to feel they are holding steady (41%) or falling behind (43%). 
By far, the economy will be the deciding issue this fall.  It’s the top priority for 37%, trailed by abortion and immigration at 15% each. All other issues are in the single digits.
Majorities of those prioritizing the economy and immigration back Trump (by 38 and 81 points respectively), while those putting abortion as their top issue prefer Harris by 78 points.
""This poll shows Harris in a slightly stronger position in Wisconsin than Biden based on personal favorability,"" says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, whose company Beacon Research conducts Fox News surveys along with Republican Daron Shaw.  ""However, with many voters feeling strained financially and union households breaking for Trump, she has work to do convincing voters they’ll be better off continuing with a Democrat in the White House.""
In a potential 5-way race, Harris and Trump tie at 46% each, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. receiving 5%, and Jill Stein and Cornel West at 1% each.  Support for Kennedy was 9% in April.
Kennedy takes more support from Trump (6%) than Harris (2%), but it evens out because the other candidates also take from her (3%).
The large 75% approval of Biden withdrawing from the presidential race is widespread, as it includes 88% of Democrats and two-thirds of Republicans (65%) and Independents (69%).

That consensus disappears on the issue of Biden finishing his term: 92% of Democrats and 58% Independents think he should, while 57% of Republicans think he should resign.  Overall, two-thirds think he should stick around. 
In 2020, Biden won Wisconsin by 20,682 votes, less than one percentage point. Trump’s 2016 victory was also by less than a point (22,748 votes).

In the senate race, Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin leads likely Republican challenger Eric Hovde by a 54-43% margin, running 5 points ahead of Harris’ support in the presidential race. (The Wisconsin primary is August 13.)
More Trump supporters are ticket splitters, as 83% of his backers favor Hovde, while 96% of Harris supporters go for Baldwin.

Overall, three-quarters of Wisconsin voters say they are extremely motivated to vote in the presidential election, and they split 50% Harris vs. 49% Trump. That’s because slightly more Harris supporters (76%) than Trump supporters (73%) say they are extremely motivated.

The latest Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters finds Vice President Kamala Harris in a dead heat with former President Donald Trump. This comes two weeks after the former president was shot in an assassination attempt in the Keystone State, and one week after President Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race and endorsed Harris.
The state of the race is similar to where it was in April, when Biden and Trump were tied 48-48%.  The survey, released Friday, shows Harris and Trump locked in a tie at 49-49% -- barely different from what the final election results were in 2020 (49.85% Biden vs. 48.69% Trump).

Since April, Harris has held on to most of Biden’s coalition while Trump’s groups have stayed firm, but there are a few notable shifts in voting patterns from the spring. 
Trump has closed the gap with voters under 30 (-27 points in April to -4 points today), voters 65 and over (-5 to -1), suburban women (-32 to -12), those with a college degree (-18 to -10) and has widened it slightly among Independents (+8 to +9).
FLASHBACK: HARRIS TRIED TO DEFUND BORDER PATROL AGENTS, SLASH ICE BUDGET
Harris has narrowed the gap among White men without a degree (-34 points to -28 points).
Seven in 10 Pennsylvanians are extremely motivated to vote this year, with Democrats slightly more enthusiastic (75%) than Republicans (72%), and Independents decidedly less enthused at 43%.  Overall, those extremely motivated to vote are a bit more likely to back Harris (51% to 49% Trump).
The expanded ballot shows Harris with a 2-point edge: 45% Harris, 43% Trump, 7% Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Jill Stein and Cornel West with 1% each. Third parties hurt Trump here as 10% of his two-way supporters go for someone else compared to 7% of Harris’ supporters.
Voters are split on Harris’ favorable rating: 49-49%. Still, views of her are better than Biden (41% favorable, 57% unfavorable) or Trump (46-53%).

Those with negative views of both Biden and Trump back Harris by 41 points. In April, Biden was up by only 27 points among these so-called double haters. 
""While the horserace remains deadlocked, there’s more under the surface to suggest Democrats are in a significantly better position in Pennsylvania than in April,"" says Democrat Chris Anderson, who conducts Fox News surveys with Republican Daron Shaw. ""The Democrat at the top of the ticket is now more favorable than Trump and Democrats are more motivated, and the key group of double haters are breaking more heavily for Harris than they were for Biden.""
Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is widely considered to be on Harris’ shortlist of potential running mates, receives a 61% favorable rating -- the highest of any individual tested. His rating has improved by 10 points since July 2022 when he was campaigning for governor.
The survey also finds he does better than Harris in a hypothetical matchup against Trump: Shapiro 54% to Trump’s 44%, for a 10-point lead. That is outside the margin of error.
That’s because Shapiro outperforms Harris among key groups such as women, White voters, those under age 30 and over 65, college graduates, Republicans, Independents, and suburban voters. He does slightly worse with nonwhites compared to Harris.
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was also tested against Trump. She fares about the same as Harris: 48% Whitmer vs. 49% for Trump in a potential matchup. Her favorable rating sits at 38% favorable vs. 34% unfavorable while 28% can’t rate her.
Those receiving the lowest favorable ratings are Trump’s running mate JD Vance (38% favorable, 47% unfavorable) and Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar (32-35%), although 15% can’t rate Vance and 33% can’t rate Klobuchar.
TRUMP QUICKLY MOVES TO DEFINE HARRIS AS ‘MORE LEFT THAN BERNIE SANDERS’
Biden’s job approval rating is down slightly from April, underwater by 12 points (44% approve, 56% disapprove) compared to 10 points in the spring (45-55%). One factor keeping the race tight is that voters who somewhat disapprove of Biden go for Trump by only 5 points.
And while 78% approve of Biden’s decision to withdraw from the presidential race, two-thirds say he should finish his term (65% finish term, 33% resign).

Majorities of Democrats (86%), Republicans (69%), and Independents (78%) support Biden stepping aside from the campaign. Democrats and Independents think he should finish his term as president, while Republicans are more likely to want him to resign.
Overall, 47% want Harris to replace Biden, including 74% of self-identified Democrats. Shapiro comes in second among both groups for replacing Biden (20% all voters, 14% Democrats). Just 2% of voters want Whitmer or Klobuchar.
Shapiro and Whitmer are set to campaign for Harris in Pennsylvania on Monday.
Four in 10 Pennsylvanians say the economy will be the most important issue to them when voting this fall. That’s the highest of the issues tested and comes as three times as many voters say they are falling behind (44%) rather than getting ahead financially (14%). Another 4 in 10 (42%) are holding steady. The only other issues in double digits are immigration (16%) and abortion (15%). All others are under 10%. 
""Even more so than in other battleground states, the economy is everything in Pennsylvania,"" says Shaw. ""Trump’s edge on the economy in general, and inflation in particular, is why he is better positioned now than he was four years ago, and that’s the biggest problem for Harris.""
Economy and immigration voters back Trump by 31 and 86 points respectively, while abortion voters back Harris by 67 points.
A few more things…
In the Senate race, incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania leads Republican challenger David McCormick by 13 points. It also shows he performs better than Harris does against Trump, with Casey getting 55% support to McCormick’s 42%.
Some 15% of Trump supporters switch sides to Casey while just 3% of Harris backers defect to McCormick.

A Democrat has won the presidential race in Minnesota every cycle since 1976 and Vice President Kamala Harris is favorably positioned to extend this streak in 2024, as she currently has a 6-point advantage over former President Donald Trump in a Fox News survey released Friday.
A majority of voters support Harris in a head-to-head matchup against Trump, 52% to 46%, nearly matching the 2020 vote (52.40% Biden, 45.28% Trump). These results sit right at the margin of sampling error.
The survey was completed after the July 13 assassination attempt on Trump and Biden’s July 21 withdrawal announcement and endorsement of Harris.
Harris is bolstered by strong support from urban voters (65%), suburban women (63%), White voters with a college degree (60%), women (58%), voters ages 65 and over (58%), union households (57%), and Independents (53%).
JOE BIDEN'S HEALTH: LEADERSHIP ABILITY QUESTIONS MOUNT AS OVAL OFFICE SPEECH GAVE NO REASON FOR EXITING RACE
Trump’s coalition consists of White evangelical Christians (69%), White men with no college degree (59%), rural voters (56%), men under age 45 (54%), and voters under age 30 (52%).
Harris has stronger ideological (93% of liberal voters back her) and party support (95% of Democrats) than Trump (81% of conservatives and 93% of Republicans).
Nearly 7 in 10 Minnesotans are extremely motivated to vote this November and they go for Harris by 7 points.
The vice president also does better than other potential Biden replacements in hypothetical matchups against Trump:  Gretchen Whitmer 49% vs. Trump 46%, and Josh Shapiro 49% vs. Trump 45%.
In the expanded ballot, Harris drops below 50% support, but Trump suffers more:  Harris 47%, Trump 41%, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 7%, and Jill Stein and Cornel West at 1% each. Slightly more two-way Trump supporters defect to third parties (10%) than Harris supporters (7%).
Kennedy is currently the only third-party candidate on the ballot in Minnesota. 
Harris’ personal favorable rating is higher than Biden’s by 9 points. She also receives a net positive rating of 4 points (51% favorable vs. 47% unfavorable) versus a negative rating by 14 points for Biden (42-56%). 
Still, neither is as high as Amy Klobuchar, the senior U.S. Democratic Senator from Minnesota, who checks in at 57% favorable vs. 38% unfavorable. Other possible replacements for Biden are in positive territory but are much less well known in Minnesota:  Whitmer (39% favorable, 33% unfavorable, 28% can’t rate) and Shapiro (33% favorable, 27% unfavorable, 40% can’t rate).  
The president’s job performance rating is higher than his personal favorability rating:  46% approve while 53% disapprove.

Biden’s decision to withdraw from the presidential race is met with high approval (83%). More Democrats (90%) approve than Independents (83%) or Republicans (76%). 
While majorities approve of the decision to withdraw, by more than 2 to 1 voters still think he should finish his term: 68% finish vs. 30% resign.
Trump’s favorable rating is underwater by 13 points (43% favorable, 56% unfavorable) while his vice-presidential running mate JD Vance is underwater by 8 points and lesser known (37% favorable, 45% unfavorable, 18% can’t rate).
TAKE IT FROM ME, REPUBLICANS: KAMALA HARRIS IS A STRONG CANDIDATE. DON'T UNDERESTIMATE HER
""Minnesota is a tough nut for the Republicans, and Harris is a better fit in Minnesota than Biden,"" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Democrat Chris Anderson. ""But the contest is clearly competitive there and that’s indicative of a race in which Trump still has more pathways to victory than Harris.""
Trump and Vance are set to campaign in St. Cloud, Minnesota, on Saturday.
The top issue for Minnesota voters when it comes to their vote this fall is the economy at 33%, with more than twice as many saying they are falling behind financially (43%) as say they are getting ahead (17%). Four in 10 say they are holding steady (39%).
Immigration (16%) and abortion (15%) follow the economy as the second and third most important issues. All other issues tested are in the single digits. The top issue for Democrats is abortion (24%) while for Republicans (44%) and Independents (39%) it is the economy.
Overall, those who point to the economy as the most important issue back Trump by 33 points, while immigration voters support him by an even greater 83 points. Those who say abortion is their top issue favor Harris by 63 points.
""The prospect of Republicans bringing Minnesota into play this fall appears less likely with Harris at the top of the ticket,"" says Anderson. ""She is viewed favorably by a narrow majority, while larger majorities are unfavorable toward both Trump and Biden. The choice is no longer between a lesser of two evils for some voters.""
Although Harris’ nomination is not official, she’s the top choice among Minnesota registered voters to replace Biden, with 48% supporting her as the nominee, including 76% of Democrats and 40% of Independents. The second choice of both Democrats (8%) and Independents (16%) is Klobuchar.

FOX_40,Fox News Poll: Dead heat between Harris and Trump in Michigan,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-dead-heat-between-harris-trump-michigan,2024-07-27 06:00:02.626987,world,"Fox News contributor Karl Rove comments on Kamala Harris’ ascension from vice president to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.
The presidential contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump is tied in Michigan, a state widely seen as a ""must have"" for Democrats. Harris exceeds President Joe Biden’s performance among some key voting blocs, and that makes it a dead-even race for the first time this year, according to a Fox News survey of Michigan voters conducted after Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris.
In a hypothetical head-to-head matchup, Harris and Trump each garner 49% support. Trump was ahead of Biden by 3 points in April and by 2 points in February. In the wake of being unofficially embraced as the party’s nominee, Harris received higher support than Biden did in April, while Trump’s number held steady despite the survey being conducted soon after the Republican National Convention and a failed assassination attempt. 
Here’s why the race is a tossup: Men favor Trump by 13 points, while women back Harris by 12. Voters ages 45 and over prefer Trump by 2 points, but Harris is the choice among voters under 35 by 5 points. Whites without a college degree pick Trump by 15 points, while Whites with a degree go for Harris by 3 points and voters of color back her by 39 points.  
Harris also receives support from union households (+6 points), and she trails by only 9 points among those who ""somewhat"" disapprove of Biden’s job performance.
NETANYAHU REPORTEDLY UPSET WITH HARRIS OVER VP'S ISRAEL REMARKS AS WHITE HOUSE PUSHES BACK
Other groups backing Trump include Independents (+8 points), rural voters (+20), and White evangelical Christians (+48). 
Compared to Biden in April, Harris performs better with Democrats (by 3 points), men (+5), Whites without a college degree (+6), Black voters (+7), voters under age 35 (+ 12), and those with negative views of both Biden and Trump (double haters +23). She does worse than Biden among voters ages 65 and over (-3 points) and suburban women (-2).

""Harris does slightly better with some key Democratic constituencies and heightened enthusiasm on the left is real,"" says Daron Shaw, a Republican who conducts Fox News surveys with Democrat Chris Anderson. ""However, Democrats were completely depressed over Biden, and he was hemorrhaging support among young people and nonwhites, so it’s a pretty low bar."" 
Overall, 7 in 10 say they are extremely motivated to vote this year, and they back Trump over Harris by 1 point. 
DOOCY GRILLS WHITE HOUSE ON CLAIMS THAT HARRIS WAS NEVER ‘BORDER CZAR’
About 5 in 10 Michigan voters say they are falling behind financially, while almost 4 in 10 are holding steady, and 1 in 10 are getting ahead. Those numbers are mostly unchanged since April.  
The economy dominates for Michigan voters, as more than twice as many (35%) say it will be the most important issue to their vote as say the same about immigration (17%) and abortion (16%). All other issues rank in the single digits.  
Trump is favored among those voting on immigration (+79) and the economy (+31), while those prioritizing abortion prefer Harris (+68).  
In a potential expanded ballot, Harris trails Trump by 2 points (43-45%), with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. getting 7%, and Jill Stein and Cornel West at 1% each.  In April, Trump also topped Biden by 2 points, with Kennedy at 9%. 
Kennedy gets a touch more backing from those who support Trump (8%) than Harris (6%). 
Biden won Michigan in 2020 by 2.78 percentage points and received 50.62 percent of the vote. The new survey finds 43% of voters approve of the job he is doing, while 56% disapprove -- including 14% of those who voted for him in 2020.  
Most, 79%, approve of Biden’s decision to abandon his re-election bid and nearly two-thirds want him to finish his term. Those numbers are even higher among Democrats, as nearly 9 in 10 both approve of him leaving the race and want him to stay in office.
Seven in 10 Michigan Democrats want Harris as the Democratic Party’s nominee, while 2 in 10 favor their governor, Gretchen Whitmer, for the role. 
However, Whitmer outperforms Harris in a potential 2-way matchup against Trump, besting him by a 6-point margin (52-46%). She receives more support than Harris among White voters (by 3 points), women (+3), non-college Whites (+4), and Independents (+6). 
Whitmer is also the only one in the survey with a positive personal rating. A 56% majority of Michigan voters has a favorable opinion of her, while 42% view her negatively for a net +14 points. All others are underwater, including Harris (-4 points), Trump (-5), and GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance (-10). One in five Michigan voters are unable to rate Vance.

Since April, Biden’s favorable rating has slipped, going from negative by 16 points to negative by 20 today. Trump’s rating, on the other hand, has improved by 3 points over the same period. 
Four years ago this month, Biden’s favorability was +11 and Trump’s was -10 (July 2020).  
""While the race might not look much different based on the horserace, Democrats are clearly in a better position with Harris at the top of the ticket,"" says Anderson. ""Biden had become deeply unpopular in Michigan, but now Democrats can hit the reset button with a candidate with the exact same favorability as Trump and who is capable of campaigning vigorously.""

CNN_1,Harris steps out on Israel as she navigates Biden and Netanyahu,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/kamala-harris-israel-policy/index.html,2024-07-26 08:17:00,politics,"
            Four days into the most consequential week of Kamala Harris’ political life, she confronted the most fraught foreign policy issue facing the country by looking directly into the eyes of an Israeli prime minister who decided not to even give her a passing name check in his address to Congress Wednesday afternoon.
    

            Up until now, Harris has been defined by working for President Joe Biden, arguably the most explicitly pro-Israel American president, even though his relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu has frayed.
    

            But now that she’s the presumptive Democratic nominee, Harris has to define what kind of president she wants to be — on this and every other issue, while Biden remains at the White House trying to nail down a Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal and with some around him thinking that restarting the normalization of relations with Saudi Arabia could be a top legacy project for the remainder of his term.

Harris says she told Netanyahu to get ceasefire deal done while pledging ‘unwavering’ support for Israel


            Harris didn’t preside over Netanyahu’s speech to Congress on Wednesday, instead choosing to stick with a pre-scheduled trip to a sorority event in Indiana, as antisemitic protests erupted near the US Capitol where fences were put up like in the days following the January 6, 2021, riot.
    

            But after her meeting with the prime minister Thursday afternoon, she laid out what she wanted to be a very clear position, speaking to reporters in a way she has not done after previous meetings with foreign leaders.
    

            Harris started by recalling a history of connection to Israel that dates back to her childhood collecting money to plant trees there, and she ran through her work in the administration. She has, she said, “unwavering commitment” to Israel, its right to exist and its security.
    

            She called Hamas a “brutal terrorist organization.” She read the names of the American hostages still being held, and those who have died in captivity.
    

            “Israel has a right to defend itself,” she said, “and how it does so matters.”
    

            And the toll on the Palestinians matters, she said, as she called for everyone involved to push for a hostage release and ceasefire deal, and eventually, a two-state solution.
    

            “What has happened in Gaza over the last nine months is devastating,” she said. “We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies, we cannot allow ourselves to be numb. And I will not be silent.”
    

            Harris is trying to clear up uncertainty about her position toward Israel, which has left even people who have talked in depth with her about it responding with pauses when CNN has asked whether, for example, she would have done the same as Biden in sending some, and halting other, weapons to Israel.
    

            And her remarks follow a statement on Thursday condemning the protests around Netanyahu’s speech in Washington as unequivocal: “I condemn any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organization Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate the State of Israel and kill Jews.”
    

            Change is coming, predicted Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee who has been critical of Israel in this period and observed Harris’ foreign policy thinking when they served on the Senate Intelligence Committee together.
    

            “President Biden brought to the White House a lifelong relationship with Bibi Netanyahu and a very mature history on the US-Israel relationship,” Murphy said. “This certainly seems to be a moment for a reconsideration of the relationship and for some fresh thinking on how to approach an Israeli political landscape that is lurching further to the right than we could have ever imagined.”
    

            Murphy added, “I think we would all benefit from getting a fresh set of eyes on this conflict and the way that the United States could try to create a viable Palestinian state.”
    

            But Harris has so many different pulls on her that an aide did not give a direct answer when asked if the vice president considers herself a Zionist — a term Biden again proudly embraced just weeks ago.
    

            That’s a reflection of how much Zionism, which for a century meant believing in the right of a Jewish homeland to exist, has been co-opted by anti-Israel forces, who argue it has come to symbolize colonialism and the killing of Palestinians.
    

            It’s also a reflection of the difference in thinking and rhetoric between the Democratic Party’s new standard bearer and a president who has made allegiance with Israel one of his defining positions for 50 years in national politics.
    

            “The vice president has been a strong and longstanding supporter of Israel as a secure, democratic homeland for the Jewish people. She will always ensure Israel can defend itself from threats, including from Iran and Iran-backed militias such as Hamas and Hezbollah,” said Harris’ deputy national security adviser Dean Lieberman when asked if she considers herself a Zionist. “One can criticize specific policies of the government of Israel while still strongly supporting the state of Israel and the people of Israel. And that support for Israel in no way conflicts with the vice president’s strong view that the Palestinian people deserve freedom, dignity, and self-determination.”
    

            Many close observers see a sign of where Harris’ inclinations are in her choice of Phil Gordon to be her national security adviser. A former Obama administration official, Gordon in 2016 co-authored a report for the Council on Foreign Relations, which, seven years before the October 7 attacks, begins: “The U.S. relationship with Israel is in trouble.” The root of the problem, the authors wrote, is that while America and Israel used to agree on the threats to Israeli security and what to do about them, now those threats have become broader and more complicated, and the opinions about how to tackle them have too.
    

            Gordon has traveled to the region since October 7, holding meetings separate from the ones that Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan and others have been having.
    

            One official who has been deeply involved with Biden administration policy on Israel said that Harris’ differences will actually be key to keeping the overall relationship from getting worse.
    

            “She’ll be able to communicate with another generation. She has the ability, because of who she is, to be enormously helpful to us who care deeply about Israel and how we’re going to get through this disaster,” said the official. “She is the future of the relationship between us and Israel.”
    

            Aides and allies who have talked with Harris – from her Senate days up through her being on the line for nearly every conversation Biden has had with Netanyahu – insist that substantively there is little daylight between her and the president.
    

            The difference is rhetorical, but that difference, they say, is very important. She has been concerned since right after October 7 both about expressing empathy for the Palestinians and about thinking of what the political reverberations could be back home from the way Biden hugged Netanyahu close, figuratively and then literally on his trip to Israel two weeks after the attacks.
    

            It’s the explanation, aides involved tell CNN, for the fury that erupted from the West Wing in March about the way Harris punctuated prepared text that both decried the “humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza and thoroughly condemned Hamas. She built up to her reading of “there must be an immediate ceasefire,” taking a long pause, then adding the rest of the approved sentence: “for at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table.”
    

            Many Democrats outside the White House are making optimistic guesses that she aligns with them.
    

            “Like most Americans, the vice president falls within the pro-Israel mainstream—somewhere between the ‘Greater Israel’ far right and the ‘Free Palestine’ far left,” said Rep. Ritchie Torres, a New York Democrat who has positioned himself as one of the most stalwart defenders of Israel. He added that he expects that position to translate into being for a two-state solution, keeping up security aid and Iron Dome funding for Israel and supporting the Trump administration-negotiated Abraham Accords.
    

            For all the Biden speeches that had to be paused as protesters were removed from the rooms, Harris’ first week effectively on the top of the ticket hasn’t seen such an interruption so far. That doesn’t mean the politics of this are settled.
    

            Abbas Alawieh – a delegate who won a spot at the Democratic convention because he represents some of the 730,000 people who voted “uncommitted” in Michigan’s Democratic primary – told CNN on Wednesday that he remains “very curious how she will differentiate a Gaza policy.”
    

            Alawieh said he’s hopeful. At the very least, he thinks that the party under Harris’ leadership will no longer make him and others aligned with him feel “neglected, ignored—and in some cases maligned,” as happened on a Tuesday night call of state delegates when another person told him to shut up when he tried to speak.
    

            The Michigan Democratic Party chair condemned that behavior in an email to delegates.
    

            Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition released an online ad on Wednesday repeatedly referring to Harris by a mispronounced version of her first name and falsely claimed that she “sided with the pro-Hamas demonstrators” and snubbed Israel by not attending Netanyahu’s speech to Congress.
    

            Trump also accused her of this, saying at a rally in North Carolina that “she’s running away from Israel” and “totally against the Jewish people” for not going. Neither the ad nor the candidate mentioned that Ohio Sen. JD Vance also skipped the speech, though he had no other public schedule, with campaign spokesman Jason Miller telling CNN he “has duties to fulfill as the Republican nominee for vice president.”
    

            Harris’ connection to these issues is more than policy. It touches second gentleman Doug Emhoff’s daughter, who has been noticeably active on pro-Palestinian causes since October 7. It has come up at Seder dinners at the Naval Observatory. And more than anything, it is rooted in the second gentleman.
    

            Emhoff has talked at length about feeling a sense of duty, not just when he became the first Jewish spouse of a vice president or president, and channeling that into helping develop the administration’s strategy to combat antisemitism. He’s also talked about how much pain he felt personally after October 7.
    

            Halie Soifer, the CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, recalled a trip to Jerusalem she took with Harris and Emhoff in 2017, when she was working in the California Democrat’s new Senate office. She still has photos of Harris taking out a traditional kippah head covering for Emhoff when they visited the Western Wall.
    

            Soifer said she is satisfied that Harris remains committed to Israel — even after being read the indirect answer about whether the vice president considers herself a Zionist.
    

            And Emhoff has stressed that even as this campaign picks up, he is going to keep talking about Judaism and Israel, as he has throughout this administration with his wife’s encouragement.
    

            On a quickly organized Zoom call Wednesday afternoon hosted by the Jewish Democratic Council of America and Jewish Women for Kamala, where he made made a surprise appearance, Emhoff started by reiterating Harris’ unwavering support for Israel.
    

            But he also told the story of not being with his wife on Sunday when the news broke about Biden exiting the race, dropping a little Yiddish by blaming “this flight mishigas” that had him stuck in Los Angeles.
    

            Then he made a promise to the 1,700 people listening: “I’m going to keep living openly like a Jew and maybe there will be a mezuzah on the White House, like there is on the vice president’s residence.”

            Vice President Kamala Harris vowed to “not be silent” about suffering in Gaza amid the Israel-Hamas war, saying she expressed her “serious concern” to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday while telling him it is time to lock down a ceasefire deal.

            “Israel has a right to defend itself and how it does so matters. What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating,” Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, told reporters in remarks after her meeting with Netanyahu in Washington.
    

            “The images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time. We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and I will not be silent,” she continued.
    

            Harris’ comments provided the clearest explanation yet of her views on the conflict as she works to balance the issue that has not only divided the country but caused friction within the Democratic Party. Harris echoed Biden’s repeated comments about America’s “ironclad support” and “unwavering commitment” to Israel, but she conveyed a forcefulness on ending the war.
    

            Recalling the details of the proposed US-backed ceasefire and hostage deal, Harris said that “it is time for this war to end and end in a way where Israel is secure, all the hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can exercise their right to freedom, dignity and self-determination.”

            The vice president said there has been “hopeful movement” in the talks and that she pushed the prime minister to bring the conflict to a close.
    

            “As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done,” she said. “So to everyone who has been calling for a ceasefire, and to everyone who yearns for peace, I see you and I hear you.”
    

            The Biden administration, Harris said, is working to bring home the American hostages in Gaza. The vice president, who has met with the families, listed the names of those being held by Hamas.
    

            In a notable moment near the conclusion of her remarks, Harris told reporters that  “it is important for the American people to remember, the war in Gaza is not a binary issue.”
    

            “Let us all condemn terrorism and violence. Let us all do what we can to prevent the suffering of innocent civilians. And let us condemn antisemitism, islamophobia and hate of any kind. And let us work to unite our country,” she said.

            Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, co-founder and alleged current leader of the Mexican Sinaloa drug cartel, is in US custody, according to a diplomatic source with direct knowledge of the case.
    

            Joaquin Guzman Lopez, son of cartel co-founder Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman and another alleged leader of the cartel, is also in federal custody, said Attorney General Merrick Garland.
    

            Both men are facing several charges for leading the cartel’s criminal operations, including it’s “deadly fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking networks,” Garland said.
    

            The Sinaloa Cartel, named after the Mexican state where the gang was formed, is one of the most powerful drug-trafficking groups in the world, known for trafficking fentanyl, methamphetamine and heroin into the United States.
    

            The latest indictment against Zambada, one of the most notorious drug traffickers in Mexico’s history, was in February. It charged him with conspiring to manufacture and distribute a substance containing fentanyl, according to the US Justice Department.
    

            From 1989 to 2024, Zambada imported and distributed “massive amounts of narcotics,” generating billions of dollars in profits, according to the February indictment.
    

            Federal prosecutors said he employed people to obtain “transportation routes and warehouses” to import and store narcotics, along with hit men, or sicarios, to carry out kidnappings and murders in Mexico “to retaliate against rivals who threatened the cartel.

            President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met at the White House Thursday afternoon, where sources told CNN the president was expected to be as forceful as he has ever been in urging Netanyahu to accept a ceasefire agreement, as US officials believe that a deal may be on the cusp.
    

            “We’re closer than we’ve ever been,” one senior administration official said. “It’s up to the Israelis to accept it.”
    

            Biden’s in-person meeting with Netanyahu followed the Israeli prime minister’s speech to Congress on Wednesday, which sparked protests including instances of antisemitism or pro-Hamas rhetoric in Washington, DC. The White House has condemned such demonstrations.
    

            In brief remarks before the meeting, Netanyahu mentioned how the two men have known each other for four decades. He added: “From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish-American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the State of Israel.”
    

            Biden reminisced about meeting with previous Israeli leaders before making a joke about his age: “That’s how far back it goes. I was only 12 then.” Neither leader responded to shouted questions from reporters.
    

            The meeting, which was Biden’s first with a world leader since announcing he would drop out of the 2024 race, came at a fragile point in their decadeslong relationship. A resolution to end the Israel-Hamas war that began in October now looms large over Biden’s legacy as a one-term president. Progress in the negotiations for a ceasefire have come in fits and starts in recent months, and Biden and his senior national security officials have been closely involved in trying to land the deal.
    

            During the meeting, the president stressed the need to finalize the deal as soon as possible, according to a readout from the White House.
    

            “Biden expressed the need to close the remaining gaps, finalize the deal as soon as possible, bring the hostages home, and reach a durable end to the war in Gaza,” the readout said. “The President also raised the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, the need to remove any obstacles to the flow of aid and restoring basic services for those in need, and the critical importance of protecting civilian lives during military operations.”
    

            Biden also participated in a meeting with Netanyahu that included families of American hostages in Gaza - a separate setting where he could apply firm pressure on Netanyahu to finalize the ceasefire agreement.
    

            “In this setting he will really be held accountable to his commitment of pursuing a ceasefire and hostage deal,” said one US official.
    

            Families of the American hostages have expressed frustration in recent months about the relative lack of outreach from Netanyahu and his office – particularly in comparison to the regular cadence of communication that has come from senior Biden administration officials since the war began.
    

            One family member who attended the Thursday afternoon meeting with Biden and Netanyahu told CNN before the meeting that they hoped the president would use the setting to exert serious pressure on his Israeli counterpart – particularly now that Biden is free from the political burdens of a reelection campaign.
    

            After their meeting with the president and Netanyahu, some family members struck an optimistic tone on the prospects of a deal being reached soon.
    

            “We feel more optimistic than we have since the first round of releases in late November, early December,” said Jonathan Dekel-Chen. “We got absolute commitment from President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu that they understand the urgency of this moment now. And to waste no time. And to complete this deal as it currently stands with as little change as humanly possible.”
    

            When the Biden administration proposed a joint meeting with the families, some US officials did not expect Netanyahu to accept the proposal, two US officials said.
    

            Other US officials believed that Netanyahu would have no choice but to accept the offer, and viewed it as an opportunity to put the Israeli leader in the hot seat in front of both Biden and hostage families amid ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage deal, officials said.
    

            Multiple sources stressed that no major announcement about an agreement is expected on Thursday. However, as CNN reported this week, US and Israeli officials have voiced increased optimism about the prospects of an agreement.
    

            While Biden has remained firmly behind Israel, even as its campaign in Gaza has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, both leaders have traded not-so-subtle barbs in recent months over the future of the war and how Netanyahu has waged it.
    

            Biden has described Israel’s actions in Gaza as “over the top,” threatened to withhold some new arms transfers and repeatedly pressured Netanyahu to scale back and be more precise in his military operation in Gaza – criticism that reached a peak when an Israeli strike killed seven World Central Kitchen workers in early April. The Israeli leader has been steadfast in his position that the war will not end until Hamas is eliminated while accusing the US of withholding weapons from its closest ally – claims that American officials flatly rejected.
    

            Speaking in front of Congress this week, Netanyahu did not substantially address the status of ceasefire negotiations. He instead praised Biden for his “heartfelt support” for Israel after the October 7 Hamas attack while urging the US to fast-track military aid to “dramatically expedite an end to the war.”
    

            “As we defend ourselves on all fronts, I know that America has our back and I thank you for it – all sides of the aisle,” Netanyahu said.
    

            US officials remain sensitive to Israeli politics that may be shaping Netanyahu’s calculations – including, as CNN has reported, the timing of Israel’s parliament going into recess at the end of the month, which would make it harder for right-wing opponents of the deal to move to collapse the government.
    

            The US does not believe, for now, that Netanyahu is standing in the way of or delaying a ceasefire and hostage deal, and believes that progress is being made amid ongoing negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Both the Israelis and Hamas, the official said, have elements they need to agree on before a deal is reached, and not one side is holding up negotiations at this point.
    

            The in-person meeting at the White House was the first time the two men have met in person since Biden’s trip to Israel last year following the October 7 attack, although the two men have spoken frequently on the phone. It was followed by the meeting with American hostage families, and then Netanyahu met with Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Biden has endorsed to replace him on the top of the Democratic ticket.
    

            In remarks to reporters following their meeting, Harris said that she told Netanyahu it is time to get a ceasefire deal “done,” adding that she “will not be silent” about the suffering in Gaza.
    

            Harris touted her “unwavering” support for Israel while warning Netanyahu’s government that it matters how the war is conducted.
    

            The prime minister in his remarks to Congress criticized anti-Israel protesters as “Iran’s useful idiots” and falsely downplayed the role of Israel in causing the ongoing civilian suffering in Gaza.
    

            Biden’s support for Israel’s war had been one his most politically toxic issues within his own party for much of the year, with many of his public campaign appearances being repeatedly interrupted by protesters demanding a ceasefire in Gaza. Biden’s stance toward those protests has been conciliatory – he has repeatedly responded to them by saying that the protesters have a point, and that too many innocent people are dying in Gaza.
    

            But the national conversation surrounding Biden’s handling of Israel’s war took a back seat to the waves of Democratic concern about his ability to beat former President Donald Trump after his faltering debate performance last month. Trump and Netanyahu will meet Friday at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump announced Tuesday.
    

            Last week, Biden spoke extensively about the war in the Middle East for the first time in months – telling a Complex Networks interviewer that he considers himself a Zionist but adding that he’s “done more for the Palestinian community than anybody” while still calling for more aid to reach the Gaza Strip.
    

            “I’m the guy that opened up all the assets. I’m the guy that made sure that – I got the Egyptians to open the border to let goods through, medicine and food,” Biden said. “I have been very supportive of the Palestinians, but Hamas, they’re a bunch of thugs.”
    

            Biden and Netanyahu last spoke during a 30-minute call on July 4, during which both leaders “focused” on details about a possible hostage exchange and ceasefire deal.
    

            A deal was never finalized or assured during that call.

CNN_8,Man accused of starting California’s Park Fire is arrested as Oregon battles massive blaze,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/us/durkee-fire-oregon/index.html,2024-07-26 09:41:00,us,"
The largest active wildfire in the United States has scorched almost 270,000 acres in eastern Oregon, as nearly 80 large active wildfires are burning in the US, including a California blaze that exploded in size overnight. Here’s the latest:


            • California battles northern blaze: The Park Fire in California has exploded to nearly 125,00 acres and is 3% contained, according to CalFire. A suspect has been arrested after being identified pushing a car engulfed in fire 60 feet into a gully, “spreading flames that caused the Park Fire,” the Butte County District Attorney’s Office announced Thursday afternoon. The blaze has forced mandatory evacuations in Butte County, where the state’s deadliest wildfire, the Camp Fire, killed more than 80 people in 2018.
    

• Oregon fire is 20% contained: The Durkee Fire, which has burned an area larger than the city of Indianapolis, started on July 17 near the Oregon-Idaho state line. Amid high temperatures, extremely dry vegetation and strong winds, the fire has grown tens of thousands of acres since Sunday and is 20% contained as of Thursday afternoon, according to InciWeb.


• Durkee Fire threatens nearby communities: Three people were injured and two homes and 12 other structures were destroyed as the fire spread, according to the Oregon Department of Emergency Management. Officials have asked some residents to evacuate. Some communities do not have power, according to Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, who has deployed resources from the National Guard to assist.
    

• Two fires threaten national park in Canada: The flames closing in on the nation’s largest national park from two directions sent visitors and residents fleeing the town of Jasper in Alberta, where buildings are burned. Officials say the losses are significant, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has deployed federal support to help battle the blaze.
    

            A 42-year-old man, identified as Ronnie Dean Stout II, has been arrested after witnesses reported seeing someone “pushing a car that was on fire into a gully near the Alligator Hole in upper Bidwell Park shortly before 3:00 p.m. yesterday,” according to Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey. “The car went down an embankment approximately 60 feet and burned completely, spreading flames that caused the Park Fire.”
    

            The DA says the man was seen “calmly leaving the area by blending in with the other citizens who were in the area and fleeing the rapidly evolving fire.”
    

            Stout was arrested at a mobile home park in Chico, California, around 2 a.m., Ramsey said. 


            He has two previous strikes in California, including a 2001 conviction in Butte County for lewd acts on a child under 14, and another in 2002 in Kern County for robbery with great bodily injury, when he was sentenced to 20 years in prison, Ramsey added. In California, people with two prior strikes – convictions of violent or serious felonies – receive significantly longer prison sentences if convicted of a third felony.
    

            Prison records were not immediately available but CNN reached out to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation for more information.

            The suspect is being held without bail pending his arraignment, which is set for Monday, according to the DA’s office.
    

            Stout will likely face an arson charge, though it is unclear what count, or whether any enhancements will be added, Ramsey said.  The DA’s office told CNN Stout has not retained an attorney and will be assigned a public defender at his arraignment.
    

            Triple-digit temperatures and high wind gusts have fueled the fire’s growth.
    

            Some residents in Butte County were asked to evacuate, as the fire grew to nearly 40,000 acres overnight to an area roughly the size of Washington, DC. By Thursday morning, the fire had burned an average of nearly 50 football fields per minute since it started Wednesday afternoon. Triple-digit temperatures and high wind gusts have fueled its growth.
    

            There are more than 200 firefighters deployed to fight the blaze, according to CalFire.
    

            The lightning-sparked Durkee Fire is the largest of 31 large wildfires currently burning across Oregon, which has been the hardest hit by fires in recent days.
    

            Officials in eastern Oregon’s Malheur County and Baker County had issued evacuations for areas around the Durkee Fire since its beginning.
    

            However, as of Thursday afternoon, all evacuation recommendations for the Durkee Fire in Malheur County have been lifted, said the Malheur County Sheriff’s Office in a social media post. As for Baker County, many areas’ evacuation levels have been reduced or eliminated, according to the county’s Sheriff’s Office.
    

            Dense smoke from the flames have impeded traffic on Interstate 84, leading to periodic closure of the freeway.
    

            Kotek called it a “dynamic situation.”
    

            “The wildfires in Eastern Oregon have scaled up quickly,” Kotek said in a news release. “We are facing strong erratic winds over the region that could impact all fires. Rain is not getting through. Some communities do not have power.”

            More than 500 firefighters and resources from 22 states are working to fight the fire, according to InciWeb.
    

            “We have been at this for a number of days, and those days just seem to keep getting harder and harder with the weather that we’re seeing in our area and the intense fire behavior,” Sarah Sherman of the Bureau of Land Management said in a video update.
    

            Over the weekend and earlier this week, the Durkee Fire exhibited extreme fire behavior, even creating it’s own weather in the form of pyrocumulus clouds.
    

            The clouds form over heat sources due to the intense, upward vertical motion of air cooling and condensing as it moves higher into the sky. They can reach heights of 50,000 feet and generate their own systems of thunderstorms.
    

            If fires burn hot enough, they can create clouds that produce lighting and rain, called pyrocumulonimbus.
    

            “Over the last week, firefighters have been challenged by hot temperatures and gusty winds that continue to push several wildfires across the state,” the Oregon State Fire Marshal said.
    

            Wildfire smoke, including from the Durkee Fire in Oregon, was spreading into Boise and beyond. Air quality alerts have been issued for parts of Colorado, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.
    

            Patrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, told the Associated Press that driving into town Wednesday morning was “like driving into a fog bank, because it’s so thick and low to the road.”
    

            “Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,” Nauman said of the smoke.
    

            A cold front has moved through the area Thursday morning, bringing high temperatures to the 80s on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. A red flag warning, which indicates increased risk of fire danger, has expired.

            A US diplomatic source with direct knowledge of the case had earlier confirmed Zambada was in US custody.
    

            The Sinaloa Cartel, named after the Mexican state where the gang was formed, is one of the most powerful drug-trafficking groups in the world, known for trafficking fentanyl, methamphetamine and heroin into the United States.
    

            The latest indictment against Zambada, one of the most notorious drug traffickers in Mexico’s history, was in February. It charged him with conspiring to manufacture and distribute a substance containing fentanyl, according to the US Justice Department.
    

            Guzman’s name was removed from the superseding indictment filed this year due to his trial conviction in 2018, federal prosecutors said.
    

            From 1989 to 2024, Zambada imported and distributed “massive amounts of narcotics,” generating billions of dollars in profits, according to the February indictment.
    

            Federal prosecutors said he employed people to obtain “transportation routes and warehouses” to import and store narcotics, along with hit men, or sicarios, to carry out kidnappings and murders in Mexico “to retaliate against rivals who threatened the cartel.
    

            Guzman Lopez’s father was convicted by a federal jury in Brooklyn in 2018 and sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years, the Justice Department said. However, Zambada had continued to evade capture while he ran the cartel.
    

            The elder Guzman bribed prison guards to smuggle him out and escape prison in 2001. He had been arrested in 1993 on homicide and drug charges.

CNN_10,Kamala Harris wants to be America’s first Silicon Valley president. She has tech’s support,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/tech/kamala-harris-tech-industry-support/index.html,2024-07-26 09:35:00,us,"
            With Vice President Kamala Harris the front runner to receive the Democratic Party’s nomination for president, America’s most powerful industry is set to have a candidate on the ballot from its home turf.
    

            Top technology leaders are already showing their excitement for the Bay Area native, in the form of endorsements and donations for Harris, which have come from prominent names, such as longtime Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, Netflix Co-Founder Reed Hastings and philanthropist Melinda French Gates.
    

            The Harris supporters represent a foil to the loud and powerful — although not necessarily large — contingent of (mostly) men in tech who have endorsed Former President Donald Trump’s White House bid, including Elon Musk. The pro-Harris movement within tech suggests that the vice president’s policies, as well as her long and friendly relationship with many top executives in the tech world, may ultimately make her Silicon Valley’s top choice for the White House.
    

            “There’s been a real shift in the Valley toward supporting Harris in a way that was not happening with Biden,” Aaron Levie, CEO of the cloud computing firm Box, told CNN. “I am pretty optimistic. I believe she has some appreciation for the different dynamics that we deal with in the tech industry, and how important of a role tech is going to play in the in the future of the economy and the country.”
    

            Harris was born and began her political career in Oakland, California, a short ferry ride from the heart of the tech industry. She attended the wedding of early Facebook executive Sean Parker, and she’s appeared at events alongside Steve Jobs’ widow and philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs. Harris’ failed 2020 presidential bid received support from various tech luminaries, including Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and legendary venture capitalist Ron Conway.
    

            Despite her friendly relationships with the industry’s leaders, Harris has also pushed for tech accountability in key areas. As California’s attorney general, she went after tech companies for their role in online sexual harassment and revenge porn. As a California senator in 2018, Harris grilled Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg over user privacy in a hearing following the Cambridge Analytica scandal.
    

            As vice president, Harris has taken a key role in the White House around establishing safety measures for artificial intelligence, which is widely viewed as the most consequential new technology in decades. Last year, Harris met with the chief executives of OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and Anthropic on Capitol Hill to discuss AI safety measures and how to increase transparency among top tech firms and the government.
    

            “When she wanted to solve problems, she would bring social activists, public policy experts and business leaders together in common forums. …She just felt we should have all the players around the table and understand the issues and (tech leaders) love that that kind of a dialogue,” Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, told CNN.
    

            Harris can also stake a claim to some of the pro-tech actions taken by the Biden administration, including the Chips Act, which set aside funding to invest in US-production of critical computing components.
    

            Her record on tech stands in contrast to some of the policy positions that Trump has laid out for his possible second term, which tech leaders might find “toxic,” Sonnenfeld said. Trump’s anti-immigration stance and tariff plans, for example, could have serious ripple effects across Silicon Valley and send inflation higher again, numerous economists have warned.
    

            “Most folks that I’ve talked to didn’t really enjoy the chaos of the (prior) Trump administration,” Levie said.
    

            He added that the industry needs “level headed leadership that allows you to have a clear sense of trade policy and how you’re going to be interacting globally from a supply chain standpoint, versus on the Trump side, every day, you woke up to some new dynamic.”
    

            What’s more, many in tech likely appreciate Harris’ efforts to defend progressive causes, such as action on climate change and protecting reproductive rights, with which the industry has long been aligned.
    

            “Kamala Harris is the right person at the right time.  …Harris’s background and leadership growing the economy, fighting for bodily autonomy, and protecting our democracy uniquely position her to push back against Trump’s extremism,” LinkedIn founder and tech investor Reid Hoffman said in a post on X.
    

            In an interview with CNN, Hoffman added: “In Silicon Valley, actually there’s many threads that are very excited about her. …She understands how technology can create a great difference for the American people.”

CNN_11,Remember when Taylor Swift did drag in a Versace shirt?,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/style/taylor-swift-the-man-music-video/index.html,2024-07-26 09:23:00,world,"
    Editor’s Note: Delving into the archives of pop culture history, “Remember When?” is a CNN Style series offering a nostalgic look at the celebrity outfits that defined their eras.


            A man dances on the top-deck of his private yacht, swigging champagne from the bottle, surrounded by bikini-clad women. He’s heavily fake-tanned, his dark hair is coiffed. But this isn’t a man — it’s Taylor Swift.
    

            Back in February 2020, Swift had not yet announced her Eras Tour (now the highest-grossing tour of all time); released any of the four new records that have come since, or begun re-recording her earliest work. She was, instead, still busily promoting her seventh album, “Lover,” and premiering the self-directed music video for its fourth single, “The Man.”
    

            Throughout the video, and under several pounds of prosthetic makeup, Taylor — appearing in drag as “Tyler” — swans around a boardroom, smokes on the subway, and parties on the private yacht as lyrics lament the double standard between men and women. Tyler is praised for things that real-life Taylor would be shamed for: where she is rude, he is bold; things that make her greedy make him a go-getter. It’s on-the-nose, but it gets her point across.
    

            As well as sporting a wig and faux facial hair, Tyler’s wardrobe as “The Man” features snugly-fitted suits, tennis whites and a brown suede dad jacket. But it’s his gaudy outfit from the yacht that’s been selected for display in a new exhibition at London’s Victoria & Albert Museum (V&A), picked as being definitive of the entire “Lover” period.
    

            “Taylor Swift: Songbook Trail” traces the star’s meteoric journey from childhood to the present day, spreading 13 exhibits of costumes, props and instruments from Swift’s personal archive across the museum’s various galleries.

            The centerpiece of Swift’s look from “The Man” is a black, red and gold silk Versace shirt, worn with matching shoes and a pair of white linen Tommy Bahama trousers. Huge black aviator-style sunglasses obscure half of Swift’s face, while hefty gold rings and a gold chain complete the garish look.
    

            “(The costume) is instantly recognizable, and it’s particularly flamboyant,” Kate Bailey, senior curator at London’s Victoria and Albert Museum, told CNN. “It does so much storytelling within that Versace ‘bling’ aesthetic. It speaks volumes — and I never thought in a million years we’d be displaying a beard and facial hair!”
    

            But Swift was not the first pop star to don drag for the camera. The members of Queen famously appeared as women in the 1984 video for “I Want to Break Free.” In 2009, Mariah Carey dressed as a male stalker in her “Obsessed” video, while Lady Gaga cast her own campy drag character, Jo Calderone, to star in the video for “You and I” in 2011. Zayn Malik and Troye Sivan have also revealed drag personas on screen (“Best Song Ever” and “One Of Your Girls,” respectively), and Little Mix performed as drag kings in their video for “Confetti” in 2021. As her own alter-ego, Swift is visibly — even through all the makeup — having the time of her life playing the manspreading, leering parallel version of herself.
    

            This era was arguably Swift at her most overtly political. In June 2019 she released her star-studded video for “You Need To Calm Down,” a song celebrating Pride, as well as launching a petition in support of the US Equality Act. “The Man” was a similarly impassioned swing at Swift’s own experiences of sexism during her career. The video came out less than a month after her documentary, “Miss Americana,” which explored similar themes.
    

            “You are kind of doing a constant strategy in your head as to how not to be shamed for something on any given day,” Swift mused during one scene, filmed while she was writing “The Man.” “But then you get accused of being calculated for having a strategy. You sort of do have to twist yourself into a pretzel on an hourly basis.”
    

            In the years since “The Man” premiered, Swift has released four new albums — plus four re-recordings — but none seem to have inspired the same fledgling political engagement as “Lover” (Before he withdrew from the race, the Biden campaign had hoped, to no avail, that Swift would echo the support she gave him in 2020). Instead, Swift has settled back into the familiar grooves of love, heartbreak, and fringed bodysuits. She does wear a blazer to perform “The Man” on tour — but it’s rhinestoned. At least, with Tyler’s yachting garb on show at the V&A until 8 September, fans can look back on one of the most memorable chapters in Swift’s fashion history.

CNN_12,Fast-moving wildfire in the Canadian Rockies’ largest national park hits the town of Jasper,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/weather/jasper-national-park-canada-wildfire/index.html,2024-07-26 09:37:00,world,"
            A fast-moving wildfire in the Canadian Rockies that had prompted 25,000 people to flee roared into the near-deserted town of Jasper overnight with flames higher than treetops, devastating up to half of its structures, officials said Thursday.
    

            There were no immediate reports of injuries, following a mass evacuation of the picturesque resort and a neighboring national park earlier in the week, but Jasper Mayor Richard Ireland said in a letter on the town’s website that the wildfire “ravaged our beloved community.”
    

            “The destruction and loss that many you are facing and feeling is beyond description and comprehension, my deepest sympathies go out to each of you,” he said.
    

            Danielle Smith, the premier of Alberta province, said from 30% to 50% of the town’s structures are potentially damaged or destroyed, saying, “That’s going to be a significant rebuild and significant displacement.”
    

            Smith teared up talking about the beauty of Jasper, noting that many families from the province regularly visit. A postcard-perfect mountain town, Jasper is famous for hiking, skiing, kayaking and biking. It is also home to dozens of species such as elk, mountain goats, cougars, lynx, black bears and grizzly bears.

            “We share the sense of loss with all who live in town,” Smith said at a news conference in Edmonton, Alberta, while pledging her government’s support for the community to rebuild.
    

            Jasper and the neighboring Jasper National Park had been menaced by fires from both the north and south, and the town’s 5,000 full-time residents — along with 20,000 visitors – fled on short notice late Monday and Tuesday when the fires flared up.
    

            One of the fires raced into the southern edge of the community Wednesday evening as firefighters tried to limit the damage.
    

            Alberta Public Safety Minister Mike Ellis said a wind gust moved the wildfire about 5 kilometers (about 3 miles) in probably less than 30 minutes toward the town with a wall of fire that he estimated was 100 meters high.
    

            “People need to picture what those wildfire folks were experiencing at that time. Any firefighter will tell you there is little to nothing you can do when a wall of fire like that is coming at you,” Ellis said. “Nobody anticipated the fire to come so fast, so large.”
    

            Pierre Martel, director of fire management at Parks Canada, said lightning, winds and drought made the fire grow rapidly on Monday and that flames were above the treetops when it entered the town Wednesday.
    

            “It’s just a monster at that point. There are no tools we have in our tool box to deal with that at that point. You get out of the way, you retreat,” he said.
    

            Parks Canada said in a post on X that there had been “no reported injuries,” adding that “approximately 25,000 people were safely evacuated from the town of Jasper and Jasper National Park. All residents, visitors and responders are safe.”
    

            Park officials said efforts to fight the fire were continuing and that it was too early to give details of the damage. They asked for patience, and said the fire remains out of control despite a small amount of rain that fell overnight.
    

            Annelies Lagger, who has owned and lived in the Austrian Haven B&B for 30 years, said she’s waiting to hear if it’s been destroyed but isn’t optimistic because all the houses nearby are gone. She said she fled with her 13 cats and dog.
    

            “I have no clue where I go now. Heaven or hell. It was my life. You can imagine how much work it was,” she said. “I’m think I’m in shock.”
    

            She said relatives including her daughter and son-in-law had their homes destroyed. “It was the heat that dried everything out. And now the town is gone,” she said.
    

            Lagger was sheltering with a kind stranger in Valemount, British Columbia, but said she eventually would need to find new homes for her family members and “for my critters.”
    

            “I’m a very tough woman. Whatever happens I start again even though I’m 82 years old,” she said.
    

            Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his administration has approved Alberta’s request for federal assistance, including military resources.
    

            Jasper National Park is considered a national treasure. The United Nations designated the parks that make up the Canadian Rockies, including Jasper, a World Heritage Site in 1984 for its striking mountain landscape.
    

            Alberta has been baking under scorching temperatures that have already forced another 7,500 people out of remote communities. About 176 wildfires were burning across the province, including 54 that are burning out of control.
    

            Alberta Forestry and Parks Minister Todd Loewen said many of the fires are caused by lightning, and Alberta Wildfire spokesperson Christie Tucker said firefighters expect winds will raise the danger.
    

            Tucker said hundreds of firefighters from Australia, Mexico, New Zealand and South Africa are arriving to help fight the wildfires throughout the province.
    

            A record number of wildfires in 2023 forced more than 235,000 people across Canada to evacuate and sent thick smoke into parts of the US, leading to hazy skies and health advisories in multiple US cities.

CNN_13,British tabloid battle was ‘central piece’ in rift within royal family — Prince Harry,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/media/british-tabloid-battle-royal-family-prince-harry/index.html,2024-07-26 10:46:00,us,"
            Prince Harry said in an interview on ITV that despite feeling “vindicated” after a “monumental victory” last year against a major British tabloid, he believes his battle against the press was a “central piece” of the rift that formed between him and members of the royal family.
    

            Speaking publicly about the court case for the first time as part of the ITV documentary “Tabloids on Trial,” which aired on Thursday, Prince Harry relayed details of the case after a High Court judge ruled in December 2023 that Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) unlawfully gathered personal information on him to be used in published stories.
    

In the interview, Prince Harry described the tactics used by the tabloids, including voice mail inception, unlawful information gathering and the use of private investigators to get credit card details and flight information for him and his love interests over the years.
    

            In December last year, Prince Harry was awarded £140,600 after the UK High Court ruled he was the subject of “extensive” phone hacking by Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) from 2006 to 2011. Justice Fancourt ruled that 15 stories published about Prince Harry by MGN used unlawful information gathering methods such as hacking of voicemail messages and the use of private investigators.
    

            Following the ruling last year, an MGN spokesperson said the publisher welcomed the judgment “that gives the business the necessary clarity to move forward from events that took place many years ago,” according to PA Media.
    

            “Where historical wrongdoing took place, we apologise unreservedly, have taken full responsibility and paid appropriate compensation,” the spokesperson added.
    

            Prince Harry described it as a “David vs Goliath situation,” in the ITV documentary.
    

            “The Davids are the claimants, and the Goliath is this vast media enterprise,” he told ITV News correspondent Rebecca Barry.
    

            Other celebrities, including Hugh Grant, were also interviewed for the documentary about their legal cases against British tabloids.
    

            When asked to what extent his battle against the tabloids destroyed his relationship with his family, Prince Harry said it was “certainly a central piece.”
    

            “But that’s a hard question to answer because anything I say about my family results in a torrent of abuse from the press,” he added.
    

            While Prince Harry said he feels vindicated by the Mirror phone hacking decision, he added that he wished his family would have joined him in pursuing the court case.
    

            “It would be nice if we did it as a family,” he added.

CNN_14,‘Just shocking’: Delta passengers tell of airport agony and honeymoon travel woes during tech meltdown,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/business/passengers-delta-meltdown-stories/index.html,2024-07-26 10:39:00,us,"
            J.R. Reed’s three kids were scattered in different states across the country this week. They all had tickets to get home — on Delta.
    

            But they couldn’t even get onto planes. Delta paused its unaccompanied minors program during the airline’s meltdown in the wake of the global tech outage that started late last week.
    

            “Delta flew my kids out and won’t fly them home,” said Reed, a resident of Atlanta. He told CNN he wasn’t notified of the minors program embargo.
    

            His eldest, 15, was stuck in the Charlotte airport for 12 hours. His middle child, 12, stayed stranded in New York’s LaGuardia Airport. His youngest, 10, was in Orlando after flying solo for the first time.
    

            Reed eventually resorted to buying a ticket to New York himself to pick up his middle child, while his sister bought a ticket to Atlanta to bring home his youngest. He then arranged for a car to pick up his eldest son and bring him back to Atlanta. Later, he told CNN in an update, Delta refunded his New York ticket, and his sister found an Orlando agent who allowed his youngest child to fly home on Wednesday when the embargo was lifted.
    

            “As soon as Delta made the decision to not honor any child tickets flying by themselves, their first priority should have been rebooking those passengers, and they didn’t care,” he added.
    

            A Delta representative said in an email to CNN that the airline embargoed unaccompanied minor travel beginning July 19 to keep them from being separated from their caregivers should their flights be canceled or delayed due to the outage.
    

            “We take seriously the trust caregivers place in us with their children’s travel, and sincerely apologize that that trust was compromised through confusion around the embargo,” the company said.
    

            Reed is a longtime Delta loyalist who achieved “Million Miler” status. He’s seen his share of technology-related disruptions with the airline, but he described its handling of the fallout from the CrowdStrike outage as “the worst ever.”
    

            Similar tales of frustration and fury are mounting as Delta Air Lines lags behind other airlines in recovering from the global tech meltdown that swept across the world last week, prompting Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to launch an investigation into Delta. With the number of delayed and canceled flights hitting the thousands, he told reporters he estimated more than 500,000 passengers were affected.
    

            For newlyweds Jeremy and Kaylee Jones, the disruption upended their plans to celebrate their honeymoon on the Caribbean Island of St. Lucia.
    

            The couple flew to Atlanta, Georgia, from Spokane, Washington, on a Delta flight and encountered no issues, they told CNN. But upon arrival Tuesday, they discovered their flight to St. Lucia was canceled due to a lack of crew.
    

            The couple, who were married Saturday, said the flight issues caused five guests to miss the wedding, as well.
    

            “I get that things happen,” Jones said. “This is just shocking to me that a multi-billion-dollar corporation would struggle this much to get the ball rolling again.”
    

            In a note to customers Sunday, Delta CEO Ed Bastian apologized for the disruptions and attributed the problem to the computer program affecting its “crew tracking” software. The company followed up Monday, saying the CrowdStrike error required its technology team to manually reboot and repair impacted systems — and that additional time was still needed for the applications to sync up.
    

            The Joneses are also among thousands of passengers missing their baggage.
    

            At Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, Delta’s headquarters and largest hub, thousands of pieces of luggage were lined up on the floors of baggage claim on Tuesday. The bags made it to the world’s busiest airport — but, due to delays and cancellations, their owners didn’t.
    

            Dylan Steele, a federal worker from South Georgia, was stuck at Hartsfield-Jackson Airport in Atlanta since Saturday when he was supposed to travel to Washington, DC, for a conference. He told CNN on Tuesday his job requires him to fly Delta Airlines and that he was unable to pick up a flight from a different airline, forcing him to abandon his travel plans entirely.
    

            So instead, Steele planned to head back home — without his luggage, he told CNN.
    

            “My belongings are on the tarmac or being loaded onto a plane somewhere,” he said.
    

            A Delta Air Lines representatives told Steele his baggage will go to D.C. without him and will be sent to his home in about a week.
    

            “Delta, typically on a normal day, is pretty good,” he said. “The CrowdStrike glitch has caused a significant speed bump, and they’re just finding it hard to get their footing back.”
    

            At Hartsfield-Jackson, Delta is trying to boost staffing by mobilizing its volunteer team alongside employees from different departments to iron out the chaos.
    

            But exasperated flyers, like Arthur Ginolfi, say Delta needs to do better to take care of their customers.
    

            “It is frustrating to travel, but this is the worst experience I’ve ever had in my 35 years of business travel,” said Ginolfi, whose Delta flight from Philadelphia to Atlanta was originally booked for Sunday afternoon.
    

            Ginolfi said he was forced to drive two hours back to his home in New Jersey, arriving around 2 am on Monday.

            “There are lines that were unacceptable, there were people that were frustrated. I saw and I heard a lot of sad stories,” he said. “There should be some kind of compensation for this.”
    

            He told CNN the issues have cost him a significant amount of money.
    

            “I had to pay for parking for 12 hours, I had to pay for food, I had to pay for tolls,” he said.
    

            Bastian also told Delta passengers in a note on Sunday that the airline would “continue to offer meal vouchers, hotel accommodations and transportation where available. And as a gesture of apology, we’re also providing impacted customers with Delta SkyMiles and travel vouchers.”
    

            Included in the compensation being offered to Delta customers is a waiver that allows travelers who booked a flight from July 19 to 23 to make a one-time change to their itinerary as well as the option to request a refund for significantly delayed flights.

CNN_15,The woman behind Venezuela’s upstart opposition movement,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/americas/maria-corina-machado-interview-intl-latam/index.html,2024-07-26 10:41:00,world,"
            As Venezuela girds for what could be a historic presidential election this weekend, one of the most important names in the race isn’t on the ballot: María Corina Machado – the woman who galvanized Venezuela’s opposition movement, and whom many voters see as the real challenger to socialist incumbent Nicolás Maduro.
    

            Twelve years ago, Machado introduced herself to Venezuela’s political scene by confronting late President Hugo Chávez in Congress. Chévez, then at the peak of his power, was delivering his annual state of the nation address. Machado, then a fringe opposition politician who lost her primary race to challenge Chávez for the presidency, stood up and shouted back at the president on the podium.
    

            Chávez dismissed her as an irritation, telling her, “An eagle doesn’t hunt a fly.”

            On Sunday, once again, Machado will not be on the ballot – but not for lack of popularity. An avowed capitalist who has promised privatization of several state industries, Machado won more than 90% of the opposition primary vote last year, but has been barred from running for office following allegations that she didn’t include some food vouchers on her assets declaration. Machado has described the decision to bar her – upheld by Venezuela’s Supreme Court – as illegitimate, unjustified and unconstitutional.
    

            The current opposition candidate for president, Edmundo González, is backed by Machado, who has campaigned on his behalf to mobilize voters.Experts say that their efforts may now pose the most significant threat to Maduro’s grip on power in years, as he fights to claim a third term.
    

            The following is an interview that Machado gave to CNN International in Caracas this week. It has been edited for clarity and length.
    

CNN: We spoke with many people who say that they’re planning, in case things don’t succeed this time, to leave. Have you considered that for yourself?


            Machado: We will win. We will succeed and we will bring everyone that has been forced to leave to come back. That’s my only plan.
    

CNN: In the economy, your plan is to privatize most Venezuelan public assets, especially in terms of health, oil and education. Do you think private education is a better response to the challenges that Venezuela youth faces?


            Machado: I am committed to giving every single Venezuelan the opportunity to have the education they need to be independent and take hold of their future.
    

            I do believe in public education, but I do believe that you have to create incentives so the public education can be as competitive and with the same degree of excellence that you have in private education.
    

            You must have the rules of the market. It’s the system, and that works as well with the health system. I am convinced that education is a right.
    

CNN: So the rules of the market applies to the education sector?


            Machado: As a society and as a state, you have the duty to guarantee that every single Venezuelan has access to it. But we have to change all the way around.
    

            What do I promote? For instance, in the case of education, I believe in coupons that you can give directly to the parents so that parents can choose the kind of education they want for their children, either public or private. And this is a true revolution in Venezuela.
    

            In the case of the energy sector or other, industries. Venezuela has a huge potential that requires enormous investments. That we don’t have the resources for. This country was sacked: we need to open markets.
    

            And we need to create conditions that are so competitive, so attractive that international resources will be invested in a country, despite what happened in the previous regime.
    

            One of the things we need to do is totally transform our judiciary system and come back from being the last place globally in rule of law to one of the most respected countries.
    

CNN: Back to the energy sector, what are the best possible conditions for private investors? Does that mean taking away the public ownership of crude oil that has been part of the Venezuelan constitution for decades?


            Machado: We need tens or hundreds of billions of dollars that could be invested in energy, not just oil and gas. Also, renewable resources.
    

            The Venezuelan government doesn’t have the resources to do that. The resources we need to invest in infrastructure, in health, in education and so on.
    

            We definitely need to open markets in order to take advantage of that huge potential and turn Venezuela into truly the energy hub of the Americas.
    

            How the how the country will benefit from that? We will have fiscal flows, and other resources, mechanisms through which the state will get taxes.
    

            But you don’t need to own the companies directly for the country to benefit from it.
    

            If we don’t do that, the window of opportunity for oil and gas will close soon. And that will be unforgivable.
    

CNN: What do you really think is going to happen on the night of July 28 [when the result of the presidential vote is expected to be announced]?


            Machado: The regime will try to steal the election. But I have trust, full confidence in what the Venezuelan people voted for. We have built a platform to defend our votes; it’s unprecedented.
    

            Today, Venezuelans realize that it is a personal responsibility. They don’t expect others to defend their vote. Right? They are going to do it themselves. And you will see people coming out with their families together, willing to stay as long as it takes.

CNN_16,Young Venezuelan opposition voters prepare to leave the country if Maduro is reelected,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/americas/venezuela-election-opposition-migrate-intl-latam/index.html,2024-07-26 10:36:00,world,"
            Ambar Leáñez grows quiet when she thinks of a future beyond this weekend.
    

            A staunch supporter of Venezuela’s opposition movement, she’s buoyant about her coalition’s chances to win this Sunday’s presidential election. The thought of another six years under the incumbent – Venezuela’s entrenched authoritarian president Nicolás Maduro – would drive her to flee the country, she says.
    

            “The alternative is to go somewhere else to look for a better life,” she told CNN.
    

            This Sunday’s vote will be a consequential moment for Venezuela, and particularly for many young opposition voters who tell CNN they will emigrate if there is no political change.
    

            Often divided among its many political parties, Venezuela’s anti-government coalition has united behind a single presidential candidate, Edmundo González.
    

            Many experts believe that González could pose Maduro’s toughest political challenge to date. On top of a galvanized opposition, pressure from the international community and Venezuela’s oil sector have led to a series of agreements that paved the way to a competitive election this year.

Over 70 arbitrary detentions reported days into campaigning for Venezuela election, NGO says


            On Friday, members of a young opposition group in Maracay, a mid-size city in central Venezuela, took to the streets with fliers and slogans to galvanize votes for González. A few years ago, openly calling for Maduro’s removal here could have invited trouble.
    

            But the group, called “Neighbors for Venezuela,” campaigned without incident. Leañez among them shouting anti-Maduro slogans in the city’s market: “Urgent, we need a new president!”
    

            Another protester, Julio César Pérez, described the choice looming on Sunday in stark terms: “For me, it’s change or the Darién.”
    

            Fellow protester Víctor Medina agrees. “The plan B is packing your bags and the border,” he told CNN. “I can’t see myself living another six years under this government. I can’t give up my future, I’m out of here.”
    

            Thousands of Venezuelans have already trekked through jungles and rivers in the Darién Gap between Colombia and Panamá to head northward toward the United States.
    

            If Maduro remains in power, experts predict that millions more may follow. One poll conducted in June by Venezuelan firm ODH Consultores, estimates up to a third of the population is considering leaving the country after the election.
    

            “I don’t want to leave!” has become a popular chant among opposition supporters.
    

            Most people in Venezuela know someone who has emigrated already. Large numbers of Venezuelans now live in Colombia, Perú, and Brazil, and growing numbers have attempted relocating to the United States – part of a significant election year issue for American voters.
    

            Leáñez’s uncle, Rafael Cabrera, moved to Miami in 2021. On a videocall to his niece in Maracay, he expressed anger that he would not be able to vote on Sunday – Venezuelans living abroad are not allowed to vote by mail, and Venezuela doesn’t have consular representation in the US, which means there are no paths to the vote for Cabrera.
    

            To join him one day, Leáñez said she would consider migrating as an undocumented migrant. “I would wish to migrate as legally as possible, but it’s is one of the cards in my hand. An option… What else could I do?” she said.
    

            On the campaign trail, both Venezuela’s current government and the opposition are urging Venezuelans abroad to return.
    

            Since 2018, a government-sponsored “Return to the Homeland” program organized free flights for more than 10.000 Venezuelan migrants who wished to come back from other Latin American countries.
    

            “We have gone through a bad stretch, really bad, but we’re getting better, we’re improving… to all Venezuelans abroad […] come home!” Maduro said last month.
    

            González has called migration a “drama” that every Venezuelan family has endured. “It’s something that we must find a solution for, immediately. We ask them to come back and to help us to rebuild the country,” he told CNN.
    

            It’s an issue that has touched the top leaders of the opposition movement personally – though they have chosen to stay and fight, in a battle for Venezuela’s future that will be decided on Sunday.
    

            González’s own daughter and his two grandchildren live in Madrid, Spain. He is able to see them “about once a year, otherwise it’s videocall,” he told CNN.
    

            Opposition leader María Corina Machado, who has campaigned alongside González after being barred from running as a candidate, has endured a familiar separation, with her three adult children and their families all living abroad.
    

            “When I walk by their rooms, I have to turn my head away. It’s not something you get used to,” she told CNN.

CNN_17,How Kamala Harris’ warp-speed campaign launch has changed the 2024 race,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/kamala-harris-election-campaign/index.html,2024-07-26 12:00:00,politics,"
            The five days since Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign launched at warp speed have remade the 2024 race – and given Democrats new hope of preventing a second Donald Trump presidency.
    

            Bright green, pro-Harris memes have erupted across social media. Fundraising exploded, with Harris’ campaign saying she raised $126 million between Sunday afternoon and Tuesday evening. And Democrats were more eager to devote their own time to working to elect Harris: More than 100,000 people signed up to volunteer for her bid, and more than 2,000 applied for campaign jobs, Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a Wednesday memo. New polls show a race in which Trump had been ahead now having no clear leader.
    

            It’s all made clear how desperate much of the Democratic Party was for a change at the top of the ticket – and how eager its donors and loyalists are to back a candidate who can take on Trump in a more consistent and aggressive way.
    

            Michigan AFL-CIO President Ron Bieber described the energy in his state – one of November’s most important battlegrounds – as “electric.”
    

            “I’ve never seen energy like this, this time in an election cycle,” he said.
    

            The Democratic message is largely the same. Though Harris has put her own spin on it, much of what she’s focused on in recent days – defending women’s reproductive freedom; rejecting “trickle-down economic policies”; standing up for democratic norms and values – mirrors what President Joe Biden had campaigned on.
    

            But it’s coming through more clearly with a new messenger,  whose energetic performances on the campaign trail in recent days have laid bare the limitations of the 81-year-old Biden.
    

            The strength of Harris’ launch has at times surprised even the former Biden campaign staffers who on Sunday suddenly found themselves working for what was converted into the Harris campaign.
    

            It’s far too soon to draw many conclusions about how Harris’ ascension changes a race that had long looked to be a rematch between Biden and Trump. Harris hasn’t yet chosen a running mate or launched her campaign’s first television advertisement. The Democratic National Convention is just weeks away.
    

            And Harris and Trump could debate – the sort of showdown that would attract tens of millions of viewers and potentially change the trajectory of the race.
    

            Though Trump said earlier this week that he has not committed to debating Harris, the vice president said Thursday that she would participate in the September 10 debate that ABC had originally scheduled between Trump and Biden.
    

            “I think that the voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on a debate stage and so, I’m ready. Let’s go,” she told reporters after landing at Joint Base Andrews following a campaign trip to Houston.
    

            It adds up to an unsettled race – even though there are signs of Harris improving on key Biden weaknesses among younger, non-White and female voters.

CNN Poll: Harris improves on Biden’s performance against Trump in early look at new matchup


            Trump, after surviving an assassination attempt and making his party’s case at the Republican National Convention last week, was in a margin-of-error race with Harris – 49% to her 46% – in a CNN/SSRS poll of registered nationwide voters released Wednesday.
    

            Half of those who backed Harris in the new poll (50%) said their vote was more in support of her than against Trump. That’s a dramatic shift compared with the Trump-focused dynamic of the Biden-Trump race. Among Biden’s supporters in CNN’s June poll, just 37% said their vote was mainly to express support for the president. About three-quarters of Trump supporters (74%) said in the latest survey that their vote was to express support for him rather than opposition to Harris.
    

            The shift toward affirmative support for Harris was notably strong among young voters, voters of color and women – groups that typically back Democrats but had been seen as trouble spots for the Biden campaign.
    

            A New York Times/Siena College poll released Thursday offered similar findings, with Trump at 48% and Harris at 46% among registered voters nationwide – and Harris gaining strength compared with Biden among young and non-White voters.
    

            Harris is only beginning what will be the most grueling 102-day sprint of her political career. The mistakes of her 2020 Democratic primary bid and the verbal missteps and staff upheavals that marred the early period of her vice presidency could resurface as Harris tries to prove she has grown since those stumbles. And she will face the same challenges Biden did in uniting factions of the party who are split over the war in Gaza.
    

            Still, O’Malley Dillon argued in her memo that Harris’ presence at the top of the ticket would expand the map for Democrats. Biden’s campaign believed his path to 270 Electoral College votes ran through the “blue wall” states – Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But Harris, with potentially stronger appeal among young Black and Latino voters, could prove more competitive than Biden in Sun Belt battleground states – Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina.
    

            “We intend to play offense in each of these states, and have the resources and campaign infrastructure to do so,” O’Malley Dillon said in the memo.
    

            It began just after 1:46 p.m. Sunday in her official residence at the Naval Observatory, where Harris – wearing a Howard University hoodie and workout sweats and waiting for Biden’s social media post announcing his exit from the race – began a 10-hour marathon of phone calls.
    

            She called 100 Democrats, including former presidents, governors, congressional leaders and heads of key congressional caucuses. Harris had Biden’s endorsement but told those she called she intended to earn the nomination.
    

            By Sunday evening, many of those initially seen as potential rivals had backed her. Monday morning, many others followed suit. By the afternoon, she had former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s endorsement and had effectively ended the race to take over from Biden before it began.

            On Monday afternoon, Harris visited campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, that had become a bunker of sorts, with staffers dispirited by the weeks of controversy over whether Biden could survive as the Democratic nominee in the wake of his disastrous debate performance weeks earlier.
    

            Biden signs were being swapped out for Harris signs. After all, only the Federal Election Commission paperwork had changed; Harris was taking over an infrastructure built for Biden, and at least initially, keeping the same leadership on board.
    

            As she spoke to campaign staff in a speech that was carried nationally on cable news networks, Harris left Democrats elated as she previewed the message she’d drive against Trump – invoking the former president’s scandals and legal troubles and contrasting those with her own history.
    

            She pointed to her time as San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general, saying that she “took on perpetrators of all kinds.”
    

            “Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own game,” Harris said. “So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump’s type.”
    

            Within about 36 hours, no serious challenger had emerged, and enough state delegations to the Democratic National Convention had announced their unanimous support for Harris for her to clinch the party’s nomination.
    

            Meanwhile, pro-Harris memes were exploding across social media.
    

            Charli XCX, the British pop singer, declared the vice president “brat,” which is both the title of her sixth studio album with its bright green-colored cover and now a Gen Z summer soundtrack. It set off a series of TikTok memes featuring the same shade of green and video of Harris.
    

            Then, there were the coconut memes, revisiting a May 2023 speech in which Harris spoke about “a difference between equality and equity.”
    

            “None of us just live in a silo. Everything is in context,” she said in that speech. “My mother used to – she would give us a hard time sometimes – and she would say to us, ‘I don’t know what’s wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree? You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.’”
    

            Democratic Colorado Gov. Jared Polis posted an endorsement of Harris on social media that was communicated through three emojis: a coconut, a palm tree and an American flag.
    

            “What we’re seeing is a really classic example of when pop culture really gets intertwined with politics, and it takes a special kind of candidate and a special kind of leader to inspire that,” Florida Rep. Maxwell Frost, a 27-year-old Democrat, said on CNN. “It has to be organic. You can’t make it happen.”
    

            On Tuesday, Harris traveled to Milwaukee, where she held her first rally as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.
    

            The usually soft-spoken Wisconsin governor, Tony Evers, told thousands of people who had packed into the Milwaukee high school gymnasium that he was “jazzed as hell” to welcome Harris to town.
    

            “We have 105 days, and we do not have a minute to waste,” Evers said.

            Harris once again hammered Trump in her Tuesday speech. And she sought to drive an economic message that was much clearer and more forward-looking than Biden’s case for his own accomplishments.
    

            “Building up the middle class,” Harris told supporters, “will be a defining goal of my presidency.”
    

            Harris also pointed to what she called Trump’s “extreme Project 2025 agenda.” Trump has disavowed the Heritage Foundation-backed policy plan, which was created by many of his former staffers. However, many of its most conservative and controversial proposals have become central planks in Democratic attacks on Trump.
    

            “We are not going back,” she vowed, prompting the crowd to chant the words back at her.
    

            Many in the crowd, which the campaign said consisted of more than 3,500 attendees, said they were thrilled that Harris was replacing Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket.
    

            Felita Daniels Ashley, a high school administrator in Milwaukee, said she was “so excited” to see Harris as the party’s nominee, after backing the California Democrat to be Biden’s running mate in 2020.
    

            “The future is banking on this,” she said.
    

            Seventeen-year-old Olivia Jessup-Anger and her friend Natalie Jauch, who turns 18 the day before Election Day, said they agree with Charli XCX that Harris is “brat,” a sentiment the pop artist shared on social media Sunday in a post that went viral.
    

            Jessup-Anger said she’s seen a lot of content over the past few days on TikTok featuring Harris paired with music by popular artists such as Taylor Swift and Kesha.
    

            “I think she’s iconic,” Jessup-Anger said of Harris, saying she also agrees with the vice president on policy issues such as abortion rights and education, and “overall seeing a strong independent woman on the ballot this November is really promising.”
    

            Harris has spent each day methodically targeting key parts of the Democratic base – including supporters in a crucial part of a swing state Tuesday, Black women on Wednesday and teachers on Thursday.
    

            She attempted to mobilize Black women – a key Democratic constituency that helped Biden secure the Democratic nomination in 2020 – in a speech to the Zeta Phi Beta sorority in Indianapolis.

            “There’s so much at stake at this moment. There’s so much at stake, and again in this moment, our nation – as it always has – is counting on you to energize, to organize and to mobilize,” Harris said at the Black sorority’s Grand Boulé gathering. “To register folks to vote, to get them to the polls and to continue to fight for our future.”
    

            She accused Trump of backing “a plan to return America to a dark past” and argued that some of Project 2025’s agenda, including cutting the Department of Education and Medicare, “represents an outright attack on our children, our families and our future.”
    

            On Thursday, Harris traveled to Houston for the American Federation of Teachers’ convention, where she thanked the union for being the first to endorse her presidential campaign this week.
    

            Again, she pointed to Project 2025, saying that the agenda would stop student loan forgiveness for teachers and other public servants.
    

            “They even want to eliminate the Department of Education and Headstart, which, of course, would take away preschool from hundreds of thousands of our children,” she said.
    

            Harris’ campaign on Thursday also released the first video of her reelection campaign – a 75-second clip that features Beyoncé’s “Freedom.”
    

            The messengers are different, but the core theme bears similarities to what Biden said in his April 2023 reelection campaign launch video.
    

            In that three-minute video, Biden said: “The question we are facing is whether in the years ahead, we have more freedom or less freedom. More rights or fewer. I know what I want the answer to be, and I think you do too. This is not a time to be complacent. That’s why I’m running for reelection.”
    

            Harris, meanwhile, also emphasized an argument for “freedom” – though in a slight departure from Biden’s defense of democracy, she made the case more broadly, incorporating women’s reproductive rights and more.
    

            The video begins with Harris asking, “In this election, we each face a question: What kind of country do we want to live in?” as scenes from her campaign rally in Milwaukee play.
    

            “We choose freedom. The freedom not just to get by, but get ahead. The freedom to be safe from gun violence. The freedom to make decisions about your own body,” Harris said. “We choose a future where no child lives in poverty, where we can all afford health care. Where no one is above the law. We believe in the promise of America, and we’re ready to fight for it. Because when we fight, we win.”

CNN_18,FBI says investigators are still examining evidence from Trump assassination attempt,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/fbi-examining-evidence-trump-assassination-attempt/index.html,2024-07-26 11:44:00,politics,"
            The FBI said Thursday that investigators continue to examine bullet fragments and other evidence in the attack on Donald Trump at his Pennsylvania rally this month, but the agency has always considered the shooting an attempted assassination of the former president.
    

            “Since the day of the attack, the FBI has been consistent and clear that the shooting was an attempted assassination of former President Trump which resulted in his injury, as well as the death of a heroic father and the injuries of several other victims,” the agency said in a statement.
    

            The agency said it “is devoting enormous resources” to its ongoing investigation of the “heinous attack” and its shooting reconstruction team “continues to examine evidence from the scene.” The FBI is also seeking to interview Trump to obtain a victim statement, a standard part of the investigation since he is the victim of a crime, according to a US official.

Minute-by-minute: Visual timeline of the Trump assassination attempt


            The bureau issued the statement in response to questions about FBI Director Christopher Wray’s testimony on Capitol Hill Wednesday about the shooting, in which he said there’s still “some question” about whether Trump was hit with a bullet or shrapnel.
    

            “As I said, I think with respect to former President Trump, there’s some question about whether or not it’s bullet or shrapnel that hit his ear,” Wray said.
    

            Republicans, including the former president, have seized on the statement to raise questions about Wray’s leadership of the agency.
    

            “No, it was, unfortunately, a bullet that hit my ear, and hit it hard. There was no glass, there was no shrapnel,” Trump wrote on Truth Social Thursday. “No wonder the once storied FBI has lost the confidence of America!”
    

            House Speaker Mike Johnson also expressed skepticism of the FBI director’s testimony.
    

            “We’ve all seen the video, we’ve seen the analysis, we’ve heard it from multiple sources in different angles that a bullet went through his ear. I’m not sure it matters that much,” Johnson told NBC Thursday, adding that Wray “was not forthcoming with some of the information that we would expect.”
    

            “There’s a lot of frustration and concern about the leadership with these agencies,” he said.
    

            During Wednesday’s wide-ranging House Judiciary hearing, Wray shared new details with lawmakers about Trump’s would-be assassin, including that he searched for details of the John F. Kennedy shooting from his laptop and flew a drone in the area near the rally just two hours before the former president took the stage.
    

            Despite later criticism from Republicans about the FBI’s pending conclusions about the nature of the projectile, Wray was commended by representatives on both sides of the aisle for offering new insight into details about the investigation into the gunman. Those bipartisan expressions of appreciation stood in stark contrast to earlier testimony by then-Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned Tuesday after Democrats and Republicans accused her of stonewalling them and demanded her ouster.
    

            When asked Wednesday about how close the “assassin’s bullet” came to killing the former president, Wray said, “My understanding is that either it or some shrapnel is what, you know, grazed his ear.” He then agreed that it came very close to killing the former president.
    

            The director again noted that the shooter fired eight times, and said he believes that investigators know which shot nearly killed Trump.
    

            “The very first one was the one that hit the president. Is that the very first shot? Or is that not accurate?” Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan asked.
    

            “As I sit here right now, I don’t know the answer to that,” Wray responded. “I believe we know the answer to that. I just don’t have it in front of me.”

CNN_19,Harris and Trump at odds over presidential debate,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/kamala-harris-donald-trump-presidential-debate/index.html,2024-07-26 11:41:00,politics,"
            After Vice President Kamala Harris accused former President Donald Trump of “backpedaling” on a debate, the Trump campaign said Thursday it would not commit to any future debates until the Democratic Party formally chooses a nominee.
    

            President Joe Biden’s decision to step down from the Democratic ticket on Sunday threw previous debate plans into doubt. While the Biden and Trump campaigns had agreed to a debate hosted by ABC on September 10, it is unclear if it will go on as planned.
    

            “I have agreed to the previously agreed upon September 10th debate, he agreed to that previously,” Harris told reporters after landing at Joint Base Andrews Thursday. “Now it appears he’s backpedaling. But I’m ready. And I think that the voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on a debate stage and so, I’m ready. Let’s go.”
    

            Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, said in a statement late Thursday that it “would be inappropriate to schedule things with Harris because Democrats very well could still change their minds,” since Harris is only the party’s presumptive nominee.
    

            Harris quickly hit back on social media. “What happened to ‘any time, any place’?” she said in a post on X.


            Democratic delegates are expected to vote virtually to confirm Harris as the party’s nominee by August 7. Trump, for his part, officially clinched the Republican nomination last week at the Republican National Convention.
    

            Trump told reporters earlier this week he wants to debate Harris but has not yet agreed to anything.
    

            “I haven’t agreed to anything. I agreed to a debate with Joe Biden,” Trump said on a press call. “But I want to debate with her, and she’ll be no different because they have the same policies. I think debating is important for a presidential race, I really do. You sort of have an obligation to debate.”
    

            Biden’s exit from the race came weeks after a disastrous performance at the CNN debate last month. He endorsed Harris shortly after his announcement, and the vice president quickly racked up enough delegate endorsements to win the Democratic presidential nomination. While those endorsements are not binding, Harris is still the favorite to take Biden’s place.
    

            Harris would not say on Thursday whether she was open to another proposed debate hosted by Fox News. Before Biden withdrew from the race, Harris had positioned herself to go up against Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, on the debate stage. In a brief call earlier this month, both candidates said they looked forward to debating one another but didn’t discuss specifics about when that would happen, CNN previously reported. 


            It’s now becoming clear those debate plans won’t be made after all, as Vance noted at a campaign stop in his hometown of Middletown, Ohio, earlier this week.
    

            “I was told I was going to get to debate Kamala Harris, and now President Trump’s going to get to debate her?” Vance joked. “I’m kind of pissed off about that if I’m being honest with you.”

CNN_20,"California’s Park Fire burns nearly 125,000 acres in 30 hours as Oregon firefighters battle nation’s largest active fire",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/us/california-park-fire-oregon-durkee-jasper/index.html,2024-07-26 12:52:00,us,"
Hot and dry weather is fueling wildfire activity in the Western United States and Canada, with fires damaging homes, causing injuries and forcing evacuations. The largest active wildfire in the US has scorched more than 280,000 acres in eastern Oregon and another blaze has exploded to nearly 125,000 acres in California. Here’s the latest:


            • Man accused of starting California wildfire is arrested: The Park Fire, the largest of 27 wildfires actively burning across California, has quickly burned an area larger than the size of Atlanta and is only 3% contained, according to Cal Fire. A suspect has been arrested on suspicion of pushing a burning car 60 feet into a gully, “spreading flames that caused the Park Fire,” authorities said.
    

            • Park Fire explodes in size: By Thursday morning, the wildfire had burned an average of nearly 50 football fields per minute since starting Wednesday afternoon. The blaze has forced mandatory evacuations in Butte County, where the state’s deadliest wildfire, the Camp Fire, killed more than 85 people and destroyed thousands of homes in 2018. Conditions around the Park Fire continue to be difficult for the 1,153 firefighters battling the flames as dry air, warm temperatures and gusty winds linger over the area Thursday. The area is under a red flag warning until Friday evening.
    

            • Firefighters battle massive Oregon fire: The Durkee Fire, which has burned an area larger than the city of Indianapolis, started on July 17 near the Oregon-Idaho state line. The lightning-sparked fire is the largest of 31 large wildfires currently burning across Oregon, which has been the hardest hit by fires in recent days. Amid high temperatures, extremely dry vegetation and strong winds, the fire has grown tens of thousands of acres and is 20% contained as of Thursday night, according to InciWeb. More than 500 firefighters and resources from 22 states are working to fight the fire, according to InciWeb. Over the weekend and earlier this week, the Durkee Fire exhibited extreme fire behavior, even creating its own weather in the form of pyrocumulus clouds.
    

            • Oregon wildfire destroys buildings: Three people were injured and two homes and 12 other structures were destroyed as the fire spread, according to the Oregon Department of Emergency Management. Evacuations are still in effect in Baker County for areas around the Durkee Fire. Some communities do not have power, according to Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, who has deployed resources from the National Guard to assist. Dense smoke from the flames has also impeded traffic on Interstate 84, leading to periodic closure of the freeway. Wildfire smoke was spreading into Boise and beyond. Air quality alerts have been issued for parts of Colorado, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.
    

            • Wildfire engulfs tourist town in Canada: A fast-moving wildfire sent thousands of visitors and residents fleeing the town of Jasper in Alberta, where flames devastated up to half of the town’s structures. Officials say the losses are significant, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has deployed federal support to help battle the blaze.
    

            • Fire-conducive weather continues in Western US: Triple-digit heat and dry conditions across the West this week have made conditions poor for firefighters actively fighting to contain the 89 large wildfires burning nationwide. “Many wildfires in the Northwest area continue to exhibit active to extreme fire behavior, with evacuation orders in effect on 17 wildfires. Several teams are managing multiple fire starts as complexes. Evacuation orders are also in effect for several fires in California, the Northern Rockies and the Great Basin,” the National Interagency Fire Center said. Conditions will begin to improve for much of the West over the weekend as cooler temperatures and higher humidity levels arrive in the area.
    

            Some families have found themselves displaced as the Park Fire raged near Chico, a city in northern California, burning homes and forcing evacuations.
    

            A former news anchor told CNN affiliate KOVR that she watched her Butte County house burn down live through security camera footage.
    

            “There is no rhyme or reason. Our house is gone, their house is okay. The house next to it you can see it’s gone,” Julia Yarbough said.
    

            Looking at the remnants of her home, Yarbough said she felt numb.
    

            “It’s surreal,” she said. “It probably won’t hit me till later, I’m pretty sure.”
    

            Triple-digit temperatures and high wind gusts have fueled the explosive growth of the Park Fire amid an active fire season in California. An estimated 343,253 acres have burned across the state so far in 2024, compared to 22,439 acres burned by this time last year, according to Cal Fire.
    

            A 42-year-old man, identified as Ronnie Dean Stout II, has been arrested after being accused of igniting the inferno.
    

            Witnesses reported seeing someone “pushing a car that was on fire into a gully near the Alligator Hole in upper Bidwell Park shortly before 3:00 p.m. yesterday,” Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said Thursday. “The car went down an embankment approximately 60 feet and burned completely, spreading flames that caused the Park Fire.”
    

            The DA says the man was seen “calmly leaving the area by blending in with the other citizens who were in the area and fleeing the rapidly evolving fire.” Stout was later arrested at a mobile home park in Chico, Ramsey said.
    

            Stout will likely face an arson charge, though it is unclear what count, or whether any enhancements will be added, Ramsey said. The DA’s office told CNN Stout has not retained an attorney and will be assigned a public defender at his arraignment.
    

            In Jasper, a popular tourist town in Alberta, 25,000 residents and visitors were forced to evacuate from a fast-moving blaze that has damaged 30 to 50% of the town’s structures, officials said during a press conference on Thursday.
    

            “Homes and businesses have been lost to a wildfire that people are calling a ‘wall of flames,’” Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said.
    

            An “enormous wind gust” moved the wildfire roughly about 3 miles in “probably less than 30 minutes,” Alberta Minister of Public Safety & Emergency Services Mike Ellis said during the press conference. This created “a wall of fire that was about 100 meters high.”
    

            “Any firefighter will tell you there is little to nothing you can do when you have a wall of flames coming at you like that. Nobody anticipated that fire to come so fast, so large,” Ellis said.
    

            Damage wrought by the flames will result in “a significant rebuild and significant displacement,” Smith said. The most significant structural damage lies on the west side of town, according to a Facebook post from Jasper National Park.

            “We will recover from this,” Smith said while holding back tears. “To those in Alberta and around the world who have experienced the magic of Jasper, the magic is not lost, and it never will be.”
    

            The vast majority of evacuees were “visitors with other places to return to,” Ellis said.
    

            Jasper Mayor Richard Ireland said residents will work together to rebuild after the wildfire “ravaged our beloved community.”
    

            “Your resilience and strength have always been the backbone of our community. In the coming days and weeks, we will rally together, support one another, and begin the daunting process of recovery,” Ireland said in a statement on Thursday.
    

            Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said all federal agencies are working together to provide resources to Jasper, support evacuations and strengthen response efforts on the ground.
    

            “Our governments are working together to keep Albertans safe and supported through this,” he said on Facebook.

CNN_21,"Restaurant not responsible for man’s injury after bone from ‘boneless’ wing got stuck in his throat, Ohio Supreme Court rules",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/business/ohio-restaurant-boneless-wings-lawsuit/index.html,2024-07-26 12:32:00,us,"
            An Ohio restaurant is not responsible for a customer’s injury after a bone was found in an order of boneless wings, a divided Ohio Supreme Court ruled Thursday, affirming an appellate court’s earlier decision.
    

            Michael Berkheimer filed a lawsuit in 2017 after he ordered boneless wings a year earlier from Wings on Brookwood in Hamilton, Ohio, and he got a bone lodged in his throat, leading to medical issues, according to court records.
    

            In a 4-3 ruling, the state Supreme Court said Thursday that a “boneless” label on the menu “described a cooking style; it was not a guarantee.” It also noted a lower court’s earlier ruling that “common sense dictated that the presence of bone fragments in meat dishes – even dishes advertised as ‘boneless’ – is a natural enough occurrence that a consumer should reasonably expect it and guard against it.”
    

            “There is no breach of a duty when the consumer could have reasonably expected and guarded against the presence of the injurious substance in the food,” the state Supreme Court opinion says.
    

            CNN has sought comment from Wings on Brookwood and Berkheimer’s attorneys.
    

            Berkheimer’s lawsuit came after he visited the restaurant in 2016 with his wife and friends and placed his “usual order” of boneless wings with parmesan garlic sauce, according to court documents. While he was eating a boneless wing, Berkheimer says he felt a piece “go down the wrong pipe.”
    

            Over the next couple of days, he had trouble eating and had a fever that led him to eventually visit the emergency room, according to court documents.
    

            Berkheimer’s medical records said that a doctor found a “5cm-long chicken bone” lodged in his esophagus, according to court records. The bone tore part of his esophagus and later became infected, which led to additional ongoing medical issues, the lawsuit says.
    

            Berkheimer sued the restaurant, a food supplier, and a chicken farm in the Butler County Common Pleas Court in 2017. That court – siding with the sellers and dismissing the lawsuit – was the one that said the presence of bone fragments in meat dishes was common enough that a consumer should guard against it, court documents and a release from the Supreme Court say.
    

            Berkheimer then appealed to the Twelfth District Court, which also agreed with the trial court. In 2023, Berkheimer appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case, the release said.
    

            On Thursday, the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the lawsuit, saying the customer could have guarded against a piece of bone in his meal.
    

            “A diner reading ‘boneless wings’ on a menu would no more believe that the restaurant was warranting the absence of bones in the items than believe that the items were made from chicken wings, just as a person eating ‘chicken fingers,’” Justice Joseph T. Deters said, writing for the majority.
    

            Dissenting justices, however, said a jury should have been able to hear the case and that it would have been “able to determine, better than any court, what a consumer reasonably expects when ordering boneless wings.”

CNN_22,OpenAI is taking on Google with a new artificial intelligence search engine,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/tech/openai-artificial-intelligence-ai-search-engine/index.html,2024-07-26 12:19:00,us,"
            OpenAI on Thursday announced its most direct threat yet to its stalwart Big Tech rivals: a search engine that uses artificial intelligence baked in from the beginning.
    

            The company is testing SearchGPT, which will combine its AI technology with real-time information from the web to allow people to search for information in the same way they talk to ChatGPT. While the search engine is currently in an early test for a limited number of users, OpenAI said it plans to integrate the tools into ChatGPT in the future.
    

            With the new feature, OpenAI will be directly competing with Google, which has for years dominated the online search market but has scrambled to keep pace with the AI arms race that OpenAI kicked off when it launched ChatGPT in November 2022. SearchGPT could also pose a threat to Microsoft’s Bing, the also-ran search engine player that last year incorporated OpenAI’s own technology in an effort to better compete with Google.
    

            With SearchGPT, users will be able to ask questions in natural language – the same way they talk with ChatGPT – and they’ll receive answers that they can then follow up on with additional questions. But unlike ChatGPT, which is often reliant on older data to generate its answers, SearchGPT will provide up-to-date information, with online links to what the company says are “clear and relevant sources.”
    

            For example, a demo clip shared by the company shows SearchGPT answering a query about the “best tomatoes to grow in Minnesota” with information about tomato varietals, as well as links to sites like “The Garden Magazine” and “The Gardening Dad.”
    

            The tool will also show a sidebar with additional links to relevant information – not totally unlike the ten blue links users are used to seeing on Google Search results pages.
    

            “Getting answers on the web can take a lot of effort, often requiring multiple attempts to get relevant results,” the company said in a blog post. “We believe that by enhancing the conversational capabilities of our models with real-time information from the web, finding what you’re looking for can be faster and easier.”

AI tools make things up a lot, and that’s a huge problem


            The OpenAI search engine could cement generative AI — technology that can create original text, as well as other types of media — as the future of finding answers online, after Google and others have experimented with early efforts to incorporate chatbots and AI-generated answers into the search experience. But that future is not assured, given AI tools’ propensity to confidently assert false information with no indication that it may be incorrect or misleading.
    

            OpenAI’s new tool comes after Google in May rolled out new AI-generated summaries to top some search results pages so users don’t have to click through multiple links to get quick answers to their questions. Google quickly pulled back on use of the feature after it provided false, and in some cases totally nonsensical, information, in response to some users’ queries.
    

            The rollout of Google’s tool also raised concerns among some news publishers, who worried that the AI summaries could cannibalize their web traffic by removing the need for users to visit their sites to get information — and similar concerns could arise with OpenAI’s search engine.
    

            However, OpenAI said Thursday that it partnered with publishers to build the tool and give them options to “manage how they appear” in SearchGPT’s results. It added that sites can appear in SearchGPT even if they’ve opted out of having their content be used to train the company’s AI models.

    Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.


            Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged Hong Kong to prevent Russia from using the Asian financial hub to bypass Western sanctions during a visit to the city on Thursday.
    

            The United States and European Union have sanctioned dozens of companies in Hong Kong and mainland China for evading the extensive measures imposed on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine, including the supply of critical dual‑use goods such as semiconductors.
    

            Kuleba “called on the Hong Kong administration to take measures to prevent Russia and Russian companies from using Hong Kong to circumvent the restrictive measures imposed for Russia’s aggression against Ukraine,” according to a statement from Ukraine’s Foreign Affairs Ministry issued after the minister met with Hong Kong leader John Lee.
    

            “These restrictive measures are necessary to weaken Russia’s capacity to wage war and kill people in Ukraine,” it added. “The Minister stressed that Russia’s machinations should not spoil Hong Kong’s reputation as a highly developed liberal economy based on unwavering respect for the rule of law.”
    

            Dual-use items are goods, software or technology that can be used for both civilian and military applications. The US has said that some of the dual-use items targeted by its sanctions are critical to Russia’s defense-industrial base.
    

            In a statement, a spokesperson for the Hong Kong government told CNN on Friday that it “implements and strictly enforces” United Nations Security Council (UNSC) sanctions.
    

            While the UN General Assembly has passed resolutions condemning Russia’s invasion and demanding the withdrawal of its troops from Ukraine, similar resolutions at the UNSC have been vetoed by Russia, a permanent member of the group.

            Hong Kong officials have previously said the city has no obligation to implement unilateral sanctions imposed by other countries – including when a mega yacht linked to a Russian oligarch sanctioned by the US, the EU and the United Kingdom dropped anchor in the city in October 2022.


            However, international companies based in Hong Kong, including Chinese banks, have generally adhered to US sanctions to avoid any risk of being frozen out of the dollar dominated global financial system.
    

            Kuleba’s visit to Hong Kong was the final leg of his trip to China, the first time the close partner of Russia has hosted a top Ukrainian official since Moscow’s invasion began nearly two and half years ago.
    

            Beijing, which has forged deeper ties with Russia since the invasion and become a vital economic and diplomatic lifeline for Moscow, has repeatedly decried “unilateral sanctions” and what it calls “long-arm jurisdiction” by Western countries, saying they have no basis in international law.
    

            In a meeting in the southern city of Guangzhou on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Ukrainian counterpart that, “although the conditions and timing are not yet ready,” China was “willing to continue to play a constructive role in ceasefire and resumption of peace talks.”
    

            Kuleba told Wang that Ukraine was prepared for peace talks “when Russia is ready to negotiate in good faith,” according to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, but stressed that Kyiv saw no such willingness from Moscow.
    

            The Ukrainian diplomat’s visit comes as Beijing faces increasing pressure from the West over its deepening ties to Russia and allegations that it’s aiding Moscow’s war effort by providing dual-use goods. Beijing denies this and says the West is fueling the conflict by supplying arms for Ukraine’s defense.

CNN_24,"Indebted Indian laborer finds life-changing $100,000 diamond",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/india/india-laborer-diamond-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-26 13:10:00,world,"
            A debt-ridden laborer in central India said his family’s life has been “changed forever” after he unearthed a 19.22-carat diamond worth almost $100,000.
    

            Raju Gond normally makes about $4 a day taking whatever work comes his way to provide for his large family, working in fields or diamond mines in his home state of Madhya Pradesh, or as a tractor driver for a wealthier farmer.
    

            But the 40-year-old and his younger brother Rakesh sometimes pay $9.50 a day to dig for gold in a 64-square-meter (690-square-foot) plot of government land.
    

            And it was there that he made his fortuitous find. After laying his hands on the stone on Wednesday, he said, his heart raced as he cleaned the dirt off it. With every stroke of his finger, the stone shone brighter and brighter.
    

            “It shone spectacularly; I knew it was a diamond right then!” an audibly delighted Gond told CNN from his home in Panna district.
    

            He and Rakesh hugged and jumped in delight. They got onto their bike and hurtled 7 miles (11 kilometers) back home from the shallow mine in Krishna Kalyanpur to share the news with their family. They then took their mother along to the local Panna Diamond Office to have the stone evaluated.
    

            Anupam Singh, the official diamond examiner, took hold of the diamond and had it weighed. “This is a white diamond of 19.22 carat,” he told CNN. It was valued at about $95,500.  Singh was quick to add that Panna is known for its rich diamond reserves. “In 1961 someone found a 54.55-carat diamond, then in 2018 someone found a 42-carat diamond, and now this,” he said, adding that smaller diamonds were also found earlier this year.
    

            Gond may have the weather to thank for his good fortune.
    

            Two months ago, monsoons descended upon the region, washing away many work opportunities. Rather than sit at home, the family felt compelled to search for diamonds.
    

            “What we have to do is fill in a form, give identification proof, provide photos and pay 800 rupees ($9.50) to the government,” Gond explained. “When we are done searching there we can apply again to search for diamonds on another patch of land.”
    

            Singh, the diamond examiner, said the government leases shallow mines to families who want to look for the gemstones, under the supervision of local officials. The government takes an 11.5% royalty for any find, plus a small tax, and gives the remaining amount to the person who found it.
    

            The diamond office will wait for the value of its inventory to exceed $360,000 before holding an auction, Singh said, after which Gond will receive his payout.
    

            “Right now, we have diamonds worth half that amount,” he said.
    

            Gond has opened a bank account and is eagerly waiting for the money to be credited. “Our lives have changed forever,” he said.
    

            “The first thing I’ll do is pay back debt of ($6,000). Then we will invest in all children getting educated, building homes, buy some land and maybe a tractor too,” he said.
    

            Lately, he said, it has been hard to make ends meet. His family includes his parents, wife, seven children, and the families of his younger brother and sister.
    

            When he was growing up, his father and grandfathers would tell Gond stories of people who found diamonds in the soil, “and how the fate of the family had changed after that.” Today, he says, he has his own story to share.
    

            And on Friday, the brothers were back at the mine.
    

            “We woke up early and got out again,” Gond told CNN. “We are already in the shallow mine. We will find more diamonds!”

CNN_25,US arrests alleged Sinaloa cartel leader and son of ‘El Chapo’ in Texas sting operation,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/us/sinoloa-cartel-ismael-zambada-custody-report/index.html,2024-07-26 14:42:00,us,"
            An alleged Mexican drug kingpin suspected of flooding the United States with deadly fentanyl and who evaded authorities for decades is in US custody after he was apparently lured across the border by federal agents.
    

            Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, 76, the alleged co-founder and leader of the powerful Sinaloa cartel, was arrested in El Paso, Texas on Thursday, Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.
    

            Another alleged cartel leader, Joaquin Guzman Lopez, 38, was also arrested, he said. Guzman is a son of the cartel’s infamous co-founder and former boss Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, 69, who is serving a life sentence in a US prison after he was convicted five years ago on multiple charges.
    

            Both Zambada and Guzman Lopez face several charges for allegedly leading the cartel’s criminal operations, including its “deadly fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking networks,” Garland said.
    

            “Fentanyl is the deadliest drug threat our country has ever faced, and the Justice Department will not rest until every single cartel leader, member, and associate responsible for poisoning our communities is held accountable,” Garland said.
    

            The sting operation to catch Zambada duped the alleged drug lord into flying to the US under false pretenses, two law enforcement officials familiar with the plot told CNN.
    

            Zambada and Guzman Lopez boarded a plane purportedly en route to inspect a property in Mexico, the sources said, adding that at least one of the men was unaware they were headed to the US.
    

            FBI agents arrested the two alleged drug kingpins after they landed in El Paso.
    

            US authorities had sought Zambada’s capture for years and in 2021 raised the reward for information leading to his arrest to $15 million.
    

            “Ismael Mario Zambada Garcia is the long-time leader of the Zambada Garcia faction of the Sinaloa Cartel.  Zambada Garcia is unique in that he has spent his entire adult life as a major international drug trafficker, yet he has never spent a day in jail,” according to the US State Department.
    

            FBI Director Christopher Wray said Zambada and Guzman Lopez had “eluded law enforcement for decades” and “will now face justice in the United States.”
    

            The pair allegedly oversaw the trafficking of “tens of thousands of pounds of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and fentanyl into the US along with related violence,” Wray added.
    

            Drug Enforcement Administration chief Anne Milgram said the pair’s arrests strike “at the heart of the cartel that is responsible for the majority of drugs, including fentanyl and methamphetamine, killing Americans from coast to coast.”
    

            The Sinaloa Cartel, named after the Mexican state where the gang was formed in the late 1980s, is one of the most powerful criminal groups in the world, raking in billions of dollars annually by trafficking drugs into the US and around the globe.
    

            Notorious cartel boss Guzman, better known as “El Chapo,” was arrested in Guatemala in 1993 on homicide and drug charges and extradited to Mexico. But he escaped Mexican prison in 2001, reportedly by bribing prison guards to smuggle him out in a laundry truck. He was arrested again in 2014, but escaped again, this time through a tunnel.
    

            Guzman was arrested for a third time in 2016 and then extradited to the United States.

            In a major trial, he was convicted by a federal jury in Brooklyn in 2018 and sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years, according to the Justice Department.
    

            Guzman was found guilty on 10 federal criminal counts, which included engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiracy to launder narcotics proceeds, international distribution of cocaine, heroin, and marijuana, and use of firearms.
    

            During the trial, Guzman’s lawyers argued Zambada was the real kingpin of the cartel who bribed the Mexican government to frame Guzman and remain free to run the criminal organization.
    

            In the latest in a string of US indictments against him, Zambada was charged in February with conspiring to manufacture and distribute fentanyl, an extremely potent synthetic opioid that has killed tens of thousands of Americans in an epidemic of overdoses.
    

            Fentanyl “was largely unheard of when [Zambada] founded the Sinaloa Cartel more than three decades ago and today is responsible for immeasurable harm,” said Breon Peace, US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, in the indictment.
    

            Since 1989, Zambada has imported and distributed “massive amounts of narcotics,” generating billions of dollars in profits, according to the indictment.

            Federal prosecutors said he employed people to obtain “transportation routes and warehouses” to import and store narcotics, along with hit men, or sicarios, to carry out kidnappings and murders in Mexico “to retaliate against rivals who threatened the cartel.”
    

            Zambada’s son, Vicente Zambada Niebla, admitted during testimony at Guzman’s 2018 trial to passing along orders for murders and kidnappings and was sentenced to 15 years in 2019 by a federal judge in Chicago.
    

            He began cooperating with the US government in 2011, prosecutors said in a May 2019 filing. They said he aided authorities in helping target members of the Sinaloa Cartel and a rival gang, which lead to the “charging of dozens of high-level targets and hundreds of their associates in indictments throughout the country,” CNN previously reported.
    

            The younger Zambada had known “El Chapo” since he was 15 years old, he testified at the kingpin’s trial in 2018. The younger Zambada frequently referred to “El Chapo” as “mi compadre,” or “my buddy,” during his testimony and said the drug lord was godfather to his youngest son.
    

            “El Mayo” Zambada was also indicted by a US federal grand jury in April 2012, in Texas, along with other suspected top Sinaloa leaders and 22 people allegedly connected with the cartel, including Guzman. They were charged with murder and conspiracy connected with drug trafficking, money laundering and organized crime.
    

            At that point, Guzman and Zambada had already been indicted on drug trafficking and organized crime charges in several US federal courts.
    

            The 2012 indictment in western Texas detailed two acts of violence federal prosecutors said were committed by members of the cartel; one took place during a 2010 wedding ceremony in Ciudad Juarez, when an American citizen and two members of his family were kidnapped because of their ties with the rival Juarez cartel.
    

            The target was the groom and a resident of Columbus, New Mexico, whose body was found to be beaten, strangled and whose hands had been “severed above the wrists and placed on his chest,” according to the indictment.
    

            Police found the bodies of the groom, his brother and his uncle three days after the wedding in the bed of a pickup truck, the indictment stated.
    

            Another incident detailed in the indictment related to the kidnapping, killing and mutilation of a Texas resident in 2009 “to answer for the loss of a 670-pound load of marijuana seized by the Border Patrol,” prosecutors said.

CNN_26,"Hollywood’s videogame performers to go on strike over AI, pay concerns",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/media/sag-aftra-video-game-performers-strike/index.html,2024-07-26 14:52:00,us,"
            Video game voice actors and motion-capture performers have called a strike over failed labor contract negotiations focused around AI-related protections for workers, bringing about another work stoppage in Hollywood.
    

            The SAG-AFTRA has called a strike of the Interactive Media Agreement that covers videogame performers, effective July 26, the union said on Thursday.
    

            The decision follows months of negotiations with major videogame companies including Activision Productions, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Take-Two Interactive, Disney Character Voices and Warner Bros Discovery’s WB Games.
    

            The Interactive Media Agreement expired in November 2022 and was being extended on a monthly basis during the talks.
    

            “Although agreements have been reached on many issues important to SAG-AFTRA members, the employers refuse to plainly affirm, in clear and enforceable language, that they will protect all performers covered by this contract in their AI language,” the union said in a statement.
    

            The SAG-AFTRA also represents the film and television actors who went on strike in July last year over concerns of inadequate safeguards against artificial intelligence (AI), putting Hollywood in the midst of two simultaneous work stoppages for the first time in 63 years.
    

            Apart from AI protections, the SAG-AFTRA’s most pressing issues in the contract negotiations for videogame performers are higher pay, medical treatment and breaks for motion capture performers.
    

            SAG-AFTRA is seeking wage increases for videogame performers, saying their pay has not kept pace with inflation, and pursuing more protections for the motion-capture performers who wear markers or sensors on the skin or a body suit to help game makers create character movements.
    

            “We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations. We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions,” said Audrey Cooling, a spokesperson for the videogame producers party to the Interactive Media Agreement.
    

            The offer presented to the SAG-AFTRA features AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA, Cooling said.

CNN_27,"California’s Park Fire explodes to over 145,000 acres as Oregon firefighters battle nation’s largest active wildfire",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/us/california-park-fire-oregon-durkee-jasper/index.html,2024-07-26 15:43:00,us,"
Hot and dry weather is fueling wildfire activity in the Western United States and Canada, with fires damaging homes, causing injuries and forcing evacuations. The largest active wildfire in the US has scorched more than 280,000 acres in eastern Oregon and another blaze has exploded to over 145,000 acres in California. Here’s the latest:


            • Man accused of starting California wildfire is arrested: A suspect has been arrested on suspicion of pushing a burning car 60 feet into a gully, “spreading flames” that caused what’s now become California’s largest wildfire of the year, authorities said. The Park Fire in the Butte County area has quickly burned an area larger than the size of Atlanta and is only 3% contained, according to Cal Fire.
    

            • Park Fire explodes in size: By Thursday morning, the wildfire had burned an average of nearly 50 football fields per minute since starting Wednesday afternoon. The blaze has forced mandatory evacuations in Butte County, where the state’s deadliest wildfire, the Camp Fire, killed more than 85 people and destroyed thousands of homes in 2018. Conditions around the Park Fire continue to be difficult for the 1,153 firefighters battling the flames as dry air, warm temperatures and gusty winds linger over the area Thursday. The area is under a red flag warning until Friday evening.
    

            • Three firefighters injured and structures damaged: Three firefighters had minor heat-related injuries on Wednesday while fighting the Park Fire, Cal Fire Captain Dan Collins told CNN Thursday. They were treated and released, he said. Officials know structures have been damaged or destroyed by the fire, but there is no official count yet, Collins said.
    

            • Firefighters battle massive Oregon fire: The Durkee Fire, which has burned an area larger than the city of Indianapolis, started on July 17 near the Oregon-Idaho state line. The lightning-sparked fire is the largest of 34 large wildfires currently burning across Oregon, which has been the hardest hit by fires in recent days. Amid high temperatures, extremely dry vegetation and strong winds, the fire has grown tens of thousands of acres and is 20% contained as of Thursday night, according to InciWeb. More than 500 firefighters and resources from 22 states are working to fight the fire, according to InciWeb. Over the weekend and earlier this week, the Durkee Fire exhibited extreme fire behavior, even creating its own weather in the form of pyrocumulus clouds.
    

            • Oregon wildfire destroys buildings: Three people were injured and two homes and 12 other structures were destroyed as the fire spread, according to the Oregon Department of Emergency Management. Evacuations are still in effect in Baker County for areas around the Durkee Fire. Some communities do not have power, according to Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, who has deployed resources from the National Guard to assist. Dense smoke from the flames has also impeded traffic on Interstate 84, leading to periodic closure of the freeway. Wildfire smoke was spreading into Boise and beyond. Air quality alerts have been issued for parts of Colorado, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.
    

            • Wildfire engulfs tourist town in Canada: A fast-moving wildfire sent thousands of visitors and residents fleeing the town of Jasper in Alberta, where flames devastated up to half of the town’s structures. Officials say the losses are significant, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has deployed federal support to help battle the blaze. Cool temperatures and rain are expected to keep fire behavior low for the next 72 hours, which will help crews fight the blaze, Jasper National Park said on Facebook Thursday night.
    

            • Fire-conducive weather continues in Western US: Triple-digit heat and dry conditions across the West this week have made conditions poor for firefighters actively fighting to contain the 89 large wildfires burning nationwide. “Many wildfires in the Northwest area continue to exhibit active to extreme fire behavior, with evacuation orders in effect on 17 wildfires. Several teams are managing multiple fire starts as complexes. Evacuation orders are also in effect for several fires in California, the Northern Rockies and the Great Basin,” the National Interagency Fire Center said. Conditions will begin to improve for much of the West over the weekend as cooler temperatures and higher humidity levels arrive in the area.
    

            Some families have found themselves displaced as the Park Fire raged near Chico, a city in northern California, burning homes and forcing evacuations.
    

            A former news anchor told CNN affiliate KOVR that she watched her Butte County house burn down live through security camera footage.
    

            “There is no rhyme or reason. Our house is gone, their house is okay. The house next to it you can see it’s gone,” Julia Yarbough said.
    

            Looking at the remnants of her home, Yarbough said she felt numb.
    

            “It’s surreal,” she said. “It probably won’t hit me till later, I’m pretty sure.”
    

            Triple-digit temperatures and high wind gusts have fueled the explosive growth of the Park Fire amid an active fire season in California. An estimated 343,253 acres have burned across the state so far in 2024, compared to 22,439 acres burned by this time last year, according to Cal Fire.
    

            A 42-year-old man, identified as Ronnie Dean Stout II, has been arrested after being accused of igniting the inferno.
    

            Witnesses reported seeing someone “pushing a car that was on fire into a gully near the Alligator Hole in upper Bidwell Park shortly before 3:00 p.m. yesterday,” Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said Thursday. “The car went down an embankment approximately 60 feet and burned completely, spreading flames that caused the Park Fire.”
    

            The DA says the man was seen “calmly leaving the area by blending in with the other citizens who were in the area and fleeing the rapidly evolving fire.” Stout was later arrested at a mobile home park in Chico, Ramsey said.
    

            Stout will likely face an arson charge, though it is unclear what count, or whether any enhancements will be added, Ramsey said. The DA’s office told CNN Stout has not retained an attorney and will be assigned a public defender at his arraignment.
    

            In Jasper, a popular tourist town in Alberta, 25,000 residents and visitors were forced to evacuate from a fast-moving blaze that has damaged 30 to 50% of the town’s structures, officials said during a press conference on Thursday.
    

            “Homes and businesses have been lost to a wildfire that people are calling a ‘wall of flames,’” Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said.
    

            An “enormous wind gust” moved the wildfire roughly about 3 miles in “probably less than 30 minutes,” Alberta Minister of Public Safety & Emergency Services Mike Ellis said during the press conference. This created “a wall of fire that was about 100 meters high.”
    

            “Any firefighter will tell you there is little to nothing you can do when you have a wall of flames coming at you like that. Nobody anticipated that fire to come so fast, so large,” Ellis said.
    

            Two wildfires converged in the Jasper National Park area, becoming what authorities are referring to as the Jasper Wildfire Complex. It remains difficult to measure exactly how big the complex – which also includes a third nearby fire – is due to extreme fire behavior and thick smoke cover. Together, the fires have swallowed an estimated 89,000 acres, the Jasper National Park said.
    

            Damage wrought by the flames will result in “a significant rebuild and significant displacement,” Smith said. The most significant structural damage lies on the west side of town, according to a Facebook post from Jasper National Park.

            “We will recover from this,” Smith said while holding back tears. “To those in Alberta and around the world who have experienced the magic of Jasper, the magic is not lost, and it never will be.”
    

            The vast majority of evacuees were “visitors with other places to return to,” Ellis said. Along with about 5,000 residents who live in the town, 2.48 million people visited Jasper National Park last year.
    

            Jasper Mayor Richard Ireland said residents will work together to rebuild after the wildfire “ravaged our beloved community.”
    

            “Your resilience and strength have always been the backbone of our community. In the coming days and weeks, we will rally together, support one another, and begin the daunting process of recovery,” Ireland said in a statement on Thursday.
    

            Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said all federal agencies are working together to provide resources to Jasper, support evacuations and strengthen response efforts on the ground.
    

            “Our governments are working together to keep Albertans safe and supported through this,” he said on Facebook.

CNN_28,French rail lines disrupted by ‘coordinated sabotage’ ahead of Paris Olympics Opening Ceremony,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/europe/france-rail-network-disruption-paris-olympics-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-26 15:50:00,world,"
            France’s high-speed train lines were targeted by multiple “malicious” acts including arson on Friday, in what has been described as “coordinated sabotage” to disrupt travel ahead of the Opening Ceremony of the Paris Olympics.
    

            France’s state railways company SNCF called the overnight disruption a “massive attack aimed at paralyzing the high-speed line network.”
    

            In a post on X, SNCF said “a large number of trains were diverted or canceled,” and asked “all travelers who can to postpone their trip and not go to the station.”
    

            The railway operator said the disruption hit Atlantic, Northern and Eastern high-speed lines, with damage caused to several of its facilities. SNCF said one of the acts was “foiled.”
    

            Travel on these lines is “very disrupted,” with the railway network needing to divert and cancel a large number of trains, SNCF said. Disruptions were expected throughout the weekend as work crews oversee repairs, it added
    

            The Rémi Train Centre Val de Loire said travel on its railway lines would be disrupted until at least Monday, with a fire near the tracks in Courtalain, northern France impacting services to Paris.
    

            The reports come just hours before the Olympic torch relay concludes and the Opening Ceremony begins, with more than 320,000 spectators expected to attend along the River Seine.
    

            CNN has reached out to the International Olympic Committee for comment.
    

            The French Minister of Sports and the Olympic and Paralympic Games, Amélie Oudéa-Castera said the disruption to the train lines are “a sort of coordinated sabotage.”
    

            Speaking to CNN affiliate BFMTV, Oudéa-Castera condemned the attacks in the “strongest possible terms,” and said it is “truly appalling.”
    

            “Playing against the Games is playing against France, against your camp, against your country,” she said, according to BFMTV.
    

            Oudéa-Castera said the incidents will disrupt hamper on Friday and the weekend.

            “We will assess the impacts on travelers, athletes, and ensure the proper transport of all delegations to the competition sites,” she said.
    

            In response to the attacks, Paris police chief Laurent Nunez said Friday that police are stepping up security and focusing manpower on the capital’s train stations.
    

            Security in Paris had already been bolstered in recent weeks.
    

            France plans to deploy around 35,000 police each day during the Games, peaking at 45,000 for the Opening Ceremony, a spokesperson at the French interior ministry previously told CNN. In addition, 10,000 soldiers will be deployed in the Paris region – an effort supported by 1,800 police officers from around the world, they added.
    

            Nicolas Nordman, Deputy Paris Mayor in charge of security, recently told CNN that authorities had been working for months to try to anticipate what might happen and were confident the ceremony would be safe.
    

            The cause of the disruptions is currently unclear. But there has been growing domestic unrest, powered in part by recent national elections that saw a battle between the left and far-right.
    

            Interior Minister Darmanin confirmed security forces had detained a “member of the extreme-right” this week who was “suspected of wanting to commit violent action during the Olympic Games.” According to Darmanin, the man had an “intention to intervene during a phase of the torch relay.”
    

This is a developing story. More to come.

CNN_29,"Assisted dying bill introduced in Britain’s House of Lords, as emotional campaign picks up pace",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/uk/assisted-dying-bill-gbr-cmd-intl/index.html,2024-07-26 15:50:00,world,"
            An emotional, accelerating campaign to allow assisted dying for terminally ill adults in Britain has reached parliament, with activists hoping the country will become one of few to legalize the process.
    

            A Private Member’s Bill is to be introduced in the House of Lords on Friday, putting the issue back on parliament’s agenda – though it is uncertain whether it will reach the House of Commons for approval from lawmakers.
    

            Whatever its progress, it marks another development in a debate that has found its way onto Britain’s airwaves and prompted impassioned appeals from some well-known faces.
    

            “I’ve been campaigning for a long time on this issue,” Charlie Falconer, the Labour peer introducing the bill, told CNN. “It has never felt for me a more favorable time upon which to try and embark on legislation,” he said.
    

            “Change is definitely coming.”
    

Assisted dying generally refers to the process through which a person with a terminal illness can legally access drugs to end their lives. It is legal in few countries; Canada and 11 US states allow it, as does most of Australia, Switzerland and the Netherlands. It is partially available in Germany and Italy, while Spain and Portugal have legalized the process in recent years.
    

            “The conditions for change have never been better,” said Ellie Ball of Dignity in Dying, a leading campaign group that has pushed for years for the United Kingdom to follow suit. “The trend around the world is towards giving people greater choice at the end of their lives.”
    

            But it is a heated national conversation, and its path to legalization remains long – with vocal pockets of opposition from outside and inside parliament.
    

            “The state should not be complicit in encouraging people to end their lives,” said Alistair Thompson, a spokesman for Care Not Killing, which opposes any change in the law on assisted dying or euthanasia and advocates for better palliative care.
    

            “People just need to look very coldly, clinically at the facts and the data, and not necessarily at clearly very emotional stories,” he said.
    

            Friday’s bill is not the first to reach parliament; nine years ago MPs voted by a sizable margin not to legalize assisted dying in Britain, and Lords have occasionally tried to reintroduce the issue in the years since.
    

            For Falconer, the time is right to try again. “There has been over the last year or two a much greater urgency and interest in the issue,” he said. His bill is similar to the law in Oregon, the first US state to allow assisted dying, where only terminally ill people – and not those in unbearable suffering – are permitted to seek medication that would end their lives.
    

            It does not go as far as Switzerland, the Netherlands and Canada, which allow an assisted death in cases of suffering as well. Only a handful of countries allow euthanasia, in which another person deliberately ends someone’s life to relieve suffering.
    

            It is currently a crime to help somebody die in England and Wales, punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Performing euthanasia on a person, meanwhile, is considered murder or manslaughter.
    

            Polling indicates the public broadly supports ending those laws, and a campaign by celebrated journalist and broadcaster Esther Rantzen, who is terminally ill with lung cancer, has given the issue a prominent face.
    

            “Isn’t it typically British that we give the pets we love a pain-free, dignified, private death but we can’t offer it to the people we love,” she told the BBC in April.
    

            Rantzen told the broadcaster that allowing assisted dying would “mean that I could look forward in confidence to a death which is pain-free surrounded by people I love.”
    

            Currently, traveling alone to a clinic like Dignitas in Switzerland is about the only option for Brits in her situation, but it is one very few seek out; only 33 British citizens ended their lives at Dignitas in 2022, according to the clinic.
    

            Opponents of legalization have argued that those small figures represent a limited appetite for assisted dying in the UK, but there are other pressures at play too. “If my family go with me, they could be investigated by the police for killing me, or pressuring me to die,” Rantzen told the BBC.
    

            One of the clinic’s recent British patients was Paola Marra, who had terminal cancer and died at Dignitas earlier this year. In a video message filmed before her death, she said: “The pain and suffering can become unbearable. It’s a slow erosion of dignity – the loss of independence, the stripping away of everything that makes life worth living.
    

            “Assisted dying is not about giving up. In fact, it’s about reclaiming control,” she said.
    

            Britons are increasingly hearing stories like Rantzen’s and Marra’s. But some among the country’s lawmakers, who will ultimately decide the fate of the assisted dying law, say there is more to consider.
    

            “We’re in danger of it being a cause célèbre,” said Rachael Maskell, a Labour lawmaker and clinician who has researched assisted dying on parliament’s Health and Social Care Committee.
    

            “It’s easy to market, isn’t it: Do you want a good death or not? Do you want to control the end of your existence, or not? Who’s going to say no to that?” Maskell told CNN.
    

            But she listed a number of reservations that she and other members of the committee considered, including that legalization would encourage patients to seek an earlier death to avoid becoming a burden on their relatives.
    

            “I’ve had that conversation so many times with patients,” she said. “That worries me, because that person has as much right to a fulfilled life.”
    

            And she said a lack of monitoring in Oregon of how medication is assigned and taken by patients “horrified” her when she visited the US state to study its law. “We wouldn’t be a world leader, we would be a world follower,” Maskell added.
    

            The arrival of an intensely delicate issue in Britain’s parliament provides an early political test for Keir Starmer, Britain’s new prime minister – and the decisions his government take on the bill will determine whether and how soon assisted dying becomes legal in the country.
    

            The first stages of a premiership are typically finely choreographed; a government’s priorities are introduced to parliament, one by one, as the prime minister looks to craft the public’s first impressions of their new government.

            For Starmer, the assisted dying bill has the potential to disrupt those intentions. He said before and after this month’s general election – which his Labour Party won in a landslide – that he would allow time for a debate on the issue if it reaches the Commons, and he would allow a free vote on the issue, meaning his MPs wouldn’t be asked to vote one way or the other.
    

            But legalizing assisted dying wasn’t in Labour’s manifesto or in its King’s Speech, limiting the opportunities for it to ever reach MPs. Falconer’s effort is a Private Member’s Bill, allocated individually after a ballot determined which peers can introduce a bill. A similar ballot will take place in the Commons in September, which could see an elected lawmaker take on the mantle, and that is the way the government is believed to prefer the matter is introduced.
    

            “The key piece of the jigsaw that is currently missing is a vote in the Commons,” Falconer said. “I think (Starmer) is very keen for it to be done. (But) of course there are other priorities.”
    

            Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, is likely to eventually face calls to allow a debate and a vote on the issue, whether those come as a result of Falconer’s bill or another legislative push.
    

            But campaigners are urging lawmakers to turn to the matter faster.
    

            “There’s growing momentum around the campaign,” Ball, of Dignity in Dying, told CNN. “I’ve lost count of the number of soap (operas) that have approached us to provide evidence in support of storylines about the issue.
    

            “The debate needs to start as soon as possible,” she said. “Dying people don’t have time to wait.”

CNN_30,Destructive cyclones and dreamlike scenery: award-winning photos show beauty and destruction,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/mangrove-photo-award-2024-c2e-spc/index.html,2024-07-26 17:02:00,world,"
    Editor’s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex’s Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.


            A photograph of a young girl in a checked green dress against the backdrop of a churned-up sea filled with debris is the winner of the 2024 Mangrove Photography Awards.
    

            Taken by Indian photographer Supratim Bhattacharjee, it shows the aftermath of a cyclone in the Sundarbans, a huge mangrove forest that lies at the delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers on the Bay of Bengal.
    

            Extreme weather is becoming more frequent in the region, leading to the destruction of homes and businesses, and the mass displacement of people.
    

            In this case, the girl’s tea house was destroyed in the storm. “We see the girl’s life turn upside down … her look of helplessness reflecting the turmoil of life for many people on the southern coast of the Sundarbans in India,” Leo Thom, founder of the Mangrove Photography Awards and creative director of Mangrove Action Project, told CNN.
    

            “As sea levels rise and storms breach the protective embankments, their land becomes inundated with saltwater from the sea, making it impossible to grow crops for years to come,” he added.
    

            In its tenth year, the photography awards are intended to drive awareness of the beauty and fragility of mangrove forests like the Sundarbans and highlight the urgent need for their protection.
    

            Found in 123 countries, the unique ecosystems are key in the fight against climate change, acting as a giant carbon store. They also serve as a natural barrier against flooding, and provide a habitat to threatened animal species like tigers and jaguars.

            “Known as the ‘roots of the sea,’ our coastal forests are crucial for the survival of millions of coastal communities, providing protection from the extremes of nature and acting as nurseries for fish and marine life,” said Thom.
    

            Yet despite this, they are also one of the world’s most threatened ecosystems. According to a recent report from the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems, more than half of global mangroves are at risk of collapse by 2050.
    

            The awards, which received more than 2,500 entries from 74 nations, selected winners in six categories, including one dedicated to mangrove threats. This category’s winning image, taken by Dipayan Bose in India, shows a man standing in his flooded home; other commended images depict urban development encroaching on mangrove forests, and pollution ranging from fishing nets to toxic chemicals.
    

            Other categories celebrate the beauty of mangroves, with stunning aerial images of mangrove forests lining turquoise channels, and shots of amazing wildlife that lives within these ecosystems. A “young mangrove photographer of the year” title was awarded to Australia’s Nicholas Alexander Hess, for his intense multiple exposure photograph of a saltwater crocodile’s eye peering out of a mangrove forest at low tide.

            “Captured at night, the image gives off a slightly unsettling feeling, such as what one may experience in a mangrove, unknowing of what predators may be lurking nearby, hidden by the dense network of the mangrove,” said Hess in a press release.
    

            The awards’ organizers believe that the wide variety of images from all corners of the world can help to raise awareness of the ecological role mangroves play and catalyze their protection.
    

            “We hope the photography awards can help connect people to mangrove forests and their conservation, by exciting them about the diversity of life found within them,” said Thom. “We want to see existing healthy mangroves protected and improve restoration of our lost forests.”

CNN_31,Hurricane season has been on pause. Here’s when that could change,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/weather/atlantic-hurricane-forecast-climate/index.html,2024-07-26 16:47:00,world,"
            The Atlantic Ocean has been on a nearly three-week long rest after producing historic Hurricane Beryl, but the basin is about to wake up.
    

            “There’s definitely some (tropical activity) coming,” Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert and research scientist at Colorado State University, said. “It’s coming sooner rather than too much later.”
    

            Tropical activity in the Atlantic typically starts to ramp up in August, particularly during the second half of the month. But this season – which is expected to be hyperactive – got off to a historic start when Beryl exploded into a ferocious Category 5 hurricane in early July.
    

            Beryl was supercharged by ocean waters as warm as they should be in September – a phenomenon becoming more common as the planet warms due to fossil fuel pollution.
    

            The rapidly intensifying hurricane also had two other ingredients needed for storms to form that have been missing ever since: moist air and a lack of storm-disrupting upper level winds, called wind shear.
    

Ocean temperatures are still off the charts, but a vast expanse of dry, dusty air has limited moisture and helped rein in tropical activity over the Atlantic post-Beryl.
    

            This so-called Saharan dust originates from dust storms in Africa, gets trapped in a layer of air above the surface and is then carried out over the Atlantic by persistent winds.
    

            Batches of Saharan dust flow out of Africa and over the Atlantic year-round, but high concentrations peak in the early summer, just like this year.
    

            This July has so far produced the month’s second-highest concentration of dust over the tropical Atlantic on record, according to an analysis by hurricane expert Michael Lowry. Reliable satellite data for this measurement begins in 2002.

            But this disruptive dry, dusty air isn’t sticking around and will likely dissipate in August, according to Klotzbach.
    

            Dust wasn’t the only factor keeping the Atlantic quiet after Beryl. Upper-level winds were too hostile for hurricanes to develop in July, but signs point to calmer winds and favorable conditions in the weeks to come, according to Klotzbach.
    

            Klotzbach estimates all of the necessary atmospheric conditions will come together in the next week and a half, which will open the door for more hurricanes.
    

            While Klotzbach doesn’t think a storm is guaranteed to form immediately after conducive conditions align, it’s only a matter of time before one does.
    

            Forecasts from the Climate Prediction Center highlight an area for potential tropical development from July 31 to August 6. Part of the western Atlantic and the Caribbean has at least a 20% chance of tropical development during that timeframe.
    

            That 20%-or-greater chance persists through mid-August and expands across almost the entire tropical Atlantic, from west of Cabo Verde into the eastern Caribbean.
    

            The most active period of the Atlantic hurricane season typically runs from mid-August to mid-October, with activity peaking around September 10.
    

            Once hurricane season wakes up again, quiet periods could be few and far between.

CNN_32,Barack and Michelle Obama endorse Kamala Harris for president,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/barack-michelle-obama-kamala-harris-endorsement/index.html,2024-07-26 17:28:00,politics,"
            Former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential bid in a video released Friday.
    

            “Michelle and I couldn’t be prouder to endorse you and to do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office,” the former president told Harris on a phone call joined by his wife, according to the video.
    

            Harris thanked the Obamas for their support and expressed gratitude for their decadeslong friendship.
    

            “Oh my goodness. Michelle, Barack, this means so much to me. I’m looking forward to doing this with the two of you, Doug and I both. And getting out there, being on the road,” the vice president said.
    

            “But most of all, I just want to tell you the words you have spoken and the friendship that you have given over all these years mean more than I can express, so thank you both. It means so much. And we’re gonna have some fun with this too, aren’t we?” she added.
    

            The former first lady said she is proud of Harris and expects the upcoming election to be historic.
    

            “I can’t have this phone call without saying to my girl, Kamala, I am proud of you. This is going to be historic,” she told Harris.
    

            In a joint statement announcing the endorsement, the Obamas praised Harris and listed her accomplishments.
    

            “But Kamala has more than a resume,” the statement said. “She has the vision, the character, and the strength that this critical moment demands. There is no doubt in our mind that Kamala Harris has exactly what it takes to win this election and deliver for the American people.”
    

            The statement added, “At a time when the stakes have never been higher, she gives us all reason to hope.”
    

            Obama and Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, have been in touch regularly, and he has been serving as a sounding board for her as he has over the 20 years they’ve known each other, a source told CNN earlier this week.
    

            Obama didn’t immediately endorse Harris following President Joe Biden’s announcement on Sunday that he was not seeking reelection.
    

            “I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,” the former president said in a statement at the time.
    

            According to the source, Obama believed it was important for the Democratic Party to have a legitimate process by which delegates would select their new nominee. An Obama adviser told CNN that the former president was taking the same approach as he did during the 2020 Democratic primary, watching closely with the intent of being able to unify the party when a nominee is chosen – whether it was Harris or someone else. Obama’s statement was intended to keep the focus on Biden – his former vice president – on the day he announced he was no longer seeking a second term, the adviser said.
    

            Obama had previously been supportive of Biden’s reelection efforts, attending a handful of fundraisers that raised millions of dollars, along with participating in moderated conversations with Biden and sending messages encouraging supporters to chip in as part of fundraising efforts.
    

            Democrats have been moving quickly in their process to nominate Harris with the party adopting rules Wednesday to choose their presidential nominee. Voting to officially nominate Harris is likely to begin on August 1.
    

            The rules call for ceremonial votes for president and vice president, as well as a vote on the party platform, during the Democratic convention, which is scheduled to take place in Chicago from August 19 to 22. While the ceremonial presidential vote will be conducted as a roll call, the vote for vice president is likely to be a voice vote.
    

            Harris has not yet selected a running mate. As CNN previously reported, a team of lawyers and advisers are conducting one of the most accelerated vice presidential searches in modern American history, with a goal of announcing a nominee before August 7.

CNN_33,What we know about the governor’s order to clear homeless encampments in California,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/us/california-homeless-encampments-gavin-newsom-order/index.html,2024-07-26 17:27:00,us,"
            California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday issued an executive order directing officials in the state with the nation’s largest homeless population to start removing homeless encampments – a move met with outrage from homeless advocates and elected officials.
    

            The Democratic governor’s order came on the heels of a US Supreme Court decision last month that ruled in favor of an Oregon city that ticketed homeless people for sleeping outside. The order calls on state officials “to adopt humane and dignified policies to urgently address encampments on state property.”

            “This executive order directs state agencies to move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them – and provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same,” Newson said in a statement. “There are simply no more excuses. It’s time for everyone to do their part.”
    

            California has the largest homeless population in the nation, with more than 180,000 of the estimated 653,000 people experiencing homelessness nationwide residing in the Golden State, according to a 2023 report to Congress from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.
    

            Here’s what we know about the executive order, along with reactions from state officials and homelessness advocates:
    

            Newsom’s executive order was buoyed by the US Supreme Court’s decision last month, which rejected arguments that ticketing homeless people for sleeping outside violates the Constitution’s ban on “cruel and unusual” punishment.
    

            The case centered on “anti-camping” ordinances in Grants Pass, Oregon, that were challenged by several residents experiencing homelessness.

            The Eigth Amendment “does not authorize federal judges to wrest those rights and responsibilities from the American people and in their place dictate this Nation’s homelessness policy,” Gorsuch wrote in his opinion for the 6-3 conservative majority. The three liberal justices dissented, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor writing that the ruling “punishes (people) for being homeless.”
    

            The case was the most significant appeal involving homeless Americans to reach the Supreme Court in decades, and was closely watched by cities and states across the nation wrestling with a sharp increase in homelessness.
    

            Newsom last month praised the high court’s ruling, saying it “provides state and local officials the definitive authority to implement and enforce policies to clear unsafe encampments from our streets.”
    

            Chris Herring, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California Los Angeles, said Newsom “could have issued this order” before the high court’s decision.
    

            “The only difference now is that states and localities are free to confine and arrest people even when there is no shelter available,” Herring said.
    

            “Before the Supreme Court ruling, cities were in the position where they would have to provide shelter offers before removing encampments,” he said. “Now … they will be able to carry out these encampment sweeps with the very real threat of issuing people incredibly expensive fines of which people cannot pay and often results in a warrant or an arrest or can result in incarceration.”
    

            Herring said the timing of the order wasn’t surprising as Newsom seeks to “politically clear his name of the homeless crisis, especially as he’s in the national spotlight right now amid the presidential election.”
    

            The governor’s order directs, but does not mandate, state agencies and departments to adopt “policies and plans consistent” with the existing encampment policy of the state’s Department of Transportation (Caltrans).

            Caltrans provides “advance notice of clearance and works with local service providers to support those experiencing homelessness at the encampment, and stores personal property collected at the site” for at least 60 days, Newsom’s office said in a news release.
    

            In his order, Newsom encouraged local governments to follow this policy and use resources funded by his investments in housing and intervention programs to remove encampments – prioritizing those that pose the greatest danger to those living in and around them.
    

            It also directs the state’s Interagency Council on Homelessness to “develop guidance and provide technical assistance” to local governments.
    

            The state invested over $24 billion in funding to assist local jurisdictions “in providing services and wrap-around support” to people living in encampments to address the housing crisis, the news release added. The governor’s office also urged local governments to apply for grant funding to “expand the behavioral health continuum and provide appropriate care to individuals experiencing mental health conditions and substance use disorders.”
    

            Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the parent organization of the Housing is a Human Right initiative, accused Newsom of “criminalizing poverty” and “doubling down on failed policies.”
    

            “Governor Newsom, where do you expect people to go? This is a shameful moment in California history,” Weinstein said in a statement Thursday.
    

            Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness in San Francisco, called Newsom’s executive order “a punch in the gut.”
    

            She said there are already thousands of people on a waitlist for housing, and all shelter beds in San Francisco are already full. Roughly 8,000 people are homeless every night in the city, which has 3,300 occupied shelter beds, Friedenbach told CNN.

            “The governor is saying they want to crack down on folks who have no other choice – obviously they wouldn’t be out there if they had somewhere else to be,” she said, adding there isn’t a system in place that is “matching the need.”
    

            Friedenbach cited examples to illustrate the challenges homeless people already face in the state, including women experiencing homelessness who can’t get into women-only shelters or disabled people who have to forego a shelter bed due to lack of accessibility.
    

            People who are living in encampments have “nowhere to go” when they are cleared, Friedenbach said. “They lose their belongings, they face increased morbidity, they lose their paperwork making it harder to get services, they lose their access to social workers,” she continued. “These kinds of efforts exacerbate homelessness.”
    

            Tescia Uribe, who works with the statewide nonprofit organization PATH that seeks to end homelessness in the state, told CNN the group will continue investing resources “into just moving people from one place to another.”
    

            “This order doesn’t force anyone to do anything they haven’t already been doing or want to do. It comes with no dollars, nothing to provide permanent solutions for people,” she said.
    

            Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass was also among those pushing back against Newsom’s order, saying: “Strategies that just move people along from one neighborhood to the next or give citations instead of housing do not work.”
    

            A study published this month by the Rand Corp’s Center on Housing and Homelessness found encampment clearing efforts in Los Angeles had no long-term effect on the number of people on the streets.
    

            The researchers looked at encampment cleanups in Venice, Hollywood and Skid Row in Los Angeles and “observed temporary declines in the unsheltered population that lasted two to three months on average” before returning to previous levels, the study said.

            “For the first time in years, unsheltered homelessness has decreased in Los Angeles because of a comprehensive approach that leads with housing and services, not criminalization,” said Bass. “We thank the Governor for his partnership thus far and hope that he will continue collaboration on strategies that work.”
    

            But in San Francisco, a spokesperson for Mayor London Breed said Thursday the city had already started to take action to clear encampments.
    

            “Our city encampment teams and street outreach staff have been going out every day to bring people indoors, and to clean and clear encampments,” spokesperson Parisa Safarzadeh said in a statement. “This is why we are seeing a five year low in the City’s tent count on our streets.”
    

            The city’s police department told CNN plans for how to clear encampments are still being developed, but will involve a coalition of partners, including the San Francisco Department of Public Health, nonprofit partners, and the San Francisco Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing.

CNN_34,"Exclusive: CNN survey finds 48 states say Harris can get on ballot instead of Biden, rejecting claim switch breaks state laws",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/harris-ballot-legal-obstacles-48-states/index.html,2024-07-26 18:00:00,us,"
            The election authorities of at least 48 states, both Republicans and Democrats, say there are no obstacles that would prevent Vice President Kamala Harris from getting on election ballots if she becomes the official Democratic presidential nominee, as expected.
    

            The findings of a CNN survey of all 50 states undercut the claims of House Speaker Mike Johnson, who said both before and after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race on Sunday that there are legal “impediments” in some states to a party switching presidential candidates as the Democrats did. There was not a single state election authority that told CNN Harris would face a ballot issue as the official nominee; election authorities in two states, Florida and Montana, did not respond to requests for comment, but a review of the states’ ballot access rules suggests Harris is not likely to face an issue there either.
    

            Johnson, a lawyer, said on ABC News Sunday that “it would be wrong and I think unlawful in accordance to some of these state rules for a handful of people to go in the backroom and switch it out because they’re – they don’t like the candidate any longer.” He said on CNN Monday that “in some of the states, there are impediments to just switching someone out like that.”
    

            But experts on election law say that is not true, since the Democrats never named Biden as the official 2024 nominee or submitted his name to the states as their 2024 nominee. And election authorities around the country have now confirmed – telling CNN or saying in public statements that Harris will not face any obstacles getting on their ballots if she is formally chosen as the Democratic nominee next month.
    

            The 48 states (plus the District of Columbia) whose election authorities have said the official Democratic nominee will not have ballot issues include the seven states with the closest margins in the 2020 election, which are widely considered the key swing states again in 2024: Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Michigan and Nevada. The 48 states also include the 15 states where former President Donald Trump, the Republicans’ 2024 nominee, had his highest share of the vote in 2020.
    

            Johnson’s office did not respond to CNN’s requests to identify the “impediments” he claimed some states have.
    

            The election authorities in 48 states and the District of Columbia offered highly similar comments explaining why Harris does not face any hurdles getting on the ballot there.
    

            In general, they explained that they receive the names of a major party’s presidential nominee after the nominee is officially chosen by the party; that the Democratic convention has not been held yet (it’s scheduled for in-person events on August 19-22, with an official nomination vote to be held virtually earlier in the month); and that their state’s deadline for receiving the party nominees’ names has not arrived yet.
    

            Patrick Gannon, spokesperson for the bipartisan North Carolina State Board of Elections, said in an email: “Political parties nominate their presidential and vice-presidential candidates at their conventions and then inform the State Board of Elections of those persons’ names. The Democratic Party has not yet had its convention, nor has it informed the State Board of its presidential and vice-presidential candidates’ names.When they do, those candidates’ names will be placed on the ballot.”
    

            Gabriel Sterling, chief operating officer for Republican Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, wrote on social media: “So it’s understood, Biden dropping out will not impact Georgia ballots. As the Democrats haven’t had a convention, there is no ‘nominee’ to replace.”
    

            Even the Republican election authorities of reliably pro-Trump states throughout the country definitively said Harris would not have issues there if she were chosen as nominee at the convention.
    

            Chelsea Carattini, spokesperson for Republican Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, said in an interview: “There’s no issue. We basically just wait for the major parties to do their national conventions, and once completed, they send us the certificate of nomination for whomever is selected.”
    

            Michon Lindstrom, spokesperson for Republican Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams, said in an interview: “No, there is no issue with Kamala being on the ballot because Joe Biden was never the official nominee.”
    

            Rachel Soulek, director of South Dakota’s elections division under Republican Secretary of State Monae Johnson, said in an email: “South Dakota will have no issues with the Democratic Party’s nominations.”
    

            Landon Palmer, a spokesperson for Republican West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner, said in an email: “The candidate that will appear on West Virginia’s ballot in November will be the candidate that is nominated by the DNC. Presuming that is Kamala Harris, then there will be no issues.”
    

            Laney Rawls, spokesperson for Republican Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, said in an email: “Major parties have until August 23, 2024 to certify to the Secretary of State’s office their Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidates” under a provision of Alabama law Rawls identified. She added, “The Secretary of State’s office will certify lawfully submitted party certifications on August 28, 2024.”
    

            CNN’s Tierney Sneed reported Sunday that Trump allies have discussed whether or not they have grounds to mount a challenge on the replacement of Biden with Harris, according to a source familiar with the discussions.
    

            It’s impossible to say for certain whether a particular court in a particular state might rule that the state’s elections authority was wrong. But experts say that is unlikely.
    

Derek Muller, a University of Notre Dame law professor who is an expert on election law, said in an email: “Democrats do not have a nominee yet. The nomination formally happens at the convention. Any litigation before the convention challenging the identity of the nominee is about something that hasn’t yet happened. Any challenges after the convention would be challenges to a nominee who received the support of the convention delegates under convention rules. It’s essentially impossible to argue that the nominee is not the true nominee of the party at that point.”

CNN_35,The Trump-crypto love story may not be happily ever after,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/business/trump-crypto-bitcoin/index.html,2024-07-26 18:00:00,us,"
A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.


            Donald Trump didn’t need to do much to win over crypto investors, who are used to being treated like the problem children of the financial world. They’re tinkering in the shadows, doing a thing most normies either don’t understand and/or believe is a scam.
    

            In recent months, the bitcoin crowd has warmed to the former president and Republican nominee, who in turn has warmed to the idea of Big Tech and crypto profits flowing into political action committees that support his reelection.
    

            “Bitcoiners are looking for political validation after years in the wilderness,” said Eric Soufer, a political adviser to major crypto companies. “They believe now is their moment, and it’s hard to resist someone who is telling them everything they want to hear.”
    

            Trump is expected to do just that on Saturday, when he gives the keynote speech at Bitcoin 2024, billed as the largest crypto gathering in the US, in Nashville.
    

            And while Trump has locked in support from a handful of deep-pocketed Silicon Valley bigwigs like Marc Andreessen and the Winklevoss twins, his claim to be the “crypto candidate” may be a harder sell now than it was even just a week ago.
    

            Running against President Joe Biden, Trump only needed to nod in the direction of crypto-friendly policies to get the attention of an industry that is exhausted from battling Biden’s top market regulator, Securities and Exchange Commission chief Gary Gensler, who is, to put it mildly, not a fan.

A rash of tech billionaires are pivoting to Trump — but not because they’re MAGA bros


            But running against Vice President Kamala Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee, may change the calculus.
    

            Almost immediately after Biden dropped out of the race Sunday, the tech world began buzzing about what a Harris administration could look like and how it might take a gentler approach to crypto regulation than Biden’s did. (And to be fair, industry insiders say just about anyone would be less hostile than Gensler.)
    

            Harris’ team appears, at the very a least, aware of the opportunity for a vibe shift.
    

            Mark Cuban, the billionaire entrepreneur and bitcoin enthusiast, told the news site Decrypt that advisers to the vice president have reached out to him with questions about crypto, which he saw as a “good sign.” Cuban also told Politico on Tuesday that Harris would be “far more open” to crypto, though he noted that was “certainly not confirmed by the VP.” Cuban didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment.
    

            Representatives for the Harris campaigns didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment. Brian Hughes, a senior Trump adviser, told CNN that crypto innovators and others in the technology sector are “under attack” by Democrats and that “Trump is ready to encourage American leadership in this and other emerging technologies.”
    

            At this point, neither Harris nor Trump has laid out any specific policy proposals related to digital assets. When the Republican Party updated its platform earlier this month, its only mention of crypto said the GOP would “end Democrats’ unlawful and unAmerican Crypto crackdown” and “defend the right to mine Bitcoin.”
    

            Harris, a Californian with close Silicon Valley ties, appears to have said little publicly on the topic.
    

            Crypto advocates have coalesced around political action committees that are shopping for candidates who’ll back industry-friendly legislation and take a light hand to regulation. In the 2024 election cycle alone, crypto-backed super PACs have raised more than $180 million — making them some of the top fundraisers around, according to Follow the Crypto, a tracking site run by the tech writer and prominent crypto critic Molly White. So far, those PACs have spent $42 million on both parties, though slightly more for Republicans.
    

            It’s not clear why Trump has shown a sudden adoration for digital assets when he pooh-poohed it during his presidency. But the sector is considerably more flush with cash now than it was four years ago, and for the first time in its 15-year history, politically organized.
    

            Contrast his current stance with what he said in 2019: “I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.” Or in 2021, when he told Fox Business that crypto “just seems like a scam.”

CNN_36,"Don’t help Russia evade sanctions, Ukraine tells Hong Kong",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/business/russia-china-hong-kong-ukraine-sanctions-kuleba-hnk-intl/index.html,2024-07-26 17:38:00,us,"
    Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.


            Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged Hong Kong to prevent Russia from using the Asian financial hub to bypass Western sanctions during a visit to the city on Thursday.
    

            The United States and European Union have sanctioned dozens of companies in Hong Kong and mainland China for evading the extensive measures imposed on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine, including the supply of critical dual‑use goods such as semiconductors.
    

            Kuleba “called on the Hong Kong administration to take measures to prevent Russia and Russian companies from using Hong Kong to circumvent the restrictive measures imposed for Russia’s aggression against Ukraine,” according to a statement from Ukraine’s Foreign Affairs Ministry issued after the minister met with Hong Kong leader John Lee.
    

            “These restrictive measures are necessary to weaken Russia’s capacity to wage war and kill people in Ukraine,” it added. “The Minister stressed that Russia’s machinations should not spoil Hong Kong’s reputation as a highly developed liberal economy based on unwavering respect for the rule of law.”
    

            Dual-use items are goods, software or technology that can be used for both civilian and military applications. The US has said that some of the dual-use items targeted by its sanctions are critical to Russia’s defense-industrial base.
    

            In a statement, a spokesperson for the Hong Kong government told CNN on Friday that it “implements and strictly enforces” United Nations Security Council (UNSC) sanctions.
    

            While the UN General Assembly has passed resolutions condemning Russia’s invasion and demanding the withdrawal of its troops from Ukraine, similar resolutions at the UNSC have been vetoed by Russia, a permanent member of the group.

            Hong Kong officials have previously said the city has no obligation to implement unilateral sanctions imposed by other countries – including when a mega yacht linked to a Russian oligarch sanctioned by the US, the EU and the United Kingdom dropped anchor in the city in October 2022.


            However, international companies based in Hong Kong, including Chinese banks, have generally adhered to US sanctions to avoid any risk of being frozen out of the dollar dominated global financial system.
    

            Kuleba’s visit to Hong Kong was the final leg of his trip to China, the first time the close partner of Russia has hosted a top Ukrainian official since Moscow’s invasion began nearly two and half years ago.
    

            Beijing, which has forged deeper ties with Russia since the invasion and become a vital economic and diplomatic lifeline for Moscow, has repeatedly decried “unilateral sanctions” and what it calls “long-arm jurisdiction” by Western countries, saying they have no basis in international law.
    

            In a meeting in the southern city of Guangzhou on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Ukrainian counterpart that, “although the conditions and timing are not yet ready,” China was “willing to continue to play a constructive role in ceasefire and resumption of peace talks.”
    

            Kuleba told Wang that Ukraine was prepared for peace talks “when Russia is ready to negotiate in good faith,” according to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, but stressed that Kyiv saw no such willingness from Moscow.
    

            The Ukrainian diplomat’s visit comes as Beijing faces increasing pressure from the West over its deepening ties to Russia and allegations that it’s aiding Moscow’s war effort by providing dual-use goods. Beijing denies this and says the West is fueling the conflict by supplying arms for Ukraine’s defense.

CNN_37,Too hot to board: What’s the limit for sweltering airplane cabins?,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/airplane-cabins-heat-limits/index.html,2024-07-26 17:45:00,world,"
    Editor’s Note: Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter. Get the latest news in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.


            Boarding a sweltering airplane cabin on a hot summer day has never been anyone’s favorite part of a flight, but as aviation traffic picks up — generating congestion that keeps planes on the ground for longer — and global heat records keep being broken, overheated airplane cabins could soon become a problem.
    

            There is currently no regulatory standard for cabin temperature during boarding, but the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA) — an American group and the largest flight attendant union in the world — has since 2018 called for one in the US, where every airline deals with the issue in its own way.
    

            In July 2023 in Las Vegas — during the hottest summer on record, according to NASA — emergency services had to attend to at least one passenger on a United flight bound for Atlanta that had been sitting on the tarmac for hours due to delays. The outside temperature reached a high of 115 degrees, and the flight was eventually canceled.
    

            “The temperature in the cabin was in triple digits. There were several people who had to go to the hospital for overheating and get medical treatment,” says Sara Nelson, president of the AFA.
    

            The incident might be a glimpse into things to come. When the AFA petitioned the US Secretary of Transportation to set a federal limit for cabin temperatures during boarding of 80 F (26.7 C), or 85 F if in-flight entertainment screens are switched on, it also launched an app where passengers and crews can report instances of uncomfortably hot cabins. In the five years since, it has received more than 4,000 extreme temperature reports, 80% of which are about boarding.
    

            “Some of the airlines have internal policies that actually match or come near to the standards that we’re calling for, like, for example, Delta Air Lines,” Nelson continues. “And yet, in the July of 2023 incident, the cabin was hitting temperatures well above 100 degrees. This shows that without a federal requirement, these policies are oftentimes set aside.”
    

            Delta said at the time that it was “looking into the circumstances that led to uncomfortable temperatures inside the cabin.”
    

            According to an AFA spokesperson, among the US airlines that have policies somewhat aligned to the union’s proposed federal limit are Spirit and Hawaiian, both of which instruct their flight attendants to not let passengers board if the cabin is above 85 F. For American Airlines, that limit stretches up to 90 F, according to AFA.
    

            Other airlines, like Alaska, United and Frontier, the AFA spokesperson said, don’t have a set temperature and leave the issue to the judgment of the captain and crew. Alaska, for example, requires a crew member to inspect the center of the cabin one hour before departure to subjectively determine if it’s too hot or too cold.
    

            These airlines did not offer details about temperature limits in response to CNN’s queries.
    

            It doesn’t help, the union remarks, that different aircraft have different ways to set cabin temperature, with some controlled by flight attendants and some by flight crew. 


            “We were actually giving out keychain thermometers to passengers and crew for a while,” Nelson says.
    

            The reason why cabins can get hot on the ground is that the engines cannot power the on-board air conditioning systems until the plane is airborne. It is still possible to do so via the auxiliary power unit (APU) — a smaller engine in the tail of the plane whose purpose is specifically to power electric systems while on the ground — but it costs fuel, which is why most airlines avoid it.
    

            “There is typically a lot of pressure on the pilots to limit the APU at the gate to also limit the burning of fuel if they’re waiting to take off,” Nelson says. “The pressure’s on everyone and it creates conditions that make people sick. The aircraft cabin is designed in a way that it will often heat up very quickly, and the smaller the aircraft is, the faster it heats up.”
    

            In mid-May, the House passed a major federal aviation bill that renewed the FAA’s authority for five years and provided more than $105 billion in funding. It also called for a “a 1-year study on the health and safety impacts of unsafe cabin temperature with respect to passengers and crew members during each season.”
    

            The study must be completed within the next two years, and results will have to be submitted to both the National Academies of Sciences and Congress, which will then decide if further action needs to be taken.
    

            The first line of defense against the heat while the aircraft is sitting on the ground is trying to prevent the cabin from becoming excessively hot to begin with, according to Charles Horning, a professor of aviation maintenance science at the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.
    

            Many of us have been on “flights where the flight attendants have asked all the passengers to close the sliding windows before they get off the aircraft,” he says. “That’s probably the best thing that can be done to try to keep the cabin from heating up.” 


            There are other ways to cool down a plane; for example, by using special carts that provide air conditioning in lieu of the APU. “But again, you’re burning fuel in order to generate the compressed air that has to be used for the air conditioning system, so it’s a trade-off,” says Horning.
    

            The other thing to work on, he adds, is to prevent aircraft from sitting on the ground for too long in the first place. “That’s a whole other issue, but once the aircraft gets in the air and you have the engines running, the air conditioning system works much more efficiently.”
    

            CNN reached out to several airlines for comment on this story.
    

            Delta told CNN that it focuses on keeping aircraft cabins cool during the summer “through use of ground power and air and systems on board the aircraft,” with crew working with boarding agents to ensure the cabin is comfortable before passengers get on board. Customers can help keep cabins cool by following crew member instructions to keep window shades down and air vents open while aircraft are on the ground,” the spokesperson added.
    

            Southwest Airlines said it “adheres to all Federal Aviation Regulations concerning temperatures aboard aircraft” and manages operations by using “aircraft most capable of operating efficiently in high temperatures with heavy flight loads” in places that experience extreme heat.
    

            “Southwest hasn’t recently experienced widespread delays or cancellations related to heat. We’re running aircraft air conditioning on the ground and asking customers to close window shades and open overhead air vents to help maintain cooler cabins,” Lynn Lunsford, SWA spokesman, said in an email to CNN.
    

            Lunsford said Southwest provides water, ice and frequent breaks in air-conditioned areas to employees and encourages them to take measures to stay hydrated and as cool and protected from the sun as possible. The airline also trains employees to look out for signs of heat-related illness.
    

            Spirit, Hawaiian, Frontier, JetBlue and United did not respond to a request for comment on their cabin temperature policies. American and Alaska responded to the request but did not provide comment.
    

            Airlines for America, a trade association that represents major North American airlines, did not directly answer a CNN question on whether it is in favor of a federal mandate on cabin temperature. However, its spokesperson Hannah Walden said that “the safety of all passengers, flight and ground crews is always the US airline industry’s top priority” and that “extreme heat impacts on commercial aircraft operations are rare given that aircraft are designed and certified to safely operate in a wide range of low and high temperatures.”
    

            Hassan Shahidi, president of the Flight Safety Foundation – an international non-profit organization that champions the cause of aviation safety – says that implementing international regulations and standards for cabin temperatures must take multiple issues into consideration.
    

            “Airlines must balance fuel efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions, and the technological limitations of current aircraft cooling systems,” he says. “Additionally, setting a uniform temperature standard can be complicated due to varying climates at different airports and the diverse types of aircraft in operation.”
    

            He adds that running APUs when aircraft are on the ground may be constrained by environmental regulations in different regions around the world: “We urge industry stakeholders to share data on cabin temperature events and best practices they use to keep temperatures down. We support a comprehensive study on this topic.”

CNN_38,The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2024,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/politics/senate-race-rankings-july-2024/index.html,2024-07-26 18:30:00,politics,"
            Democrats faced a challenging path to holding their Senate majority even before President Joe Biden stepped aside from the 2024 campaign – and they likely still do with Vice President Kamala Harris as their presumptive nominee.
    

            But this year’s Democratic candidates, many of them well-known incumbents, have so far been able to create some separation from the top of the ticket. The question is whether they can sustain it as these contests take off over the late summer and fall.
    

            Nine of the top 10 seats on CNN’s latest ranking of the Senate seats most likely to flip are held by Democrats (or independents who caucus with them). And assuming Republicans flip West Virginia, where Sen. Joe Manchin is retiring, the GOP just needs to win the White House or pick up one more Senate seat to win the majority.
    

            That’s a tough landscape for Democrats – especially when they’re defending seats in states that either twice voted comfortably for Donald Trump (Montana and Ohio) or are presidential battlegrounds. CNN polling released this week showed no clear leader between Harris and the former president – although it was closer contest than CNN had found in earlier surveys of the Biden-Trump matchup. The poll showed Harris doing better than Biden against Trump among some key demographic groups – younger voters, female voters and Black voters.
    

            But there’s been limited public polling of Senate races that would capture the past tumultuous month in American politics – from the June 27 presidential debate that sparked Democratic consternation about Biden, the assassination attempt on Trump in Pennsylvania in mid-July, and Biden’s decision to forgo reelection nearly a week ago.

CNN Poll: Harris improves on Biden’s performance against Trump in early look at new matchup


            The CNN poll found Trump enjoying his highest approval rating since 2020 in CNN surveys and maintaining support with his most loyal constituencies. Republicans have already made clear they’ll be tying Harris to the Biden administration, misleadingly calling her a “border czar” because of her assignment to address the root causes of emigration from Central America. Even though her role has not included managing the border, that messaging fits into the immigration-related attacks that have been central to GOP campaigns this cycle.
    

            The National Republican Senatorial Committee said in a memo this week that “Harris is arguably a bigger threat to Democrats’ Senate majority than Joe Biden,” acknowledging that the narrative about the president’s mental fitness didn’t apply as well to down-ballot races. The committee encouraged candidates to tie senators to Harris and her positions.
    

            All of that raises the stakes for Senate Democrats to keep doing what they’re doing: touting their legislative accomplishments without invoking the Biden administration and using their fundraising edge to try to define their GOP challengers – often by mining their business backgrounds and out-of-state ties. Democrats have also been hitting back on attacks over the southern border by highlighting their support of bipartisan immigration legislation that Republicans killed in Congress this year.
    

            But the risk for Democrats is that as their Republican challengers become better known, GOP campaign spending increases and more voters tune in, any separation from the top of the ticket will erode. Ticket-splitting isn’t as common as it once was, as CNN political analyst Ronald Brownstein wrote recently. 


            One change to this month’s CNN ranking is reflective of that challenge. Two Democratic-held seats are trading places: Michigan, an open seat, moves above Pennsylvania, where there’s a three-term incumbent on the ballot. But otherwise, the list remains unchanged from April, when Maryland was first included due to Republican former Gov. Larry Hogan’s candidacy and when Florida fell off. That leaves Texas as the only Democratic target in the top 10.
    

            While Biden was still a candidate, his recent struggles had raised questions about whether the list of Senate GOP targets would grow – a source of enthusiasm for attendees at last week’s Republican National Convention. Virginia GOP nominee Hung Cao, for example, addressed the delegates just as new polling from The New York Times/Siena College showed a margin-of-error presidential race in the Old Dominion. (Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, however, led Cao 53% to 36% among likely voters in that survey.)
    

            And NRSC Chair Steve Daines talked up the prospects of New Mexico nominee Nella Domenici, the daughter of the late Sen. Pete Domenici. Democrats, however, felt confident about their incumbents in states Biden won by 10 points (Virginia) and 11 points (New Mexico), given that some of their candidates in much tougher states are, for now, still holding their own. But if Harris can keep the race with Trump tighter, the Senate map is less likely to expand in the GOP’s favor.
    

            The rankings below represent a snapshot of where the race for the Senate stands and not necessarily where it may be heading, so we’ll check back on the following contests next month.
    

            Both Democrats and Republicans have essentially been treating this seat as a GOP pickup since Sen. Joe Manchin announced he wasn’t running for reelection. The onetime Democratic senator tried last month to put to rest chatter that he could run as an independent against Republican nominee Jim Justice, the current governor, in the Trump-friendly state. “I’m not running for any office, political office,” Manchin told CNN’s Manu Raju in June shortly after registering as an independent. He did, however, leave a little bit of wiggle room ahead of the August 1 filing deadline, adding, “You always have options, because life is full of surprises.”
    

            Justice, a former Democrat, has had his share of troubling headlines – about his business practices, for example – but he’s a popular and well-known second-term governor who easily dispatched Rep. Alex Mooney in the May Republican primary. And Manchin, the most conservative member of the Senate Democratic Caucus, was clear about the challenge of running in a state that’s moved so sharply to the right, noting that the “D” brand in West Virginia had grown “toxic.”
    

            Sen. Jon Tester needs to overperform the top of the ticket in a state that twice backed Trump by double digits. Tester has won tough elections before – including in 2018, when Trump was in the White House – but this is the first year he will be on the same ballot as the former president.
    

            Republicans have run plenty of ads attempting to tie Tester to Biden and attacking him over the border. They are now likely to substitute the president for Harris, although Tester is among the few Democrats not to have endorsed her so far. Democrats, meanwhile, are trying to play up the contrast between the seven-fingered dirt farmer and his GOP opponent, Tim Sheehy, a wealthy businessman and retired Navy SEAL. Last Best Place PAC, a Democratic-aligned group, has run ads poking fun at what they call Sheehy’s “hobby ranch” and attacking him as a “millionaire out-of-stater driving up housing costs.” Democrats have also seized on Washington Post reporting about Sheehy’s changing account of a gunshot wound sustained roughly a decade ago to raise questions about his credibility.
    

            The relevance of Sheehy’s relatively recent arrival in the state – he settled there in 2014 after leaving the military – has become a key question in this race. Democrats are trying to make it a weakness after using a similar argument to discredit Republican nominee Matt Rosendale in his 2018 challenge to Tester. But Republicans argue that post-pandemic Montana is filled with conservative transplants from bluer states and that Sheehy, who recently stepped down as CEO of Bridger Aerospace, has been a job creator.
    

            Tester raised $10.6 million in the second quarter – about double Sheehy’s haul, which included a million dollars in personal loans. The senator spent more than he took in those three months, but he still started July with a healthy cash-on-hand advantage over Sheehy – $10.9 million to his opponent’s $3.2 million.
    

            Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is the second-most vulnerable incumbent, facing reelection in a state that Trump has twice carried by 8 points. His path to reelection, like Tester’s, runs through distancing himself from the top of the ticket while trying to paint a character contrast with his GOP opponent to localize rather than nationalize the race. Democrats got their preferred opponent in Bernie Moreno, a Cleveland car dealership owner whom they boosted in a three-way primary by highlighting his backing from Trump.
    

            Brown, a progressive populist who’s been in Congress since 1993, raised more than any other incumbent in the second quarter and is spending heavily – a whopping $18.1 million during that three-month period – to shape that contrast with Moreno. His ads feature a Republican sheriff vouching for him and tout successful legislation to lower the cost of insulin (without mentioning that this was a Biden priority). A Democratic-aligned outside group has highlighted legislation he has pushed that Trump signed. Democrats have been working to define Moreno – Brown’s campaign uses his background as a car dealer to attack his credibility, for example. Democrats have also seized on a New York Times story that poked holes in the personal narrative the Colombian-born Moreno presents on the trail.
    

            Brown is the known commodity in this race – a recent ad about his gravelly voice underscores that familiarity – but Republicans think Ohio voters will eventually come their way given the state’s increasing redness. Moreno, who’s playing up his ties to Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, had tried to tether his opponent to an unpopular president with one ad featuring two men, supposed to be Biden and Brown, riding a tandem bicycle to make the argument that they’re pedaling together in Washington.
    

A Marist poll released in early June, well before Biden dropped out, hinted at the ticket-splitting Democrats are banking on for Brown to prevail. (While Trump led Biden by 7 points among registered voters, Brown led Moreno by 5 points.) Brown, who raised $12.8 million in the second quarter and ended June with $10.7 million in the bank, will need to similarly overperform Harris to win another term. Moreno raised $4.4 million and ended the quarter with $4.5 million on hand.
    

            Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen is running for a second term in a state that, on paper, would seem to lean more comfortably blue (Biden carried it by 2 points) than a few others on this list. But the first-term senator, who’s up against Republican Sam Brown, may be in a more vulnerable position than some of her fellow battleground state incumbents in part because of the state’s shifting demographics.
    

            Rosen led Brown 47% to 40% in a Times (UK)/SAY24/YouGov survey released last week. Before that, the most recent poll that met CNN standards – from The New York Times/Siena College in early May – had each Senate candidate at 41%.
    

            Rosen, who raised $7.6 million in the second quarter and spent nearly $4 million more than that, is touting her work to lower prescription drug costs (again without mention of Biden). But she doesn’t have the same established brand as her Montana or Ohio colleagues. She’s trying to tar Brown as a “MAGA extremist” – specifically attacking inconsistencies in his abortion position, which Democrats see as an especially salient issue in the Silver State. Brown, who told NBC News earlier this year that he’d “close the door” on backing a national abortion ban and that he supported Nevada’s law allowing the procedure up to 24 weeks, once backed a more restrictive abortion bill when running for office in Texas. His support for that legislation, and its effect on one woman named Valerie, was the subject of one of Rosen’s first ads against the Army veteran after he won the GOP nomination last month.
    

            Brown, who got a shout-out from Trump during his keynote speech at the Republican convention last week, is focused on the border and the economy, promising to build Trump’s wall and extend his tax cuts. He raised $4.1 million in the second quarter, ending with $3.1 million in the bank to Rosen’s $9.5 million.
    

            While Arizona has looked favorable for Republicans at the presidential level, their liability at the Senate level is their leading candidate. Kari Lake, who lost the 2022 gubernatorial election and continues to make false claims about that defeat and the 2020 election, is all but guaranteed to win the GOP nomination in the August primary to succeed retiring independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema.
    

            Lake would then be up against Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, who significantly overperformed Biden in the Times (UK)/SAY24/YouGov poll conducted after the presidential debate but before the assassination attempt on Trump. While Trump led the president 44% to 37% among registered voters, Gallego led Lake 48% to 41%. Harris may have the ability to do better in a state like Arizona, which Biden barely flipped in 2020, but it remains to be seen how her candidacy will affect the Senate race. Gallego, a Marine veteran, went up on TV early, giving him an advertising advantage that’s been fueled by his strong fundraising. He brought in nearly $10.5 million in the second quarter to Lake’s $4.3 million and started July with $9.2 million in the bank to his opponent’s $2.8 million.
    

            A former member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Gallego is attempting to cut a more moderate profile in this race, with ads that tout his military service, his humble upbringing and his work to lower costs for families. Lake has run ads with the NRSC that feature women talking about their fears of the border and immigrants. But she’s faced concerns from within her own party – including from Trump, according to The Washington Post – that she’s traveling the country too much instead of campaigning in the state she’s trying to win. If Trump does well enough in Arizona, however, he may be able to carry Lake to victory with him.
    

            The race to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow in Michigan – where Republicans haven’t won a Senate race in 30 years – moves up one spot on the ranking this month. That’s largely because it’s an open seat, which is typically harder for the party in power to defend while facing a troubling national environment.
    

            Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who’s all but guaranteed to win next month’s primary, is a strong recruit and fundraiser – she raised $6.5 million in the second quarter and ended June with $9.6 million in the bank. But her comments on a donor call, obtained earlier this month by The New York Times, crystalized the Democratic fears about how the top of the ticket could jeopardize such a crucial battleground race. Slotkin said that Trump was leading in her state and that the Senate race was a toss-up. But Slotkin acknowledged on CNN this week that her race was in a better position without Biden running. In particular, she said “the energy is palpable” for Harris, citing enthusiasm she’d heard from young voters.
    

Polling from the Times (UK)/SAY24/YouGov showed Slotkin holding her own against the likely Republican nominee, former Rep. Mike Rogers – 48% to 39% among registered voters.
    

            Notably, both candidates have national security backgrounds – Slotkin as a former CIA analyst and Rogers as the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Slotkin has made her public service a cornerstone of her campaign and advertising, touting her experience in Democratic and Republican administrations.
    

            With the primary still looming, Rogers’ allies are leaning into his endorsement from Trump. A recent ad from the Great Lakes Conservatives Fund, for example, almost exclusively features the former president praising Rogers. Rogers raised $2.1 million in the second quarter, ending June with $2.5 million banked.
    

            Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, a three-term incumbent with a well-known name in the state, is facing wealthy Republican Dave McCormick – a matchup that both sides are trying to milk for the political contrast that suits them. For Democrats, that means painting McCormick, a onetime hedge fund executive, as a rich guy who regularly flies back to Connecticut, has had business ties to China and opposes abortion rights.
    

            For Republicans, it’s been about portraying Casey as a career politician who answers only to Washington and who is weak on the border. McCormick’s campaign quickly pivoted this week to attacking the “Harris-Casey agenda,” releasing a digital video that splices past footage of Harris and calls her “the most liberal nominee ever.”
    

            Democrats have been trying to counter the border message. For example, one ad from Duty and Honor sounds like it could be a GOP spot, opening with “Fentaynl and crime, they’re coming from our southern border.”
    

            Before Biden dropped out, Casey had been holding his own, even as the numbers for the president – who narrowly carried the state in 2020 – became more precarious. A New York Times/Siena College poll conducted after the presidential debate but before the assassination attempt on Trump found Casey leading McCormick 50% to 42% among likely voters while Biden and Trump were locked in a close race.
    

            Casey raised $8 million in the second quarter, entering July with $8.4 million on hand. McCormick raised $6.7 million, which included $2.1 million in personal loans, ending June with $8 million. But he has plenty more of his own money to spend, as well as a supportive super PAC, and the Senate Leadership Fund recently announced a $24 million investment in the state beginning in September – a sign that Republicans see this as a winnable contest.
    

            Sen. Tammy Baldwin was with Harris in Milwaukee this week for the vice president’s first campaign rally since becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee – a clear sign that down-ballot Democrats feel better about their chances with Harris on top of the ticket.
    

            Biden barely won the Badger State in 2020 after Trump had carried it by a similarly narrow margin four years earlier. Despite those thin margins, Democrats are heartened that Baldwin, a two-term senator with a known statewide brand, will likely be up against Republican Eric Hovde, the favorite in the August primary.
    

            Hovde has made a string of controversial comments that have provided fodder for Democrats as they rush to define him. Baldwin’s campaign has run ads with people responding to a remark he made during a 2012 Senate run that those who are overweight need to pay more for health care and to a more recent comment that most nursing home patients aren’t in a condition to vote.
    

            Hovde, the CEO of Sunwest Bank who bought a house in Laguna Beach, California, after losing the 2012 Senate primary, has responded to Democratic attacks about his out-of-state ties with an ad that showcases where he grew up and went to school in Wisconsin. Hovde ran ads trying to press Baldwin to say whether she thought Biden should step aside, which she did not. After Biden dropped out of the race, Hovde attacked the senator for not taking a firm enough stand, accusing her of being part of a “Biden cover-up.”  (Asked about Biden last week, before his announcement, Baldwin said she was hearing “legitimate and serious concerns” about the president from her constituents and relaying them to the White House and the Biden campaign.) She has also been on the air touting her work to cap insulin prices and crack down on fentanyl.
    

            Pointing to Hovde’s early spending, Daines, the NRSC chairman, said at an RNC event last week that the Wisconsin Republican has closed the gap with his Democratic opponent more than any other GOP challenger. That’s where self-funding comes into play. Hovde’s second-quarter haul was just slightly less than Baldwin’s – $7.3 million to $7.5 million – but his total included a $5 million loan. Baldwin ended June with $7.3 million in the bank, while Hovde had $5.4 million.
    

            Baldwin led Hovde 50% to 43% among registered voters in the Times (UK)/SAY24/YouGov poll. A Marquette Law School poll from mid-June showed the senator up 52% to 47% over Hovde among both registered and likely voters. Notably, however, Hovde was still largely unknown – 44% of registered voters said they hadn’t heard enough about him to form an opinion, which means he likely has room to grow his support.
    

            Angela Alsobrooks shook up the political world this spring when she defeated self-funding Rep. David Trone for the Democratic nomination to succeed retiring Democrat Ben Cardin. She’ll now face Republican former Gov. Larry Hogan, who’s the only reason a seat in a state Biden carried by more than 30 points is even competitive.
    

            While Alsobrooks, the executive of Prince George’s County, doesn’t bring the personal resources that Trone would have, she has proved to be a strong campaigner and has raised significant money. She narrowly outraised Hogan in the second quarter, raking in $5.3 million to his $5.1 million, and ended up with more money in the bank. Alsobrooks’ potential to become the first Black senator from Maryland and just the third Black woman elected to the Senate carries appeal for some voters – especially against a White Republican opponent whom Democrats are attacking on abortion.
    

            Hogan has tried to distance himself from his party – “In the Senate, Republicans can’t count on my vote,” he says in one spot. After winning his primary, he told The New York Times that he’d support federal legislation to codify Roe v. Wade – which Alsobrooks immediately criticized, citing his previous veto of a state law to expand abortion access. Hogan has also tried to disavow his June endorsement from Trump, saying he had “no interest” in it. But Trump’s embrace of the former governor – who has said he isn’t backing the former president – may be a gift for Democrats trying to defend this seat.
    

            Knocking off Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas was going to be a tough proposition for Democrats regardless of whom they nominated for president. Democrats have not won a statewide election in Texas since 1994. Still, Democrats have a strong recruit in Dallas-area Rep. Colin Allred, who first came to the House by unseating a Republican congressman in 2018.
    

            Allred’s campaign pulled in more than Cruz’s principal campaign account in the second quarter, although the senator still ended with more cash on hand. Allred brought in $10.5 million, spent about as much and ended June with around the same amount in the bank. Cruz raised $7.9 million and ended the period with $12.7 million banked.
    

            Despite Texas voting reliably red, polling of the Senate race has shown a close contest – 47% of likely voters backed Cruz and 44% backed Allred in a recent University of Houston/YouGov poll.

CNN_39,Kamala Harris praised ‘defund the police’ movement in June 2020 radio interview,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/kfile-kamala-harris-praised-defund-the-police-movement-in-june-2020/index.html,2024-07-26 18:36:00,politics,"
            Vice President Kamala Harris voiced support for “defund the police” in a radio interview in June 2020 amidst nationwide protests for police reform, just months before denouncing the movement after she had joined the Biden presidential campaign.
    

            Harris said in the June radio interview the movement “rightly” called out the amount of money spent on police departments instead of community services such as education, housing, and healthcare, emphasizing that more police did not equate to more public safety.
    

            “This whole movement is about rightly saying, we need to take a look at these budgets and figure out whether it reflects the right priorities,” Harris said on a New York-based radio program “Ebro in the Morning” on June 9, 2020, adding that US cities were “militarizing police” but “defunding public schools.”

            Harris made her comments just weeks after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer galvanized the “defund” movement among progressive activists. At the time, Harris was six months removed from ending her own presidential campaign and was still two months away from being tapped as Joe Biden’s vice presidential nominee.
    

            In an interview a day earlier, Harris also lauded Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti for his decision to slash $150 million from the police budget and move it into social services.

The latest on the 2024 campaign


            As Harris works to replace Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee following his decision to drop out of the 2024 race, the newly unearthed interview could complicate her strategy of highlighting her history as a tough on crime prosecutor in a potential matchup against Donald Trump, who is facing numerous legal challenges, including multiple felony convictions.


            Before she was elected to the Senate in 2016, Harris spent seven years as the district attorney in San Francisco before serving as California’s attorney general for six years.
    

            In a statement to CNN, Ammar Moussa, Harris for President rapid response director, said, “Whether as a district attorney, attorney general, Senator, or as Vice President, Kamala Harris has led the way to keep our communities safe, take on violent crime, and helped lead the nation to a historic drop in violent crime to a 50-year low.”
    

            After June 2020, Harris rarely if at all mentioned the “defund the police” movement. The Biden campaign later tried to clarify after adding her to the ticket that she supported funding the police.
    

            But in June 2020, Harris argued the “defund” movement was correct to examine police budgets, and also talked about police departments needing to be demilitarized.
    

            “We need to have this conversation and critically examine and understand this is not working,” Harris said on “Ebro in the Morning.” “It’s not working. So, this is an important conversation and not just a conversation – cause to your earlier point, can’t just be about talk. It has to be about forcing change.”
    

            “And this is why, you know, I was out there with folks and we’ll, any movement, any progress we have gained has been because people took to the streets,” Harris added.
    

            A day before her “Ebro in the Morning” radio interview, Harris appeared on MSNBC where she explicitly called to “demilitarize police departments” and said it was “backward” to think more police officers created more safety.
    

            “Part of what we have to do here is also look at the militarization of police departments and, and the kind of money that is going to that. And we need to demilitarize police departments,” Harris said. “At its core, one of the issues that I think we should all agree on is that it is old thinking. It is outdated and is actually wrong and backward to think that more police officers will create more safety.”
    

            In another interview on “The View” on June 8, 2020, Harris engaged in an exchange on defunding the police where she directly suggested the funding for police could be used in other social programs.
    

            “In many cities in America, over one third of their city budget goes to police. So, we have to have this conversation. What are we doing? What about the money going to social services? What about the money going to helping people with job training? What about helping with the mental health issues that communities are being plagued with for which we’re putting no resources?”
    

            Also on June 8, 2020, Harris praised the mayor of Los Angeles for removing money from police and investing it in social services in an interview on “Good Morning America. “
    

            “I applaud Eric Garcetti for doing what he’s done,” she said.
    

            In the same interview, Harris added she didn’t support “getting rid” of police.
    

            “We have to be practical about this,” she said.
    

            At the time “defund the police” became a rallying cry for protestors, with some arguing that police departments should be abolished altogether. Others, like Harris, framed it as a means of questioning spending on police budgets and investing more in areas like education, mental health services, and affordable housing as essential for creating safer communities.
    

            “Defund the police, the issue behind it is that we need to reimagine how we are creating safety,” Harris said in the June 2020 radio interview. “And when you have many cities that have one third of their entire city budget focused on policing, we know that is not the smart way and the best way or the right way to achieve safety.”
    

            “For too long, the status quo thinking has been, you get more safety by putting more cops on the street,” Harris added. “Well, that’s wrong, because by the way, if you wanna look at upper middle class suburban neighborhoods, they don’t have that patrol car.”

            Harris, citing suburban communities, said that true safety comes from well-funded schools, homeownership, thriving small businesses, and access to health services – not increased police presence.
    

            Despite the nationwide movement, polling showed reducing police budgets remained heavily unpopular, even in 2020. A Pew Research poll found that just 25% of adults supported reducing police budgets that year and, by 2021, that support had decreased to 15%, with 47% of adults supporting more police spending.
    

            After Harris was selected as Biden’s running mate in August 2020, the Biden campaign tried to make it clear she opposed defunding the police – and said she supported increasing police funding.
    

            “Joe Biden and Kamala Harris do not support defunding the police, and it is a lie to suggest otherwise,” Sabrina Singh, Harris’ then-press secretary said in October 2020. “Throughout her career, Sen. Harris has supported increasing funding to police departments and boosting funding for community policing.”
    

            According to a POLITICO-Morning Consult poll published in mid-June 2020, almost 60% of registered voters supported major reforms or a complete overhaul to police departments in 2020, but only 29% backed the “defund the police” movement.
    

            Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee at the time of the protests in the summer of 2020,  made clear repeatedly throughout his campaign that he opposed the “defund” movement – saying he supported increasing spending for both police and social services.
    

            In a joint interview on ABC News from August 2020 featuring both Biden and Harris, Biden answered the question on whether the campaign supported the “defund the police” movement.
    

            “I don’t want to defund police departments. I think they need more help. The vast majority of the police – they’re ashamed of what they saw,” Biden said in reference to the Floyd murder. “But you have to take action and it has to be national.”
    

            Harris’ record as a prosecutor was heavily scrutinized during her failed 2020 presidential campaign. Harris was known for her “smart on crime” approach, initiatives like truancy prosecution, and the creation of the “Back on Track” program for first-time drug offenders.
    

            She also defended the death penalty as California attorney general, opposed a statewide ballot measure to legalize marijuana, and pushed for higher bails for certain gun charges as district attorney.

CNN_40,The world’s biggest luxury brands are hurting as Chinese shoppers rein in spending,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/business/lvmh-luxury-firms-china-slowdown/index.html,2024-07-26 18:27:00,us,"
            The value of some of the world’s best-known luxury companies is plunging as Chinese consumers pull back on spending, with even the most exclusive brands feeling the pain.
    

            First-half sales at Bernard Arnault’s luxury powerhouse LVMH, the owner of Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, dropped 10% year over year in Asia excluding Japan, a region dominated by China. The rout seems to be accelerating, with those sales tumbling 14% in the second quarter, according to results published late Tuesday.
    

            Shares in LVMH, whose offerings also include high-end jewelry and luxury hotel stays, dropped 4.7% Wednesday, their biggest one-day decline since October. The stock had pared some of its losses by Friday early afternoon in Paris, but was still 4﻿.4% lower than before the earnings were released.
    

            The numbers from the bellwether of the luxury industry also had a chilling effect on the stock of Prada, which has fallen 3% from its closing level Tuesday. The Hong Kong-listed company is due to report half-year results next week.
    

            “For now, the (luxury) market remains volatile as investors reassess the once-held belief that luxury brands are a safe-haven investment, shielded from broader economic downturns,” Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, told CNN.
    

            Europe’s top 10 luxury companies have lost $250 billion in market value since March, Reuters reported Thursday.

            The decline in LVMH’s fortunes in China chimes with steep falls in sales in the world’s second-biggest economy reported by Richemont, the owner of jeweler Cartier, and German carmarker Porsche.
    

            Richemont, which saw sales crater 27% in China, Hong Kong and Macao in the three months to the end of June compared with a year prior, said a “low level of consumer confidence” was a key reason for the fall. Similarly, Porsche cited in part “weak demand in the luxury segment” in China.
    

            Mercedes-Benz, another maker of luxury cars, also revealed a drop in sales Friday, albeit a smaller one, with revenue in its cars division dipping 4% in the second quarter. “The Chinese market contracted slightly; the market situation in the premium and luxury segment in China remained weak,” the company said.
    

            Meanwhile, Gucci owner Kering said there was “a marked deceleration” in its revenue in China in the first six months of the year and “trends did not improve greatly in North America and Europe.”
    

            However, Hermes bucked the trend. The company known for Birkin handbags — whose prices range from $10,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars — and silk scarves reported sales growth in all countries in the Asia region, from which Hermes excludes Japan, in the first half of 2024.
    

            The earnings reports reflect a striking turnaround in spending by Chinese shoppers, who splurged on premium goods following the lifting of pandemic restrictions, helping boost growth in the luxury sector.
    

            It appears that China’s faltering economy is finally hurting many brands catering to even the most deep-pocketed consumers. The country is grappling with a number of challenges, from sluggish consumer spending and a persistent property slump to a mounting debt crisis in local governments.
    

            China’s economy grew 4.7% year-on-year in the second quarter of the year, according to official data released last week, missing economists’ expectations and marking the weakest growth since the first quarter of 2023.
    

            China’s economic slowdown may not be affecting all shoppers equally but it appears to be curbing ostentatious purchases by the wealthy, in what consultancy Bain & Company has called “luxury shame,” similar to what happened in the United States during the global financial crisis.

CNN_41,French rail lines disrupted by ‘coordinated sabotage’ ahead of Paris Olympics opening ceremony,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/europe/france-rail-network-disruption-paris-olympics-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-26 18:35:00,world,"
            France’s high-speed train lines were targeted by multiple “malicious” acts including arson on Friday, in what has been described as “an attack on France” and “coordinated sabotage” to disrupt travel ahead of the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics.
    

            The French state railway company SNCF called the overnight disruption a “massive attack aimed at paralyzing the high-speed line network.”
    

            In a post on X, SNCF said that “a large number of trains were diverted or canceled,” and asked “all travelers who can to postpone their trip and not go to the station.”
    

            The operator said the Atlantic, Northern and Eastern high-speed lines were impacted, with damage caused to several of its facilities, adding that one of the acts was “foiled” in the east after SNCF agents scared off several individuals.
    

            SNCF CEO Jean-Pierre Farandou told journalists on Friday that cables – which are there to ensure the security of train drivers – were set on fire and taken apart but that authorities “don’t know who is behind it.”
    

            An intelligence source told CNN that French intelligence services are “fully mobilized” to find those responsible. The source added that “these methods have been used by the far-left in the past” but “there is no evidence to tie today’s actions to them.”
    

            Travel on the affected lines is “very disrupted,” with the railway network needing to divert and cancel a large number of trains, SNCF said. Disruptions – which it estimates could impact around 250,000 travelers today – were expected throughout the weekend, affecting 800,000 passengers, as work crews oversee repairs, it added.

Olympics opening ceremony set to go ahead in Paris despite attacks on French railways


            Passengers milled around outside Paris’ Gare du Nord train station and sat with their luggage on staircases as the disruption laid waste to their travel plans. Francoise, an 80-year-old from La Rochelle, is trying to get home and back to her nurse after medical treatment in Paris. She told CNN she is preparing to wait another five hours in the forlorn hope of catching a train. “We didn’t need a day like this!” she said.
    

            Meanwhile, Raphaël, a SNCF user who has been waiting for his train at Montparnasse Station in the capital since 6 a.m. local time, told CNN affiliate BFMTV that “people are a little exasperated.”
    

            The Rémi Train Centre Val de Loire said travel on its railway lines would be disrupted until at least Monday, with a fire near the tracks in Courtalain, northern France impacting services to Paris.
    

            Farandou explained that they have to pull the damaged cables back together one by one, reconnect and test them. “It’s a question of security,” he said. “We have to make sure we test them so when trains are back up and running, they are safe.”
    

            Brittany, a region in the northwest France, and the north of the country are the most impacted areas, SNCF said, though some trains have started running again, notably in eastern France. There would be no trains from Paris’ Gare Montparnasse, however, until at least 1 p.m. local time, Christophe Fanichet – the CEO of SNCF Voyageurs – told reporters.
    

            Eurostar, the high-speed train service that connects the United Kingdom with France, has been forced to cancel and divert trains due to the “coordinated acts of malice,” on French lines.
    

            In a statement to CNN, Eurostar said that the incidents have impacted travel between Paris and Lille, forcing the train network to cancel and divert journeys, and extend travel times.
    

            These incidents come just hours before the Olympic torch relay concludes and the opening ceremony begins, with more than 320,000 spectators expected to attend along the River Seine. The opening ceremony will go ahead as planned, a Paris 2024 spokesperson told CNN, and organizers have “no concerns from their side in light of the overnight events on the train network.”
    

            The French Minister of Sports and the Olympic and Paralympic Games, Amélie Oudéa-Castera said the disruption to the train lines are “a sort of coordinated sabotage.”
    

            Speaking BFMTV, Oudéa-Castera condemned the attacks in the “strongest possible terms,” and said it is “truly appalling.”
    

            “We will assess the impacts on travelers, athletes, and ensure the proper transport of all delegations to the competition sites,” she said.
    

            Other French officials echoed her description of the attacks being intentional. Outgoing French transport minister Patrice Vergriete and Valerie Pecresse, head of the Île-de-France region, in which Paris lies, said on Friday that “all elements” pointed towards it being a “deliberate attack.” Vergriete added those elements were “the coincidental timing, the vans found after the people had fled (and) the arson materials found on location.”

The Olympic Games face a unique set of potential security threats in Paris. Organizers say everyone will be safe


            Outgoing French prime minister Gabriel Attal said in a post on X that the consequences are “massive and serious” while SNCF called the disruption an “attack on France.”
    

            In response to the attacks, Paris police chief Laurent Nunez said Friday that police are stepping up security and focusing manpower on the capital’s train stations.
    

            Security in Paris had already been bolstered in recent weeks.
    

            France plans to deploy around 35,000 police each day during the Games, peaking at 45,000 for the opening ceremony, a spokesperson at the French interior ministry previously told CNN. In addition, 10,000 soldiers will be deployed in the Paris region – an effort supported by 1,800 police officers from around the world, they added.
    

            Nicolas Nordman, Deputy Paris Mayor in charge of security, recently told CNN that authorities had been working for months to try to anticipate what might happen and were confident the ceremony would be safe.
    

            The cause of the disruptions is currently unclear. But there has been growing domestic unrest, powered in part by recent national elections that saw a battle between the left and far-right.
    

            Interior Minister Darmanin confirmed security forces had detained a “member of the extreme-right” this week who was “suspected of wanting to commit violent action during the Olympic Games.” According to Darmanin, the man had an “intention to intervene during a phase of the torch relay.”

CNN_42,She couldn’t stop thinking about the guy she met at the Athens Olympics. Then a message from him changed her life,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/chance-encounters-olympics-athens-2004-romance/index.html,2024-07-26 18:10:00,world,"
            Omaira Gill grew up counting down the days to each Olympic Games.
    

            “It was a big deal in our house,” Omaira tells CNN Travel today. “I remember watching with my parents and I used to always think, ‘I’m going to go one day. I’d love to go to the Olympics.’”
    

            Omaira wasn’t especially sporty, so she ruled out the prospect of competing pretty early on. But she still harbored Olympic dreams – even just spectating would do.
    

            In 2004, the year Omaira turned 22, the Olympics were set to return to their birthplace of Athens, Greece.
    

            Omaira grew up near Birmingham, in the United Kingdom. Athens was a little less than four hours away by airplane.
    

            “I thought, ‘Okay, Athens, that’s the closest it’s ever come to me in my lifetime,’” recalls Omaira. “I didn’t know then that eventually the Olympics would come to London as well. So I thought, ‘Let me see if I can go to the Athens Olympics. I’ll see if there’s tickets for gymnastics or something like that. Maybe I could go to the opening ceremony…’”
    

            Several months before the start of the games, Omaira was finishing up her journalism degree and staying at her parents’ home for the holidays. Noodling around on the family computer, Omaira spent hours researching the logistics of attending the games.
    

            Eventually, she found herself on the official Athens 2004 website.
    

            “In the corner of the site there was this little banner saying, ‘Volunteers,’” recalls Omaira. “And I thought, ‘Well, that’s even better. Because that puts you inside the Olympics. And you get the full experience of the Olympic Games. That would be amazing.’”
    

            Omaira signed up right away, registering interest in the media village – the obvious choice for a journalism student.
    

            “And then a couple of months passed. Uni finished. This, that and the other happened…And I still heard nothing back from my application.”
    

            Summer rolled around. The opening ceremony was imminent. There was still nothing in Omaira’s inbox from the Athens volunteer team. She was starting to think her Olympic dream wasn’t meant to be.
    

            “And then out of the blue one morning, I got a phone call saying, ‘Are you still interested in volunteering at the Olympics?’”
    

            The speaker barely finished their sentence before Omaira confirmed that yes, she was definitely still interested.
    

            “Would you mind if it’s the shooting center and not the media village, like you requested?” asked the voice on the other end.
    

            Omaira didn’t even hesitate.
    

            “I don’t care,” she said. “I’d just love to be there.”
    

            The unknown speaker told Omaira the job was hers – as long as she could make the necessary travel arrangements, and find somewhere to stay for the duration of the Games.
    

            “I think he also gave me a really basic rough outline of where I would need to be for initial training, and where to pick up my uniform,” says Omaira. “Then I hung up and started screaming. My dad was like, ‘What’s happened? What’s the matter with you?’”
    

            As luck would have it, Omaira had a friend from college who lived in Athens, who offered her a room for the duration of the Games. Within days, Omaira was on a flight to Greece.
    

            From the moment Omaira landed in Athens, everything was a whirlwind. She was invited to watch the final dress rehearsal of the opening ceremony. Omaira teared up as she watched the opening countdown, in giddy disbelief that she’d finally made it to the Games.
    

            And then Omaira was off to work at the shooting center, where the Games’ shooting events were held.
    

            “My very first day at work – well, first day of training, let’s say – I was late,” she recalls. “The shooting center was way out in the sticks, around the area where the airport is. I took the train, and later worked out that the bus was actually a lot faster.”
    

            Omaira, along with a few other latecomers, eventually arrived that first day embarrassed and flustered. Omaira tried to apologize, but her words were batted away by the guy heading up the shooting center.
    

            “These things happen,” he said.
    

            Instead of berating them for tardiness, the shooting center manager suggested the volunteers reconvene that evening in the city center, for a city tour and a few drinks.
    

            “So then we turn up at Syntagma Square (Athens’ main public square) that evening. And we were all kind of more fresh, more relaxed,”  recalls Omaira.
    

        I used to always think, ‘I’m going to go one day. I’d love to go to the Olympics.’
    

            Omaira Gill
        

            The shooting center manager arrived last. He smiled and waved as he approached the rest of the group.
    

            “And that’s what I noticed,” recalls Omaira. “I was like, ‘Oh, he’s quite good-looking. He’s quite cute.’”
    

            She also learned his name: Dimitris Athanasiou. Early thirties. Born and raised in Athens. Warm, friendly, welcoming. Omaira liked him right away.
    

            “But I didn’t make anything of it,” says Omaira. “Because I thought, ‘Okay, you’re young, free and single. It’s great. It’s summertime. Just enjoy your time here.’”
    

            Later that evening, Omaira found herself seated at one end of a long table filled with excited Olympics volunteers. Dimitris was at the other end.
    

            “He kind of waved, saying, ‘Come sit over here,’” recalls Omaira. “And I would have never done that normally, but I got up and sat next to him.”
    

            Right away, Omaira found Dimitris easy and fun company.
    

            “I just remember thinking, ‘Wow, he’s really interesting to talk to,’” she says. “I was quite a sheltered person growing up. I was raised Muslim, my family is modern, but they’re still quite conservative about things like dating and stuff like that. So I didn’t really talk so much to guys. But I found Dimitris really interesting to have conversations with.”
    

            Over the course of the Athens Olympics, Omaira worked in spectator services at the shooting center, checking tickets, pointing Olympic visitors toward the bathrooms. She loved soaking up their excitement and enjoyed the insight into the Olympics’ behind the scenes. But she also spent a lot of time thinking about Dimitris.
    

            “I would live for those two minutes when he would come and change my shift,” she recalls. “I’d be like, ‘What time is it? What time is it? Have three hours passed yet? When is he coming?’” And then I’d see him walking towards me and I’d be like, ‘Act normal, try and act normal.’”
    

            Omaira and Dimitris always exchanged a few friendly words. But the conversations were brief. Dimitris was busy heading up the volunteers, and Omaira was busy working.
    

            “We spent no time together, really,” Omaira says. “I don’t know why we clicked.”

            As Omaira got to know Dimitris, she learned he didn’t grow up with the same reverence for the Olympics as she had. He told her he saw the Games more as a “good job opportunity” than anything else.
    

            But Dimitris was happy to see Athens abuzz with activity. And he enjoyed sharing his city with the shooting center volunteers – he took the group out most nights, guiding them around his favorite Athenian spots.
    

            “It was exciting knowing that the games were in Athens,” Dimitris tells CNN Travel today. “The public was a little split about the cost of hosting the Games, and as we know, they eventually were a big factor in how much debt the country got into. But at the time they kicked off, people were excited. It felt like a chance to present modern Greece to the world.”
    

            Dimitris’ official job title was Markopoulo Olympic Shooting Centre venue manager. Early on, he realized shooting hadn’t attracted the same numbers of volunteers as some of the other Olympic sports. In a quest to increase headcount, Dimitris ended up going through the other centers’ applications. He discovered Omaira’s application right at the end of this process. It was Dimitris who’d called her that day earlier in summer 2004, to ask if she was still interested in volunteering. Omaira was the last person he recruited.
    

            Once he’d gathered his shooting center group together, Dimtiris was determined “to make sure they had fun.” Sure, they needed to work hard – but this was also a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and Dimitris encouraged the volunteers to make the most of it.
    

            That’s why he was lenient when Omaira and some of the others were late that first day – and why he suggested going out later that evening.
    

            He enjoyed getting to know all the volunteers – who hailed from across the world and ranged in age. Everyone seemed fun and friendly. But Omaira stood out.
    

            “I do remember walking up to the fountain in Syntagma Square, where they were all waiting that first night and thinking she was cute,” Dimitris recalls.
    

            Dimitris liked speaking with Omaira that first evening. And he enjoyed their brief workday interactions, and looked forward to their friendly chats on nights out. But while Omaira was cultivating a pretty heady crush, Dimitris didn’t really have time to engage with his potential feelings.
    

            “I thought she was pretty,” he says. “But I was so busy I didn’t really have time to pay much attention.”
    

            Working the Olympics was “busy and exciting,” Dimitris recalls, unlike anything he’d done before. And as well as working constantly, Dimitris was also hosting several of the volunteers at his apartment. Plus, the shooting center gang were regularly going out until the early hours of the morning.
    

            On the final night, the group went out together for the last time. As they weaved in and out of bars, walking through the cobbled Athens streets, Omaira and Dimitris ended up side by side.
    

            They were chatting, flirting. Omaira talked about how much she liked Greece, Dimitris quizzed her on whether she enjoyed camping, and asked about her thoughts on dogs.
    

            “Okay,” he concluded. “Will you marry me then?”
    

            “Yeah, okay,” said Omaira, laughing.
    

            She’d bought a “tacky, souvenir ring” during her time in Athens. Now, Omaira pulled it off her finger and handed it to Dimitris.
    

            “If you’re going to propose to me, you have to do it properly, with the ring,” she said.
    

            “Okay, will you marry me, with this ring?” he said, laughing and holding out the ring.
    

            “Sure,” said Omaira. And Dimitris slipped the ring onto her wedding finger.
    

            It was just a light-hearted conversation. But to Omaira, the words felt charged.
    

            “That evening, as we were parting ways, I kept thinking, ‘I should say something to him. I really like this guy. I should say something because I’m leaving the next day and I have literally nothing to lose right now. If he says no, I’m never going to see him again…’” she recalls.
    

            But Omaira couldn’t bring herself to speak her feelings aloud.
    

            “So I didn’t say anything. And I returned back to the UK.”
    

            As for Dimitris, he was moving straight from working the Olympic Games to working the Paralympic Games. He didn’t really have time to fully register how he felt about Omaira leaving.
    

            But as they said their goodbyes, Dimitris found himself thinking about the previous night’s marriage conversation.
    

            “I remember looking at her and thinking ‘I could really marry her,’” he says. “I’d never felt that before.”
    

            When Omaira landed back in the UK, her mother picked her up at the airport. Omaira got into the car passenger seat and her mother looked at her, narrowing her eyes.
    

            “You’ve met someone,” she said.
    

            “No, don’t be ridiculous,” said Omaira.
    

            Her mother just raised her eyebrows in response.
    

            “She clocked on straight away,” says Omaira today. “She knew.”
    

            A couple days later, Omaira caved, and confided in her mother about Dimitris.
    

            “You’re right,” she said. “I did meet someone. I want to go back to Athens, I have to find out how he feels about me.”
    

            Omaira’s mother was sympathetic, but practical.
    

            “You can’t do that,” she said. “You don’t know this person.”
    

            So instead of jumping on another flight, Omaira resorted to keeping in touch with Dimitiris over MSN Messenger. Social media was in its infancy back in 2004, but instant messaging had taken off. It was an easy way of communicating with people across the world.
    

            Still, Omaira also went old school – she handwrote Dimitris a letter from the UK, enclosing a photo of the two of them – both grinning into the camera lens, arms around each other. The picture was taken the night they met, on the first evening in Athens.
    

            A few friends commented that Omaira and Dimitris looked like a couple in the picture. One of the other Olympics volunteers scrutinized the picture, and then asked Omaira if anything happened between her and Dimitris.
    

            Nothing happened, replied Omaira, truthfully. Because nothing actually had happened. It was all what ifs, should haves, could haves.
    

            Then one evening, Omaira was chatting with Dimitris on instant messenger. They both sat at desktop computers, typing messages back and forth.
    

            “How are you doing?” asked Omaira.
    

            “I’m a bit sad today,” wrote Dimitris.
    

            “What’s up?” asked Omaira.
    

            Dimitris’ reply made Omaira pause, her heart beating fast:
    

            “I’m missing someone.”
    

            “Who are you missing?” Omaira wrote back.
    

            “You,” said Dimitris.
    

            After that, their messages became more frequent. Omaira and Dimitris started chatting on the phone. They talked about their feelings for each other, and wondered aloud if they could make it work.

            After a few months of regular instant messaging and phone calls, Dimitris came to visit Omaira in the UK for a few days in October 2004.
    

            By then, Omaira had left her parents’ house and moved south to London to pursue a journalism masters degree.
    

            In the lead up to his visit, Omaira practiced her favorite recipes, with the idea she’d impress Dimitris with her cooking skills.
    

            “But then just before he arrived, I came down with this horrible cold – so he ended up cooking for me – and he cooks really well,” says Omaira. “So eating this food I was like, ‘Okay, now what? I played my ace and his cooking is better than mine. So that’s not going to work.’”
    

            But Omaira didn’t need to worry about impressing Dimitris with elaborate meals. It was clear he liked her. They spent a happy few days in each others’ company, and Dimitris went back to Greece hoping to see Omaira again soon.
    

            “I didn’t know what role I would play in her life but I hoped it would be a good one,” he says.
    

            Then, a month or so later, Omaira flew to Athens to visit Dimitris. Even though the London visit had gone well, she was still nervous. Her friends and family were a little skeptical about the relationship’s longevity.
    

            “I remember my housemates were like, ‘Oh my god,’” says Omaira. “And I broke out in spots, I was so anxious about it.”
    

            But on the plane over to Athens, Omaira told herself: “Even if it turns out to be a total disaster, go out in a blaze of glory, have this adventure – you keep saying nothing interesting happens in your life. So go for it.”
    

            And as soon as Omaira reunited with Dimitris, the nerves vanished. The ease and comfort she’d felt during his London visit returned.
    

            “He was very kind and reassuring and I just felt that same sense of ‘This is really familiar and very comfortable,’” she recalls.
    

            Dimitris was excited to host Omaira in Greece.
    

            “By then we’d built a strong emotional connection talking every day on the phone, so I felt close to her,” he says.
    

            From there, Omaira and Dimitris committed to a long distance relationship, traveling back and forth between the UK and Greece to visit one another. In between, they spoke on the phone, sent emails and instant messages – and Omaira wrote Dimitris handwritten letters, which she sprayed with her perfume.
    

            Dimitris looked forward to her mail.
    

            “Omaira has a strong creative streak, she pours herself into any task and the letters were like that too,” he says. “She took a lot of care in all of the process.”
    

            While letter writing wasn’t Dimitris’ thing, he did mail Omaira a copy of his favorite book, “The Alchemist” by Paulo Coelho.
    

            “When I read that book it struck me that sometimes the thing you searched the world over for was always right in front of you,” says Dimitris.
    

            Sharing the novel with Omaira felt important.
    

            Omaira and Dimitris also got to know one another’s loved ones on their respective trips to the UK and Athens.
    

            “I began to introduce her to my closest friends, and they all remember this because I would tell them ‘There’s someone I want you to meet. It’s serious, tell me what you think’ as they’re great judges of character,” recalls Dimitris. “They all adored her straight away.”
    

            In between trips they missed one another, but both Dimitris and Omaira felt it was important for them not to rush their romance. Dimitris was especially conscious of this, given he was a little older than Omaira.
    

            “I missed her, but I also knew that I would be taking something away from her if I moved things too fast,” he says. “Omaira has said when she met me she felt like she was at a crossroads trying to figure out where to go next. I wanted her to figure that out on her own with her own time and space, her own job, social circle etc. I didn’t want to push those decisions for her.”
    

            Cut to 2006. Omaira finished her journalism postgraduate studies and started working in a bank – not her dream job, but a job that paid the bills. She was moving into the next stage of her life, and so she started looking into the logistics of moving to Greece to be with Dimitris. He was excited to welcome her to Athens.
    

            “Six months before I actually moved, I started Greek lessons in London, just so I’d have a language base when I moved,” Omaira recalls. “My bank let me keep my job remotely, so I was one of the remote working pioneers.”
    

            From there, Omaira and Dimitris settled into life in Athens together, making regular trips back to the UK to see Omaira’s friends and family.
    

            It was on one of these UK visits that Dimitris proposed. Omaira jokes that it wasn’t the most romantic moment – they were barbecuing in her parents’ garden and she had “smoke in my hair, grease all over me.” But she was delighted to take this next step.
    

            Omaira and Dimitris got married in Athens on the hottest day of 2009.
    

            “We did the ceremony in the morning at the mayor’s office with lots of friends and family. And then in the evening, we did a beach party with our nearest and dearest friends – so less than 50 people. The beach party was really nice, super casual,” says Omaira.
    

            Omaira designed her wedding dress herself. Her father is from Pakistan, and her mother is from India, and she wanted to wear something that nodded to traditional dress, wasn’t too heavy in the heat, and felt true to her.
    

            “She looked so beautiful,” says Dimitris. “Neither of us felt nervous on our wedding day. It felt like a new chapter in what we had already started together.”
    

            Omaira and Dimitris welcomed their first child, Hermes, in 2011. They were over the moon, but parenthood wasn’t without its challenges. At just over a year old, Hermes was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a muscle degenerative disease. People with Duchenne usually don’t live past their 30s.
    

            “We were in shock,” says Omaira.
    

            But she and Dimitris were determined their son would enjoy a full, fulfilling life – and Hermes’ diagnosis lit a fire in them both.
    

            “I’d studied journalism, but I ended up working in financial marketing,” says Omaira. “I decided, ‘Okay, I’m going to work on journalism really aggressively now. Because I have to prove to my son that if you really want something, you can get it, you just have to work hard. I can’t just tell him, I have to prove it to him – be the living example.”
    

            Omaira left her fulltime job and started working as a freelance journalist, writing about politics, culture and her personal experiences.
    

            “I’m very proud of her,” says Dimitiris, who has since become a Duchenne patient advocate.
    

            As Omaira and Dimitiris came to terms with their son’s diagnosis, they only felt more solid in their certainty in each other.
    

            “It’s a tough thing,” says Omaira. “But we picked the right person to go through it with.”
    

            This feeling was compounded when the couple went through two miscarriages.
    

            Omaira and Dimitris now have three children, with their sons Hector and Orion rounding out the family.
    

            Dimitris calls fatherhood, “the greatest feeling in the world.”
    

            “They are the best pieces of Omaira so they are very precious to me,” he says of his children.
    

            The couple are raising their kids speaking a mix of Greek and English, and highlighting Greek, British, Indian and Pakistani traditions.
    

            “The kids have been very aware of both halves of where they come from,” says Omaira.
    

            When they started raising their children, Omaira and Dimitris also realized the similarities between their respective cultural backgrounds – they’d both been raised with an emphasis on community and family.
    

            “And accepting that family is going to interfere in your business,” says Omaira, laughing.

            This year marks 20 years since Omaira and Dimitris crossed paths at the Athens Olympics. As someone who grew up loving the Olympic Games, it’s special to Omaira that her life is now forever entwined with the Games.
    

            “I get very sentimental every time the Olympics roll around, because I’m like, ‘That’s where we met,’” says Omaira. “Every time I watch the Greece Olympic opening ceremony, I will always cry because I remember how nice it felt to be there. It’s where our story started.”
    

            “The Olympics have a special place in my heart,” agrees Dimitris. “They’re the reason we met and why I have the family I have today.”
    

            It seems appropriate, says Omaira, that there are five Olympic rings and she and Dimitris and their sons are a family of five.
    

            “Although sometimes I joke with Dimtiris, ‘You gave me one ring. I need four more, because there’s five Olympic rings.’”
    

        I get very sentimental every time the Olympics roll around, because I’m like, ‘That’s where we met.’ Every time I watch the Greece Olympic opening ceremony, I will always cry because I remember how nice it felt to be there. It’s where our story started.

            Omaira and Dimitris excited to watch this year’s opening ceremony in Paris. And coincidentally, they’ll be in the city during the Games – although not at the Stade de France. Omaira, Dimitris and their kids will be at Disneyland Paris, Paris’ Disney theme park, with the Make-A-Wish Foundation, which facilitates memorable moments for children living with incurable illnesses.
    

            “Hermes asked for a trip to Disney,” says Omaira. “So it just so happens we’ll be in Paris during the Olympics.”
    

            Twenty years after her volunteer experience, Omaira is still an advocate for the Olympic volunteer program – and always encourages people to sign up.
    

            “It was spectacular,” she says. “I still have friends from volunteering. We’re still in touch, spread around Europe –  spread around here, there and everywhere. It was wonderful, because it was really what I wanted, which was to experience the Olympics, from the inside.”
    

            And of course, volunteering led Omaira to Dimitris – and to a marriage of 15 years and counting.
    

            “It’s by no means a perfect marriage, but if I was to say a final word to someone reading this, it would be, in addition to my other comments to you, that there are times when you are madly in love and there are times when you wake up and choose to love that person, because things are hard,” says Omaira.
    

            “You can experience multiple shades of a relationship with the same person. And also, go forth and volunteer, kids, you never know what might happen.”

CNN_43,Eliud Kipchoge: The two-hour marathon man has unprecedented Olympic glory at his feet,https://edition.cnn.com/sport/eliud-kipchoge-profile-paris-olympics-spc/index.html,2024-07-26 18:23:00,world,"
    Editor’s Note: Editor’s Note: This story is also part of an interactive article about Kenya’s distance running superstars.


            It’s 5:55am on a wet May morning in northern Kenya. The sun is yet to rise, but a group of runners emerge from a mud path onto the side of a road. They briefly pause, each tightening laces or adjusting a watch; then, without warning, the group sets off into the darkness at a blistering pace. Soon all evidence of them has disappeared, save for their shoe prints in the dirt.
    

            This is what Olympic preparation looks like for arguably the greatest distance runner of all time, Eliud Kipchoge.
    

            The run concludes 30 kilometers later, back where it began, at the training camp where the 39-year-old is gearing up for what could be his final bow on the Olympic stage. Kipchoge stands, once again, on the precipice of history, aiming to be the first person to secure three gold medals in one of the most iconic Olympic disciplines, the marathon.
    

            The training camp set up by Kipchoge and his management team Global Sports Communication feels more to the tastes of Rocky Balboa than Ivan Drago. There are few modern comforts and little more than a small TV room and the company of their fellow athletes to keep the residents occupied.
    

            “Discipline is sacrificial of personal pleasures,” Kipchoge tells CNN, reflecting on the daily routine that has shaped his adult life. “I always wake up at 5:45 in the morning, for the last 22 years, and that’s what discipline has meant to my mind.”
    

            Perhaps the biggest sacrifice for Kipchoge is time spent away from his wife Grace and their three children when he’s in camp. “It’s really difficult, but all in all, Grace has adapted well … my family and kids are the reason I wake up in the morning, without them I would be a much lesser person,” Kipchoge told NNRunningTeam.com in a 2022 interview.
    

            Kipchoge’s commitment and daily acts of discipline have been the bedrock of his success, building a mental strength that he believes is paramount in the marathon. “The mind is what drives the body,” he asserts. “If the driver is lazy and if the driver doesn’t have enough energy to drive you, then you cannot go anywhere.”
    

            Kipchoge racks up around 200-220 kilometers in training every week. His schedule features track and road sessions, alongside a group of elite training partners, all under the watchful eye of his long-time coach, Patrick Sang.
    

            The intense routine is fueled by a diet of traditional Kenyan food, including the fabled ugali,  a carbohydrate made from maize flour and water.

            For Kipchoge, recovery is just as crucial as training. “After a long run, I sometimes take an ice bath, then just relax for another two-and-a-half hours, have a massage, lunch, and an afternoon sleep,” he explains. With so much riding on Paris, life here has been stripped back to the basics.
    

            Middle distance superstar Faith Kipyegon has trained alongside Kipchoge since 2019. “To be alongside Eliud every day and hearing what he’s saying about motivation and about the hard work we always put in, early in the morning, and going for a run together and just enjoying sport together, I think it has really changed my mind set and changed my goals,” she says.
    

            Eliud Kipchoge is no stranger to rewriting history. In 2019, in Vienna, he shattered one of the most formidable barriers in sports by becoming the first person to run a marathon in under two hours. “Breaking the two-hour (mark) was great for me, in making history and telling the world that we are not limited at all in any barrier, in any profession.”
    

            This achievement was a group effort, reflecting Kipchoge’s philosophy that running, traditionally seen as an individual sport, thrives on teamwork. “We had a great team in Vienna, from the technical team to athletes, coaches, and performance staff,” he says. “We bring our minds together, we think together, and we make history together.”
    

            With the Games upon us, Kipchoge remains laser-focused on clinching his third consecutive gold medal in the marathon. “My goal is to win for the third time. My goal is still to run and inspire the next generation,” he says. This pursuit is not just about personal achievement but about demonstrating the power of longevity and dedication in sports.
    

            For Kipchoge, the Olympics are also a platform for showcasing Kenyan excellence and promoting the country’s image globally. “Olympics is the soft spot to meet world leaders in sport and politics, and to sell our country,” he says, highlighting the broader impact of his participation. “This is the soft power, for us to tell people what’s inside Kenya.”
    

            Historically, Kipchoge says, not enough has been done to leverage the positive image that Kenyan athletes are projecting around the globe. “After huge success in the Olympics, I think it’s high time for politicians to use the platform for development, to sell the country.”
    

            After weeks of protests in the country, and with political and social tensions escalating, the Olympics could arrive at a crucial moment for Kenya, leveraging the unique power of sport to unite the nation.
    

            Eliud Kipchoge’s influence extends far beyond his sporting accolades. A deep thinker, he has addressed the Oxford Union, met with presidents and worked tirelessly to develop his foundation, which aims to give more children across the world access to education. His story is one of breaking boundaries, rewriting what we thought humanly possible.
    

            Like many athletes coming towards the end of a glittering career, the question of how he will be remembered isn’t far from Kipchoge’s mind. His legacy, built on the foundations of discipline, teamwork and an unyielding pursuit of excellence, promises to endure long after he hangs up his running shoes. “I want to be remembered by making this world a running world,” he says. And through his unparalleled achievements, irrespective of the result in Paris, Eliud Kipchoge is well on his way to doing just that.

CNN_44,Faith Kipyegon on motherhood and the quest for history,https://edition.cnn.com/sport/faith-kipyegon-motherhood-paris-olympics-spc/index.html,2024-07-26 18:22:00,world,"
    Editor’s Note: This story is also part of an interactive article about Kenya’s distance running superstars.


            In northern Kenya, under a sunny May sky that offers a rare respite during the worst rainy season in recent memory, Faith Kipyegon pursues a singular goal: “It’s history I’m looking for,” she says.
    

            But for the 30-year-old middle distance superstar, success is no longer simply measured in medals and records; it’s also about the profound journey of motherhood and her status as one of track and field’s greatest role models.
    

            Having won a gold medal in the 1,500m at the 2016 Rio Olympics, Kipyegon’s return to the pinnacle of athletics after the birth of her daughter, Alyn, in 2018, has been nothing short of spectacular. Training in Kaptagat, a highland haven for elite athletes, alongside marathon legend Eliud Kipchoge, she prepares for the Paris Olympics with unwavering focus. Yet her daily grind is enriched and challenged by the joys and responsibilities of motherhood.
    

            “She changed my life and my mentality,” Kipyegon says of her daughter. “I now realize that I have someone who looks up to me as a role model.” This shift in perspective has fueled her drive, leading her to another Olympic gold, at the 2020 Tokyo Games, and three world titles.

            In 2023, Kipyegon cemented her legacy as one of the greatest middle-distance runners of all time, breaking three world records across three different distances (1,500m, 1 mile, 5,000m) in less than two months — all while raising her daughter.
    

            Kipyegon and a string of top athletes are continuing to prove that elite sport and motherhood are not incompatible. “[Jamaican sprinter] Shelly Ann Fraser Pryce came back after maternity leave, and [US runner] Allison Felix, and we met in Tokyo at the 2021 Olympic Games,” she recalls.
    

            At those Games, Felix won a gold and a bronze and Fraser-Pryce won silver to become the most decorated 100m sprinter in Olympic history. “I think we motivate young women to know that you can go on maternity leave and come back stronger than before,” Kipyegon suggests. “They realize that it’s not the end of your life, but it can be the beginning of your life.”
    

            Training with Kipchoge, a mentor and friend, has given Kipyegon a new perspective on running and pushed her to new heights, “I don’t know how to express it, he’s just a unique athlete,” Kipyegon says.
    

            “I have grown as an elite athlete and as a person. To be alongside Eliud all of the time and to hear what he’s saying about motivation and about hard work … I think it has really changed my mindset and changed my goals,” she says.
    

            Having spent much of the 2024 season recovering from a soft tissue injury, Kipyegon returned to action at the Kenyan Olympic trials in June, winning both the 1,500m and 5,000m races. She followed that up on July 7 at a Diamond League meet in Paris with a performance that defied belief, breaking her own 1,500m world record with a time of 3:49.04 (she remains the only woman to have run below 3:50).
    

            “Everybody expects you to perform well and to be on top of the world,” she says, reflecting on whether she’s feeling any pressure to defend her Olympic title. “It’s a big event and everybody’s dreaming of getting that gold medal — well Faith is also dreaming of getting that gold medal.”
    

            Kipyegon’s story is not just about athletic prowess; it is a testament to resilience and inspiration. The eighth of nine children, she grew up in the rural village of Ndabibit, in western Kenya, walking and jogging several miles to and from school each day.
    

            She shot to prominence in 2011, aged 17, when she won the World Junior Cross Country Championships, running barefoot. Those beginnings laid the foundation for her view that true success stems from within. “It’s mentality, the hard work you put in and being patient, I think that drive the success of an elite athlete,” she says.
    

            As she gears up for Paris, Kipyegon is acutely aware of the significance of her quest to win a third consecutive gold in one event, a feat only a handful of athletes in any sport have achieved. “Going to Paris and remembering the history I’ve talked about and getting that gold medal, it’ll be a huge history for me,” she says.
    

            Kipyegon carries with her the hopes of a nation famed for its running stars, and the legacy of countless runners who have paved the way. “I am always proud to represent Kenya,” she says. “It’s heritage, the many athletes we have from around our country … To wear the Kenya singlet, it’s really beautiful and magical.”
    

            With the Olympic Games upon us, Kipyegon stands poised to etch her name in the annals of sports history. Her journey from a young girl running barefoot to an Olympic champion is proof that with resilience, dedication and a bit of Faith, anything is possible.

CNN_46,The USWNT kicks off in France as a team in transition – and one that’s looking to make a point,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/sport/uswnt-team-in-transition/index.html,2024-07-26 18:18:00,world,"
            As the US Women’s National Team made attack after attack last week in Washington, DC, the final pass was just a little bit off the mark or the decisive shot was just fired a few inches wide.
    

The USWNT’s scoreless draw against Costa Rica in their final game before heading to France for the 2024 Summer Games was as frustrating as the nation’s capital was hot that night with the thermometer reading 97 degrees at kickoff. But it also made for a neat encapsulation of the task ahead of head coach Emma Hayes and her squad during these Paris Games.


            The old reliable stars of the team’s golden generation are largely gone. And this will be the competition where new ones will have to be made – or a streak of disappointing major tournaments will go on for another frustrating few years.
    

            “We want to make this environment comfortable, but also know, you know, what the standard is – you’re here for a reason,” said Lindsey Horan, the midfielder who serves as the team’s captain. “Any new player coming in, that means you’re one of the best in the country and you have every right to be here. So, the nerves and all those things, they’re normal. That means this means something and you’re playing on one of the best teams in the world. And we want to get back to being the best in the world.”
    

            “So, we need those players. And like I said before, we have a lot of new players and new players that make up you know, the starting spots on this roster so we’re gonna need them to be great, be confident, and you know, everyone that’s come in so far – new players, young players, too – the confidence is outstanding.”
    

            For young stars like Sophia Smith and Trinity Rodman entering their first Olympics, and four other players playing in their first major tournament for the US national team, it’s the first major test in what they hope will be a long career in the red, white and blue. Other veterans like Rose Lavelle and Alyssa Naeher will be looking to redeem themselves from disappointing showings in Tokyo and Australia and New Zealand, where the US suffered its earliest-ever defeat in the World Cup.
    

            The USWNT defeated Zambia 3-0 in their first game Thursday in Nice, France.
    

            When she set the roster, Hayes acknowledged the surprising decision to not bring Alex Morgan to France, picking players who she felt adapt to her style and could play in the tight turnarounds that Olympic competition requires.
    

            It was arguably Hayes’ first tough decision as the manager of the women’s team after coming on board in late 2023 following a successful decade-plus at Chelsea FC in London. She told reporters after the Costa Rica game that at that point she’d only had about a half-dozen training sessions with her team, leaving her not much time to build the kind of relationships that major competition victories are built on.
    

            Even still, she is finding it easier than anticipated to get her team to come together.
    

            “I’ve only had a half a dozen sessions and four games. No problem, like, I’ll make the most of those” she said. “And in the sessions we have leading into the Olympics will add another layer to prepare us for the opening game in Zambia, when we have to be patient. There’s a lot of young, inexperienced players that are still learning at this level. And yes, it’s a new era. Yes, we want to win. But we have to understand the steps to take to do that.”
    

            For first-time Olympians like defender Sam Coffey, that patience is key.
    

            While Coffey says she intends to enjoy her Olympic experience and live in the moment as much as possible, the 25-year-old added she and other players stepping onto this stage for the first time are going to be doing a lot of learning.
    

            While that learning is part of the path to success, it can be a difficult position to be in when so much is expected quickly of the US women’s national team.
    

            “This is a new group, there’s a new energy, there’s a new philosophy, culture, I think we’re learning a lot as we go. And in some ways, we need to have patience with ourselves as we do that. It’s not going to be linear,” she said, adding, “But I again, I think – I hope it’s evident in the way that we’re playing and the difference in the style of play.”
    

            While the team has been gelling – Hayes and multiple players described good vibes being prominent in the locker room as the trip to France will likely be an intense period of bonding for the veterans and younger players.
    

            “We’re in our little bubble so traveling to new places is difficult because you don’t have that much free time,” forward Trinity Rodman said when asked what she was looking forward to at her first Olympics. “So, I would just say, having family members and friends there to support us through everything. being far away from home. I think the togetherness is great.”
    

            That group mentality is key to Hayes’ preparation for the rigors of tournament play.
    

            “We do a lot internally in terms of, you know, getting them to focus on the things that happen in our environment,” Hayes said.
    

            She nodded at the pressure that comes with being a part of one of the most successful women’s soccer teams of all time, saying, “We can’t control the keyboard warriors. And for us, you know, we have to realize the privilege to play for USA at the Olympics. Not only is it, you know, the greatest honor for these players, but one that we did not want to waste and we certainly don’t want to waste that with, you know, remarks and comments that are happening away from us that – people are entitled to – but we should just focus on ourselves and look after each other.”
    

            It’ll be up to players like Mallory Swanson, who’s playing in her second Olympics and third major tournament, to guide the younger players through the pressure that is heaped on the American women’s team.
    

            Swanson said so far, the mix of younger and more veteran players has led to a positive atmosphere in a locker room full of some of the game’s top players.
    

            “You got a mix of not of veterans, and then some newer players and I think that makes us really, really good,” Swanson said. “I think. It’s like I said, like the vibe has been really positive and it’s been a lot of fun and, yeah, I think just going into the tournament, that’s important.”
    

            With Morgan left at home, it’s the first major tournament in many years for the US women where there is not one striker who is expected to pour in the goals.
    

            Smith, Rodman and Swanson made up an electric front three against Costa Rica, often blitzing down the flanks of Las Ticas to create chances. Their intricate passing and combination with Horan occasionally left Costa Rican defenders flailing.
    

            But the chances were left wanting. That leaves room for a concerning question – who’s the classic striker that can be counted on to finish off the build-up play like Morgan, Carli Lloyd, Abby Wambach and Mia Hamm once did?
    

            “It’s frustrating, obviously, when you’re creating those chances that it’s just not going in. And but yeah, I think that we’re getting in those positions, and I think that you take the positive from that,” Swanson told reporters after the July 16 game. “And then I think you just go back to the training ground, and you just continue to work on finishing that last little bit. And yeah, I think it’ll come and, and just be a little – me myself, I just had to be a little bit more clinical, and just go back to the training ground and just get some reps in.”
    

            Hayes is happy to be patient with her team while they forge their new identity, and said the teams the team played ahead of their trip to France allowed them to get great experience playing different types of defenses.
    

            “The last part in the box is that little bit of composure, whether it’s to find the right – the spear player in the right moment, and where it’s just execute,” Hayes said. “When I analyze the chances, should we win the game? Of course we should win the game. But for me I’m always, I’m always about analyzing what you have to do to be able to ensure that happens or at least we can get into the positions again and again. I cannot finish the ball for players, but I can certainly coach to put players in positions.”

CNN_47,FBI seeking to interview Trump as part of assassination attempt investigation,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/fbi-trump-interview-assassination-attempt/index.html,2024-07-26 19:52:00,politics,"
            The FBI is seeking to interview former President Donald Trump in its investigation of the assassination attempt to obtain a victim statement — a standard part of the investigation because he is a crime victim, according to a US official.
    

            The FBI also said in a statement Thursday that investigators continue to examine bullet fragments and other evidence in the attack on Trump at his Pennsylvania rally this month, but that the agency has always considered the shooting an attempted assassination of the former president.
    

            The bureau issued the statement in response to questions about FBI Director Christopher Wray’s testimony on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, in which he said there’s still “some question” about whether Trump was hit with a bullet or shrapnel.
    

            Questions about Trump’s wound have stoked political backlash. Trump has said he “took a bullet for democracy,” and his campaign pushed back on any implication otherwise.
    

            “Anyone who believes this conspiracy bullsh*t is either mentally deficient or willfully peddling falsehoods for political reasons,” Trump adviser Steven Cheung told CNN.
    

            During Wednesday’s wide-ranging House Judiciary hearing, Wray shared new details with lawmakers about Trump’s would-be assassin, including that he searched for details of the John F. Kennedy shooting from his laptop and flew a drone in the area near the rally just two hours before the former president took the stage.
    

            Despite later criticism from Republicans about the FBI’s pending conclusions about the nature of the projectile, Wray was commended by representatives on both sides of the aisle for offering new insight into details about the investigation into the gunman. Those bipartisan expressions of appreciation stood in stark contrast to earlier testimony by then-Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned Tuesday after Democrats and Republicans accused her of stonewalling them and demanded her ouster.
    

            When asked Wednesday about how close the “assassin’s bullet” came to killing the former president, Wray said, “My understanding is that either it or some shrapnel is what, you know, grazed his ear.” He then agreed that it came very close to killing the former president.

            Martin Indyk, a former US ambassador to Israel under President Bill Clinton and former special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations under President Barack Obama, has died at 73.
    

            The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, an organization Indyk co-founded in 1985, released a statement confirming his death and praising his career.
    

            “From the Oslo process to the policy of ‘dual containment’ of Saddam’s Iraq and Islamic Iran, Martin left a deep and lasting imprint on the making and shaping of American Middle East policy,” said Dr. Robert Satloff, the Washington Institute’s executive director.
    

            Indyk’s wife, Gal Hodges Burt, confirmed with numerous outlets that he died due to complications of esophageal cancer at their home in New Fairfield, Connecticut.
    

            Clinton also shared his condolences on X writing, “Martin Indyk was an extraordinarily skilled diplomat who, no matter the obstacles, never gave up on the prospect of peace.”
    

            He added, “I’ll always be deeply grateful for the important role he played in my Administration’s efforts to end the conflict in the Middle East. The world would be better off if there were a lot more people like him.”
    

            A veteran diplomat and an expert on Middle East affairs, Indyk served as US ambassador to Israel from 1995 to 1997 and from 2000 to 2001.
    

            The Obama administration tapped him to be special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations from 2013-2014.
    

            After his resignation in 2014, Indyk remained a special adviser to Obama on Middle East peace.
    

            As recently as May, Indyk remained vocally engaged on the conflict in Gaza, posting on X a rebuke of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and claiming the Israeli government was leading Israel to “isolation and ruin” following a rejected peace deal.

            The 2024 Summer Olympic Games formally get underway today in Paris with an extraordinary Opening Ceremony aimed at putting one of the world’s most famous cities on display. For the first time in Summer Games history, the ceremony will be held outside of a stadium. Instead, athletes will parade down the city’s famous River Seine on boats. The festival on the water will begin at 7:30 p.m. local time (1:30 p.m. ET) and will air on NBC and stream on Peacock. However, France’s high-speed train lines were targeted by “malicious” acts earlier today, in what has been described as “coordinated sabotage” to disrupt travel. Olympic organizers told CNN that the ceremony will go ahead as planned with heightened security measures.
    

            The Trump campaign on Thursday said it would not commit to any future presidential debates until the Democratic Party formally chooses a nominee. Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday said she’s “ready” to debate former President Donald Trump, and earlier this week, Trump said he “absolutely” wants to debate Harris. The Biden and Trump campaigns had agreed to a debate hosted by ABC on September 10, but it is unclear if it will go on as planned. Fox News has also proposed a debate between Trump and Harris on September 17 in Pennsylvania. Analysts say a Harris v. Trump debate could be the sort of showdown that would attract tens of millions of viewers and potentially change the trajectory of the race.
    

            Two alleged leaders of the Sinaloa Mexican drug cartel were arrested Thursday, including the son of the notorious drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzmán. Joaquin Guzman Lopez, 38, and the alleged co-founder of the Sinaloa cartel, Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, 76, were caught in a sting operation in El Paso, Texas, Attorney General Merrick Garland said. Both Zambada and Guzman Lopez face several charges for allegedly leading the cartel’s criminal operations, including the trafficking of “tens of thousands of pounds of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and fentanyl into the US along with related violence,” FBI Director Christopher Wray said.
    

            California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order Thursday directing officials in the state to start removing homeless encampments. The order calls on state officials “to adopt humane and dignified policies to urgently address encampments on state property” — but homeless advocates are expressing concern over the order’s potential impact as thousands of people remain on a waitlist for state-funded housing. California has the largest homeless population in the nation, with more than 180,000 of the estimated 653,000 people experiencing homelessness nationwide residing in the Golden State, according to a 2023 report to Congress from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.
    

            OpenAI, the influential company behind ChatGPT, is taking on Google with a new artificial intelligence search engine. The company announced it is testing SearchGPT, which will combine its AI technology with real-time information from the web to allow people to search for information in the same way they talk to ChatGPT. With the new feature, OpenAI will be directly competing with Google, which has for years dominated the online search market. Separately, Rep. Jennifer Wexton made history Thursday as the first lawmaker to use an artificial intelligence-generated model of her voice to speak for her on the House floor. Wexton is battling progressive supranuclear palsy, or PSP, which has affected her voice and range of movement. When she first heard the AI rendition of her voice, Wexton called it “music to my ears.”

The meeting comes after Netanyahu visited the White House on Thursday, where President Joe Biden appeared forceful in urging Israel to accept a Gaza ceasefire agreement. Vice President Kamala Harris also met with Netanyahu, saying afterward that she urged the Israeli leader to get a ceasefire deal done.

CNN_50,"With a big heart and a tiny kitchen, meet the TikTok star cooking and delivering meals to people living on the streets of Paris",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/world/manu-solidaire-paris-cnnheroes/index.html,2024-07-26 19:38:00,world,"
            Manu Solidaire is quick to admit that he is not a real chef. Yet the cooking livestreams that he broadcasts from his tiny Paris apartment have attracted a huge audience on TikTok. They aren’t watching to see complicated cooking techniques; it’s his generosity that’s on full display.
    

            The 33-year-old spends hours preparing dozens of meals before hopping on his bike and distributing the food to people living on the streets of Paris. Solidaire takes his online audience along every step of the way.
    

            “When I wake up in the morning,” he said, “I’m thinking about, ‘What do I want to make today?’”
    

            From prep to packaging, Solidaire’s cooking sessions last four to eight hours. His kitchen is only about 30 square feet, so there is little room for others to keep him company. Instead, he often has an audience of thousands interacting online in a party-like atmosphere.
    

            “We laugh, we dance, we move, we are like a family on the live session,” he said.
    

            When Solidaire first began delivering his meals in 2022, he said that he wore a GoPro camera on his bike helmet for his own security. After a few months, he started asking people if they would mind being in his videos. He says he uses these videos to change perceptions around homelessness.
    

            “It’s to show to the world some homeless people … they work all their lives and right now they have some problems,” he said. “And maybe you can understand their situation.”
    

            Solidaire’s TikTok account has 352,400 followers and 5.6 million likes. His social media audience helps fund his efforts through links on the account and by donating during his livestreams. Last year, Solidaire won TikTok’s L’award d’honneur for his work.
    

            Solidaire first got to know people experiencing homelessness when he was running a pair of e-cigarette businesses. He would allow people in need to charge their phones in his store and would offer free coffee. Then, during the pandemic, he says “the business decreased, and the happiness decreased, too.”
    

            “I was thinking, ‘I have to find a new way to be happy,’” he said.
    

            One day, he made pasta for his family and had three portions leftover. He spent 20 minutes walking the streets and found three people who would not have eaten had he not offered the meals.
    

            “I come back home with a really huge smile,” he said. “It’s good for me and good for them.”
    
Déjà plis d'un an de distribution aux démunis. MERCI pour votre soutien 💝

            Solidaire found a new mission and started up his TikTok livestreams hoping to share recipes and sharpen his cooking skills.
    

            His first deliveries proved that he had some lessons to learn. When he would approach people, he said they did not know what to make of a stranger alone on his bike saying, “Hello, are you hungry? I have free food.” Then he realized, “’Manu, did you really ask about homeless people if [they] are hungry?’ Sure, [they] are hungry.” So, Solidaire changed his approach, instead saying, “I deliver free food for you. Do you need it?” He found people were far more accepting of his offer.
    

            When he saw that their needs went beyond food, he began distributing hygiene supplies. He also sometimes offers to pay for hotel rooms.
    

            Now, with the world’s eyes on Paris for the Olympic Games, many homeless people have been moved out of the city. Solidaire says he fears that the government is sending them to areas where they have no connection or resources. He argues this does not solve the underlying problems.
    

            “We can’t just hide the poverty of the country without any solution,” Solidaire said, adamant that he will still feed the people who depend on him. “If I can’t find them on the streets … I will take the train to continue to deliver my food.”
    

            One thing hasn’t changed for Solidaire since the first pasta meal he gave away: the joy that this work brings.
    

            “When I see the smile I (get) on the street, when I see the smiles I have (doing this), and when I see the smiles (from) my followers … thank you for that.”

CNN_51,From ‘one of the lowest points’ of his life to interim UFC heavyweight champion: the rise of Tom Aspinall,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/sport/tom-aspinall-ufc304-profile-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-26 19:22:00,world,"
            Five wins to open his UFC career had Tom Aspinall on course for a title shot.
    

            Then everything changed for the heavyweight MMA fighter 13 seconds into his clash with American Curtis Blaydes in 2022 in a fight which headlined a sold-out show at the O2 Arena in London.
    

            A kick from Aspinall connected with Blaydes’ leg and the British fighter dropped to the canvas, clutching his knee in pain, with the fight ending prematurely.
    

            Blaydes looked confused. Aspinall was in pain. The magnitude of the situation was evident.
    

            Aspinall had torn his medial collateral ligament, his meniscus and suffered anterior cruciate ligament damage. He underwent immediate surgery and missed a year of action, which he says was “one of the lowest points of my life.”
    

            “That sounds pretty superficial, but I give everything to fighting really,” the 31-year-old told CNN Sport. “At the time, it was awful.”
    

            “A lot of people get injured in a gym with 10 people there. I got injured with 25,000 home fans screaming my name and millions watching around the world. It’s a big blow to the ego.”
    

            After returning from injury, Aspinall was victorious in his comeback bout before claiming the interim UFC heavyweight championship title in his most recent fight and will defend it for the first time in a rematch against Blaydes on Saturday.
    

            “This is actually the first time in my career, amateur or professional, that I’ve had a rematch. I’m looking forward to showing Curtis what this version of Tom is.”
    

            As a youngster, Aspinall spent time sampling various combat disciplines – he trained in jujitsu, submission wrestling, Olympic wrestling, boxing, Thai boxing and kickboxing – before eventually settling on one which incorporates different facets into one discipline: mixed martial arts.
    

            “As soon as I realized that people are like doing this full time, getting paid for and not working a regular job, I was like: ‘Well, I want to get paid for what I like doing.’”
    

            He rose up the ranks through various different MMA organizations, before eventually signing with UFC in 2020.
    

            The Manchester native won his first five bouts, becoming a must-watch competitor, given his knack of ending his fights early; four of them ended in the first round and the fifth finished in the second round.
    

            Aspinall currently holds the record for the shortest average fight time in UFC history (with a minimum of five fights) with his bouts on averaging lasting just two minutes and 10 seconds.
    

            The UFC is seen as the pinnacle of MMA and therefore comes with increased attention, but Aspinall was unfazed.
    

            “I realized: ‘Oh, it’s just the same. Just the same in the UFC as anywhere else. It’s just a guy. He might be a UFC fighter, he might be a top-10 guy, you might be a former world champion, but he’s just a guy and I still have a chance of beating him,”’ said Aspinall.
    

            “Once I got a few wins in the UFC, I was like: ‘Oh, I can do this. Like, I can really be No. 1 in the world and be one of the best of all time of this.’”
    

            During his time on the sideline with his injury, Aspinall reflected on his preparation before a bout, whether that be training, or as he describes it, “all the stuff that was dragging me down a little bit” as he plotted how he might become the heavyweight champion.
    

            “It’s really selfish in a way. … there’s a lot of friends I’ve cut off,” he said. “But you have to do that to. And you’ll always get people saying: ‘Oh, he’s forgot about this. He’s cut me off. He thinks he’s better than us.’
    

            “As ruthless as it sounds and as pigheaded as that sounds, sometimes you do have to believe that you’re better than people to get yourself to the next level. But to be elite at anything, you really have to believe: ‘Everyone around me has to be moving in the same direction.’”
    

            Aspinall returned to the Octagon after almost exactly a year away with a convincing, 73-second victory over Marcin Tybura.
    

            It vaulted Aspinall to near the top of the heavyweight rankings and possibly in contention for a title shot as current champion Jon Jones was then scheduled to fight former two-time champion Stipe Miocic at UFC 295 in November 2023.
    

            But, just two weeks prior to that event, Jones was ruled out through a pectoral injury and Aspinall was drafted in to face Sergei Pavlovich for the interim heavyweight title.
    

            Fighters usually have months to prepare for upcoming bouts, but Aspinall had just 14 days to get ready for the fight in New York’s Madison Square Garden.
    

            “That was absolutely wild,” said Aspinall. “Not something that I’d recommend, especially, like even small stuff like the time difference. I didn’t have a visa until the day before I left. I didn’t have a training camp barely at all. Like I sparred twice for that fight. Two sparring sessions isn’t significant for a world title fight.”
    

            Despite the short notice, Aspinall knocked out Pavlovich in the second round, dropping to the canvas in disbelief afterwards, as well as dedicating the victory to his father who trains him.
    

            “I pulled it off in literally the worst circumstances I could have possibly had. I flew across the world and won a world title,” said Aspinall, who has drawn praise from many of his contemporaries, including former flyweight and bantamweight world champion Henry Cejudo, who described the British fighter as having a “bag of tricks.”
    

            “He’s like the heavyweight division’s version of [Georges] St-Pierre with even swifter striking,” Cejudo said on his YouTube channel. “What’s next for a guy like this? His name is Jon Jones.”
    

            Arguably one of the greatest UFC fighters of all time, Jones is the reigning heavyweight champion but has not fought since March 2023 and, according to Aspinall, doesn’t look like he’ll do so anytime soon.
    

            “Is Jon Jones even fighting? Because there’s a lot of talk on Twitter, on X, but I saw him recently, the guy has not seen a gym for I don’t know how long. He’s not in shape and he doesn’t have a fight booked.”
    

            CNN has reached out to Jones’ representatives for comment.
    

            Aspinall has accused Jones of “holding up” the heavyweight division, and despite a unification fight between Aspinall and Jones being what fans want, it doesn’t look likely anytime soon.
    

            His rematch against Blaydes at UFC 304 is the first defense he’s had of his title belt, and it will come on a special evening for Aspinall as it will be held in his home city of Manchester on a card full of bouts involving fellow British fighters.
    

            Aspinall’s fight with Blaydes is the co-main event for UFC 304, with Leon Edward’s welterweight title defense against Belal Muhammad the other headliner.
    

            The main events aren’t scheduled to start until after 3 a.m. local time, with Aspinall admitting he may not fight until 5 a.m. He says that he has had to “switch my body clock up” to prepare for it.
    

            In the moments ahead of his own fight, Aspinall will be thinking the same thing he does every fight: “Ring the bell.”
    

            “The fight day, generally, is the longest day of your life,” he explains, detailing the often-arduous steps he takes to prepare ahead of a bout.
    

            “And generally, I’m just thinking: ‘Ring the bell and let these emotions be over.’ Because as soon as you like swap leather, that’s it. It’s gone. You’re just in flow then. That’s the part that I like.”
    

  Tom Aspinall takes on Curtis Blaydes at UFC 304 on July 27 at the Co-op Arena in Manchester. It will be live on TNT Sports 1, which is available through Discovery+ and across all major TV platforms.

CNN_52,"A man is accused of pushing a burning car into a gully, causing a California wildfire that’s spread to over 145,000 acres",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/us/california-park-fire-oregon-durkee-jasper/index.html,2024-07-26 20:37:00,us,"
Hot and dry weather is fueling wildfire activity in the Western United States and Canada, with fires damaging homes, causing injuries and forcing evacuations. The largest active wildfire in the US has scorched more than 280,000 acres in eastern Oregon and another blaze has exploded to over 145,000 acres in California. Here’s the latest:


            • Man accused of starting California wildfire is arrested: A suspect has been arrested on suspicion of pushing a burning car 60 feet into a gully, “spreading flames” that caused what’s now become California’s largest wildfire of the year, authorities said. The Park Fire in the Butte County area has quickly burned an area larger than the size of Atlanta and is only 3% contained, according to Cal Fire.
    

            • Park Fire explodes in size: By Thursday morning, the wildfire had burned an average of nearly 50 football fields per minute since starting Wednesday afternoon. The blaze has forced mandatory evacuations in Butte County, where the state’s deadliest wildfire, the Camp Fire, killed more than 85 people and destroyed thousands of homes in 2018. Conditions around the Park Fire continue to be difficult for the 1,153 firefighters battling the flames as dry air, warm temperatures and gusty winds linger over the area Thursday. The area is under a red flag warning until Friday evening.
    

            • Three firefighters injured and structures damaged: Three firefighters had minor heat-related injuries on Wednesday while fighting the Park Fire, Cal Fire Captain Dan Collins told CNN Thursday. They were treated and released, he said. Officials know structures have been damaged or destroyed by the fire, but there is no official count yet, Collins said.
    

            • Firefighters battle massive Oregon fire: The Durkee Fire, which has burned an area larger than the city of Indianapolis, started on July 17 near the Oregon-Idaho state line. The lightning-sparked fire is the largest of 34 large wildfires currently burning across Oregon, which has been the hardest hit by fires in recent days. Amid high temperatures, extremely dry vegetation and strong winds, the fire has grown tens of thousands of acres and is 20% contained as of Thursday night, according to InciWeb. More than 500 firefighters and resources from 22 states are working to fight the fire, according to InciWeb. Over the weekend and earlier this week, the Durkee Fire exhibited extreme fire behavior, even creating its own weather in the form of pyrocumulus clouds.
    

            • Oregon wildfire destroys buildings: Three people were injured and two homes and 12 other structures were destroyed as the fire spread, according to the Oregon Department of Emergency Management. Evacuations are still in effect in Baker County for areas around the Durkee Fire. Some communities do not have power, according to Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, who has deployed resources from the National Guard to assist. Dense smoke from the flames has also impeded traffic on Interstate 84, leading to periodic closure of the freeway. Wildfire smoke was spreading into Boise and beyond. Air quality alerts have been issued for parts of Colorado, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.
    

            • Wildfire engulfs tourist town in Canada: A fast-moving wildfire sent thousands of visitors and residents fleeing the town of Jasper in Alberta, where flames devastated up to half of the town’s structures. Officials say the losses are significant, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has deployed federal support to help battle the blaze. Cool temperatures and rain are expected to keep fire behavior low for the next 72 hours, which will help crews fight the blaze, Jasper National Park said on Facebook Thursday night.
    

            • Fire-conducive weather continues in Western US: Triple-digit heat and dry conditions across the West this week have made conditions poor for firefighters actively fighting to contain the 89 large wildfires burning nationwide. “Many wildfires in the Northwest area continue to exhibit active to extreme fire behavior, with evacuation orders in effect on 17 wildfires. Several teams are managing multiple fire starts as complexes. Evacuation orders are also in effect for several fires in California, the Northern Rockies and the Great Basin,” the National Interagency Fire Center said. Conditions will begin to improve for much of the West over the weekend as cooler temperatures and higher humidity levels arrive in the area.
    

            Some families have found themselves displaced as the Park Fire raged near Chico, a city in northern California, burning homes and forcing evacuations.
    

            A former news anchor told CNN affiliate KOVR that she watched her Butte County house burn down live through security camera footage.
    

            “There is no rhyme or reason. Our house is gone, their house is okay. The house next to it you can see it’s gone,” Julia Yarbough said.
    

            Looking at the remnants of her home, Yarbough said she felt numb.
    

            “It’s surreal,” she said. “It probably won’t hit me till later, I’m pretty sure.”
    

            Triple-digit temperatures and high wind gusts have fueled the explosive growth of the Park Fire amid an active fire season in California. An estimated 343,253 acres have burned across the state so far in 2024, compared to 22,439 acres burned by this time last year, according to Cal Fire.
    

            A 42-year-old man, identified as Ronnie Dean Stout II, has been arrested after being accused of igniting the inferno.
    

            Witnesses reported seeing someone “pushing a car that was on fire into a gully near the Alligator Hole in upper Bidwell Park shortly before 3:00 p.m. yesterday,” Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said Thursday. “The car went down an embankment approximately 60 feet and burned completely, spreading flames that caused the Park Fire.”
    

            The DA says the man was seen “calmly leaving the area by blending in with the other citizens who were in the area and fleeing the rapidly evolving fire.” Stout was later arrested at a mobile home park in Chico, Ramsey said.
    

            Stout will likely face an arson charge, though it is unclear what count, or whether any enhancements will be added, Ramsey said. The DA’s office told CNN Stout has not retained an attorney and will be assigned a public defender at his arraignment.
    

            In Jasper, a popular tourist town in Alberta, 25,000 residents and visitors were forced to evacuate from a fast-moving blaze that has damaged 30 to 50% of the town’s structures, officials said during a press conference on Thursday.
    

            “Homes and businesses have been lost to a wildfire that people are calling a ‘wall of flames,’” Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said.
    

            An “enormous wind gust” moved the wildfire roughly about 3 miles in “probably less than 30 minutes,” Alberta Minister of Public Safety & Emergency Services Mike Ellis said during the press conference. This created “a wall of fire that was about 100 meters high.”
    

            “Any firefighter will tell you there is little to nothing you can do when you have a wall of flames coming at you like that. Nobody anticipated that fire to come so fast, so large,” Ellis said.
    

            Two wildfires converged in the Jasper National Park area, becoming what authorities are referring to as the Jasper Wildfire Complex. It remains difficult to measure exactly how big the complex – which also includes a third nearby fire – is due to extreme fire behavior and thick smoke cover. Together, the fires have swallowed an estimated 89,000 acres, the Jasper National Park said.
    

            Damage wrought by the flames will result in “a significant rebuild and significant displacement,” Smith said. The most significant structural damage lies on the west side of town, according to a Facebook post from Jasper National Park.

            “We will recover from this,” Smith said while holding back tears. “To those in Alberta and around the world who have experienced the magic of Jasper, the magic is not lost, and it never will be.”
    

            The vast majority of evacuees were “visitors with other places to return to,” Ellis said. Along with about 5,000 residents who live in the town, 2.48 million people visited Jasper National Park last year.
    

            Jasper Mayor Richard Ireland said residents will work together to rebuild after the wildfire “ravaged our beloved community.”
    

            “Your resilience and strength have always been the backbone of our community. In the coming days and weeks, we will rally together, support one another, and begin the daunting process of recovery,” Ireland said in a statement on Thursday.
    

            Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said all federal agencies are working together to provide resources to Jasper, support evacuations and strengthen response efforts on the ground.
    

            “Our governments are working together to keep Albertans safe and supported through this,” he said on Facebook.

CNN_53,An 11-year-old Virginia boy is charged with making swatting calls to Florida schools,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/us/virginia-boy-charged-swatting-calls/index.html,2024-07-26 20:13:00,us,"
            An 11-year-old Virginia boy is charged in Florida with calling in more than 20 bomb or shooting threats to schools and other places, authorities said Thursday.
    

            Flagler County Sheriff Rick Staly said during a news conference that authorities worked hard to find the caller before the school year resumes.
    

            “This kid’s behavior was escalating and becoming more dangerous,” Staly said. “I’m glad we got him before he escalated out of control and hurt someone.”
    

            Swatting is slang for making a prank call to emergency services in an attempt to send a SWAT team or other armed police officers to a particular place.
    

            Flagler County emergency services initially received a bomb threat at Buddy Taylor Middle School on May 14, officials said. Additional threats were made between then and May 22. Flagler County is in central Florida on the state’s Atlantic coast.
    

            Investigators tracked the calls to a home in Henrico County, Virginia, just outside Richmond. Local deputies searched the home this month, and the 11-year-old boy who lived there admitted to placing the Florida swatting calls, as well as a threat made to the Maryland State House, authorities said. Investigators later determined that the boy also made swatting calls in Nebraska, Kansas, Alabama, Tennessee and Alaska.
    

            The boy faces 29 felony counts and 14 misdemeanors, officials said. He’s being held in a Virginia juvenile detention facility while Florida officials arrange for his extradition. Investigators didn’t immediately say whether the boy had a connection to Florida.
    

            A 13-year-old boy was arrested in Florida in May, several days after the initial call, for making a copycat threat to Buddy Taylor Middle School, official said.

CNN_54,Inflation is inching closer toward the Fed’s 2% target,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/economy/us-pce-inflation-consumer-spending-june/index.html,2024-07-26 20:51:00,us,"
            Yet another favorable piece of economic data shows that price hikes are slowing and that long-unruly inflation appears to be tamed.
    

            The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index — a closely watched inflation gauge that the Federal Reserve uses for its 2% target — slowed to 2.5% for the 12 months ended in June from 2.6% the month before, according to Commerce Department data released Friday.
    

            Economists had projected the annual increase would slow to 2.5%, according to FactSet consensus estimates.
    

            On a monthly basis, the price index increased by 0.1%, also landing in line with expectations.
    

            Falling energy prices, which dropped 2.1% from May, continued to help put a damper on overall inflation in June, as did goods prices, which dropped 0.2%. Food and services inflation increased just 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively, for the month.
    

            Excluding food and energy, categories that are often quite volatile, the core PCE index rose 0.2% for the month and held at an annual rate of 2.6% — remaining at a three-year low.
    

            The Commerce Department’s monthly Personal Income and Outlays report also includes critical data on how Americans earn, spend and save.
    

            And, based on Friday’s data, those household finances are still holding well.
    

            Spending increased 0.3% from May, as Americans continued to put most of their money toward services and experiences, including housing and international travel. Taking inflation out of the equation, real spending was still up for the month, rising 0.2%.

            The head of one of the world’s biggest hedge funds says artificial intelligence systems are unlikely to replace traders anytime soon.
    

            London-based Man Group, whose assets under management hit an all-time high of $178.2 billion during the first six months of the year, makes its money by charging investors management and performance fees.
    

            That figure climbed by 54% between 2018 and 2023, even as the firm’s average number of employees rose by just 30% — thanks in part to its use of technology.

AI shouldn’t make ‘life-or-death’ decisions, says OpenAI’s Sam Altman


            Robyn Grew, the first woman to lead the 241-year old hedge fund, told CNN in an interview earlier this month that she was excited about advancements in AI, noting that her investment managers have been using the technology “for certainly north of 10 years.”
    

            But she was keen to play down the threat to jobs.
    

            “I don’t think of AI as making investment decisions anytime soon,” Grew said. “I think that the skill of knowing the power of this technology is to know its limitations.”
    

            The CEO, a lawyer who joined Man Group in 2010 and previously served at its president, likened AI to a tool used in surgery: “(Surgeons) have these extraordinary pieces of kit now which allow them to have better margins, better visibility and better precision.”
    

            Still, she added, you “would not want me to perform neurosurgery upon you however brilliant the tool was. And it’s the same with technology…I can appreciate the skill and what that tool might provide you, but you still want it in the hands of skilled people.”
    

            Publishing earnings Friday, Man Group cited robust growth in its credit business, which includes investments in assets such as private loans, corporate and government bonds. Its revenue from management and performance fees jumped nearly 45% to $733 million during the first half of 2024 compared with the same period last year.
    

            Shares in the company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, jumped 3% on the news, but had pared some of those gains to trade up 1.6% by 8:05 a.m. ET.
    

            In the interview with CNN, Grew said the era of rock-bottom interest rates that broadly defined the decade following the 2008 financial crisis had made way for a period of “volatility and dispersion” ushered in by the rise in inflation after the pandemic.
    

            In other words, traders navigating a volatile market can expect to make a greater range of — and possibly bigger — returns across various assets than during more stable times.

CNN_56,Trump campaign says it won’t commit to Harris debate until she’s confirmed as nominee,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/kamala-harris-donald-trump-presidential-debate/index.html,2024-07-26 21:19:00,politics,"
            After Vice President Kamala Harris accused former President Donald Trump of “backpedaling” on a debate, the Trump campaign said Thursday it would not commit to any future debates until the Democratic Party formally chooses a nominee.
    

            President Joe Biden’s decision to step down from the Democratic ticket on Sunday threw previous debate plans into doubt. While the Biden and Trump campaigns had agreed to a debate hosted by ABC on September 10, it is unclear if it will go on as planned.
    

            “I have agreed to the previously agreed upon September 10th debate, he agreed to that previously,” Harris told reporters after landing at Joint Base Andrews Thursday. “Now it appears he’s backpedaling. But I’m ready. And I think that the voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on a debate stage and so, I’m ready. Let’s go.”
    

            Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, said in a statement late Thursday that it “would be inappropriate to schedule things with Harris because Democrats very well could still change their minds,” since Harris is only the party’s presumptive nominee.
    

            Harris quickly hit back on social media. “What happened to ‘any time, any place’?” she said in a post on X.


            Democratic delegates are expected to vote virtually to confirm Harris as the party’s nominee by August 7. Trump, for his part, officially clinched the Republican nomination last week at the Republican National Convention.
    

            Trump told reporters earlier this week he wants to debate Harris but has not yet agreed to anything.
    

            “I haven’t agreed to anything. I agreed to a debate with Joe Biden,” Trump said on a press call. “But I want to debate with her, and she’ll be no different because they have the same policies. I think debating is important for a presidential race, I really do. You sort of have an obligation to debate.”
    

            Biden’s exit from the race came weeks after a disastrous performance at the CNN debate last month. He endorsed Harris shortly after his announcement, and the vice president quickly racked up enough delegate endorsements to win the Democratic presidential nomination. While those endorsements are not binding, Harris is still the favorite to take Biden’s place.
    

            Harris would not say on Thursday whether she was open to another proposed debate hosted by Fox News. Before Biden withdrew from the race, Harris had positioned herself to go up against Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, on the debate stage. In a brief call earlier this month, both candidates said they looked forward to debating one another but didn’t discuss specifics about when that would happen, CNN previously reported. 


            It’s now becoming clear those debate plans won’t be made after all, as Vance noted at a campaign stop in his hometown of Middletown, Ohio, earlier this week.
    

            “I was told I was going to get to debate Kamala Harris, and now President Trump’s going to get to debate her?” Vance joked. “I’m kind of pissed off about that if I’m being honest with you.”

CNN_57,Trump will meet with Netanyahu for first time since departing White House,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/trump-netanyahu-meeting-mar-a-lago/index.html,2024-07-26 21:14:00,politics,"
            Former President Donald Trump will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, the first such meeting between the two leaders since Trump left the White House more than three years ago.
    

            The meeting, slated for Friday morning at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence, was requested by Netanyahu, sources familiar with the planning told CNN. It comes on the heels of the prime minister’s address to Congress and meetings with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris at the White House. Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee, conveyed a forcefulness on civilian suffering and ending the war following her time with the prime minister.
    

            Friday marks an opportunity for Trump and Netanyahu to reset relations at critical moments in both the war between Israel and Hamas and the 2024 election cycle.
    

            Trump, who often claims he was the most pro-Israel president in modern history, once touted his close, personal relationship with Netanyahu. However, their relationship has soured in recent years, and the former president has been reluctant to speak with him throughout the ongoing conflict.

Harris says she ‘will not be silent’ on Gaza suffering while telling Netanyahu to get ceasefire deal done


            In the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ attack on Israel, Trump criticized Netanyahu for his handling of the war, claiming to Fox News at the time the prime minister and the country overall were “unprepared.”
    

            Part of that criticism, which Trump has continued in the months since, stems from his complicated relationship with Netanyahu, one that a former Trump administration official described as “a love-hate relationship,” who added that the two leaders experienced a dramatic up and down in recent years.
    

            During his administration Trump enacted multiple policies to Israel’s benefit, including moving the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights and backing multiple countries in Middle East and North Africa to normalize relations with Israel as part of the Abraham Accords. Netanyahu called Trump the greatest friend Israel has ever had and heralded him for “unequivocally” standing by Israel during Trump’s tenure as commander in chief.
    

            But the relationship grew bitter after the 2020 presidential election when Netanyahu congratulated Biden on his victory – something that infuriated the former president who considered the move disloyal. “F**k him,” Trump told Axios at the time.
    

            Trump has also claimed that Netanyahu betrayed him in the final months of his presidency, arguing that Israel, at the 11th hour, declined to participate in the 2020 airstrike that killed top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani. Netanyahu “let us down,” Trump said at a rally in October 2023.
    

            Two sources close to Trump, meanwhile, said they are aware of attempted outreach by Netanyahu in recent months, including seeking communications through informal channels.
    

            And in March, Trump allies — led by Keith Kellogg, a leading national security adviser to the former president who also served in the Trump administration — traveled to Israel to discuss the current conflict in Gaza, though the Trump campaign said it had learned of those meetings after the fact.
    

            Many Israelis presume that Trump would give Netanyahu a longer leash to use greater force in Gaza. Trump has said that Israel must “finish what they started,” “get it over with fast,” and that the US must “let Israel finish the job.”
    

            A senior Trump campaign adviser told CNN that Trump’s willingness to meet with Netanyahu despite their fraught relationship shows that Trump “is willing to put any personal or political differences to the side and develop or reconnect with him, to develop a working relationship with him.”
    

            “It shows the evolution of how Trump will conduct himself in a second term,” the adviser added.
    

            Sources familiar with the meeting said that there is no set agenda or overarching message that Trump wants to convey. However, the former president has repeatedly said that, if elected in November, he would seek a speedy end to the conflict in the Middle East without offering details of how he would do so. Instead, he’s argued the war must come to a swift close because the country is “losing the PR war.”
    

            Asked about the meeting during an interview with Fox News on Thursday, Trump said: “I want him to finish up and get it done quickly. You gotta get it done quickly, because they are getting decimated with this publicity. And you know, Israel is not very good at public relations.”
    

            He also asserted during the interview that the October 7 attack wouldn’t have happened if he were president, a claim he repeats frequently on the campaign trail.
    

            Arab Americans who have said they will support Trump will also be watching the meeting on Friday closely, they told CNN. They were “saddened and bewildered” when Trump called Biden a Palestinian in a derogatory manner during the debate last month, said Bishara Bahbah, who lives in Arizona and has worked to rally the Arab-American community for Trump after the lifelong Democrat soured on Biden over his approach to the Israel-Hamas war.
    

            Bahbah, however, has maintained support for Trump despite the derogatory rhetoric toward Palestinians last month. He pointed to Trump’s move to share a recent letter on his social media platform from Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas ahead of Friday’s meeting. The letter was sent after the assassination attempt on the 2024 Republican presidential nominee.
    

            “Looking forward to seeing Bibi Netanyahu on Friday, and even more forward to achieving Peace in the Middle East!” Trump posted to Truth Social with the letter.
    

            In posting that engagement with Abbas, Trump was trying to “strike a balance” going into the meeting, Bahbah said, adding that he hopes Trump will come out of the Netanyahu meeting calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire.
    

            Jewish supporters of Trump are hoping the former president asks Netanyahu what he needs to win the ongoing war, explained Lee Zeldin, a Jewish Republican and Trump supporter.
    

            “At the table, the most important question is asking the prime minister what he needs to win. What does Israel need that they don’t yet have?” Zeldin, a former congressman, said. “That conversation about ensuring victory and pursuing a lasting peace is the most important fundamental threshold in my opinion.”
    

            Zeldin added that Jewish Americans will be watching the meeting closely because they hope that Trump, if he were to win the November election, would “pick up where he left off” in terms of putting policies into place that support Israel.
    

            Trump finds himself in a distinct position given he was president just over three years ago and has longstanding relations with many of the foreign leaders now arriving on his doorstep.
    

            He has met with a series of foreign leaders in recent months, including hosting Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and British Foreign Secretary David Cameron at Mar-a-Lago, and dining with Polish President Andrzej Duda and former Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso at Trump Tower in New York during his hush money trial, among other meetings. He has also spoken by phone with several world leaders, including with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is currently working with the US to normalize relations with Israel.
    

            The Trump adviser argued that the meetings reflect the reality of the former president’s poll numbers, adding that many foreign leaders want to ensure they have strong ties to him in the event he wins in November.
    

            “It could signify that they think Trump is best positioned to be the next president, and they want to get a head start on developing a real relationship with him,” the adviser said.

CNN_58,Black women start a movement to tackle their health crisis,https://edition.cnn.com/us/iyw-girl-trek-2019/index.html,2024-07-26 21:58:00,us,"
            Across the US, obesity rates have risen and life expectancy has declined. Our national health crisis has been especially dire for African-American women.
    

            Among Black women ages 20 and older, more than half have heart disease, according to the American Heart Association.
    

            And this same population is at the highest risk for strokes, which is the leading cause of death for Black women. The CDC reports that nearly 3 out of 5 African American women suffer from high blood pressure. Also, 3 out of 5 Black women suffer obesity.
    

            The bottom line, according to the American Heart Association is that African American women are more likely to die at a younger age than women of other ethnicities.
    

            Vanessa Garrison and T. Morgan Dixon refuse to accept this fate, and formed the nonprofit GirlTrek to reclaim their health through walking.
    

            “It wasn’t because we were walking enthusiasts or because we love to walk. When we started we were just trying to save our own lives,” Dixon said.
    

            “How do we not fall in these pitfalls that our mothers and our aunts and our grandmothers have fallen into? Eighty percent of us are overweight and carrying that weight is killing us now at disproportionate levels. We can’t do it anymore. We can’t carry it anymore.”
    

            In November 18, 2020, 10 years after launching, the one millionth member laced up with GirlTrek. In 2024, more than 1,370,000 members have joined and formed walking teams across the country. GirlTrek’s goal is to keep growing and get more women to take its pledge to walk 30 minutes a day. The activity can help fight diabetes and reduce the risks of heart disease, stroke and dementia.
    

            Vanessa Garrison believes the group’s mission is more than just increasing lifespan. Quality of life is just as important, but in order to reach women in her community, she said she knows they must overcome a cultural mindset.
    

            “We grew up in households where our mothers and grandmothers and our aunties always chose to come last; they would always push those extra couple of hours to give to their family. And we’ve modeled that behavior and in fact we celebrated that behavior and it is the only way we knew how to navigate this world and get by. We created entire identities around our service to others.” Garrison told CNN.
    

            “And I tell you it is OK for you to put yourself first today for this 30 minutes and then in fact when you do that your family becomes more powerful, your community becomes more powerful.”
    

            It is important, Garrison said, for girls to see their mothers as healthy role models.
    

            “That is actually how you shift the entire dynamic of a culture by creating the habits that get passed from one generation to another,” she said.
    

            Reaching these girls is an essential goal of GirlTrek. Studies show the youngest generation of African-American girls now have the highest chance of developing diabetes.
    

            GirlTrek continues to grow thanks to the 1,000 organizers who put together all the local walks and the participants who pledge to bring along a sister.
    

            “Women are connecting with their neighbors, their friends, the women at their church, the women on campuses, and when you walk you talk,” Dixon told CNN.
    

            “And so it becomes a support community where women who are alone or women who are suffering any kind of depression or anxiety or stress can walk, talk and slow down with friends. And that act of slowing down is radical.”
    

            GirlTrek follows the path laid by the civil rights movement as both a guiding principle and often as actual routes to take. They have walked the “100 miles to freedom” along the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway. They host national walks, such as their “Road to Selma” event that marked the 50th Anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery  march.
    

            The organization and its walkers find inspiration in heroines like Harriet Tubman. Walkers receive “Harriet’s Handbook”, which provides 1,000 walks and a step-by-step guide to help women stay motivated.
    

            “We know that when Black women walk, things change, and that we walk in the footsteps of that legacy,” Garrison said, recalling African American civil rights activists
    

            “And when we tell that story to women they see themselves in those names. They see themselves as the next Ella Baker, the next Fannie Lou Hamer, the next Septima Clark, the next Harriet Tubman and they are inspired by their history to start walking and create change in their communities.”
    

            This change goes beyond getting in shape. When a walking team takes to the streets, they coalesce around problems they see or causes they discuss. Already empowered by the changes they are making in their health, these groups are ready to turn their walks into marches to make a difference.
    

            “As you start walking, you start noticing ‘oh we need a garden here’ or ‘this crosswalk is dangerous for our kids’,” Dixon said. “And so, we are here to help women, to advocate for policy, to build infrastructure, to change their neighborhoods.”
    

            For Dixon, she feels empowered when she sees these women not only get healthy but also get active in their community.
    

            “It feels great to have something practical I can do when I feel overwhelmed by the news.” Dixon told CNN. “It feels great to have Black women that I work with every single day to be my tribe. It feels amazing to go to a GirlTrek event and have women welcome me with open arms. So, I don’t feel like I’m saving lives. I feel like they’re saving my life.”

            An alleged Mexican drug kingpin suspected of flooding the United States with deadly fentanyl and who evaded authorities for decades is in US custody after he was apparently lured across the border by federal agents with another alleged leader of his cartel, according to a US law enforcement official briefed on the investigation.
    

            Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, 76, the alleged co-founder and leader of the powerful Sinaloa cartel, was arrested in El Paso, Texas on Thursday, Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.
    

            Another alleged cartel leader, Joaquin Guzman Lopez, 38, was also arrested, he said. Guzman is a son of the cartel’s infamous co-founder and former boss Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, 69, who is serving a life sentence in a US prison after he was convicted five years ago on multiple charges.
    

            Zambada boarded a plane with Guzman Lopez, believing they were inspecting property in Mexico near the US border, the law enforcement official said.
    

            But Zambada didn’t know US investigators had exploited a rift in the Sinaloa cartel and Guzman Lopez was helping with Zambada’s capture, the official said.
    

            The plane instead landed near El Paso and FBI agents arrested both men, in one of the biggest victories for US law enforcement against the cartels.
    

            “Two individuals got off the plane … and were calmly taken into custody,” by federal agents who were waiting, a worker at the Santa Teresa airport near El Paso told Reuters. “It seemed like a pretty calm, arranged thing,” the man, who declined to share his name out of concern for his safety, said.
    

            Both Zambada and Guzman Lopez face several charges for allegedly leading the cartel’s criminal operations, including its “deadly fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking networks,” Garland said.
    

            “Fentanyl is the deadliest drug threat our country has ever faced, and the Justice Department will not rest until every single cartel leader, member, and associate responsible for poisoning our communities is held accountable,” Garland said.

            Among various criminal charges Zambada faces in the US, he was indicted by a northern Illinois grand jury in 2009, according to the US State Department.
    

            While his whereabouts are unclear, CNN has learned that a US Justice Department aircraft frequently used for extraditions traveled from El Paso and landed at an airport near Chicago early Friday morning.
    

            US authorities had sought Zambada’s capture for years and in 2021 raised the reward for information leading to his arrest to $15 million.
    

            “Ismael Mario Zambada Garcia is the long-time leader of the Zambada Garcia faction of the Sinaloa Cartel.  Zambada Garcia is unique in that he has spent his entire adult life as a major international drug trafficker, yet he has never spent a day in jail,” according to the US State Department.
    

            FBI Director Christopher Wray said Zambada and Guzman Lopez had “eluded law enforcement for decades” and “will now face justice in the United States.”
    

            The pair allegedly oversaw the trafficking of “tens of thousands of pounds of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and fentanyl into the US along with related violence,” Wray added.
    

            Drug Enforcement Administration chief Anne Milgram said the pair’s arrests strike “at the heart of the cartel that is responsible for the majority of drugs, including fentanyl and methamphetamine, killing Americans from coast to coast.”
    

            The Sinaloa Cartel, named after the Mexican state where the gang was formed in the late 1980s, is one of the most powerful criminal groups in the world, raking in billions of dollars annually by trafficking drugs into the US and around the globe.
    

            Notorious cartel boss Guzman, better known as “El Chapo,” was arrested in Guatemala in 1993 on homicide and drug charges and extradited to Mexico. But he escaped Mexican prison in 2001, reportedly by bribing prison guards to smuggle him out in a laundry truck. He was arrested again in 2014, but escaped again, this time through a tunnel.
    

            Guzman was arrested for a third time in 2016 and then extradited to the United States.

            In a major trial, he was convicted by a federal jury in Brooklyn in 2018 and sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years, according to the Justice Department.
    

            Guzman was found guilty on 10 federal criminal counts, which included engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiracy to launder narcotics proceeds, international distribution of cocaine, heroin, and marijuana, and use of firearms.
    

            During the trial, Guzman’s lawyers argued Zambada was the real kingpin of the cartel who bribed the Mexican government to frame Guzman and remain free to run the criminal organization.
    

            In the latest in a string of US indictments against him, Zambada was charged in February with conspiring to manufacture and distribute fentanyl, an extremely potent synthetic opioid that has killed tens of thousands of Americans in an epidemic of overdoses.
    

            Fentanyl “was largely unheard of when [Zambada] founded the Sinaloa Cartel more than three decades ago and today is responsible for immeasurable harm,” said Breon Peace, US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, in the indictment.
    

            Since 1989, Zambada has imported and distributed “massive amounts of narcotics,” generating billions of dollars in profits, according to the indictment.

            Federal prosecutors said he employed people to obtain “transportation routes and warehouses” to import and store narcotics, along with hit men, or sicarios, to carry out kidnappings and murders in Mexico “to retaliate against rivals who threatened the cartel.”
    

            Zambada’s son, Vicente Zambada Niebla, admitted during testimony at Guzman’s 2018 trial to passing along orders for murders and kidnappings and was sentenced to 15 years in 2019 by a federal judge in Chicago.
    

            He began cooperating with the US government in 2011, prosecutors said in a May 2019 filing. They said he aided authorities in helping target members of the Sinaloa Cartel and a rival gang, which lead to the “charging of dozens of high-level targets and hundreds of their associates in indictments throughout the country,” CNN previously reported.
    

            The younger Zambada had known “El Chapo” since he was 15 years old, he testified at the kingpin’s trial in 2018. The younger Zambada frequently referred to “El Chapo” as “mi compadre,” or “my buddy,” during his testimony and said the drug lord was godfather to his youngest son.
    

            “El Mayo” Zambada was also indicted by a US federal grand jury in April 2012, in Texas, along with other suspected top Sinaloa leaders and 22 people allegedly connected with the cartel, including Guzman. They were charged with murder and conspiracy connected with drug trafficking, money laundering and organized crime.
    

            At that point, Guzman and Zambada had already been indicted on drug trafficking and organized crime charges in several US federal courts.
    

            The 2012 indictment in western Texas detailed two acts of violence federal prosecutors said were committed by members of the cartel; one took place during a 2010 wedding ceremony in Ciudad Juarez, when an American citizen and two members of his family were kidnapped because of their ties with the rival Juarez cartel.
    

            The target was the groom and a resident of Columbus, New Mexico, whose body was found to be beaten, strangled and whose hands had been “severed above the wrists and placed on his chest,” according to the indictment.
    

            Police found the bodies of the groom, his brother and his uncle three days after the wedding in the bed of a pickup truck, the indictment stated.
    

            Another incident detailed in the indictment related to the kidnapping, killing and mutilation of a Texas resident in 2009 “to answer for the loss of a 670-pound load of marijuana seized by the Border Patrol,” prosecutors said.

            An Alabama man indicted for allegedly threatening election workers in Arizona has pleaded guilty to one count of sending interstate threats, federal prosecutors said.
    

            Brian Ogstad of Cullman, Alabama, was indicted by a federal grand jury in February after Maricopa County, Arizona, election workers reported receiving numerous threats from him via social media.
    

            Following the 2022 state primary in Arizona – which was marked by the proliferation of numerous conspiracy theories regarding the integrity of the electoral process – Ogstad sent direct messages to Maricopa County officials, including: “You did it! Now you are f*cked. Dead. You will all be executed for your crimes,” and “You are f*cking stupid if you think your lives are safe,” according to the plea agreement and a statement Thursday from the US Justice Department.

            “In a heightened political climate, people often make online remarks they wish they can take back,” Todd Spodek, Ogstad’s attorney, told CNN after the plea agreement. “Unfortunately, Mr. Ogstad let his emotions get the best of him and sent a number of messages that he regrets.”
    

            Ogstad is scheduled to be sentenced on October 21, according to court records. He faces up to five years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine for one count of transmitting threats.
    

            Ogstad appeared in a 2021 CNN special report on the group Q-Anon – a virtual cult of followers who traffic in baseless conspiracy theories.
    

            Ogstad told CNN’s Anderson Cooper at the time he did not consider himself a “follower” of Q-Anon, but he did use their slogans and online hashtags. He also appeared to believe most of their core conspiracy theories, including calling for the public execution of prominent Democratic officials, and one former Republican president.
    

            FBI Director Christopher Wray has repeatedly warned about the heightened risk of political violence in recent months, including calling out threats to election workers, whom he has referred to as “the lifeblood of our elections.”
    

            “Violent threats to election workers are threats to our democracy and democratic process,” Wray said in a statement Thursday following Ogstad’s plea agreement. “We cannot allow threats of violence against public servants to become normalized. The FBI takes seriously all threats of violence against public officials and will continue to pursue threats and acts of violence aimed at election workers.”

CNN_61,US prosecutors charge prominent short-seller with fraud,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/investing/andrew-left-citron-fraud-charge/index.html,2024-07-26 21:28:00,us,"
            Federal prosecutors in California on Friday charged prominent investor Andrew Left with multiple counts of securities fraud involving “a long-running market manipulation scheme” yielding at least $16 million in profit.
    

            The Department of Justice said Left, the founder of Citron Research, “exploited his ability to move stock prices” using social media to amplify and exaggerate market reactions.
    

            Left’s investing style is known as short-selling, a high-risk strategy that allows investors to bet against stocks they see as overvalued. Short-sellers, including Left, often present themselves as researchers sniffing out misleading or fraudulent businesses through independently published reports on their targets.
    

            Citron had a notable win in 2015, when it bet against Canadian pharmaceutical giant Valeant, accusing it of creating fraudulent invoices and comparing it to Enron. The company was later investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, leading its stock to plummet 90% from its peak.
    

            Left, 54, was charged with one count of engaging in a securities fraud scheme, 17 counts of securities fraud, and one count of making false statements to federal investigators. Each securities fraud count carries a maximum prison sentence of 20 years.
    

            Separately, the SEC on Friday accused Left and his firm of running a $20 million scheme to defraud his social media followers by publishing false and misleading reports.
    

            Citron did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.
    

            On its website, the firm says its goal “has always been to provide truthful information in an entertaining format to the investing public.”
    

            “It is obvious that the vast preponderance of companies (but not all – so who’s perfect?) covered in the archived reports performed poorly as investments,” Citron says on its website. “Readers are welcome to compile their own track records and draw their own conclusions.”

CNN_62,The show must go on: Fashion week to return to Kyiv for the first time since 2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/style/ukrainian-fashion-week-returns-war/index.html,2024-07-26 21:02:00,world,"
            The organizers of Ukrainian Fashion Week have announced the event’s 55th season in September will take place in Kyiv — the first time since Russia invaded the country on February 24, 2022.
    

            Around 50 brands are scheduled to show via a variety of mediums, from traditional runway shows to installations, presentations and performances. Most events will take place at the Mystetskyi Arsenal — Ukraine’s National Art and Culture Museum Complex — while a parade of designers and models will walk through the city in “a symbolic demonstration of unity,” according to a press release.
    

            Since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of neighboring country Ukraine almost three years ago, more than 30,000 Ukrainian soldiers have died. With Russian forces suffering even bigger losses (earlier this month, the UK Defense Ministry said more than 70,000 soldiers were likely killed or wounded in May and June 2024 alone), authorities in Moscow are offering record signing-on bonuses of around $22,000 to attract new recruits to fight in the conflict.
    

            “We still have war in the whole country, and we feel the war in the whole country,” Lisa Ushcheka, head of international communications for Ukrainian Fashion Week, told CNN in a video call. “Because of the missile attacks, the blackouts and power outages. There are regions that (have) extremely hard shelling, regions that are suffering. We are used to it, and we have to live in this war reality. It is our new reality.”
    

            Protective measures will be in place for all eventualities. The Mystetskyi Arsenal, for example, where most shows will take place, is equipped with bomb shelters. “Once we hear the air raid siren, all guests will be asked to proceed to the bomb shelter,” Ushcheka said.
    

            A spokesperson for the public relations team working on the event said that despite this, “local media, industry talent and influencers” are expected to attend. The international fashion pack, however, may find it more challenging, with the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office still advising against all travel to most of Ukraine, including Kyiv; and the US Department of State listing the country as a “Level 4” — the highest on its travel advisory scale — warning citizens not to visit due to armed conflict.
    

            Organizers have been discussing the possibility of returning to Kyiv for the last six months, said Ushcheka, who hopes the conflict doesn’t escalate. “If the war intensifies,” she told CNN, “and something unexpected happens, because each day the situation changes, of course in the worst case scenario we can cancel.” Ivan Frolov, a Kyiv-born fashion designer scheduled to exhibit in September’s showcase, added that the Ukrainian spirit has become evermore adaptable in the face of adversity. “Since the war started, we don’t only have a plan B, but a plan C, G, even Z.”

            “But life doesn’t stop,” said Ushcheka.
    

            It will be the first time Ukrainian designers will have shown their collections on home soil since the war began. For the past three seasons, Berlin, London and Copenhagen have offered up runways at their respective fashion weeks specifically for Ukrainian designers who fled the country. In February 2023, Frolov presented his Fall-Winter 2023 collection in a group show alongside labels Ksenia Schnaider and Paskal in London. “We were so appreciative of that possibility,” he said over Zoom. “For me, that show was not just about reaching a hand out and saying, ‘Please help us. We need your help.’ That was about us saying ‘We are very strong. We are very talented. We are the same as you. We are here.’”
    

            Each participating brand has agreed to make a donation in support of a new palliative care unit in the city, monies that will be used to buy specific medical equipment to help those with severe and incurable injuries. Guests will also have the opportunity to donate throughout the event. “We hope that it will be inspirational for the whole world,” said Ushcheka. “Because it’s a historical event, a fashion week taking place in a country where there is a war going on.”
    

            For Frolov, the prospect of staging a return show in Kyiv is emotionally overwhelming. “I’m happy my sunglasses are black,” he said, from behind a pair of dark glasses. “Because my eyes are wet right now. I love Kyiv very much. I was born in Kyiv and Kyiv is everything to me. With the support of the Minister of Culture and the Minister of Economy I’m able to travel and visit other countries, but I can’t leave the country for more than one month, because I feel sick without Kyiv. I feel empty without Kyiv. It’s my motherland, it’s my soul.”
    

            “This September, I want to reinstall Kyiv as one of the main cities of fashion in the world.”

CNN_63,Divers find 19th-century shipwreck laden with unopened bottles of champagne and precious mineral water,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/style/19th-century-shipwreck-champagne-scli-intl/index.html,2024-07-26 21:01:00,world,"
            A 19th-century shipwreck packed with crates of unopened champagne has been found in the depths of the Baltic Sea.
    

            The long-forgotten vessel was brimming with bubbly, according to the team of Polish divers who made the discovery off the coast of Sweden.
    

            “The whole wreck is loaded to the brim with crates of champagne, mineral water, and porcelain,” Tomasz Stachura, the leader of the Baltictech diving team that found the wreck, said in a press release sent to CNN.
    

            According to the firm’s website, Stachura is “one of the most active wreck divers in the Baltic Sea,” who has “taken thousands of underwater pictures of Baltic wrecks.” Nevertheless, this recent find was different, he said, explaining that some 100 bottles were found onboard.
    

            “I have been diving for 40 years, and it often happens that there is one bottle or two… but to discover a wreck with so much cargo, it’s a first for me,” he said in the release.
    

            The find was “largely a coincidence,” he said, as the divers have been combing the seabed for years in search of sunken ships.
    

            “We were just checking out new spots, which I had been collecting for years, out of pure curiosity, and that’s when we came across this wreck,” said Stachura. “We did not expect it to be anything significant and even hesitated for a moment whether to dive at all.”
    

            Two of the team were determined to take a look, however, on a “quick dive” but were gone for almost two hours, according to a post on the team’s website.
    

            The wreck was “in very good condition” and its cargo was plentiful. “There was so much of it that it was difficult for us to judge the quantities,” the post said.
    

            While the champagne certainly provided cause for celebration, it was the bottles of water that perhaps shed most light on the vessel’s history.
    

            The press release said the water was in sealed clay bottles and branded Selters, “a German brand highly valued in the 19th century, often reserved for royal tables and considered almost medicinal.”
    

            It comes from a mineral spring of the same name in the town of Selters, in the central German state of Hesse, and has been bottled for more than 800 years.

            “We managed to take pictures of the brand name stamped on a clay bottle, which turned out to be from the German company Selters – produced to this day,” diver and underwater videographer Marek Cacaj said in the press release.
    

            According to Baltictech’s website, “its value was so precious that transports were escorted by the police.”
    

            “Thanks to the shape of the stamp, and with historians’ help, we know that our shipment was produced between 1850-1867. Interestingly, the pottery factory into which the water was bottled also exists, and we are in contact with them to find out more details.”
    

            The divers notified the Swedish regional authorities about the vessel, which was located about 20 nautical miles south of the Swedish island of Öland. Extracting the bubbly from the boat could take some time, however, due to administrative restrictions, Stachura said.
    

            “It had been lying there for 170 years, so let it lie there for one more year, and we will have time to better prepare for the operation,” he said.
    

            His team is now collaborating with Dutch marine data company MARIS, Södertörn University in Sweden and Professor Johan Rönnby, who oversees Swedish underwater research, to develop guidelines for future exploration of the wreck.

            An alleged Mexican drug kingpin suspected of flooding the United States with deadly fentanyl and who evaded authorities for decades is in US custody after he was apparently lured across the border by federal agents with another alleged leader of his cartel who was helping with his capture, according to a US law enforcement official briefed on the investigation.
    

            Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, 76, the alleged co-founder and leader of the powerful Sinaloa cartel, was arrested in El Paso, Texas, Thursday, Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.
    

            Another alleged cartel leader, Joaquin Guzman Lopez, 38, was also arrested, he said. Guzman is a son of the cartel’s infamous co-founder and former boss Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, 69, who is serving a life sentence in a US prison after he was convicted five years ago on multiple charges.
    

            Zambada boarded a plane with Guzman Lopez, believing they were inspecting property in Mexico near the US border, the law enforcement official said.
    

            But Zambada didn’t know US investigators had exploited a rift in the Sinaloa cartel and Guzman Lopez was helping with Zambada’s capture, the official said.
    

            The plane instead landed near El Paso and FBI agents arrested both men, in one of the biggest victories for US law enforcement against the cartels.
    

            “Two individuals got off the plane … and were calmly taken into custody,” by federal agents who were waiting, a worker at the Santa Teresa airport near El Paso told Reuters. “It seemed like a pretty calm, arranged thing,” the man, who declined to share his name out of concern for his safety, said.
    

            Mexican officials were informed of the arrests during a phone call from the US Embassy in Mexico Thursday afternoon, Mexico’s secretary of security, Rosa Icela Rodriguez, said Friday.
    

            “The Mexican government did not participate in this detention or surrender,” Rodriguez said during President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s daily news conference, adding Mexico is waiting for more information from the US government.
    

            Based on information from Mexico’s National Immigration Institute, Rodriguez said, it is believed the men traveled in a Cessna 205 from Hermosillo, Mexico, to the Santa Teresa airport in Texas.
    

            Zambada has four active arrest warrants in Mexico for organized crime and other unlawful acts, Rodriquez said.
    

            In the US, both Zambada and Guzman Lopez face several charges for allegedly leading the cartel’s criminal operations, including its “deadly fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking networks,” Garland said.
    

            “Fentanyl is the deadliest drug threat our country has ever faced, and the Justice Department will not rest until every single cartel leader, member, and associate responsible for poisoning our communities is held accountable,” Garland said.

            Among various criminal charges Zambada faces in the US, he was indicted by a northern Illinois grand jury in 2009, according to the US State Department.
    

            While his whereabouts are unclear, CNN has learned that a US Justice Department aircraft frequently used for extraditions traveled from El Paso and landed at an airport near Chicago early Friday morning.
    

            US authorities had sought Zambada’s capture for years and in 2021 raised the reward for information leading to his arrest to $15 million.
    

            “Ismael Mario Zambada Garcia is the long-time leader of the Zambada Garcia faction of the Sinaloa Cartel.  Zambada Garcia is unique in that he has spent his entire adult life as a major international drug trafficker, yet he has never spent a day in jail,” according to the US State Department.

CNN_66,"A man is accused of pushing a burning car into a gully, causing a California wildfire that’s spread to over 164,000 acres",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/us/california-park-fire-oregon-durkee-jasper/index.html,2024-07-26 23:48:00,us,"
Hot and dry weather is fueling wildfire activity in the Western United States and Canada, with fires damaging homes, causing injuries and forcing evacuations. The largest active wildfire in the US has scorched more than 280,000 acres in eastern Oregon and another blaze has exploded to over 164,000 acres in California. Here’s the latest:


• Man accused of starting California wildfire is arrested: A suspect has been arrested on suspicion of pushing a burning car 60 feet into a gully, “spreading flames” that caused what’s now become California’s largest wildfire of the year, authorities said. The Park Fire in the Butte County area has quickly burned an area larger than the city of Atlanta. On Friday morning, Cal Fire said the fire had burned more than 164,000 acres and was 0% contained, after saying it had been 3% contained on Thursday.
    

            • Park Fire explodes in size: By Thursday morning, the wildfire had burned an average of nearly 50 football fields per minute since starting Wednesday afternoon. The blaze has forced mandatory evacuations in Butte County, where the state’s deadliest wildfire, the Camp Fire, killed more than 85 people and destroyed thousands of homes in 2018. Conditions around the Park Fire continue to be difficult for the 1,153 firefighters battling the flames as dry air, warm temperatures and gusty winds linger over the area Thursday. The area is under a red flag warning until Friday evening.
    

            • Three firefighters injured and structures damaged: Three firefighters had minor heat-related injuries on Wednesday while fighting the Park Fire, Cal Fire Captain Dan Collins told CNN Thursday. They were treated and released, he said. Officials know structures have been damaged or destroyed by the fire, but there is no official count yet, Collins said.
    

            • Firefighters battle massive Oregon fire: The Durkee Fire, which has burned an area larger than the city of Indianapolis, started on July 17 near the Oregon-Idaho state line. The lightning-sparked fire is the largest of 34 large wildfires currently burning across Oregon, which has been the hardest hit by fires in recent days. Amid high temperatures, extremely dry vegetation and strong winds, the fire has grown tens of thousands of acres and is 20% contained as of Thursday night, according to InciWeb. More than 500 firefighters and resources from 22 states are working to fight the fire, according to InciWeb. Over the weekend and earlier this week, the Durkee Fire exhibited extreme fire behavior, even creating its own weather in the form of pyrocumulus clouds.
    

            • Oregon wildfire destroys buildings: Three people were injured and two homes and 12 other structures were destroyed as the fire spread, according to the Oregon Department of Emergency Management. Evacuations are still in effect in Baker County for areas around the Durkee Fire. Some communities do not have power, according to Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, who has deployed resources from the National Guard to assist. Dense smoke from the flames has also impeded traffic on Interstate 84, leading to periodic closure of the freeway. Wildfire smoke was spreading into Boise and beyond. Air quality alerts have been issued for parts of Colorado, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.
    

            • Wildfire engulfs tourist town in Canada: A fast-moving wildfire sent thousands of visitors and residents fleeing the town of Jasper in Alberta, where flames devastated up to half of the town’s structures. Officials say the losses are significant, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has deployed federal support to help battle the blaze. Cool temperatures and rain are expected to keep fire behavior low for the next 72 hours, which will help crews fight the blaze, Jasper National Park said on Facebook Thursday night.
    

            • Fire-conducive weather continues in Western US: Triple-digit heat and dry conditions across the West this week have made conditions poor for firefighters actively fighting to contain the 89 large wildfires burning nationwide. “Many wildfires in the Northwest area continue to exhibit active to extreme fire behavior, with evacuation orders in effect on 17 wildfires. Several teams are managing multiple fire starts as complexes. Evacuation orders are also in effect for several fires in California, the Northern Rockies and the Great Basin,” the National Interagency Fire Center said. Conditions will begin to improve for much of the West over the weekend as cooler temperatures and higher humidity levels arrive in the area.
    

            Some families have found themselves displaced as the Park Fire raged near Chico, a city in northern California, burning homes and forcing evacuations.
    

            A former news anchor told CNN affiliate KOVR that she watched her Butte County house burn down live through security camera footage.
    

            “There is no rhyme or reason. Our house is gone, their house is okay. The house next to it you can see it’s gone,” Julia Yarbough said.
    

            Looking at the remnants of her home, Yarbough said she felt numb.
    

            “It’s surreal,” she said. “It probably won’t hit me till later, I’m pretty sure.”
    

            Triple-digit temperatures and high wind gusts have fueled the explosive growth of the Park Fire amid an active fire season in California. An estimated 343,253 acres have burned across the state so far in 2024, compared to 22,439 acres burned by this time last year, according to Cal Fire.
    

            A 42-year-old man, identified as Ronnie Dean Stout II, has been arrested after being accused of igniting the inferno.
    

            Witnesses reported seeing someone “pushing a car that was on fire into a gully near the Alligator Hole in upper Bidwell Park shortly before 3:00 p.m. yesterday,” Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said Thursday. “The car went down an embankment approximately 60 feet and burned completely, spreading flames that caused the Park Fire.”
    

            The DA says the man was seen “calmly leaving the area by blending in with the other citizens who were in the area and fleeing the rapidly evolving fire.” Stout was later arrested at a mobile home park in Chico, Ramsey said.
    

            Stout will likely face an arson charge, though it is unclear what count, or whether any enhancements will be added, Ramsey said. The DA’s office told CNN Stout has not retained an attorney and will be assigned a public defender at his arraignment.
    

            In Jasper, a popular tourist town in Alberta, 25,000 residents and visitors were forced to evacuate from a fast-moving blaze that has damaged 30 to 50% of the town’s structures, officials said during a press conference on Thursday.
    

            “Homes and businesses have been lost to a wildfire that people are calling a ‘wall of flames,’” Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said.
    

            An “enormous wind gust” moved the wildfire roughly about 3 miles in “probably less than 30 minutes,” Alberta Minister of Public Safety & Emergency Services Mike Ellis said during the press conference. This created “a wall of fire that was about 100 meters high.”
    

            “Any firefighter will tell you there is little to nothing you can do when you have a wall of flames coming at you like that. Nobody anticipated that fire to come so fast, so large,” Ellis said.
    

            Two wildfires converged in the Jasper National Park area, becoming what authorities are referring to as the Jasper Wildfire Complex. It remains difficult to measure exactly how big the complex – which also includes a third nearby fire – is due to extreme fire behavior and thick smoke cover. Together, the fires have swallowed an estimated 89,000 acres, the Jasper National Park said.
    

            Damage wrought by the flames will result in “a significant rebuild and significant displacement,” Smith said. The most significant structural damage lies on the west side of town, according to a Facebook post from Jasper National Park.

            “We will recover from this,” Smith said while holding back tears. “To those in Alberta and around the world who have experienced the magic of Jasper, the magic is not lost, and it never will be.”
    

            The vast majority of evacuees were “visitors with other places to return to,” Ellis said. Along with about 5,000 residents who live in the town, 2.48 million people visited Jasper National Park last year.
    

            Jasper Mayor Richard Ireland said residents will work together to rebuild after the wildfire “ravaged our beloved community.”
    

            “Your resilience and strength have always been the backbone of our community. In the coming days and weeks, we will rally together, support one another, and begin the daunting process of recovery,” Ireland said in a statement on Thursday.
    

            Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said all federal agencies are working together to provide resources to Jasper, support evacuations and strengthen response efforts on the ground.
    

            “Our governments are working together to keep Albertans safe and supported through this,” he said on Facebook.

CNN_67,The stock market is gearing up for its rate cut era,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/investing/stocks-rate-cuts-inflation-fed/index.html,2024-07-26 23:30:00,us,"
            Wall Street is undergoing a palpable vibe shift.
    

            Strong corporate earnings have helped stocks notch repeated record highs in 2024, despite stubborn inflation forcing investors to dial down their expectations for how many times the Fed will cut rates this year.
    

            But a slew of cooling inflation data in recent weeks has led Wall Street to bet that the Federal Reserve will finally cut interest rates in September — and that there are now more options for gains beyond just the Big Tech stocks that have dominated the market this year.
    

            Data released Friday morning showed the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, slowed to 2.5% for the 12 months ended in June — another sign for hopeful investors that inflation is continuing to ease from its four-decade high.
    

            The Dow jumped 620 points, or 1.6%, on Friday. The S&P 500 gained 1% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.7%.
    

            Economic data has also remained remarkably resilient even as rates stay at a 23-year high. That, coupled with the slowdown in inflation, has raised hopes that the central bank could tame prices without triggering a recession, a feat it has achieved just once since the 1990s, according to some economists. Data Thursday showed the economy expanded at a robust 2.8% annualized rate during the second quarter, blowing past economists’ expectations.
    

            Wall Street will get more clues about the Fed’s next moves at its policy meeting next week, where the central bank is expected to hold rates steady. While the Fed has penciled in just one rate cut for this year, traders are betting on up to three, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.
    

            Brightening prospects for rate cuts typically signal good news for stocks, since the market tends to do better when higher borrowing rates don’t weigh down companies’ balance sheets. But you wouldn’t know that from the carnage in stocks this week.

Nasdaq and S&P 500 log worst day since 2022 after Alphabet and Tesla fail to impress Wall Street


            While the market was broadly higher on Friday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Wednesday logged their worst daily performances since 2022. Both indexes are on track to end the week lower, while the Dow is on pace for a gain.
    

            The reason behind the selloff: Investors are shedding shares of the Magnificent Seven tech stalwarts that have dominated the market for the past two years, and their large weighting has dragged down the major indexes. Tech companies make up 32% of the total market capitalization, the highest level since the late 1990s, according to MRB Partners data as of June 28.
    

            An underwhelming start to the earnings season for the cohort has only intensified its declines: Tesla shares tumbled 12.3% on Wednesday after the electric vehicle-maker reported a more than 40% plunge in profits the prior evening. Alphabet shares slipped 5% after beating earnings expectations but missing analysts’ expectations for YouTube advertising revenue.
    

            One area that has benefited recently from the prospect of lower rates is small-cap stocks.
    

            Shares of smaller companies tend to perform poorly when rates are high, since they have more floating rate debt than their larger counterparts. But they have historically tended to perform well when the Fed begins easing its high borrowing rates.
    

            The Russell 2000 index, which tracks the performance of small-cap stocks, has gained 9.6% so far this month, outperforming the S&P 500’s 0.2% loss.
    

            Investors are also picking at other areas of the market poised to gain when rates come down. Stephen Lee, founding principal at Logan Capital, said his firm added to its position in homebuilder stocks earlier this quarter, betting that cooling inflation would allow the Fed to cut rates and ease the ultra-tight housing market.
    

            Sky-high interest rates have led homeowners to hold off on selling their homes to keep their pandemic-era low mortgage rates even as demand surged, driving up home prices to record levels.
    

            Investors have fretted over the past year that the market’s gains are beholden to just a handful of tech stocks, making the rally more vulnerable to pullbacks a few stocks stumble. The Magnificent Seven drove about 60% of the S&P 500’s total return during the first half of the year, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial.
    

            The recent gain in small-caps is making some investors hopeful that the market rally will continue to broaden.
    

            There are signs that the pain in tech shares might not be over yet. Tech stocks’ steep losses following tepid quarterly results from Alphabet and Tesla suggest that investors are growing impatient with companies investing hefty sums into artificial intelligence with little to show for it in terms of revenue gains.
    

            Many big tech firms have released AI chatbots and other flashy consumer tools since OpenAI’s ChatGPT kicked off the AI arms race two years ago, but the path to monetizing the technology remains unclear.
    

            On Alphabet’s Tuesday earnings call, UBS analyst Stephen Ju noted that the initial use cases of the AI models that Big Tech firms have invested in building “are more on the cost savings or efficiency side.”
    

            “When do you think we’ll start thinking about products that can help revenue generation for the Fortune 500, Fortune 1000 companies, which is probably something that can, hopefully, create greater value over time, versus just cutting costs?” Ju said.
    

            As the AI arms race continues to heat up, companies are unlikely to slow their spending on AI. But it’s unclear when those investments will provide a boost to their balance sheets.
    

            “The risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us here,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said on the call.

CNN_68,Officer suspended after videos of police beating men at UK airport spark outcry,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/uk/british-police-beating-uk-airport-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-26 23:08:00,world,"
            A British policeman has been suspended and is facing criminal investigation after multiple videos emerged on social media showing officers beating at least three people inside Manchester Airport in an incident the city’s own force has labeled “truly shocking.”
    

            The viral videos, in which one officer could be seen kicking and stomping on the head of a man in prone position, are the latest to spark a public and political argument in Britain over police violence and drew protests accusing police of racism.
    

            Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said the footage on social media showed a confrontation that began after three officers were injured in a “violent assault,” including one female officer who suffered a broken nose.
    

            But the force added that the event seen in the videos was “truly shocking” and an “unusual occurrence,” adding it had voluntarily referred itself to Britain’s independent police watchdog for a full investigation. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) confirmed it had launched an investigation.
    

            “We appreciate the footage which was shared on social media has attracted widespread shock and concern. It is vitally important we investigate all of the circumstances surrounding the incident,” the office said in a statement.
    

            Police said that the officer seen in the video has been suspended after earlier announcing they were removed from operational duties.
    

            Akhmed Yaqoob, a solicitor for the family of the man seen being stomped on in the incident said his medical condition worsened overnight and that a scan revealed a cyst on his brain.
    

            Speaking to reporters in Rochdale, he said the family was “traumatised” by the events, adding that the family have launched a complaint against the police.
    

            The videos began circulating Wednesday, quickly going viral on social media and sparking an outcry from both the public and some politicians.
    

            One video shows a man on the ground with at least two police officers pointing a taser at him. A male police officer moves closer to the man and starts kicking him in the face, while his taser is still drawn, before stomping on his head. A woman is heard shouting “stop it, he hasn’t done anything!”
    

            Later in the same video, another man, whose hands were in the air while sitting nearby, is taken to the ground after a police officer points a taser at him. After the second man kneels on the ground, one officer starts kicking him before another wrestles him to the ground and appears to try to constrain his hands behind his back.
    

            Small splatters of blood appear on the floor at the scene.
    

            In another video of the same incident, a female officer is seen clearly in distress, crying and walking away from the scene before being assisted by another officer.
    

            CNN cannot independently verify the events leading up to or directly after the violence captured on video.
    

            The condition of the men following the confrontation is unclear.
    

            Another video shows a man in a gray T-shirt being confronted, pepper-sprayed in the face, and brought to the ground by a police officer who wrapped his arm around the man’s neck as he wrestled him down.
    

            The events captured in the videos sparked protests outside the GMP divisional headquarters in the town of Rochdale on Wednesday evening. Videos from the scene showed large crowds gathering outside the police station, shouting “GMP shame on you.”
    

            On Thursday morning, GMP Assistant Chief Constable Wasim Chaudhry said the protest had concluded safely without any incidents.
    

            “We understand the immense feeling of concern and worry that people feel about our response and fully respect their right to demonstrate their views peacefully,” Chaudhry said.
    

            Some protesters blamed the violent incident on police racism as the officer seen in the video is white and the men being kicked and tasered appear to be Asian.
    

            The campaign group Stand Up To Racism has announced it will hold a demonstration in central Manchester for Thursday night, calling on people to come and “send a clear message that we won’t stay quiet against racist police violence.”
    

            The Muslim Council of Britain, an umbrella body for Muslim-led organizations, said it was “deeply shocked and alarmed” by the footage.
    

            The incident comes of the back of years of allegations of institutional racism in police forces across the country. Last year, an official report into the Metropolitan Police in London accused the organization of perpetuating a misogynistic, sexist, racist and homophobic internal culture.
    

            While the so-called Casey Report focused on the Met, it sparked accusations of institutional racism at other police forces across the United Kingdom, including the GMP.
    

            Manchester Police has previously disclosed several race-related incidents. Just last week, the GMP suspended five officers and put two officers on restricted duties following a report made of racial discrimination in Bury.
    

            A spokesperson for the force said GMP was “deeply concerned by the allegations and will not hesitate to take any action necessary.”
    

            Yaqoob said the two men who are seen in the video are related to a police officer who is currently serving in the Greater Manchester Police force. He said the officer was afraid to go to work as a result of the incident, fearing for his safety.
    

            It is still unclear what happened before the videos were filmed.
    

            In its statement released on X, the police outlined its version of the events that led up to the videos.
    

            The incident started when police were called to Terminal 2 of the airport on Tuesday evening following reports of an assault. When officers confronted the male suspect, three officers were injured in a “violent assault, where they were punched to the ground,” with one female officer ending up with a broken nose, the force said.
    

            Four men have been arrested for assaulting an emergency worker, the statement added.

            “We know that a film of an incident at Manchester Airport that is circulating widely shows an event that is truly shocking, and that people are rightly extremely concerned about,” Chaudhry said in the statement.
    

            “The use of such force in an arrest is an unusual occurrence and one that we understand creates alarm.”
    

            Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said he believes “an issue” on an incoming flight to Manchester Airport led to the scenes shown in the footage.
    

            When the flight landed, two individuals were waiting for their mother, Burnham said. When she arrived, “she pointed somebody out and then there was an altercation in the arrivals hall,” he said.
    

            “And then that individual who was involved in that – or a couple – were followed by cameras through the airport, and then we get to the scene that people have seen, which is in the car park area of Manchester Airport,” he said.
    

            Multiple British politicians condemned the assaults shown in the videos.
    

            Prime Minister Keir Starmer said “understands the concern” over the videos.
    

            British Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said it is “essential” that police “have the trust of communities and the public rightly expect high standards from those in charge of keeping us safe.”
    

            Paul Waugh, the local MP for Rochdale, said in a post on X he is “extremely concerned” by the “appalling” footage from Manchester Airport, noting he has expressed his concerns to police.
    

            The man who was arrested is a Rochdale resident, Waugh said, adding in a later post that he has spoken to the man’s family and will meet them Friday.
    

            UK Home Office Minister Diana Johnson said on X that she was “aware of the disturbing footage” and “understand(s) the public concern it has prompted.”
    

            But not all lawmakers condemned the police actions.
    

            Richard Tice, deputy leader of Reform UK and one of five recently elected MPs for the right-wing populist party, said in a television interview that seeing the video was “not distressing” but rather “reassuring” that police officers were responding to a “serious issue” if they were using such force.

CNN_69,Irish museum pulls Sinéad O’Connor waxwork after just one day due to backlash,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/travel/sinead-oconnor-waxwork-irish-museum-intl-scli/index.html,2024-07-26 23:57:00,world,"
            An Irish museum will withdraw a waxwork of singer-songwriter Sinéad O’Connor just one day after installing it, following a backlash from her family and the public, it told CNN in a statement on Friday.
    

            The National Wax Museum Plus in Dublin unveiled the figure of O’Connor on Thursday to coincide with the first anniversary of her death, but it soon sparked criticism from her brother John O’Connor, who told RTÉ’s Liveline that it “looked nothing like her,” as well as her fans, one of whom described the waxwork as “shockingly bad” in a post on X.
    

            O’Connor, who died from natural causes last year at age 56, was known for her pure and crisp voice, paired with exceptional songwriting that expressed her views on politics, spirituality, history and philosophy.
    

            The success of her music, with singles like “Nothing Compares 2 U,” combined with her openness about her struggles with addiction and mental illness made her an influential pop culture figure, particularly in her native Ireland.
    

            John O’Connor said he “thought (the waxwork) was hideous” and added “a friend of mine said to me last night that he’d seen better in (department store) Shaws, in the window.”
    

            “I lost my sister and to me that’s important,” he said. “Since she’s not here to defend herself or to speak for herself I just took it upon myself to contact you about it.”
    

            In response to the criticism, the museum said it is “launching a new project to create a more accurate representation,” after agreeing that “the figure does not fully capture Sinéad’s unique presence and essence as we intended.”
    

            “Our team of skilled artists will begin this project immediately, ensuring that every detail is meticulously crafted to celebrate her legacy appropriately.”
    

            The museum’s director, Paddy Dunning, who says he was a long-time friend of O’Connor, apologized to the singer’s family on RTÉ’s Liveline. He explained that the waxwork’s sculptor had been feeling unwell and retired after many years of “fantastic work” for the museum.

CNN_71,Trump meeting with Netanyahu for first time since departing White House,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/trump-netanyahu-meeting-mar-a-lago/index.html,2024-07-27 01:43:00,politics,"
            Former President Donald Trump is meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, the first such meeting between the two men since Trump left the White House more than three years ago.
    

            The meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence was requested by Netanyahu, sources familiar with the planning told CNN. It comes on the heels of the prime minister’s address to Congress and meetings with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris at the White House. Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee, conveyed a forcefulness on civilian suffering and ending the war following her time with the prime minister.
    

            Friday marks an opportunity for Trump and Netanyahu to reset relations at critical moments in both the war between Israel and Hamas and the 2024 election cycle.
    

            Trump, who often claims he was the most pro-Israel president in modern history, once touted his close, personal relationship with Netanyahu. However, their relationship has soured in recent years, and the former president has been reluctant to speak with him throughout the ongoing conflict.

            In the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ attack on Israel, Trump criticized Netanyahu for his handling of the war, claiming to Fox News at the time the prime minister and the country overall were “unprepared.”
    

            Part of that criticism, which Trump has continued in the months since, stems from his complicated relationship with Netanyahu, one that a former Trump administration official described as “a love-hate relationship,” who added that the two leaders experienced a dramatic up and down in recent years.
    

            During his administration Trump enacted multiple policies to Israel’s benefit, including moving the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights and backing multiple countries in Middle East and North Africa to normalize relations with Israel as part of the Abraham Accords. Netanyahu called Trump the greatest friend Israel has ever had and heralded him for “unequivocally” standing by Israel during Trump’s tenure as commander in chief.
    

            But the relationship grew bitter after the 2020 presidential election when Netanyahu congratulated Biden on his victory – something that infuriated the former president who considered the move disloyal. “F**k him,” Trump told Axios at the time.
    

            Trump has also claimed that Netanyahu betrayed him in the final months of his presidency, arguing that Israel, at the 11th hour, declined to participate in the 2020 airstrike that killed top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani. Netanyahu “let us down,” Trump said at a rally in October 2023.
    

            Two sources close to Trump, meanwhile, said they are aware of attempted outreach by Netanyahu in recent months, including seeking communications through informal channels.
    

            And in March, Trump allies — led by Keith Kellogg, a leading national security adviser to the former president who also served in the Trump administration — traveled to Israel to discuss the current conflict in Gaza, though the Trump campaign said it had learned of those meetings after the fact.
    

            Many Israelis presume that Trump would give Netanyahu a longer leash to use greater force in Gaza. Trump has said that Israel must “finish what they started,” “get it over with fast,” and that the US must “let Israel finish the job.”
    

            A senior Trump campaign adviser told CNN that Trump’s willingness to meet with Netanyahu despite their fraught relationship shows that Trump “is willing to put any personal or political differences to the side and develop or reconnect with him, to develop a working relationship with him.”
    

            “It shows the evolution of how Trump will conduct himself in a second term,” the adviser added.
    

            Sources familiar with the meeting said that there is no set agenda or overarching message that Trump wants to convey. However, the former president has repeatedly said that, if elected in November, he would seek a speedy end to the conflict in the Middle East without offering details of how he would do so. Instead, he’s argued the war must come to a swift close because the country is “losing the PR war.”
    

            Asked about the meeting during an interview with Fox News on Thursday, Trump said: “I want him to finish up and get it done quickly. You gotta get it done quickly, because they are getting decimated with this publicity. And you know, Israel is not very good at public relations.”
    

            He also asserted during the interview that the October 7 attack wouldn’t have happened if he were president, a claim he repeats frequently on the campaign trail.
    

            Arab Americans who have said they will support Trump will also be watching the meeting on Friday closely, they told CNN. They were “saddened and bewildered” when Trump called Biden a Palestinian in a derogatory manner during the debate last month, said Bishara Bahbah, who lives in Arizona and has worked to rally the Arab-American community for Trump after the lifelong Democrat soured on Biden over his approach to the Israel-Hamas war.
    

            Bahbah, however, has maintained support for Trump despite the derogatory rhetoric toward Palestinians last month. He pointed to Trump’s move to share a recent letter on his social media platform from Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas ahead of Friday’s meeting. The letter was sent after the assassination attempt on the 2024 Republican presidential nominee.
    

            “Looking forward to seeing Bibi Netanyahu on Friday, and even more forward to achieving Peace in the Middle East!” Trump posted to Truth Social with the letter.
    

            In posting that engagement with Abbas, Trump was trying to “strike a balance” going into the meeting, Bahbah said, adding that he hopes Trump will come out of the Netanyahu meeting calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire.
    

            Jewish supporters of Trump are hoping the former president asks Netanyahu what he needs to win the ongoing war, explained Lee Zeldin, a Jewish Republican and Trump supporter.
    

            “At the table, the most important question is asking the prime minister what he needs to win. What does Israel need that they don’t yet have?” Zeldin, a former congressman, said. “That conversation about ensuring victory and pursuing a lasting peace is the most important fundamental threshold in my opinion.”
    

            Zeldin added that Jewish Americans will be watching the meeting closely because they hope that Trump, if he were to win the November election, would “pick up where he left off” in terms of putting policies into place that support Israel.
    

            Trump finds himself in a distinct position given he was president just over three years ago and has longstanding relations with many of the foreign leaders now arriving on his doorstep.
    

            He has met with a series of foreign leaders in recent months, including hosting Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and British Foreign Secretary David Cameron at Mar-a-Lago, and dining with Polish President Andrzej Duda and former Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso at Trump Tower in New York during his hush money trial, among other meetings. He has also spoken by phone with several world leaders, including with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is currently working with the US to normalize relations with Israel.
    

            The Trump adviser argued that the meetings reflect the reality of the former president’s poll numbers, adding that many foreign leaders want to ensure they have strong ties to him in the event he wins in November.
    

            “It could signify that they think Trump is best positioned to be the next president, and they want to get a head start on developing a real relationship with him,” the adviser said.

CNN_72,How Doug Emhoff is amplifying his wife’s historic presidential bid,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/doug-emhoff-kamala-harris-2024-bid/index.html,2024-07-27 01:38:00,politics,"
            Confronted with a barrage of negative social media posts from former President Donald Trump aimed at his wife, second gentleman Doug Emhoff eschewed machismo or defensiveness.
    

            “That’s all he got?” he said Tuesday of the attacks on Vice President Kamala Harris, the new and historic presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.
    

            His response in that off-the-cuff moment offered insight into the Harris-Emhoff dynamic: The second gentleman is uniquely positioned to confidently serve in a supporting role to a woman vying to the most powerful person in the country.
    

            Emhoff has spent the last four years getting comfortable with being the first – serving as the first “second gentleman,” an unelected role with no manual and an automatic global platform. But with his wife’s swift ascension to presumptive nominee, he is now auditioning for another first: the potential first gentleman to the first woman president.

            And the second gentleman’s role is coming into sharper focus: Harris’ hype man, her closest confidante and best surrogate, and an ally amplifying her historic position and message on reproductive rights.
    

            Already an active presence on the campaign trail, Emhoff is expected to continue his work supporting Harris’ candidacy across the country at campaign and fundraising events, in addition to his official duties, an Emhoff spokesperson told CNN.
    

            “There has been life breathed into the Democratic campaign for president and they do not have one minute to waste or lose. And so you are going to put out your biggest guns on this – and he is just important a surrogate as anyone,” said Anita McBride, who served as a top aide to former first lady Laura Bush.
    

            Emhoff is stepping in for first lady Jill Biden to headline a trio of previously scheduled New England fundraisers in Yarmouth, Maine, and Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts. On Martha’s Vineyard, he’ll be in conversation with former late night host David Letterman.
    

            He is also expected to headline a rescheduled Jill Biden fundraiser aimed at Americans living abroad in Paris, when he leads the US delegation to the Olympics closing ceremony next month.
    

            He will hit the trail for other campaign events in the coming days and weeks as well, including Wausau and Stevens Point, Wisconsin, on Saturday.

            Emhoff, Harris campaign spokesperson Seth Schuster added, “will be a vigorous and active campaigner, speaking directly to our coalition about the issues they care most about and mobilizing the voters who will decide this election to ensure that Vice President Harris becomes President Harris.”
    

            Emhoff has carved a portfolio for himself in the past three-and-a-half years, focused on advocating for gender equity, fighting antisemitism, and promoting justice and equality in the legal system. He stepped down from a beloved decades-long career as a lawyer focused on media, entertainment, and intellectual property, opting to teach at Georgetown Law instead. He’s served as an emissary on trips abroad and has spent significant time on the campaign trail. He is also the father of two adult children.
    

            In the days since President Joe Biden stepped aside from his reelection campaign and endorsed Harris, Emhoff has offered a preview of how he will approach the role in the coming months – an extension of the work he was already doing, now under a bigger microscope.
    

            On Tuesday, Emhoff proceeded with an appearance scheduled before the whirlwind events propelling his wife to the top of the ticket, visiting a reproductive health care clinic in McLean, Virginia.
    

            “It was important for me to be here today. I just wanted to make sure we kept this on the schedule,” he told fellow participants, going on to lambast what he cast as the “post-Dobbs hellscape that Donald Trump created.” He discussed the importance of abortion access for women – and the need for family planning resources for men, as well.
    

            And Monday, he leaned into a cheerleader role as he introduced the vice president at her Wilmington, Delaware, campaign headquarters.
    

            “I get to support my wife, Kamala Harris, running for president of the United States. Let me tell you: We are going to win this election,” Emhoff said, hyping her up to a receptive crowd of staff. “We have an amazing team, you have done an amazing job, and you’re gonna continue to do that so we can elect Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States of America.”
    

            Emhoff has also made history as the first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president, and his efforts to combat antisemitism have taken on new urgency amid the Hamas-Israel conflict, serving as one of the administration’s most vocal messengers on the issue and meeting with key stakeholders.
    

            While Emhoff has said it’s not what he “expected to be doing” as second gentleman, he views his role amplifying the administration’s strategy to combat antisemitism as one of “responsibility” and “accountability.”
    

            “I take it very seriously,” he said during a Yom Kippur conversation last year, calling on Jewish Americans to “be proud you’re Jewish – and just have joy in it, and just live openly and proudly.”
    

            He will be key to bolstering her support with that coalition – and joined a Zoom call Wednesday afternoon hosted by the Jewish Democratic Council of America and Jewish Women for Kamala, seeking to clarify the vice president’s stance on Israel.
    

            “Let me just make this clear: The vice president has been and will be a strong supporter of Israel as a secure democratic and Jewish state, and she will always ensure that Israel can defend itself, period. Because that’s who Kamala Harris is,” Emhoff said.
    

            As the husband of a presumptive presidential nominee, Emhoff is offering voters a modern model of what it can mean to be a husband in 2024.
    

            “He’s a wife guy, and he owns it,” said Capricia Marshall, who served as US chief of protocol during the Obama administration and White House social secretary during the Clinton administration.
    

            “He doesn’t shirk that – he embraces it – and that’s magic for a campaign,” Marshall added.
    

            As he supports his wife in her quest to make history as the nation’s first female president, Emhoff has shared his own thoughts on masculinity and gender dynamics, telling CNN’s Dana Bash in a 2022 interview that he actively thinks about destigmatizing spousal roles.
    

            “I’m here because I’m her husband. I’m here to support her,” he told Bash at the time. “I’ll be giving speeches and one of the things I say is, ‘Men need to support women.’ One, it’s the right thing to do, then, man, OK you need to actually do it. … If I can set an example doing it, I’m very grateful for that.”
    

            He added, “Masculinity is loving your family, caring about your family, and being there for your family.”
    

            McBride said that Emhoff will be key to showing voters that there is a source of personal support behind Harris in her pursuit of the presidency.
    

            “This is a person who is confident in who he is, what he’s accomplished in his life. This is an extraordinary period in their life as a couple: her role as a major party candidate,” she said.
    

            Emhoff’s time as second gentleman could offer a blueprint for how he would approach the East Wing if his wife is elected.
    

            “He’s kind of balanced the role of being the supportive spouse, maintaining a personal professional role, and then also taking over some leadership of a presidential initiative. So I think that gives you a fairly good indication of if he now would move into a precedent-setting first gentleman role,” McBride said.
    

            Like Jill Biden before him, Emhoff has already learned the structure of a White House, how to live with full-time security and how to navigate a ceremonial leadership role that puts him on the world stage.
    

            Should Harris win this November, Emhoff would inherit a role that includes a long tradition of entertaining on a global stage and welcoming visitors to the People’s House.
    

            Marshall, the former chief of protocol, told CNN that Emhoff could be instrumental in a potential Harris administration’s diplomacy and helping the White House evolve.
    

            “How you entertain and welcome someone and show respect for them are powerful tools for engagement in international diplomacy. … He will understand what President Harris will be trying to achieve and why it’s important, including what they can add and emphasize in this new way of entertaining that would feel more in line with the times,” Marshall said.
    

            But above all, Marshall said, his role would be defined by supporting his wife through the challenges of the American presidency.
    

            “This first gentleman role is being a supportive spouse and understanding better than anyone the administration’s goals and how to go about best achieving that,” she said.

CNN_73,Harris’ team rejects Israeli notion that her comments could harm ceasefire talks,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/harris-team-netanyahu-meeting-reaction/index.html,2024-07-27 01:03:00,politics,"
            Vice President Kamala Harris’ office on Friday is rejecting a suggestion from a senior Israeli official that the vice president’s remarks on Thursday that forcefully criticized Israel’s conduct in its war against Hamas could have made a ceasefire deal harder to reach.
    

            “I don’t know what they’re talking about,” a Harris aide told CNN, in response to a senior Israeli official being quoted in The Times of Israel: “Hopefully the remarks Harris made in her press conference won’t be interpreted by Hamas as daylight between the US and Israel, thereby making a deal harder to secure.”
    

            Harris declared that she would “not be silent” about the suffering in Gaza amid the war after her meeting with Netanyahu. She also said that Israel has a right to defend itself but “how it does so matters,” staking out her lane as an empathetic and strong voice for the Palestinian suffering, just days after she became the presumptive Democratic nominee for president.
    

            But the vice president’s office on Friday sought to clarify that her message to Netanyahu behind closed doors mirrored that of Biden.
    

            “President Biden and Vice President Harris delivered the same message in their private meetings to Prime Minister Netanyahu: it is time to get the ceasefire and hostage deal done,” an aide to the vice president told reporters, adding that the meeting was “serious and collegial.”
    

            Harris has already made some public comments about the ongoing Israel-Hamas war that had a similar tone to her remarks after the Netanyahu meeting on Thursday. She emphasized the need for an “immediate ceasefire” in March, taking a long pause before adding the rest of the approved sentence: “for at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table.”
    

            Harris’s office pointed out that her comments on Thursday “tracked with her previous comments on the conflict.”
    

            “She started with rock-solid support for Israel and then she expressed her concern about civilian causalities and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, as she always does,” said the aide, responding to reporters’ questions.
    

            But her comments marked the first time that she spoke about the conflict since becoming the presumptive republican nominee as she is faced with the challenge of defining her position on the politically charged issue of the Israel-Hamas war.
    

            Her remarks on Thursday were not a major surprise to some administration officials who have been privy to her team’s views in interagency meetings.
    

            Multiple US officials say that Harris’ team has often advocated for putting more pressure on Israel during interagency conversations over the course of recent months since October 7. For example, Harris’s aides have been advocates for sanctions on violent Israeli settlers in the West Bank, one source said.
    

            Harris’s aides have also opposed the idea of possible low-level engagement with far-right members of Netanyahu’s Cabinet – such as Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir – making the case that engagement would be elevating their views, one official said. So far, the Biden administration has decided against reaching out to them.
    

            Biden administration officials acknowledged that there might be some tension in the coming weeks as Harris develops her voice and her policy on the Israel-Hamas war. She has created that tension within the administration in the past on this issue. But now, they say that the tension could be worth it, given the ultimate goal of trying to draw in voters as she is at the top of the Democratic presidential ticket.
    

            “She’s not substantively different than the president, but she’s tonally different,” one administration source told CNN.
    

            A close friend familiar with Harris’ views expected “zero” chance she would break with Biden on policy, while acknowledging the opportunity for her to introduce more nuance, especially now that she’s the party’s candidate. “She’s allowed to support Israel but also want the war to end.”
    

            Arab American leaders say that throughout the course of the Israel-Hamas war, Harris’ team has been “much more responsive” to the frustrations of their community when it comes to the Biden administration’s policies.
    

            “Harris and her office threw us a lifeline early on,” Dr. James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute. “I spoke with her and she demonstrated compassion and empathy. She wanted to know what she could do to be responsive to our concerns.”

CNN_74,"Man accused of stabbing author Salman Rushdie pleads not guilty to federal terrorism-related counts, lawyer says",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/us/salman-rushdie-stabbing-suspect-terrorism-charges/index.html,2024-07-27 01:20:00,us,"
            The man accused of stabbing author Salman Rushdie was charged with three federal terrorism-related counts, according to a grand jury indictment unsealed Wednesday.
    

            Hadi Matar is charged with committing an act of terrorism transcending national boundaries, attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization and providing material support to terrorists.
    

            He pleaded not guilty, attorney Nathaniel Barone said.
    

            In August 2022, Rushdie was stabbed several times onstage shortly before he was due to deliver a lecture at the Chautauqua Institution in New York. Matar has already pleaded not guilty to state charges of second-degree attempted murder and second-degree assault in connection with the stabbing.

Man accused of stabbing renowned author Salman Rushdie rejects plea deal that tied in federal terrorism-related charge


            Federal authorities allege in the unsealed grand jury indictment that Matar attempted to provide material support and resources – including “himself, and services” to “a designated foreign terrorist organization, namely, Hizbollah,” according to the four-page indictment.
    

            The indictment alleges Matar “did knowingly attempt to kill, and did knowingly maim, commit an assault resulting in serious bodily injury, and assault with a dangerous weapon, a person within the United States.” It does not mention Rushdie by name.
    

            In a news release Friday, the US Attorney’s Office for the Western District of New York said Matar did this in an attempt “to carry out a fatwa calling for the execution of Rushdie, which he understood was endorsed by Hizbollah.”
    

            Matar was motivated, in part, by a 2006 speech given by Hizbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, in which Nasrallah endorsed the fatwa calling for Rushdie’s death, which was originally issued in 1989, the statement from the US Attorney’s office said.
    

            Matar recently rejected a state plea deal that would have tied in a federal terrorism-related charge and reduced his state prison sentence.
    

            Barone previously told CNN his client “has maintained his innocence, not only on the state charges, but will continue to maintain his innocence on the federal charges as well.”
    

            “In addition, Mr. Matar will exercise any and all of his fundamental and constitutional rights in defending this matter to the fullest,” Barone said.
    

            Matar’s next appearance in federal court is scheduled for August 7. If convicted of the federal charges, he could face life in prison, his attorney said.
    

            Matar is due to appear in state court in October, according to Barone.
    

            Rushdie, 77, has garnered widespread acclaim and scrutiny for his literary work. His fourth novel, “The Satanic Verses,” drew condemnation from some Muslims who found it to be sacrilegious.
    

            The late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who described the book as an insult to Islam and Prophet Mohammed, issued the religious decree, or fatwa, calling for Rushdie’s death in 1989.

CNN_75,Dow surges more than 600 points as the stock market gears up for rate cuts,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/investing/stocks-rate-cuts-inflation-fed/index.html,2024-07-27 01:46:00,us,"
            Wall Street is undergoing a palpable vibe shift.
    

            Strong corporate earnings have helped stocks notch repeated record highs in 2024, despite stubborn inflation forcing investors to dial down their expectations for how many times the Fed will cut rates this year.
    

            But cooling inflation data in recent weeks has led Wall Street to bet that the Federal Reserve will finally cut interest rates in September — and that there are now more options for gains beyond just the Big Tech stocks that have dominated the market this year.
    

            Data released Friday morning showed the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, slowed to 2.5% for the 12 months ended in June — another sign for hopeful investors that inflation is continuing to ease from its four-decade high.
    

            The Dow jumped 624 points, or 1.6%, on Friday after soaring more than 800 points earlier in the session. The S&P 500 gained 1.2% and the Nasdaq Composite added 1%.
    

            Economic data has also remained remarkably resilient even as rates stay at a 23-year high. That, coupled with the slowdown in inflation, has raised hopes that the central bank could tame prices without triggering a recession, a feat it has achieved just once since the 1990s, according to some economists. Data Thursday showed the economy expanded at a robust 2.8% annualized rate during the second quarter, blowing past economists’ expectations.
    

            Wall Street will get more clues about the Fed’s next moves at its policy meeting next week, where the central bank is expected to hold rates steady. While the Fed has penciled in just one rate cut for this year, traders are betting on up to three, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.
    

            Brightening prospects for rate cuts typically signal good news for stocks, since the market tends to do better when higher borrowing rates don’t weigh down companies’ balance sheets. But you wouldn’t know that from the carnage in stocks this week.

Nasdaq and S&P 500 log worst day since 2022 after Alphabet and Tesla fail to impress Wall Street


            While the market was broadly higher on Friday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Wednesday logged their worst daily performances since 2022. Both indexes are on track to end the week lower, while the Dow is on pace for a gain.
    

            The reason behind the selloff: Investors are shedding shares of the Magnificent Seven tech stalwarts that have dominated the market for the past two years, and their large weighting has dragged down the major indexes. Tech companies make up 32% of the total market capitalization, the highest level since the late 1990s, according to MRB Partners data as of June 28.
    

            An underwhelming start to the earnings season for the cohort has only intensified its declines: Tesla shares tumbled 12.3% on Wednesday after the electric vehicle-maker reported a more than 40% plunge in profits the prior evening. Alphabet shares slipped 5% after beating earnings expectations but missing analysts’ expectations for YouTube advertising revenue.
    

            One area that has benefited recently from the prospect of lower rates is small-cap stocks.
    

            Shares of smaller companies tend to perform poorly when rates are high, since they have more floating rate debt than their larger counterparts. But they have historically tended to perform well when the Fed begins easing its high borrowing rates.
    

            The Russell 2000 index, which tracks the performance of small-cap stocks, has gained 10.1% so far this month, outperforming the S&P 500’s 0.02% gain.
    

            Investors are also picking at other areas of the market poised to gain when rates come down. Stephen Lee, founding principal at Logan Capital, said his firm added to its position in homebuilder stocks earlier this quarter, betting that cooling inflation would allow the Fed to cut rates and ease the ultra-tight housing market.
    

            Sky-high interest rates have led homeowners to hold off on selling their homes to keep their pandemic-era low mortgage rates even as demand surged, driving up home prices to record levels.
    

            Investors have fretted over the past year that the market’s gains are beholden to just a handful of tech stocks, making the rally more vulnerable to pullbacks a few stocks stumble. The Magnificent Seven drove about 60% of the S&P 500’s total return during the first half of the year, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial.
    

            The recent gain in small-caps is making some investors hopeful that the market rally will continue to broaden.
    

            There are signs that the pain in tech shares might not be over yet. Tech stocks’ steep losses following tepid quarterly results from Alphabet and Tesla suggest that investors are growing impatient with companies investing hefty sums into artificial intelligence with little to show for it in terms of revenue gains.
    

            Many big tech firms have released AI chatbots and other flashy consumer tools since OpenAI’s ChatGPT kicked off the AI arms race two years ago, but the path to monetizing the technology remains unclear.
    

            On Alphabet’s Tuesday earnings call, UBS analyst Stephen Ju noted that the initial use cases of the AI models that Big Tech firms have invested in building “are more on the cost savings or efficiency side.”
    

            “When do you think we’ll start thinking about products that can help revenue generation for the Fortune 500, Fortune 1000 companies, which is probably something that can, hopefully, create greater value over time, versus just cutting costs?” Ju said.
    

            As the AI arms race continues to heat up, companies are unlikely to slow their spending on AI. But it’s unclear when those investments will provide a boost to their balance sheets.
    

            “The risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us here,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said on the call.

            “Inside the NBA” host Charles Barkley on Friday condemned the NBA’s rejection of a matching offer from TNT’s parent company to broadcast the league’s games for the next decade, blasting the NBA for prioritizing “money over the fans.”
    

            In a statement posted on his Instagram account, Barkley wrote, “clearly the NBA has wanted to break with us from the beginning. I’m not sure TNT ever had a chance.”
    

            “TNT matched the money, but the league knows Amazon and these tech companies are the only ones willing to pay for the rights when they double in the future,” Barkley added. “The NBA didn’t want to piss them off. It’s a sad day when owners and commissioners choose money over the fans. It just sucks.”

WBD takes NBA to court in legal showdown over broadcast rights


            The comments came after the NBA on Wednesday rejected an offer from Warner Bros. Discovery to match Amazon’s $1.8 billion per year bid to carry the league’s games starting with the 2025-26 season. The decision set up a potential legal showdown between the NBA and WBD, the parent company of TNT and CNN, which maintains it has matching rights to any broadcast offer.
    

            Barkley, who hosts the iconic TNT program “Inside the NBA” alongside Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith and Shaquille O’Neal, has remained mostly mum on the situation since he condemned WBD executives in May for “screw[ing] this thing up.”
    

            “These people I work with, they screwed this thing up — clearly,” Barkley unloaded.
    

            On Friday, Barkley told The Athletic that he would field offers from NBC, ESPN, and Prime Video — with whom he said he has recently spoken with — unless WBD can guarantee his 10-year, $210 million contract will be paid.
    

            “My thing was, ‘Wait, y’all f— up, I didn’t f— up, why do I have to take a pay cut,’” Barkley said.
    

            While Barkley said that Johnson wouldn’t switch networks, he told The Athletic that he hasn’t spoken to O’Neal or Smith about their intentions pending outside offers.
    

            “It’s going to all go to streaming in 11 years,” Barkley said of sports media rights, calling the entire affair a “cash grab” because “in 11 years nobody’s going to be able to afford these rights by streaming.”
    

            “They’re kind of getting their cake and eating it, too,” Barkley said of the NBA. “They got ESPN and NBC and they got streaming.”
    

            In a statement Wednesday, WBD criticized the NBA’s decision to reject its matching offer, saying it had “grossly misinterpreted” its contractual rights and vowed to take “appropriate action.”
    

            “We have matched the Amazon offer, as we have a contractual right to do, and do not believe the NBA can reject it,” a TNT spokesperson said in a statement. “In doing so, they are rejecting the many fans who continue to show their unwavering support for our best-in-class coverage, delivered through the full combined reach of WBD’s video-first distribution platforms — including TNT, home to our four-decade partnership with the league, and Max, our leading streaming service. We think they have grossly misinterpreted our contractual rights with respect to the 2025-26 season and beyond, and we will take appropriate action.”
    

            WBD executives have suggested in recent weeks that if the NBA declined to accept its matching offer it could bring a lawsuit to enforce its contractual rights to match another bid.
    

            The months of dealmaking and uncertainty over the NBA media rights had set off alarms both inside and out of WBD, raising the prospect that TNT Sports’ nearly four decades as an NBA partner and home to the beloved “Inside the NBA” show could come to an end.
    

            The league said Wednesday that its new 11-year media deal with Amazon will complement its latest slate of broadcast, cable, and streaming agreements, which were also inked with NBCUniversal and Disney, worth a combined $77 billion.
    

            “Our new global media agreements with Disney, NBCUniversal and Amazon will maximize the reach and accessibility of NBA games for fans in the United States and around the world,” Adam Silver, the NBA commissioner, said in a statement. “These partners will distribute our content across a wide range of platforms and help transform the fan experience over the next decade.”

            Warner Bros. Discovery has filed a lawsuit against the NBA over the league’s rejection of its offer to match Amazon’s bid to broadcast NBA games for the next decade.
    

            The suit, which was filed Thursday under seal in New York County Supreme Court, comes less than 48 hours after the NBA officially rejected WBD’s matching offer, instead entering into new 11-year contracts with NBCUniversal, Disney and Amazon, starting with the 2025-26 season.
    

            “Given the NBA’s unjustified rejection of our matching of a third-party offer, we have taken legal action to enforce our rights,” a WBD spokesperson said in a statement. “We strongly believe this is not just our contractual right, but also in the best interest of fans who want to keep watching our industry-leading NBA content with the choice and flexibility we offer them through our widely distributed WBD video-first distribution platforms - including TNT and Max.”
    

            Mike Bass, an NBA spokesperson, responded to the lawsuit Friday, saying it is “without merit and our lawyers will address them.”

            Under the new agreements, national games will be distributed across Amazon Prime Video, NBC broadcast network and Peacock streaming service, and Disney’s ABC and ESPN platforms. Some 75 regular-season games will be broadcast on TV seasonally.
    

            “Our new global media agreements with Disney, NBCUniversal and Amazon will maximize the reach and accessibility of NBA games for fans in the United States and around the world,” Adam Silver, the NBA commissioner, said in a statement Wednesday. “These partners will distribute our content across a wide range of platforms and help transform the fan experience over the next decade.”
    

            The widely expected lawsuit from WBD, the parent company of TNT and CNN, comes after executives at the media conglomerate suggested in recent weeks that it would likely take legal action against the NBA to enforce matching rights in its existing contract. But the league on Wednesday said WBD “did not match the terms” of its deal with Amazon.
    

            “Warner Bros. Discovery’s most recent proposal did not match the terms of Amazon Prime Video’s offer and, therefore, we have entered into a long-term arrangement with Amazon,” the NBA said.
    

            WBD sharply criticized the league’s decision, saying it had “grossly misinterpreted” its contractual rights and vowed to take “appropriate action.”
    

            “We have matched the Amazon offer, as we have a contractual right to do, and do not believe the NBA can reject it,” a TNT spokesperson said in a statement. “In doing so, they are rejecting the many fans who continue to show their unwavering support for our best-in-class coverage, delivered through the full combined reach of WBD’s video-first distribution platforms — including TNT, home to our four-decade partnership with the league, and Max, our leading streaming service.

CNN_78,Spicy dispute over the origins of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos winds up in court,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/business/flamin-hot-cheetos-pepsico-lawsuit/index.html,2024-07-27 01:18:00,us,"
            A court case could soon settle a spicy dispute: Who invented Flamin’ Hot Cheetos?
    

            A former PepsiCo executive is suing the company, saying it destroyed his career after questioning his claim that he invented the popular flavor of Cheetos snacks.
    

PepsiCo said Thursday it has no comment on the lawsuit, which was filed July 18 in California Superior Court.
    

            According to his lawsuit, Richard Montañez began working for PepsiCo as a janitor at its Frito-Lay plant in Ranch Cucamonga, California, in 1977. Montañez was the son of a Mexican immigrant and grew up in a migrant labor camp.
    

            One day, a machine in Montañez’s plant broke down, leaving a batch of unflavored Cheetos. Montañez says he took the batch home and dusted them with chili powder, trying to replicate the flavor of elote, the popular grilled seasoned corn served in Mexico.
    

            In 1991, Montañez asked for a meeting with PepsiCo CEO Roger Enrico to pitch his spicy Cheetos, confident they would be a hit with the Latino community. Enrico granted the meeting, liked the presentation and directed the company to develop spicy Cheetos, according to the lawsuit.
    

            Montañez said PepsiCo sent him on speaking engagements and actively promoted his story. But in the meantime, Montañez claims the company’s research and development department shut him out of its discussions and testing.
    

            PepsiCo introduced Flamin’ Hot Cheetos in 1992.
    

Montañez says he continued to develop spicy snacks, like Flamin’ Hot Popcorn and Lime and Chili Fritos, and in 2000 he was promoted to a business development manager in Southern California. Montañez eventually became PepsiCo’s vice president of multicultural marketing and sales.
    

            Montañez said demand for speaking engagements was so great that he retired from PepsiCo in 2019 to become a motivational speaker full time. He published a memoir in 2021 and his life story was made into a movie, “Flamin’ Hot,” in 2023.
    

            But according to the lawsuit, PepsiCo turned on Montañez in 2021, cooperating with a Los Angeles Times piece that claimed others in the company were already working on spicy snacks when Montañez approached them, and that they – not Montañez – came up with the name, “Flamin’ Hot.”
    

            Montañez said PepsiCo’s about-face has hurt his speaking career and other potential opportunities, including a documentary about his life.
    

            He is seeking damages for discrimination, fraud and defamation.

CNN_80,Giant pink man causes stir in small Welsh town,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/style/xue-minjun-inflatable-wales-intl-scli-gbr/index.html,2024-07-27 00:11:00,world,"
            A large, pink, inflatable man, created by the Chinese contemporary artist Yue Minjun, has divided opinion in a small town in Wales.
    

            The 13-meter- (43-foot-) tall inflatable, which depicts the artist himself laughing, while leaning on all fours on a big, white ball, has been displayed on the front lawn of a school in the town of Ruthin since June 24.
    

            “The image represents the boredom of Chinese society during the rise of consumerism and economic reform in the early 1990s,” the centuries-old Ruthin School said in a post on Facebook.
    

            Yue’s work, in particular his many grinning self-portraits, have become among the most recognizable pieces of Chinese contemporary art.

            Ruthin School principal Frances King told CNN that Yue’s work has a “deep philosophical understanding,” aiming to “provoke a response in people” and make them think about “where you are in the world and what’s around you.”
    

            “It’s meant to just make you stop and think what’s going on there – and that’s been exactly what’s happening,” King added.
    

            She said the school’s students “love it” are “really quite fond” of the large inflatable man.
    

            Yue’s work has sold for millions, prompting King to joke that the school have a “very expensive big balloon” on a field previously used for rugby.
    

            “We’ve had mixed responses, where some people are saying ‘what a monstrosity,’” the principal acknowledged, before commenting that, nevertheless, “it is livening up your life.”
    

            The inflatable has drawn a range of reactions in the town, with some lauding the work and others expressing skepticism.
    

            A local resident, who didn’t want to be named, told CNN the inflatable is “absolutely wonderful,” noting that it has been “produced by a world-renowned artist” and has therefore “been a fantastic advertising focal point” for the town, which is about 150 miles north of the Welsh capital, Cardiff. The resident added that while “there have been mixed opinions,” they consider the installation “fantastic.”

            Gina Moorcroft, who works at a clothing store in Ruthin, concurred with this assessment of what she described as the “eye-catching” artwork, commenting: “It’s amazing, it’s interesting.”
    

            But others are not so sure. Another local resident told CNN the inflatable is “a bit odd for an art installation,” while a local barber aid opinions differed, explaining that he had heard both positive and negative reaction.
    

            “Our first reaction was what on earth, why is there a giant inflatable of a man on all fours on the grounds of a school?” Angela Louise Sersa, who lives nearby, explained. “It’s just more weirdness in the world we’re living in.”
    

            The inflatable was created by Yue for the Ruthin International Arts Festival, which began on June 28 and ends on Sunday.
    

            The arts festival says on its website that it has aimed to create “spaces where international creativity can flourish within the local and cultural soils of Ruthin,” featuring the work of artists, directors, poets and creators from more than 40 countries.
    

            The large inflatable will be removed from the school’s premises when the festival ends.

CNN_81,"The IOC says the Olympic Games has reached gender parity, but historic gender inequality still lingers",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/sport/olympic-games-gender-parity-paris-2024-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-27 00:41:00,world,"
            Three years before the Olympics last visited Paris in 1924, a small gathering of female athletes led by Alice Milliat staged their own Games as they were still largely excluded from the biggest sporting event in the world.
    

            Female athletes competing at the Games was simply not “in keeping” with how Pierre de Coubertin envisioned the event he revived in 1896, an event he saw as an “exaltation of male athleticism … with the applause of women as a reward,” as he wrote in 1912.


            Now, a century later in the French capital, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has distributed its quota places equally in the hope that an equal number of male and female athletes would compete at an Olympic Games for the very first time, though it fell just short of that target as ultimately 5630 male athletes and 5416 female athletes will compete in Paris.
    

            Still, women representing 49% of the total athlete population marks another step for gender equality in sport, one that has been celebrated as part of the increasing popularity of women’s sports and comes as the IOC attempts to address sexist media coverage and improve the support available for parent athletes. But at the same time, beyond the numbers, activists and academics point out that historic inequalities still linger at the Olympics, influencing everything from the small proportion of female coaches present to attitudes toward women’s clothing.
    

            “Parity is one part of equality, but it isn’t equality,” Michele Donnelly, assistant professor of sport management at Brock University who specializes in gender equality at the Olympics, told CNN Sport. “It’s the numerical piece, but it’s not the conditions, status, experience piece that is still missing from large parts of athlete’s experiences at the Games.”
    

            Nonetheless, at the same time as the Olympics targets reaching gender parity among its athletes, there is a “buzz right now with women’s sport,” soccer player Emily Sonnett told CNN.
    

            It is part of moment when the growth of women’s sport is “unreal,” as Olympic volleyball player Jordan Larson told CNN, and headlines in the USA are dominated by figures like Caitlin Clark, Simone Biles and Nelly Korda.
    

            And with the biggest ever proportion of female athletes competing on sport’s biggest stage spotlighted by “two weeks of major media coverage where the entire world is tuning in to watch,” it will have wide-reaching consequences outside sport too, Katrina Adams, the IOC’s Gender Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Champion for 2023, and the first ever Black woman to be President and CEO of the United States Tennis Association (USTA), told CNN Sport.
    

            “I think that’s going to elevate how people are thinking about it, how people are looking at it, how the sponsors are looking at it, how businesspeople are looking at it and how the focus is going to say, wow, we really have to start to look at our sport different and our business different and how we address gender equality,” she says.
    

            Getting closer to this landmark of gender equality is “incredibly important,” Olympic weightlifter Jourdan Delacruz told CNN.
    

            “It’s kind of shocking that it’s 2024 and we’re only just now getting here but I think it means not only that women are becoming better competitors but from the grassroots level, there’s more access, … there’s more representation that encourages girls and women to get into sport,” she said.
    

            Women were prohibited from competing, and spectating, at the first ever modern Olympics in 1896, and then only allowed to participate in sports deemed suitable for them such as tennis, golf or equestrian.


            It wasn’t until 2012 that the IOC allowed women to compete in all sports and 2014 that the organization committed to achieving gender parity among athletes at the Olympics, setting itself a series of targets to reach this milestone.


            “They’ve really developed a roadmap and a plan that leads us to the place that we’re at this summer in the Paris Olympics,” Nicole LaVoi, director of the Tucker Center for Research on Girls & Women in Sport, told CNN. “There’s been some metrics and some accountability in terms of reaching these target metrics and one was equal participation so that’s really important.”
    

            Over time, the number of female athletes at the Olympics has increased, rising from 11.4% of athletes in 1960, to 28.9% in 1996, 44.2% in 2016 before this opportunity for gender parity in 2024.
    

            “We fought hard to be here, and I just want to say thank you to those in the past because you guys fought hard for me to be here right now,” US Olympic boxer Morelle McCane told CNN. “Just seeing all the love pour into women’s sport, it just opens up all these avenues. It’s beautiful.” 


Part of the IOC’s strategy to reach gender parity has involved tweaking its program of events, in some cases by cutting male-only events like the 50km race walk in favor of a mixed gender marathon relay instead. In Paris, there will be slightly fewer women’s events than men’s events – 152 compared to 157 – as well as 20 mixed gender events.
    

            And tangible images of gender equality will be emblazoned on TV screens around the world at these Olympics. The IOC has encouraged each country to have a male and female flagbearer at the opening ceremony, like in Tokyo when 91% of participating countries had a female flagbearer – a “subtle” but “major” shift, said Adams.


            The organization has also reordered the broadcast schedule so that women’s events will run during peak viewing times and provided direction to producers to encourage a “gender equal and fair portrayal,” while the Olympic Broadcasting Services have increased the number of female commentators employed to 40% of its total. 


            Whether such steps have an impact remains to be seen – female athletes were about 10 times more likely than their male counterparts to be visually objectified by a camera angle at the Tokyo Olympics, according to a report conducted by The Representation Project.


            And for athletes with children, there will be positive changes at this Olympics too, even if athletes rather than organizers are often the driving force behind them. Following pressure, most notably from French judo star Clarisse Agbegnenou, French Olympic Committee secretary general Astrid Guyart told reporters that breastfeeding athletes would be able to stay in hotels nearby the Olympic Village with their infants, per local media.


            A nursery on site in the Olympic village for athletes will also provide space for athlete parents to spend time with their children.
    

            But as female athletes are achieving gender parity on the field of play, female representation in the boardroom and among coaches, where power is concentrated, still lags behind.
    

            Just 13% of coaches who attended the Tokyo Olympics were women, a number that is widely expected to rise but still remain low in Paris.


            “If you look at women in coaching … you’re going to see a small percentage compared to men being in that role because since sports have started, it’s been a men’s play until women have had to start showing we can do great things as coaches and athletes … and we’re starting to see that shift,” Mechelle Lewis Freeman – a former Olympian and now the head women’s relay coach for the USA’s Track and Field Team – told CNN.
    

            Freeman is the first woman to hold that post, she says, adding that the societal norms which traditionally prevented women from holding such leadership roles in sport are beginning to break down, particularly as their work “speaks for themselves.”
    

            “Now you’re starting to see … the spaces being created,” she said. “Because the talent was always there … and so now you’re having that space for you to be able to demonstrate and show that, yes, women can do this too.”
    

            With still such a low proportion of female coaches, they have taken to creating their own support systems, outside of their national federations and the IOC. Vicky Huyton, founder of the Female Coaching Network, has created a WhatsApp group for 52 of the world’s best female coaches to support one another, and share advice as well as vent about a system that still discriminates against women.
    

            “We’ve got women who have coached a current Olympic gold medalist … that have still not been chosen as team staff for Paris, even though that athlete is going to be defending their gold medal,” Huyton told CNN.
    

            She explains that many national teams don’t have a standardized way of selecting coaches for a major competition, instead relying on “who the head coach wants,” rather than considering the needs of female athletes.
    

            Women are underrepresented in the boardroom as well as among the coaching staff – there has never been a female president of the IOC, while just a third of the IOC Executive Board are women.


            For much of Adams’ career in the boardroom, after she had retired from professional tennis, she would look around “and constantly realize I was the only one,” she says, prompting her to “do something about it” and push for change.
    

            “If you don’t have female decision makers in the room that understand female athletes, it’s very hard to make decisions,” she said. “That’s why we need to have diversity of thought in the boardrooms that are helping people understand what the needs of female athletes are, as opposed to just pushing these aside because they don’t understand them.”
    

            For female athletes, meanwhile, controversies around their clothing have appeared in the build-up to Paris, much like they did in Tokyo when several of them found themselves rebuked for wearing too little – or too much – clothing.
    

            “My hoo haa is gonna be out,” American long jumper Tara Davis-Woodall quipped when Nike released its designs for the USA track and field athletes at the Olympics with the women’s outfits featuring a high-cut bikini waistline and the men’s a boxer short cut that covered up more of their bodies.

Nike’s US women’s Olympic team outfits criticized for being ‘born of patriarchal forces’


            Such a discrepancy prompted a torrent of criticism, including from former US track and field athlete Lauren Fleshman who wrote on Instagram that athletes “should be able to compete without dedicating brain space to constant pube vigilance … or having every vulnerable piece of your body on display.”
    

            Nike later said the leotard design would be one of several options available and some athletes, including Davis-Woodall, walked back their criticism when they saw the uniform in person.


            Still, the controversy is indicative of the greater scrutiny female athletes face when choosing their clothing. Due to France’s secular laws, Muslim athletes who wear hijabs while competing cannot wear them in Paris – a step that Amnesty International says “defies Olympic values and human rights” and that athletes say has forced them to choose between their faith and love of sport. 


            Some accommodations have been made for these athletes at the last minute, like French sprinter Sounkamba Sylla who is now able to participate in the Opening Ceremony after she had previously said she would not be allowed because she wears a hijab.
    

            On Thursday, French sports minister Amélie Oudéa-Castéra told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that Sylla and LVHM, who are designing France’s Opening Ceremony, found a solution where the sprinter can cover her hair.
    

            “There’s a lot left to do, in terms of these kinds of things,” Donnelly said. “One of my biggest concerns, I think about the way that the IOC is promoting #genderequal Olympics is that overstating the accomplishments of these Games really sends the message that we’ve achieved everything we need to achieve with gender equality. And we know that without conscious, intentional action, to move towards gender equality, we consistently see regression.”

CNN_82,Coco Gauff still can’t wrap her head around the honor of being Team USA’s flag bearer,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/sport/coco-gauff-team-usa-flag-bearer/index.html,2024-07-27 00:38:00,world,"
            Coco Gauff may be a tennis prodigy and one of the top American athletes to represent the USA at the Summer Olympics, but she still finds herself getting caught up in the glamour of the Paris Games.


            Gauff will serve as flag bearer alongside basketball superstar LeBron James – a role she has yet to truly wrap her mind around.
    

            “I don’t know when I’m going to meet him, but I’m already stressed about it really,” Gauff told CNN’s Coy Wire. “I’ve never met him before, I’m excited to meet him and I’m excited to be flag bearer alongside him. There’s no other athlete I think I would have chosen to do this with.”
    

            Gauff, just 20 years old, is entering her first Olympics after missing the Tokyo Games three years ago with a Covid-19 infection. She’s one of the faces of Team USA in Paris and says she’s finding the experience a little bizarre.
    

            She described meeting American Olympic legends Simone Biles and Katie Ledecky since arriving at the Olympic Village – where she’s spent her time trading pins and riding bikes – and found it hard to comprehend that they knew who she was even though she’s a superstar in her own right.
    

            It’s a lot for someone so early in their career to take in.
    

            “It took a while for it to sink in, (it still hasn’t really) sunken in,” Gauff told Wire just hours ahead of her big moment. “So many people are coming up to say congratulations, not just from Team USA but from other sports and countries as well. I don’t think it will, until maybe a year from now or something because I think it’s just going to be one of those things like, ‘I can’t believe I just did that.’”
    

            The women’s tennis competition gets started on Saturday and Gauff has drawn Ajla Tomljanović.
    

            The world No. 2 hopes that her play in Paris, along with those of her nearly 600 teammates on Team USA, goes a long way toward uniting a divided nation back home that is currently in the midst of one of the most intense election seasons in recent memory.
    

            “I just hope that me being a person representing Team USA … we all just want to promote positivity through our game, through our sport and through our competing,” Gauff said. “We all just want to show how passionate we are and share that passion with the supporters that we have and hopefully have a lot of success too.”
    

            But as she prepares for her moment in the spotlight leading Team USA down the River Seine in a unique Opening Ceremony, Gauff is trying to focus on what most 20-year-olds want to do: Having fun.
    

            “We just have a great team, the men’s and women’s team, we all get along we all have fun and I definitely think who your teammates are probably makes the biggest difference if you’re going to have a good experience or a bad one,” Gauff told Wire, “and so far, this experience has definitely been a once-in-a-lifetime type thing.”

            The British government has dropped plans to oppose the International Criminal Court’s application for an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over alleged war crimes in Gaza, according to UK news agency PA Media..
    

            “This was a proposal by the previous government which was not submitted before the election, and which I can confirm the Government will not be pursuing in line with our long standing position that this is a matter for the court to decide on,” said a spokeswoman for the UK’s new Labour government, which earlier this month replaced a Conservative government led by former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
    

            ICC prosecutor Karim Khan announced in May he was seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders – including Gaza chief Yahya Sinwar – over charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.
    

            The court has no means of enforcement, however ICC members have an obligation to cooperate fully with its decisions. If the warrants are granted, Netanyahu and others could risk arrest when traveling to the 124 countries that are ICC members – including Germany and the United Kingdom.
    

            The international court still must assess submissions from other powers before making a decision on whether to grant the request for arrest warrants.

Gaza war weighs heavy on the minds of Palestinian Olympians: ‘I want to be an inspiration’


            Israel has faced significant criticism over the scale and force of its military the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, launched after the Hamas-led October 7 terror attacks, which killed at least 1,200 people and abducted more than 250 others. After months of war, many Gazans are facing mass displacement, destruction, and bouts of famine; more than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed and another 90,403 people injured since the Israeli offensive began, according to the Ministry of Health in the Palestinian enclave.
    

            The UK’s governing Labour party and its leader, former human rights lawyer Keir Starmer, have faced pressure from supporters to take a tougher stance on the Gaza war.
    

            On Thursday, US Vice President Kamala Harris vowed “not to be silent” about human suffering in Gaza, speaking to reporters after her meeting with Netanyahu in Washington. The White House has also faced increasing pressure to ease the suffering of Palestinian civilians under bombardment, which has included the use of US munitions.
    

            Israel and the United States are not members of the ICC. However, the ICC claims jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court’s founding principles in 2015.
    

            The charges against Netanyahu and Gallant include “causing extermination, causing starvation as a method of war, including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, deliberately targeting civilians in conflict,” Khan told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in May.
    

            “The fact that Hamas fighters need water doesn’t justify denying water from all the civilian population of Gaza,” he added.
    

            Israeli lawmakers have vehemently condemned the application, with Netanyahu calling the decision “a political outrage.” Israel’s President Isaac Herzog said the announcement was “beyond outrageous.”

CNN_84,‘We cannot remain silent about what we saw.’ US doctors who volunteered in Gaza demand ceasefire in letter to White House,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/world/open-letter-45-us-physicians-gaza/index.html,2024-07-27 02:29:00,world,"
            A group of 45 American physicians and nurses who volunteered in hospitals across Gaza have sent an open letter to US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris sharing their experiences and demanding an immediate ceasefire and arms embargo.
    

            The signatories unanimously described treating children who had suffered injuries they believed must have been deliberately inflicted. “Specifically, every one of us on a daily basis treated pre-teen children who were shot in the head and chest,” they wrote.
    

            “We wish you could see the nightmares that plague so many of us since we have returned: dreams of children maimed and mutilated by our weapons, and their inconsolable mothers begging us to save them. We wish you could hear the cries and screams our consciences will not let us forget.”

            Many in the group have public health backgrounds and experiences volunteering in other conflict zones such as Ukraine and Iraq, according to the letter. “We believe we are well positioned to comment on the massive human toll from Israel’s attack on Gaza, especially the toll it has taken on women and children,” reads the letter posted to X on Thursday by Dr. Feroze Sidwa, who spearheaded the writing of the letter with the other physicians.
    

            The doctors and nurses’ letter calls on the Biden administration to participate in an arms embargo of both Israel and all Palestinian armed groups, and to withhold military, diplomatic, and economic support to Israel until a permanent and immediate ceasefire is achieved. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.
    

            It comes at a critical time for the White House, as it urges the Israelis to accept a ceasefire agreement. Biden met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday, a day after the Israeli leader addressed the US Congress about the conflict. Sources told CNN the president was expected to be as forceful as he has ever been in pushing Netanyahu to agree to a deal.
    

            “We believe our government is obligated to do this, both under American law and International Humanitarian Law, and that it is the right thing to do,” the letter said.
    

            Dr. Adam Hamawy, a US plastic surgeon and former US Army combat trauma surgeon, told CNN on Thursday, “there’s no one getting firsthand accounts other than physicians. We feel like we have to speak out because…we’re witnesses to this.
    

            “In Gaza, there’s no independent monitor,” he said. “If you’re not going to believe the Palestinians, then you should believe 50 doctors who’ve gone there at different times and places.”
    

            Apart from Palestinian journalists living in Gaza, there has been no media access to the enclave since October 7, with a few exceptions of entry under official escort. 


            Hamawy signed the letter to recount what he saw with his own eyes. “We all saw a complete devastation of a society, of people’s lives, of health care structure,” he said.
    

            Hamawy has worked as a surgeon in Sarajevo, in New York City on 9/11, and in Iraq, where he performed life-saving surgery on US Senator Tammy Duckworth in 2004 after her helicopter was hit by an RPG.  But he said those experiences in other conflict zones were not comparable to what he had witnessed in Gaza, adding that 90% of those he had seen killed there were women and children.

            Hamawy worked at the European Gaza hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis in May of this year where he performed about 115 reconstructive surgeries and treated mostly children under 14 years old. He worked on amputations, burns, and gunshot wounds to the face, he said.
    

            The surgeon alleges that a gunshot wound on the face of one of his patients, a male teenager, most likely came from an M16 or sniper rifle because the wound was a small entrance wound. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment on this allegation.
    

            Another patient was a little boy who picked up what he thought was a can of tuna to bring back to his family in Rafah, Hamawy recalled. But the metal object was in fact an unexploded cluster bomb, according to Hamawy, who said that after opening it in front of his family, the child lost his left arm, both his legs, and three fingers on his right arm.
    

            Dr. Mark Perlmutter, a Jewish American orthopedic hand surgeon from North Carolina and president of the World Surgical Association, told CNN that he decided to go to Gaza after receiving photographs of an X-ray of a poorly performed surgery in the battered enclave.
    

            The photos were sent to him by a first-year medical resident who had been forced to perform the surgery and requested Perlmutter’s expertise. When Perlmutter asked why senior surgeons hadn’t done the operation, the resident explained that they had been killed in a bombing.
    

            Perlmutter told CNN that during his trip, he saw significant violence inflicted on children, who accounted for around 90% of those attending the emergency room while he was working at the European Gaza Hospital.
    

            Describing a hospital overrun, Perlmutter said after every bombing, he would find injured children laid across the floor, their loved ones panicking and crying.

            “Some are dead, some will die in front of you, and some you can save. You try to save the ones you can save,” Perlmutter said.
    

            He recalled two patients aged around six years old, who had suffered gunshots to their heads and chests – wounds which suggested they had been deliberately targeted, he said.
    

            “No kid gets shot twice by a sniper by mistake,” Perlmutter said, adding that the shots were “dead center” to their chests.
    

            CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on these allegations.
    

            As Perlmutter tried to treat the children with head injuries, he said, their “brains poured out” in his hands, in what he described as a personally traumatic moment.
    

            In signing the letter, Perlmutter told CNN that he hopes “the average American can feel the pain we feel on a daily basis. They’ll never see what we saw but they should feel what we saw.”
    

            Launched in response to Hamas-led terror attacks in Israel on October 7 which killed at least 1,200 people, Israel’s monthlong military offensive in Gaza has left more than 39,000 Palestinians dead, according to the Gazan Health Ministry. The letter’s signatories estimate that the true toll of the war could be in excess of 92,000, if it included deaths from starvation or disease and bodies still buried under the rubble.

             Last week the World Health Organization said the polio virus had been found in sewage samples, putting thousands of Palestinians at risk of contracting a disease that can cause paralysis.
    

            For months, the health care system in Gaza has been collapsing under relentless Israeli airstrikes, power outages and a shortage of medical supplies, according to the United Nations and previous CNN reporting.
    

            Under such conditions, the American medical workers warned that epidemics could lead to the deaths of tens of thousands more children. The displacement of people to areas with no running water or toilets “is virtually guaranteed to result in widespread death from viral and bacterial diarrheal diseases and pneumonias, particularly in children under the age of five,” the letter said.
    

            “Everyone in Gaza is sick, injured, or both,” with few exceptions, their letter said. “We are not politicians. We do not claim to have all the answers. We are simply physicians and nurses who cannot remain silent about what we saw in Gaza.” the letter said.

            Former President Donald Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, the first such meeting between the two men since Trump left the White House more than three years ago.
    

            The meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence was requested by Netanyahu, sources familiar with the planning told CNN. It comes on the heels of the prime minister’s address to Congress and meetings with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris at the White House. Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee, conveyed a forcefulness on civilian suffering and ending the war following her time with the prime minister.
    

            Netanyahu said Friday that he hoped Harris’ comments would not make a ceasefire deal harder to reach.
    

            “I think to the extent that Hamas understands there’s no daylight between Israel and the United States, that expedites the deal,” said Netanyahu to reporters at his meeting with Trump. “And I would hope that those comments don’t change that.”
    

            Ahead of Netanyahu’s remarks, Harris’ office rejected on Friday the suggestion originally from a senior Israeli official that the vice president’s remarks could have made a ceasefire deal harder to reach.
    

            “I don’t know what they’re talking about,” a Harris aide told CNN, in response to a senior Israeli official being quoted in The Times of Israel.
    

            “President Biden and Vice President Harris delivered the same message in their private meetings to Prime Minister Netanyahu: it is time to get the ceasefire and hostage deal done,” the aide to the vice president told reporters, adding that Harris’ meeting with Netanyahu was “serious and collegial.”
    

            Friday marks an opportunity for Trump and Netanyahu to reset relations at critical moments in both the war between Israel and Hamas and the 2024 election cycle.
    

            Trump, who often claims he was the most pro-Israel president in modern history, once touted his close, personal relationship with Netanyahu. However, their relationship has soured in recent years, and the former president has been reluctant to speak with him throughout the ongoing conflict.

            In the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ attack on Israel, Trump criticized Netanyahu for his handling of the war, claiming to Fox News at the time the prime minister and the country overall were “unprepared.”
    

            Part of that criticism, which Trump has continued in the months since, stems from his complicated relationship with Netanyahu, one that a former Trump administration official described as “a love-hate relationship,” who added that the two leaders experienced a dramatic up and down in recent years.
    

            During his administration Trump enacted multiple policies to Israel’s benefit, including moving the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights and backing multiple countries in Middle East and North Africa to normalize relations with Israel as part of the Abraham Accords. Netanyahu called Trump the greatest friend Israel has ever had and heralded him for “unequivocally” standing by Israel during Trump’s tenure as commander in chief.
    

            But the relationship grew bitter after the 2020 presidential election when Netanyahu congratulated Biden on his victory – something that infuriated the former president who considered the move disloyal. “F**k him,” Trump told Axios at the time.
    

            Trump has also claimed that Netanyahu betrayed him in the final months of his presidency, arguing that Israel, at the 11th hour, declined to participate in the 2020 airstrike that killed top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani. Netanyahu “let us down,” Trump said at a rally in October 2023.
    

            Two sources close to Trump, meanwhile, said they are aware of attempted outreach by Netanyahu in recent months, including seeking communications through informal channels.
    

            And in March, Trump allies — led by Keith Kellogg, a leading national security adviser to the former president who also served in the Trump administration — traveled to Israel to discuss the current conflict in Gaza, though the Trump campaign said it had learned of those meetings after the fact.
    

            Many Israelis presume that Trump would give Netanyahu a longer leash to use greater force in Gaza. Trump has said that Israel must “finish what they started,” “get it over with fast,” and that the US must “let Israel finish the job.”
    

            A senior Trump campaign adviser told CNN that Trump’s willingness to meet with Netanyahu despite their fraught relationship shows that Trump “is willing to put any personal or political differences to the side and develop or reconnect with him, to develop a working relationship with him.”
    

            “It shows the evolution of how Trump will conduct himself in a second term,” the adviser added.
    

            Sources familiar with the meeting said that there is no set agenda or overarching message that Trump wants to convey. However, the former president has repeatedly said that, if elected in November, he would seek a speedy end to the conflict in the Middle East without offering details of how he would do so. Instead, he’s argued the war must come to a swift close because the country is “losing the PR war.”
    

            Asked about the meeting during an interview with Fox News on Thursday, Trump said: “I want him to finish up and get it done quickly. You gotta get it done quickly, because they are getting decimated with this publicity. And you know, Israel is not very good at public relations.”
    

            He also asserted during the interview that the October 7 attack wouldn’t have happened if he were president, a claim he repeats frequently on the campaign trail.
    

            Arab Americans who have said they will support Trump will also be watching the meeting on Friday closely, they told CNN. They were “saddened and bewildered” when Trump called Biden a Palestinian in a derogatory manner during the debate last month, said Bishara Bahbah, who lives in Arizona and has worked to rally the Arab-American community for Trump after the lifelong Democrat soured on Biden over his approach to the Israel-Hamas war.
    

            Bahbah, however, has maintained support for Trump despite the derogatory rhetoric toward Palestinians last month. He pointed to Trump’s move to share a recent letter on his social media platform from Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas ahead of Friday’s meeting. The letter was sent after the assassination attempt on the 2024 Republican presidential nominee.
    

            “Looking forward to seeing Bibi Netanyahu on Friday, and even more forward to achieving Peace in the Middle East!” Trump posted to Truth Social with the letter.
    

            In posting that engagement with Abbas, Trump was trying to “strike a balance” going into the meeting, Bahbah said, adding that he hopes Trump will come out of the Netanyahu meeting calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire.
    

            Jewish supporters of Trump are hoping the former president asks Netanyahu what he needs to win the ongoing war, explained Lee Zeldin, a Jewish Republican and Trump supporter.
    

            “At the table, the most important question is asking the prime minister what he needs to win. What does Israel need that they don’t yet have?” Zeldin, a former congressman, said. “That conversation about ensuring victory and pursuing a lasting peace is the most important fundamental threshold in my opinion.”
    

            Zeldin added that Jewish Americans will be watching the meeting closely because they hope that Trump, if he were to win the November election, would “pick up where he left off” in terms of putting policies into place that support Israel.
    

            Trump finds himself in a distinct position given he was president just over three years ago and has longstanding relations with many of the foreign leaders now arriving on his doorstep.
    

            He has met with a series of foreign leaders in recent months, including hosting Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and British Foreign Secretary David Cameron at Mar-a-Lago, and dining with Polish President Andrzej Duda and former Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso at Trump Tower in New York during his hush money trial, among other meetings. He has also spoken by phone with several world leaders, including with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is currently working with the US to normalize relations with Israel.
    

            The Trump adviser argued that the meetings reflect the reality of the former president’s poll numbers, adding that many foreign leaders want to ensure they have strong ties to him in the event he wins in November.
    

            “It could signify that they think Trump is best positioned to be the next president, and they want to get a head start on developing a real relationship with him,” the adviser said.

CNN_86,Here’s what Team USA is wearing to the Olympics,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/18/style/team-usa-olympic-uniforms-ralph-lauren/index.html,2024-07-27 03:40:00,world,"
            Since 2008, Ralph Lauren has outfitted Team USA at nine consecutive Olympics and Paralympics, designing uniforms for athletes to wear at opening and closing ceremonies as well as a broader capsule wardrobe for their use during and after the Games.
    

            And for this summer’s Olympics, the brand is bringing its quintessential take on Americana and preppy athleisure to Paris, the fashion capital of the world — the new collection “draws inspiration from the dynamic and vibrant host city,” a statement from the brand reads, “and embraces a patriotic spirit reflected in a signature palette of red, white and blue.”
    

            “We’re so proud to dress Team USA,” David Lauren, Ralph Lauren’s chief branding and innovation officer, told CNN at a preview of the collection on Monday. “We worked very closely with the athletes, with the Olympic Committee, to create (a collection) we think tells a story about America.”
    

            “We want the athletes to walk out on a global stage feeling like they are ambassadors of American culture, American leadership and American sportsmanship. I think that Ralph Lauren is able to understand that ethos and bring it to life,” Lauren continued.
    

            “And that’s the dream — that is the American dream for us at Ralph Lauren and for everybody watching.”
    

            At the opening ceremony, which will see Olympians traveling down the River Seine on boats towards the city’s famed Trocadéro, Team USA athletes will wear a classic navy Ralph Lauren blazer with red and white detailing, paired with a striped Oxford shirt, navy knit tie, and tapered light denim jeans.
    

            Denim is also a prominent feature in the closing ceremony ensembles. For this occasion, Ralph Lauren designed a racecar-style jacket with USA patch detailing, a a classic striped polo and crisp white jeans.
    

            “I think this collection in its entirety does a really good job of combining classic American style with a little bit more of that contemporary feel,” Paralympic swimmer Jamal Hill, a bronze medal-winner at the 2020 Tokyo Games, told CNN. “I’m wearing this to the all-white party,” he noted, with a laugh, of the closing ceremony look in particular, adding, “my only regret is that when I come home, the season for all-white will be almost over.”
    

            The athletes honored as Team USA’s flag bearers at the opening and closing ceremonies will receive versions of these looks in different colorways to help them stand out in the crowds. Beyond this, athletes will also receive pieces from a special, commemorative “Villagewear” collection. Named in reference to the Athletes’ Village, the clothing line (which will be available to purchase) will feature version of classic Ralph Lauren pieces — jackets and sweaters, rugby shirts, knits, joggers, color-blocked tees and much more. In a first for the brand, this year there is also a “100% recycled” polo shirt in the mix.
    

            “Ralph Lauren has once again created designs that not only capture the essence of American style but also embody the spirit and pride of Team USA,” Sarah Hirshland, CEO of the US Olympic & Paralympic Committee, said in a statement. “This iconic apparel serves as a symbol of unity and inspiration for both our team and the millions of fans who will be cheering them on.”

CNN_87,"California’s Park Fire 0% contained as more than a thousand battle 178,000 acre blaze",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/us/california-park-fire-oregon-durkee-jasper/index.html,2024-07-27 04:41:00,us,"
Hot and dry weather is fueling wildfire activity in the Western United States and Canada, with fires damaging homes, causing injuries and forcing evacuations. The largest active wildfire in the US has scorched more than 280,000 acres in eastern Oregon and another blaze has exploded to more than 178,000 acres in California. Here’s the latest:


            • Park Fire roars across Butte County, California: As of Friday afternoon, the Park Fire has burned more than 178,000 acres, as more than 1,600 firefighters work to slow its progress. Cal Fire reported the blaze was 0% contained Friday, with 134 structures destroyed and another 4,200 threatened. The fires has forced road closures and mandatory evacuations in Butte County, where the state’s deadliest wildfire, the Camp Fire, killed more than 85 people and destroyed thousands of homes in 2018. Conditions around the Park Fire continue to be difficult for the firefighters battling the flames as dry air, warm temperatures and gusty winds linger over the area Thursday. The area remains under a red flag warning until Friday evening.
    

            • Three firefighters injured and structures damaged: Three firefighters had minor heat-related injuries on Wednesday while fighting the Park Fire, Cal Fire Captain Dan Collins told CNN Thursday. They were treated and released, he said. Officials know structures have been damaged or destroyed by the fire, but there is no official count yet, Collins said.
    

• Man accused of starting California wildfire is arrested: A suspect has been arrested on suspicion of pushing a burning car 60 feet into a gully, “spreading flames” that caused what’s now become California’s largest wildfire of the year, authorities said. The Park Fire in the Butte County area has quickly burned an area larger than the city of Atlanta.
    

            • Firefighters battle massive Oregon fire: The Durkee Fire, which has burned more than 288,000 acres and is 20% contained as of Friday afternoon, started on July 17 near the Oregon-Idaho state line. The lightning-sparked fire is the largest of 34 large wildfires currently burning across Oregon, which has been the hardest hit by fires in recent days. More than 500 firefighters and resources from 22 states are working to fight the fire, according to InciWeb. Over the weekend and earlier this week, the Durkee Fire exhibited extreme fire behavior, even creating its own weather in the form of pyrocumulus clouds.
    

            • Oregon wildfire destroys buildings: Three people were injured and two homes and 12 other structures were destroyed as the fire spread, according to the Oregon Department of Emergency Management. Evacuations are still in effect in Baker County for areas around the Durkee Fire. Some communities do not have power, according to Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, who has deployed resources from the National Guard to assist. Dense smoke from the flames has also impeded traffic on Interstate 84, leading to periodic closure of the freeway. Wildfire smoke was spreading into Boise and beyond. Air quality alerts have been issued for parts of Colorado, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.
    

            • Wildfire engulfs tourist town in Canada: A fast-moving wildfire sent thousands of visitors and residents fleeing the town of Jasper in Alberta, where flames devastated up to half of the town’s structures. Officials say the losses are significant, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has deployed federal support to help battle the blaze. Cool temperatures and rain are expected to keep fire behavior low for the next 72 hours, which will help crews fight the blaze, Jasper National Park said on Facebook Thursday night.
    

            • Fire-conducive weather continues in Western US: Triple-digit heat and dry conditions across the West this week have made conditions poor for firefighters actively fighting to contain the 89 large wildfires burning nationwide. “Many wildfires in the Northwest area continue to exhibit active to extreme fire behavior, with evacuation orders in effect on 17 wildfires. Several teams are managing multiple fire starts as complexes. Evacuation orders are also in effect for several fires in California, the Northern Rockies and the Great Basin,” the National Interagency Fire Center said. Conditions will begin to improve for much of the West over the weekend as cooler temperatures and higher humidity levels arrive in the area.
    

            Some families have found themselves displaced as the Park Fire raged near Chico, a city in northern California, burning homes and forcing evacuations.
    

            A former news anchor told CNN affiliate KOVR she watched her Butte County house burn down live through security camera footage.
    

            “There is no rhyme or reason. Our house is gone, their house is okay. The house next to it, you can see it’s gone,” Julia Yarbough said.
    

            Looking at the remnants of her home, Yarbough said she felt numb.
    

            “It’s surreal,” she said. “It probably won’t hit me till later, I’m pretty sure.”
    

            Triple-digit temperatures and high wind gusts have fueled the explosive growth of the Park Fire amid an active fire season in California. An estimated 343,253 acres have burned across the state so far in 2024, compared to 22,439 acres burned by this time last year, according to Cal Fire.
    

            A 42-year-old man, identified as Ronnie Dean Stout II, has been arrested after being accused of igniting the inferno.
    

            Witnesses reported seeing someone “pushing a car that was on fire into a gully near the Alligator Hole in upper Bidwell Park shortly before 3:00 p.m. yesterday,” Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said Thursday. “The car went down an embankment approximately 60 feet and burned completely, spreading flames that caused the Park Fire.”
    

            The DA says the man was seen “calmly leaving the area by blending in with the other citizens who were in the area and fleeing the rapidly evolving fire.” Stout was later arrested at a mobile home park in Chico, Ramsey said.
    

            Stout will likely face an arson charge, though it is unclear what count, or whether any enhancements will be added, Ramsey said. The DA’s office told CNN Stout has not retained an attorney and will be assigned a public defender at his arraignment.
    

            He was previously convicted of second degree robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and drug paraphernalia possession in Kern County, according to criminal records. He was sentenced to 21 years in prison. He was released on parole in 2018, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation confirmed to CNN.
    

            He was also convicted of lewd or lascivious acts on a child under 14 in Butte County, records show.
    

            In Jasper, a popular tourist town in Alberta, 25,000 residents and visitors were forced to evacuate from a fast-moving blaze that has damaged 30 to 50% of the town’s structures, officials said during a news conference Thursday.
    

            “Homes and businesses have been lost to a wildfire that people are calling a ‘wall of flames,’” Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said.
    

            An “enormous wind gust” moved the wildfire roughly about 3 miles in “probably less than 30 minutes,” Alberta Minister of Public Safety & Emergency Services Mike Ellis said during the press conference. This created “a wall of fire that was about 100 meters high.”
    

            “Any firefighter will tell you there is little to nothing you can do when you have a wall of flames coming at you like that. Nobody anticipated that fire to come so fast, so large,” Ellis said.
    

            Two wildfires converged in the Jasper National Park area, becoming what authorities are referring to as the Jasper Wildfire Complex. It remains difficult to measure exactly how big the complex – which also includes a third nearby fire – is due to extreme fire behavior and thick smoke cover. Together, the fires have swallowed an estimated 89,000 acres, the Jasper National Park said.
    

            Damage wrought by the flames will result in “a significant rebuild and significant displacement,” Smith said. The most significant structural damage lies on the west side of town, according to a Facebook post from Jasper National Park.

            “We will recover from this,” Smith said while holding back tears. “To those in Alberta and around the world who have experienced the magic of Jasper, the magic is not lost, and it never will be.”
    

            The vast majority of evacuees were “visitors with other places to return to,” Ellis said. Along with about 5,000 residents who live in the town, 2.48 million people visited Jasper National Park last year.
    

            Jasper Mayor Richard Ireland said residents will work together to rebuild after the wildfire “ravaged our beloved community.”
    

            “Your resilience and strength have always been the backbone of our community. In the coming days and weeks, we will rally together, support one another, and begin the daunting process of recovery,” Ireland said in a statement on Thursday.
    

            Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said all federal agencies are working together to provide resources to Jasper, support evacuations and strengthen response efforts on the ground.
    

            “Our governments are working together to keep Albertans safe and supported through this,” he said on Facebook.

CNN_88,"ABC News still ‘full steam ahead’ with presidential debate, despite Trump backing off commitment",https://edition.cnn.com/abc-news-trump-harris-presidential-debate-back-out/index.html,2024-07-27 04:23:00,us,"
            ABC News is continuing preparations for an upcoming presidential debate, despite former President Donald Trump saying he won’t consider participating in a debate until the Democratic Party formally chooses its nominee.
    

            “Full steam ahead,” an ABC network source told CNN on Friday.
    

            Despite ABC’s preparations for the debate, set to be moderated by anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis, the network’s plan could still be upended like so many other institutions and traditions this year.
    

            “I haven’t agreed to anything. I agreed to a debate with Joe Biden,” Trump, the Republican nominee, said on a press call earlier this week. “But I want to debate with her, and she’ll be no different because they have the same policies. I think debating is important for a presidential race, I really do. You sort of have an obligation to debate.”

Fox News proposes Trump-Harris debate on Sept. 17 after Biden pulls out of race


            Vice President Kamala Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee, later told reporters she had agreed to the September 10 debate and accused Trump of “backpedaling.”
    

            “What happened to ‘any time, any place?’” Harris wrote in a post on X.
    

            Even before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, the campaigns did away with the independent Commission on Presidential Debates, which had arranged the debates for decades, instead agreeing to debates directly arranged by television networks.
    

            A person familiar with the matter said Friday that NBC is “in ongoing discussion with the campaigns,” but it’s unclear whether that involves plans for a debate, or other events like town halls with the candidates.
    

            Both the Biden and Trump campaigns had agreed to a debate hosted by CNN on June 27, a debate hosted by ABC on September 10 and a vice presidential debate hosted by CBS, although a date had not been set for the VP showdown before Biden dropped out.
    

            The CNN debate will go down in history as one of the most – if not the most – consequential presidential debates in history, withBiden’s poor performance turbocharging calls for the 81-year-old president to step bow out of the race.

            After Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris, Trump suggested the ABC debate should be moved to the right-wing network Fox News. Earlier this week, Fox sent letters to both campaigns offering to host their own presidential debate. Neither campaign has publicly responded to the offer.
    

            The location, rules, and format of the ABC News debate have not been announced, although the network on Friday afternoon released the requirements for candidates to qualify. An ABC spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
    

            Jason Miller, a senior advisor to the Trump campaign, told Axios on Thursday, “A debate will happen. I’m not sure it will be ABC.”
    

            “We do think there should be some diversification in the outlets for who hosts a debate,” he added. “But I think the public would be sold short if we only did one debate against Kamala Harris in the general election.”

CNN_89,Dow closes more than 600 points higher as investors gear up for rate cuts,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/investing/stocks-rate-cuts-inflation-fed/index.html,2024-07-27 04:03:00,us,"
            Wall Street is undergoing a palpable vibe shift.
    

            Strong corporate earnings have helped stocks notch repeated record highs in 2024, despite stubborn inflation forcing investors to dial down their expectations for how many times the Fed will cut rates this year.
    

            But cooling inflation data in recent weeks has led Wall Street to bet that the Federal Reserve will finally cut interest rates in September — and that there are now more options for gains beyond just the Big Tech stocks that have dominated the market this year.
    

            Data released Friday morning showed the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, slowed to 2.5% for the 12 months ended in June — another sign for hopeful investors that inflation is continuing to ease from its four-decade high.
    

            The Dow jumped 654 points, or 1.6%, on Friday after soaring more than 800 points earlier in the day. The S&P 500 gained 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite added 1%.
    

            For the week, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell while the Dow notched a gain.
    

            Economic data has also remained remarkably resilient even as rates stay at a 23-year high. That, coupled with the slowdown in inflation, has raised hopes that the central bank could tame prices without triggering a recession, a feat it has achieved just once since the 1990s, according to some economists. Data Thursday showed the economy expanded at a robust 2.8% annualized rate during the second quarter, blowing past economists’ expectations.
    

            Wall Street will get more clues about the Fed’s next moves at its policy meeting next week, where the central bank is expected to hold rates steady. While the Fed has penciled in just one rate cut for this year, traders are betting on up to three, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.
    

            Brightening prospects for rate cuts typically signal good news for stocks, since the market tends to do better when higher borrowing rates don’t weigh down companies’ balance sheets. But you wouldn’t know that from the carnage in stocks this week.

Nasdaq and S&P 500 log worst day since 2022 after Alphabet and Tesla fail to impress Wall Street


            While the market was broadly higher on Friday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Wednesday logged their worst daily performances since 2022.
    

            The reason behind the selloff: Investors are shedding shares of the Magnificent Seven tech stalwarts that have dominated the market for the past two years, and their large weighting has dragged down the major indexes. Tech companies make up 32% of the total market capitalization, the highest level since the late 1990s, according to MRB Partners data as of June 28.
    

            An underwhelming start to the earnings season for the cohort has only intensified its declines: Tesla shares tumbled 12.3% on Wednesday after the electric vehicle-maker reported a more than 40% plunge in profits the prior evening. Alphabet shares slipped 5% after beating earnings expectations but missing analysts’ expectations for YouTube advertising revenue.
    

            One area that has benefited recently from the prospect of lower rates is small-cap stocks.
    

            Shares of smaller companies tend to perform poorly when rates are high, since they have more floating rate debt than their larger counterparts. But they have historically tended to perform well when the Fed begins easing its high borrowing rates.
    

            The Russell 2000 index, which tracks the performance of small-cap stocks, has gained 10.4% so far this month, outperforming the S&P 500’s 0.03% loss.
    

            Investors are also picking at other areas of the market poised to gain when rates come down. Stephen Lee, founding principal at Logan Capital, said his firm added to its position in homebuilder stocks earlier this quarter, betting that cooling inflation would allow the Fed to cut rates and ease the ultra-tight housing market.
    

            Sky-high interest rates have led homeowners to hold off on selling their homes to keep their pandemic-era low mortgage rates even as demand surged, driving up home prices to record levels.
    

            Investors have fretted over the past year that the market’s gains are beholden to just a handful of tech stocks, making the rally more vulnerable to pullbacks a few stocks stumble. The Magnificent Seven drove about 60% of the S&P 500’s total return during the first half of the year, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial.
    

            The recent gain in small-caps is making some investors hopeful that the market rally will continue to broaden.
    

            There are signs that the pain in tech shares might not be over yet. Tech stocks’ steep losses following tepid quarterly results from Alphabet and Tesla suggest that investors are growing impatient with companies investing hefty sums into artificial intelligence with little to show for it in terms of revenue gains.
    

            Many big tech firms have released AI chatbots and other flashy consumer tools since OpenAI’s ChatGPT kicked off the AI arms race two years ago, but the path to monetizing the technology remains unclear.
    

            On Alphabet’s Tuesday earnings call, UBS analyst Stephen Ju noted that the initial use cases of the AI models that Big Tech firms have invested in building “are more on the cost savings or efficiency side.”
    

            “When do you think we’ll start thinking about products that can help revenue generation for the Fortune 500, Fortune 1000 companies, which is probably something that can, hopefully, create greater value over time, versus just cutting costs?” Ju said.
    

            As the AI arms race continues to heat up, companies are unlikely to slow their spending on AI. But it’s unclear when those investments will provide a boost to their balance sheets.
    

            “The risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us here,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said on the call.
    

As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might change slightly.

CNN_90,"Trump plans to return to Butler, Pennsylvania, to honor slain supporter and those injured during assassination attempt",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/donald-trump-butler-pennsylvania-rally/index.html,2024-07-27 05:43:00,politics,"
Donald Trump said Friday he plans to return to Butler, Pennsylvania – the place where the former president survived an assassination attempt nearly two weeks ago – for a rally that will honor slain supporter Corey Comperatore and those injured in the shooting.
    

            Trump announced the “big and beautiful” rally in an all-caps post on his Truth Social platform, noting that the event would be “honoring the soul of our beloved firefighting hero, Corey, and those brave patriots injured two weeks ago.” He did not say when the rally would take place.
    

            Trump was minutes into his speech on July 13 when a gunman fired eight shots at the stage in Butler, a city north of Pittsburgh in one of the most important battleground states of the 2024 election.
    

            Trump’s right ear was bloodied, and he appeared days later at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee wearing a large white bandage over the injured ear.
    

            At the convention, the former president honored Comperatore, a volunteer firefighter who officials said protected his wife and children from the gunfire in his final moments.
    

            Trump’s reaction to the shooting – standing and raising his right fist while mouthing “Fight” to the Butler crowd as the Secret Service rushed him off stage – became a rallying cry at the Republican convention and in his campaign appearances since.
    

            Trump and his allies used the Republican convention to deliver calls for unity in the wake of the assassination attempt. However, in his speech on the convention’s final night, Trump returned to familiar attacks on Democratic rivals, and has repeated those attacks in campaign rallies since then.
    

            “What a day it will be – fight, fight, fight!” Trump said Friday in his social media post announcing the Butler rally.

Pennsylvania state police commissioner reveals stunning details about Trump shooting


            FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers in a Wednesday hearing on Capitol Hill that there was “some question” whether Trump was hit by a bullet or shrapnel.
    

            “No, it was, unfortunately, a bullet that hit my ear, and hit it hard. There was no glass, there was no shrapnel,” Trump wrote Thursday on Truth Social. “No wonder the once storied FBI has lost the confidence of America!”
    

            The FBI said Thursday that investigators are continuing to examine bullet fragments and other evidence in the attack on Trump, but the agency has always considered the shooting an attempted assassination of the former president.
    

            US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned this week amid scrutiny of security lapses related to the assassination attempt. The move came as lawmakers and an internal government watchdog move forward with investigations into the agency’s handling of Trump’s protection and how the gunman came close to the killing the Republican presidential candidate.
    

            “In light of recent events, it is with a heavy heart that, I have made the difficult decision to step down as your Director,” Cheatle wrote in her resignation letter. She acknowledged that on the day of the shooting, the agency “fell short” of its mission “to protect our nation’s leaders.”

CNN_91,"Parkinson’s specialist met with Biden’s physician at the White House earlier this year, records show",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/parkinsons-specialist-white-house/index.html,2024-07-27 06:43:00,politics,"
            A top Parkinson’s disease specialist held a meeting with President Joe Biden’s physician at the White House earlier this year, according to records, though the circumstances of the meeting are unclear.
    

            Dr. Kevin Cannard, a neurologist at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, met with White House physician Dr. Kevin O’Connor at the White House in mid-January, according to White House visitor logs.
    

            Cannard has visited the White House three times this year, according to the visitor logs: A January 17 meeting with O’Connor, and with another staffer on January 26 and March 28. Cannard has visited the White House at least eight times over the past year, according to the logs, beginning late July 2023 and ending with the March 28 meeting. Only the January 17 meeting lists O’Connor as the person who was visited.
    

            O’Connor took the unusual step Monday night of releasing a letter offering some details about Cannard’s visits to the White House, following days of speculation about the president’s health, writing that “President Biden has not seen a neurologist outside of his annual physical.”
    

            He wrote of Cannard: “Prior to the pandemic, and following its end, he has held regular Neurology Clinics at the White House Medical Clinic in support of the thousands of active-duty members assigned in support of White House operations,” adding, “Many military personnel experience neurological issues related to their service, and Dr. Cannard regularly visits the WHMU as part of this General Neurology practice.”
    

            O’Connor described Cannard as the “neurological specialist that examined President Biden for each of his annual physicals” and noted the specialist’s findings were included each time he publicly released the results of the president’s physical.
    

            Asked earlier Monday about the visit between Cannard and O’Connor, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said, “A wide variety of specialists from the Walter Reed system visit the White House complex to treat the thousands of military personnel who work on the grounds.”
    

            Those visits include one from a neurologist each year for Biden’s physical, Bates said. Biden has not been seen by a neurologist during his time as president outside the context of his annual physical, he added.
    

            Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre later repeated Biden had been seen by a neurologist three times during his presidency – once during each of his physicals – but declined to name them or explain why Cannard had visited the White House eight times over the past year.
    

            She said she wouldn’t name the specialist due to security reasons. Publicly available profiles name Cannard as a neurology specialist supporting the White House Medical Unit.
    

            “I am not sharing, confirming names from here,” she said during the news briefing, which quickly became contentious as Jean-Pierre deflected questions about the president’s health. “It doesn’t matter how hard you push me, it doesn’t matter how angry you get with me, I’m not going to confirm a name, it doesn’t matter if it’s even in the log, I am not going to do that from here.”
    

            Jean-Pierre added Biden has never been treated for, or taken any medicine to treat, Parkinson’s.
    

            Cannard — who’s worked as a neurologist for Walter Reed for more than a decade — has visited the White House multiple times, according to the visitor logs, which don’t detail the reasons for the visit, including whether Cannard was visiting in reference to Biden or another person who works at the White House.
    

            Biden’s latest health report, released by O’Connor, indicated the president had been screened for a number of neurological conditions, including Parkinson’s, with negative results, as did two other physical reports from Biden’s time as president.
    

            The six-page letter from O’Connor, released after the president underwent his last physical in February, said several specialists consulted on the physical, including a neurological specialist.
    

            It later said O’Connor convened several specialists, including an unnamed movement-disorder neurologic specialist, to review Biden’s stiffened gait, which had been noted since Biden’s November 2021 physical.
    

            That team concluded Biden’s stiff gait was the result of “wear and tear” on his spine and not a neurological condition, O’Connor wrote. An “extremely detailed” exam resulted in no findings consistent with Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis, or other neurological disorders.
    

            News of the visit by Cannard comes as Biden’s age, fitness and mental acuity have been under intense scrutiny following his faltering June 27 presidential debate performance against former President Donald Trump.
    

            In the 11 days since that performance, Biden has had to defend his position on the top of the Democratic ticket and his ability to govern for another four years if he is reelected. Both the White House and Biden have repeatedly been asked about tests and doctors visits in the months before the debate and the moments after.
    

             Biden was asked in an ABC interview on Friday whether he had taken specific tests for cognitive capability. The president responded by saying he is regularly seen by White House doctors and added, “No one said I had to … they said I’m good.”
    

            The president also added that he spoke with his doctor and was told, “You’re exhausted.” Biden said, “Being president” means “I get a full neurological test every day.”
    

            Speaking with Biden during an interview Monday morning, MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski asked Biden specifically whether he had undergone any recent tests for Parkinson’s. Biden confirmed he had.
    

            “Have you been tested for any age-related illness, pre-Parkinson’s or anything like that, that might explain sort of having a night like that where you couldn’t finish sentences?” the MSNBC host asked.
    

            Biden laughed before responding: “I had before.”
    

            The president added: “I was feeling so badly before the debate, when I came back, they tested me for - I thought maybe I had COVID, maybe there was something wrong, I had an infection or something. They tested me, they gave me those tests, I was clear.”
    

            The White House and Biden campaign have alternatively blamed Biden’s poor performance during the debate on his packed travel schedule in the weeks before – Biden went to France to commemorate the anniversary of D-Day and Italy to attend the G7 – and a cold.
    

            The White House initially said Biden wasn’t seen by a doctor after the debate, but then reversed after Biden told a group of governors during a meeting last week that he underwent a medical checkup after the debate and is fine.

CNN_92,Government to pay ex-FBI agent $1.2 million in settlement over release of anti-Trump texts,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/peter-strzok-lisa-page-fbi-settlement-doj/index.html,2024-07-27 06:35:00,politics,"
            Ex-FBI agent Peter Strzok reached a settlement with the Justice Department that includes a $1.2 million payout in the lawsuit over the department’s 2018 release of his text messages, his lawyers said Friday.
    

            According to court filings Friday, both Strzok and former FBI attorney Lisa Page have finalized their settlements with the Justice Department after alleging the department violated the Privacy Act by releasing to the media texts they exchanged criticizing Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign.
    

            Page’s attorneys said they were pleased the DOJ agreed to settle her claims, but did not provide the amount of the settlement. “While I have been vindicated by this result, my fervent hope remains that our institutions of justice will never again play politics with the lives of their employees,” Page said in a provided statement.
    

            The Justice Department did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.
    

            Strzok played a senior role on special counsel Robert Mueller’s team until he was removed after an internal investigation first revealed his texts with Page, with whom Strzok had an extramarital relationship, that could be read as exhibiting political bias. Page, who had also briefly served on Mueller’s team, resigned from her role as a lawyer for the FBI after the messages were discovered. The release of the messages became political fodder for Donald Trump to oppose the Russia investigation during his presidency.
    

            Strzok has other ongoing claims in the lawsuit against the department for his termination during the Trump administration.
    

            “This outcome is a critical step forward in addressing the government’s unfair and highly politicized treatment of Pete. As important as it is for him, it also vindicates the privacy interests of all government employees,” Strzok’s attorney Aitan Goelman said in a news release.
    

            “We will continue to litigate Pete’s constitutional claims to ensure that, in the future, public servants are protected from adverse employment actions motivated by partisan politics,” Goelman continued.

    Editor’s Note: This story was originally published on July 14. It was updated on July 26 with additional forensic analysis.


            Former President Donald Trump was injured in a shooting during his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, Saturday evening, in what the FBI says was an assassination attempt. One rally attendee was killed and two others were seriously injured.
    

            The rally marked Trump’s last public appearance before the scheduled start of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where the Republican Party is set to formally select him as its presidential nominee.
    

            Through videos, maps and photos, CNN pieced together what occurred from the start of the rally to the chaotic moments when gunshots erupted to, ultimately, when Trump landed in Newark, New Jersey, early Sunday morning.

Trump starts addressing his supporters and speaks for roughly six minutes before the scene erupts into chaos.
Video shows some attendees notice the gunman on the roof at least one minute and 57 seconds before the shooting begins, based on an analysis comparing this video to the moments in Trump’s speech. At least one law enforcement officer appears in the video to be walking around the building where the gunman is on the roof. You can see the gunman laying down on the roof crawling as people in the crowd shout out that there’s someone on the roof. Several rally attendees try to call attention to the gunman as Trump is speaking on the stage.

Trump is in the middle of speaking when someone in the crowd is heard saying, “He’s got a gun.” As the video captures someone in the crowd repeating, “On the roof. He’s got a gun,” three shots ring out. A pause and five more shots in rapid succession are heard, along with a final shot of a different tone. “Stay under here,” an attendee says in the video. Forensic analysis suggests that at least two weapons were fired at the rally (including, apparently, those fired as part of the response by law enforcement officials). The first eight shots were consistent with alleged weapon A and the final two shots were emitted by one or two “same or similar” weapon, per audio analysis by Catalin Grigoras, director of the National Center for Media Forensics at the University of Colorado in Denver, and Cole Whitecotton, Senior Professional Research Associate at the same institution. Their initial analysis was updated after receiving access to raw footage of the assassination attempt. The FBI said that the shooter acted alone.

Trump takes cover as US Secret Service agents rush to the podium to surround him. “Get down, get down, get down,” one says.
While the gunman is positioned outside the rally venue, the distance between him and where Trump is speaking is only approximately 400 to 500 feet. CNN has learned that the gunman accessed the roof by climbing a building AC unit, though the timing of this action is not known.
Trump remains low to the ground surrounded by agents, who can be heard on the rally microphone discussing which vehicle would be used to move the former president away from the scene. Seconds later, multiple agents say, “Shooter’s down.” Law enforcement in tactical gear and rifles are now on the stage. A woman’s screams are heard following the sound of another shot.
Here’s a transcript of the audio at the podium with Trump and Secret Service members.
Female agent: “What’re we doing? What’re we doing? …Where are we going…”Man indistinctly yelling.
Gunshot, then woman screams. 
Male agent 2: “Go around to the spare. Go around to the spare.”(“Spare” refers to a spare limousine.)
Male agent 3 appears to say something like: “Move to the spare, hold, hold, when you’re ready, on you.”
Male agent 2: “Ready.”
Male agent 3: “Move!”
Male agent 2: “Up!”
Male agent 3: “Move!”
Male agent 4: “Go, go, go.”
Male agent 2: “Hawkeye’s here.”(“Hawkeye” is the code name for the counter assault team.)
Female agent 1: “Hawkeye’s here, moving to the spare.”
Male agent 4: “Spare get ready, spare get ready.”
Male agent 2: “You ready?”
Agents: “Shooter’s down. Shooter’s down. Are we good to move?”
Male agent: “Shooter’s down. We’re good to move.”
Female agent: “Are we clear?”
Agents: “We’re clear. We’re clear. We’re clear.”
Male agent: “Let’s move. Let’s move.”
The suspected shooter fired from a building rooftop before he was killed by Secret Service personnel, the agency said.

One man who was shot and killed has since been identified as firefighter, father and husband, Corey Comperatore. His location was on the set of bleachers to Trump’s right. The two seriously injured victims, David Dutch and James Copenhaver, were sitting on the far end of the bleachers to Trump’s left. CNN geolocated the victims positions using verified videos and photos from the event.

Here’s more of the transcript from the same audio with Trump and Secret Service members, after agents start to stand, lifting Trump.
Trump: “Let me get my shoes. Let me get my shoes.”
Male agent 2: “I got you sir. I got you sir.”
Trump: “Let me get my shoes on.”
Another male agent: “Hold on, your head is bloody.”
Male agent 2: “Sir, we’ve got to move to the car, sir.”
Trump: “Let me get my shoes.”
Female agent: “OK, [inaudible].”
Trump: “Wait, wait, wait.” He then fist pumps to crowd. He mouths “fight” three times — a move met with cheers by the crowd.
Agent: “We got to move. We got to move.”
Trump was then helped down the stairs of the stage by five agents and ushered into the SUV that was waiting for him. Trump raised his fist one more time as he got into the backseat of the vehicle, which ultimately took him from the rally site to a local hospital.
Trump’s spokesperson says the former president “is fine” and being evaluated at a “medical facility,” in a statement released approximately 40 minutes after the shooting.
Roughly two and a half hours after he was taken off the rally stage, Trump says in a Truth Social statement, “I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin.”

Matthew Crooks tells agents that he believed his son, Thomas Matthew Crooks, had taken the rifle Saturday to go to the shooting range and thought he would be back by around 1 p.m., according to law enforcement officials. CNN has also learned that the shooter requested a day off from work Saturday because he had “something to do,” according to multiple law enforcement officials.
Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro says late Saturday night that Trump had left the Butler, Pennsylvania, area following the rally shooting. In the early hours of Sunday morning, Trump flies back to Newark, New Jersey. Trump campaign deputy communications director Margo Martin posts a video of Trump disembarking from a plane in Newark, writing on X: “Strong and resilient. He will never stop fighting for America.”

CNN_94,"Toyota will put new engines into 100,000 Tundra trucks and Lexus SUVs",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/business/toyota-recall-engine-replacement-tundra-trucks-lexus-suv/index.html,2024-07-27 06:29:00,us,"
            In early June, Toyota announced the recall of nearly 100,000 Tundra pickups and about 3,500 Lexus luxury SUVs to fix a problem that could cause their engines to lose power while driving.
    

            At the time, Toyota said it was working to find a solution to the issue. The solution, it now says, is simply to replace the entire engine on each one of the 103,500 big trucks and SUVs.
    

            The vehicles involved are 2022 and 2023 model year Toyota Tundras and Lexus LX 600s. Only regular gasoline-powered versions, not hybrids, are involved in this recall, according to Toyota. (The Tundra is available in both gas-only and “iForce Max” hybrid versions.)
    

            In some of these vehicles, debris from the manufacturing process may have been left inside the engine where it can lead to banging or popping noises, the engine not running smoothly and even stalling altogether while driving.
    

            Toyota dealers will perform the engine replacement at no cost to the vehicles’ owners. The company did not provide any information on how much replacing the engines on all these vehicles will cost the automaker.
    

            It is unusual, but not unheard of, for an auto manufacturer to have to replace engines in a recall. For instance, in 2015, Hyundai recalled 470,000 Sonata models for a similar problem and, in that case, said that engines could have to be replaced in some of those cars. Last year, Honda recalled 250,000 vehicles for a problem that could, in some cases, result in engines having to be replaced.

CNN_95,5 takeaways from the opening ceremony of the 2024 Paris Olympics,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/sport/takeaways-opening-ceremony-2024-paris-olympics/index.html,2024-07-27 06:50:00,world,"
            It was wet, parts of it were weird, much of it was beautiful and all of it was very, very memorable.
    

            An opening ceremony unlike any other got the 2024 edition of the Olympic Games officially underway in Paris Friday night and truly it was one that will live on in Olympic legend – though maybe not in the way the Paris 2024 organizers would have hoped.
    

            Here are five takeaways from the opening of the 2024 Olympics.
    

            It wasn’t exactly the night that Paris 2024 organizers would have hoped for (more on that in a moment). But the opportunity to put the City of Light and its culture and people on full display was well-taken on Friday.
    

            The boats floating on the River Seine allowed for incredible Parisian scenes as they passed storied landmarks on their journey to the end of the Parade of Nations at the Trocadero, with an Olympic-rings-adorned Eiffel Tower serving as the backdrop. The famous landmark was lit up in all its glory, a veritable beacon on what could have been a dreary night.
    

            Much of the city was used as part of the performances, including videos of a torch-bearer running across the city’s rooftops and through iconic Paris locations. While the initial part of the ceremony flicked back and forth between recorded videos and live sweeping shots of the city, it really picked up when the focus was put on Paris itself.
    

            Parts of the city’s history and culture were acknowledged throughout the ceremony, including a heavy metal performance in the Conciergerie with the windows full of headless Marie Antoinettes backlit in red, and a fashion show catwalk that went over the river itself. Oh, and not to mention Lady Gaga performing a salute to the city’s cabaret’s culture on the banks of the river.
    

            As the sun went down, the City of Light shone through the raindrops. The running of the Olympic Torch passed down the lit-up Seine and around the magnificent scenery outside of the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower’s light show looked incredible as it illuminated the clouds and rain with lasers and dancing beams.
    

            It was a strong preview of what the rest of the Games will look like with some of the city’s most iconic landmarks serving as backgrounds for competition.
    

            The rain had sent a warning Friday morning and threatened through much of Friday afternoon. But Paris’ gray skies finally opened up about 30 minutes into a three-and-a-half-hour show, leading to perhaps the most drenched opening ceremony in the history of the modern Olympics.
    

            Hundreds of thousands of spectators lined the banks of the River Seine, clad in ponchos and rain jackets, and a canopy of umbrellas sprouted up at the first hint of raindrops. But after about an hour of the wet stuff coming down in earnest, it was clear some of the crowd had had enough. In the grandstands at the end of the Parade of Nations, exposed onlookers ran for the comfort of hospitality tents and other nearby covered areas while cameras caught the occasional thinning of the crowd along the riverside.
    

            The rain was evident in the performances as dancers occasionally took tentative movements or were seen having slight slips as they performed. The water sprung off musicians’ instruments as they played and some of the boats carrying the smaller athletic delegations appeared tossed in the Seine’s waves.
    

            But the Olympic spirit did not wilt in the rain. The athletes – standing in pouring rain days before they are about to compete in the most important competitions of their lives – looked beyond excited to wave to the crowds and France truly seemed to embrace the Games, though maybe most of the Parisians who did not had already left the city to flee the millions of people coming to watch the competitions.
    

            After a stunning light show on the Eiffel Tower, one of the most iconic singers of the last several decades finally made her return to performing after four years.
    

Celine Dion has has been battling stiff person syndrome, a rare neurological condition that causes spasms, muscle rigidity, and a heightened sensitivity to stimuli, such as sound and lights. These spasms can be strong enough to fracture bone, and any fall can lead to severe injury, experts say.

            Stiff person syndrome is very rare. About 1 out of every 1 million people develop it and most general neurologists will see only one or two cases in their lifetimes. The condition can develop at any age and has been found to affect twice as many women as men.
    

            The exact cause of stiff person syndrome isn’t clear, but research has shown it may be due to an autoimmune response gone awry in the brain and spinal cord. Pain relievers, anti-anxiety medications and muscle relaxers can be a part of treatment for this disease, and a new drug has recently been fast-tracked for development by the US Food and Drug Administration.
    

            Dion has been upbeat about her recovery, recently praising her doctor and saying that her fear of her condition has been replaced with hope.
    

            Her performance of “L’Hymne à l’amour” closed the ceremony in stunning fashion. Clad in magnificent white, Dion’s performance drew goosebumps as she rolled back the years and her incredible voiced echoed along the Seine.
    

            A massive roar greeted the end of her performance from the spectators who braved the rain throughout the night as the Eiffel Tower sparkled around her – truly a moment worthy of a singing icon.
    

            A long dance break in the middle of the show encapsulated the vibe that much of the show took on: It was party time in the French capital.
    

            Plenty of techno and Europop music accompanied by colorful dancers wearing all sorts of rave outfits – including one singer fully painted blue singing on a bed of flowers – turned heads around the world as the French displayed their party scene.
    

            Earlier in the ceremony, the first moment that made people stop and stare was a performance by heavy metal band Gojira and their aforementioned headless Marie Antoinettes. In an opening ceremony full of classic rock anthems and dance tracks, the slamming drums and driving guitar was a surprising change of pace – indeed, it was the first time a metal band had played at the Opening Ceremony – but one that left a mark.
    

            There was also a stirring performance of the host nation’s national anthem “La Marseillaise” from the top of the Grand Palais that surely sent French spirits soaring.
    

            The traditional singing of John Lennon’s “Imagine” was accompanied by a burning piano on a stage floating in the Seine, a truly incredible moment as the lights went out along the river.
    

            And as volunteers carried nations’ flags into the Trocadero, a rider on a galloping steel horse glided down the Seine with the Olympic flag serving as a cape in a one-of-a-kind Olympic moment. The steel horse and rider gave way to the living versions of both, carrying the Olympic flag to be officially raised.
    

            The 2024 Games promised an opening ceremony unlike any other and it delivered – including on the incredible cauldron lighting.
    

            The torch was carried by scores of French athletes and other famous Olympians of now and yesteryear – including Zinedine Zidane, Rafael Nadal (who carried the torch on a boat down the Seine), Serena Williams (who rode next to Nadal), Carl Lewis and Tony Parker.
    

            And when the final torchbearers judo star Teddy Riner and 400-meter sprinter Marie-José Pérec lit the Olympic cauldron, which was attached to a giant balloon, it began to float.
    

            The Olympic flame ended the night hovering over the city of Paris – one last chance for the cameras to capture the incredible Parisian landscape.

CNN_96,Olympic moment of the day: Married couple makes history as Romania’s flag bearers,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/sport/olympic-moment-of-the-day-romanian-flag-bearers/index.html,2024-07-27 06:41:00,world,"
            Romanian rowing athletes Ionela-Livia Cozmiuc and Marius Cozmiuc set a historic first at the opening ceremony Friday in Paris, becoming the first-ever married couple to serve as flag bearers for their country.


            In what is truly an athletic love story, the two flag bearers are both multiple-time Olympians. Marius Cozmiuc won a silver medal in the coxless pairs for Romania at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Ionela Livia Cozmiuc is a two-time Olympian in double sculls (sixth in 2020, eighth in 2016), a two-time lightweight sculls world champion (2017, 2018) and the 2022 World Championships single sculls gold medalist.
    

            The duo found out about their honors shortly before the Games when they went to do a photo shoot.
    

            “It’s a huge honor for us to be the flag bearers. We didn’t expect that, but every Olympic athlete dreams about it, so we’re really glad that we’ll do this together as a family,” Ionela Livia Cozmiuc told the Olympic Information Service.
    

            It’s a family affair for the Cozmiucs.
    

            “It’s our third Olympics together as a couple. We were together at Rio (in 2016), then in Tokyo (2020), and now here. It’s not just the two of us from our family,” Ionela Livia said.
    

            “My brother is also in the team, my sister-in-law is also in the team - Florin Sorin Lehaci and Maria Lehaci - and last year, on this venue, the sister of Maria Lehaci (Gabriela Tivodariu) won the world title in the pair (at the World Under-19 Rowing Championships). So, we are a small family in the big family of the Romanian rowing team.”
    

            The Cozmiucs are happy to be competing in the same sport and sharing the honor of being flag bearers, but they and the rest of their rowing family members have a rule at dinner: No talking shop.
    

            “We try to not. We have a lot of subjects, of course, but everything ends with a rowing story. Even if we go out at dinner, for example. My brother once said that the first who would start to talk about rowing would pay (for) the dinner. It was me,” Ionela Livia said.

WaPo_1,Top Sinaloa cartel leader taken into U.S. custody alongside son of ‘El Chapo’,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/25/mayo-zambada-sinaloa-cartel-arrested/,2024-07-26 08:56:02.590294,,"MEXICO CITY — A longtime senior leader of the Sinaloa cartel, Ismael Zambada Garcia, or “El Mayo,” and a son of famed drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman were taken into custody Thursday by U.S. authorities in Texas, according to senior Mexican and U.S. officials. It was a major blow to the Sinaloa federation, a global drug-trafficking syndicate that has sent tons of cocaine, heroin, fentanyl and other drugs to the United States.Zambada and the former drug lord’s son, also named Joaquin Guzman, turned themselves in, according to a former U.S. official with knowledge of the detentions.The two men are among the U.S. government’s most-wanted drug traffickers, and the State Department had offered $15 million for information leading to Zambada’s capture.The news of Zambada’s arrest was first reported by the Reuters news agency.Zambada and the senior Guzman were considered co-founders of the Sinaloa cartel. The elder Guzman was arrested in 2016 and convicted of multiple drug charges in the United States. He is serving a life sentence in a Colorado maximum-security prison.Unlike “El Chapo,” known for his girlfriends and flashy lifestyle, Zambada had kept a low profile. He is believed to be in his 70s.The Justice Department confirmed it had “taken into custody” both Zambada and the younger Guzman on Thursday in El Paso.The department said the men “are facing multiple charges in the United States for leading the Cartel’s criminal operations, including its deadly fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking networks.”It did not provide details of how the pair were detained. But U.S. authorities have aggressively targeted the Sinaloa cartel because of its critical role in the production of fentanyl, responsible for tens of thousands of American deaths over the past few years.El Chapo’s son had been under pressure from his family to turn himself in to U.S. authorities, according to a former U.S. official with knowledge of the joint investigation by the DEA and Homeland Security Investigations agents. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the operation.Miroff reported from Washington. Lorena Rios in Monterrey, Mexico, contributed to this report."
WaPo_2,Judge throws out Gateway Pundit’s bankruptcy claim,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/25/judge-throws-out-gateway-pundits-bankruptcy-claim/,2024-07-26 08:03:02.590294,,"A federal judge in Florida threw out a bankruptcy case filed by the Gateway Pundit, ruling that the site, which is known for spreading conspiracy theories, sought bankruptcy protection in “bad faith” to avoid having to pay potential damages in defamation suits related to the site’s reporting on the 2020 election.The Thursday ruling from U.S. bankruptcy judge Mindy Mora in the Southern District of Florida means that defamation cases from two Georgia election workers, as well as one from a former Dominion Voting Systems executive, can proceed. The defamation cases had been held up while the bankruptcy case was ongoing.Gateway Pundit wrote a series of articles about the 2020 presidential election amplifying claims that the election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss and former Dominion executive Eric Coomer helped rig the 2020 election in favor of Joe Biden. Gateway Pundit denies wrongdoing and previously said it was seeking bankruptcy protection to fight against “progressive liberal lawfare attacks” against the site.“We are pleased that the Court today saw through The Gateway Pundit’s transparent attempt to abuse the bankruptcy process to avoid accountability and granted our motion to dismiss the bankruptcy case,” Brittany Williams, a lawyer at Protect Democracy, said in a statement. The organization is representing Freeman and Moss along with several private law firms and attorneys and the Yale Law School’s Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic.Coomer’s attorney did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.Gateway Pundit published an article responding to the judge’s decision, which the organization plans to appeal. The piece alleged, referencing an unnamed anonymous source, that the Department of Justice had intervened in the case to influence the judge.“In this unusual bankruptcy case, truth is at the center of all disputes. Lack of truthful disclosure, theories based upon half-truths, claims for which truth could provide a defense — all possibilities are on display,” Mora wrote in her decision. “Litigation about truth pushed [Gateway Pundit] to file bankruptcy, but that unusual twist does not alter the Court’s duty to remain focused on bankruptcy issues.”Mora wrote that, far from being financially insolvent, Gateway Pundit’s assets were “eye-catching.” She noted that the company’s assets were 22 times the size of its liabilities. The company reported more than $3 million in revenue in 2023, higher than the previous year, and was on track to continue that trajectory in 2024.The judge wrote that the “publication of sensational stories has generated healthy revenues” for Gateway Pundit, but that “the viability of that strategy as a long-term business plan … is now in question.” The defamation cases challenge what the judge described as a “brash (and allegedly not fact-checked) reporting style.”The judge went on to say that if a court ruled against the site in a defamation suit, “then the Gateway Pundit might choose to adopt a more restrained editorial style. That choice could lead to fewer website views, which would likely soften revenue.”“TGP remains both balance sheet and cash flow solvent. There is no present financial distress, no looming foreclosure sale, no prospect of a market crash,” Mora wrote. The only financial strain resulted from the defamation suits. “That’s not a basis for bankruptcy relief; it’s the justice system in operation.”Jim Hoft, owner and founder of the Gateway Pundit, has said he started blogging as a hobby in 2004, overseeing significant growth in the site’s traffic, particularly following the 2020 election, which Hoft and his small staff covered extensively.One of Gateway Pundit’s highest-profile stories of 2020 was published after a volunteer Trump campaign attorney presented a misleading video during a post-election hearing in Georgia. The video purported to show that Freeman and Moss, Freeman’s daughter, had tampered with ballots.That day, Gateway Pundit published the first of 58 articles on the two women that would appear over the next year and a half, even though Georgia election officials had quickly debunked claims that the pair had engaged in election fraud. Gateway Pundit’s stories cast Freeman and Moss as “crooked” operatives who counted “illegal ballots from a suitcase stashed under a table!”In 2021, the women sued Gateway Pundit, Hoft and his twin brother, Joe, who is a frequent contributor to the site. Gateway Pundit and the Hofts filed a counterclaim, alleging that the case against them is designed to drive Gateway Pundit out of business. The counterclaim was dismissed in 2023.A federal jury in 2023 ordered Rudy Giuliani to pay the two women $148 million for his own false claims that they helped steal the election from Trump. His lawyer, Joseph D. Sibley IV, told jurors that Gateway Pundit had been “patient zero” for the false claims.Coomer sued the site in Colorado in 2020 after it boosted false claims that he was part of an effort to throw the election for Biden.Gateway Pundit’s parent company, TGP Communications, filed for bankruptcy in April. “We will not be deterred from our mission of remaining fearless and being one of the most trusted independent media outlets in America today. We do not expect that to change,” Jim Hoft wrote at the time.In her ruling, the Florida judge indicated that the company, which had been based out of Hoft’s home in Missouri, appeared to have been operating in Florida for several years without a license and may owe back taxes there. “Taking Hoft’s sworn testimony at face value, TGP has been doing business in the state of Florida for approximately 3 years without a local business license,” she wrote.Referring to substantial assets controlled by Hoft, the judge wrote that “it is difficult to tell where TGP ends and Hoft begins.”She noted a Jensen Beach condo that Hoft purchased for just under $800,000 and a 2021 Porsche Cayenne whose value is over $50,000 as some of the assets “accrued with TGP’s funds.”In concluding that the case was filed in bad faith, the judge wrote that “the plain statutory language and years of legislative history show that bankruptcy relief is intended to foster equitable goals, not provide a Monopoly-style ‘Get out of jail free’ card.”"
WaPo_3,Mars rover discovers an ancient rock with a ‘potential biosignature’,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2024/07/25/mars-rover-life-nasa/,2024-07-26 08:00:02.590294,,"Ancient life on Mars? Maybe, could be, might be. But this is going to require a much closer look.That’s the boiled-down message from NASA, which revealed Thursday that the Perseverance rover had found a rock with compelling evidence of organic molecules and with intriguing markings that, if they were seen on Earth, would be consistent with biological activity in the past.The announcement came framed with cautionary notes. Organics can have both a biological or non-biological origin, a fact NASA scientists emphasized. Mars rocks have fooled scientists before.But they’re pumped about this vein-filled rock that they’ve dubbed “Cheyava Falls.” NASA said the rock was sampled July 21 on the edge of an ancient, wide river valley carved by water rushing long ago into Jezero Crater, before Mars lost most of its atmosphere and surface water and became a cold, parched world with dust storms and no sign of anything alive.“We cannot say right now that we have discovered life on Mars,” said Katie Stack Morgan, the deputy project scientist. “But what we are saying is that we have a potential biosignature, which is a set of features that could have a biological origin but do need further study and more data.”The reddish rock is covered with white patches known as “leopard spots.” These spots are produced by chemical reactions that on Earth are often associated with biological activity, Stack Morgan said.“This is the kind of feature if found on Earth, life would probably be involved with it,” she said. “At the same time, these are chemical reactions that don’t require life.”The rover has been traversing an ancient river delta in Jezero Crater, and pocketing samples of rock and soil as part of the ambitious but troubled Mars Sample Return mission. Cheyava Falls is an arrowhead-shaped rock that measures 3.2 feet by 2 feet, and is named after a waterfall in the Grand Canyon, NASA said.The rover took a sample of the rock, the 22nd sample obtained so far. The general plan has been to send another spacecraft to the surface of Mars to be met by Perseverance for the sample transfer. Then the new lander will launch the material into orbit, where it will be transferred to yet another spacecraft — one provided by the European Space Agency — for the journey back to Earth.But fears of cost overruns and delays have called into question whether NASA and its European partners can finish the job. In 2020, a review board estimated that Mars Sample Return would cost $3.8 billion to $4.4 billion. A review last year jacked that estimate to $8.4 billion to $10.9 billion, with samples not getting back to laboratories on Earth until 2040.NASA officials said that wasn’t acceptable, and earlier this year put the mission on a bare-bones budget. They also asked the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory as well as outside contractors to propose new mission architectures that could bring down the cost and operational risk.The rover does not have the kind of advanced technology necessary to tell if the leopard spots and organic molecules are biological or non-biological in origin, said Andrew Steele, an astrobiologist at the Carnegie Institution for Science who is part of the Perseverance scientific team.But the rock’s environment, the presence of organics and the surface features are all compelling and make Cheyava Falls the most important sample obtained so far, he said.“It just ticks all the boxes,” Steele said. “It’s very interesting chemistry with the iron and phosphate concentrations. It shows aqueous activity. It’s a great place for habitability.”He is eager to see the new rock up close, back here on Earth."
WaPo_4,"Father Eugene Brake, activist priest and food bank leader, dies at 89",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/07/25/eugene-brake-capital-area-food-bank/,2024-07-26 08:00:02.590294,,"Father Eugene Brake, a Catholic priest who co-founded the Washington area’s largest food bank and spent decades championing social justice, demonstrating on behalf of Soviet Jews, the antiwar movement and incarcerated people in Virginia, died July 20 at his home in Frederick, Md. He was 89.His partner Lynn Brantley, with whom he helped start the Capital Area Food Bank, said the cause was multiple myeloma, a rare blood cancer. Father Brake had left the priesthood around the late 1980s, in part because of their relationship.Formed through a partnership between the United Planning Organization and the Interfaith Conference of Metropolitan Washington, the Capital Area Food Bank opened in 1980 as a bridge between local agencies feeding the hungry and grocery stores looking to offload extra food.It was initially based out of a leaky warehouse in Northeast Washington, where it distributed just over 1 million pounds of food in its first year, including slightly dented cans and unwanted frozen dinners salvaged from wholesalers.As Congress and the Reagan administration slashed funding for the food stamp program, now known as SNAP, the food bank grew to help fill the void, eventually moving into a bigger warehouse, opening a second location in Lorton, Va., and partnering with local organizations to pair food with health care, job training and educational programs. The group said it distributed 73 million pounds of food last year, half of which was fresh produce.Father Brake “was the heart and soul of the place,” said Brantley, who served as the organization’s president and chief executive before retiring in 2012. “He was a gentle soul, but he knew how to go at things.”When a room in the warehouse needed to be expanded because of all the food coming in, Father Brake tore down the wall himself, even though he had recently fallen off his bike and broken his arm. He built a makeshift desk out of particle board when more workspace was needed. He organized the shopping area and ran errands and hauled potatoes. For a time, Brantley recalled, he picked up cans in a run-down pickup that had more than 500,000 miles on it.“He had this funny, conspiratorial tone about him — he never took himself too seriously, even though he took the work of social justice very seriously,” said Hilary Salmon, a spokeswoman for the food bank.Friends joked that he subsisted entirely on peanut butter and crackers, washed down at times with a Diet Pepsi. He seemed to bike or walk everywhere he went.“Life had a kind of beautiful simplicity for Gene,” said Grant P. Thompson, a consultant to the food bank. “He was one of those people who was a little bit easy to underestimate. Not highly educated, not sophisticated in any kind of way. But to be around him caused you to say to yourself, ‘How can I be better?’ His view on life was, we can all be better.”Activism and advocacy were essential to his ministry. Although he was based for a time at Holy Name Catholic Church, off H Street NE, he also worked at McKenna House, a shelter for men transitioning out of homelessness, and served as a volunteer chaplain at Lorton Reformatory. For years, he rode his bike 30 miles each way to meet with inmates at the Virginia prison, whom he helped find jobs and housing upon their release.When two inmates were hospitalized in 1984 with severe burns from a gas explosion, Father Brake helped draw attention to their plight, demonstrating for three days outside a neighboring landfill. Authorities said the blast was triggered by methane gas that had seeped through sewer lines and phone cables from the dump.The Washington Post reported that Father Brake, “clad in clerical collar and standing before a bulldozer,” delayed a half-dozen garbage trucks operating at the landfill, where he called for the men’s sentences to be commuted. “They have suffered enough,” he said. “Their punishment is going to be for life. They look like victims of nuclear fallout.”One of the men, Anthony Johnson, 25, soon died from his injuries. Father Brake successfully advocated on behalf of the other, Arthur Moody, who had been serving a sentence for unauthorized use of a car and receiving stolen property. He was granted clemency by President Ronald Reagan the next year, at age 27. “Justice has been done,” Father Brake declared.By then, Father Brake was an old hand at using dramatic demonstrations to advance his cause. He was arrested four times during antimilitary protests at the Pentagon, including a 1977 demonstration in which he was said to have joined Father Philip Berrigan and other activists in throwing “human blood and ashes on the floor, the doors and the ceiling” of the Pentagon concourse, according to United Press International.Father Brake was later detained in Moscow while trying to aid Soviet Jews known as refuseniks, who had been denied permission to emigrate, and was arrested outside the Soviet Embassy in Washington in 1985 during a protest marking Yom Kippur.The Catholic hierarchy bristled at some of Father Brake’s advocacy, including an anti-apartheid demonstration he held outside the residence of future Cardinal Pio Laghi, Pope John Paul II’s official representative to the United States. The Post reported in 1989 that Cardinal James A. Hickey, the archbishop of Washington, refused a request to appoint Father Brake the official Catholic chaplain at Lorton.“He’s kind of a prophet, and we need people like him a lot,” the Rev. Richard Fowler, Hickey’s secretary for social concerns, said at the time. “But he feels responsible only to God, and in a church like this, when you have people not willing to cooperate, it makes the cardinal very uncomfortable.”Before long, Father Brake left the ministry and moved in with Brantley. “It was a tough decision to make, because he was very dedicated,” she said, adding that their relationship “definitely played a role” in his decision to stop preaching.For the next two decades, his advocacy continued unabated, including at the food bank, where he remained known by his priestly title.“All I ever wanted was the same opportunities for everybody,” he said, according to a tribute from CEO Radha Muthiah. “That’s what drives me. It’s the very nature of Christianity.”The second of 12 children, Eugene Francis Brake was born into an Irish Catholic family in Wilmington, Del., on July 24, 1934. His mother managed the home, and his father worked for nearly 50 years at a men’s clothing factory. “I was poor,” he said of his childhood, “but I never felt poor.”He and his siblings went to parochial schools — two of his sisters became nuns — and after working as an upholsterer he professed his vows with the Oblates of St. Francis de Sales, who operated his Wilmington high school. He graduated in 1962 from Niagara University, studied at the De Sales Hall School of Theology in Hyattsville, Md., and was ordained to the priesthood in 1965.The next day, he celebrated his first public Mass, not at a church but at the New Castle Correctional Institution, a Delaware prison where a whipping post still stood as a deterrent to crime.In addition to Brantley, his partner of more than three decades, survivors include five sisters and three brothers.Father Brake remained a regular presence at the Capital Area Food Bank until around 2012, when Brantley retired, shortly after the organization opened a new $37 million distribution center.The group had come a long way, Father Brake noted at the dedication ceremony.“We got this far by faith,” he said, “and we will move forward in hope. This building is proof.”"
WaPo_5,Future Forward launches a $50 million pre-convention ad blitz for Harris,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/25/harris-future-forward-ads/,2024-07-26 08:00:02.590294,,"The Kamala Harris ad blitz has launched.Future Forward, the largest Democratic-leaning super PAC, will spend $50 million on advertising in six states over the next three weeks to introduce the vice president and boost her candidacy before the Democratic nominating convention in Chicago begins, the group announced Thursday.American Bridge 21st Century, the second-largest independent advertiser for the Democratic presidential campaign, will restart its advertising Friday in the northern battlegrounds of Michigan, continuing a direct-to-camera testimonial campaign that began in May before taking a break, according to a person familiar with that spending, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the plans. Women Vote, the ad spending arm of the Democratic-leaning Emily’s List, also announced on Thursday a $2 million digital effort for Harris aimed at younger women in four of the states.“We’re ready to hit the ground running to make sure voters know that Kamala Harris will be a President that fights for them,” Future Forward President Chauncey McLean said in a statement Thursday. “She is focused on improving the lives of all Americans, while Donald Trump is only focused on himself.”The ads will begin airing Saturday, with a positive biographical spot about Harris.That ad describes Harris as “the district attorney who protected children from sexual predators,” “the attorney general who stood up to the big banks to protect homeowners and won,” “the senator who fought to defend a woman’s right to make her own medical decisions,” and “the vice president who fought to cap the price of insulin at $35 a month.”The Harris campaign also launched its first ad on Thursday, aiming to draw a sharp distinction with Republican nominee Donald Trump and amplify the pro-freedom theme that has become central to her pitch.“In this election, we each face a question: What kind of country do we want to live in?” Harris says in the ad. “There are some people who think we should be a country of chaos. Of fear. Of hate. But us? We choose something different. We choose freedom.”The ad backup for Harris counters a short-term advantage that Republicans have had in ad spending in swing states since Sunday, when President Biden announced he was dropping out of the race and endorsed Harris. MAGA Inc., a group supporting Trump, spent $2.9 million on ads between Sunday and Thursday, according to AdImpact, a tracking firm. That included a spot alleging that “Kamala was in on it. She covered up Joe’s obvious mental decline,” before blaming her for increased immigration and inflation.The Harris and Biden operation spent just under $2 million during the same period, according to AdImpact. The Harris campaign has separately launched a massive digital ad campaign through her affiliated victory fund to raise money this week, spending $4.8 million over five days, according to Ad Impact. In the five days before Biden’s exit, the same victory fund spent $1.6 million on digital ads.MAGA Inc. is also adding $32 million in ads attacking Harris between now and Labor Day, bringing the group’s planned total for that period to $72 million, according to a super PAC official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the plans. (The official later said the correct number is $70 million.) Politico first reported the new MAGA Inc. spending Thursday.The attack ads will be focused in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona, the MAGA Inc. official said. Spots are expected to criticize Harris’s handling of the southern border — for instance, her past comments that “the border is secure” — as well as her record as a prosecutor.Future Forward’s ad-makers have produced more than 50 potential spots for Harris since Sunday, said a person familiar with the strategy, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.Those spots will form the basis for the coming campaign, with more than half of the spending occurring alongside Olympics coverage, when the group’s strategists expect many of their targeted voters, including those less engaged with politics, will be watching.Future Forward announced a $250 million post-convention advertising commitment in January, the largest single purchase in political history. But the group, which spends through a committee called FF PAC, did not rule out additional spending, either before or after the convention. Discussions of launching ads earlier in July were put on hold after Biden stumbled in a June 27 presidential debate, raising questions about whether he would stay in the race.Future Forward USA Action, an affiliate of Future Forward that does not disclose its donors, has already been one of the biggest spenders of the cycle. The group spent nearly $25 million on broadcast, cable and digital spots last year on its own and $40 million in partnership with Climate Power. Those spots focused on Biden’s policy achievements as president.Women Vote releasedtwo ads on Thursday, both contrasting Harris’s work to ensure abortion access with Trump’s record on the issue. American Bridge has said it plans to spend $140 million in the northern battleground states through November on voter testimonial ads warning about another Trump term in office. The ads focus on attacking Trump for on such issues as democracy, his criminal convictions and members of his own administration distancing themselves from him.ProgressNow, another independent group, started an $11 million digital ad purchase on Monday that will run through Labor Day promoting Harris.

WaPo_6,Harris calls for cease-fire and hostage release after Netanyahu meeting,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/25/netanyahu-biden-harris-hostages/,2024-07-26 08:00:02.590294,,"Vice President Harris implored Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday to accept a cease-fire deal that would pause the fighting in Gaza and release hostages, as U.S. leaders say they are closer than ever to an agreement.“Let’s get the deal done so we can get a cease-fire to end the war,” she told reporters in brief remarks after her bilateral meeting with Netanyahu at the White House. “Let’s bring the hostages home, and let’s provide much-needed relief to the Palestinian people.”Harris’s decision to give her full backing for the deal and explain its general outline appeared designed to add pressure on Israel and Hamas to close the remaining gaps in reaching an agreement to at least temporarily end more than nine months of conflict.That it was the vice president, not President Biden, giving public remarks after they each held bilateral meetings with the Israeli leader reflected how much has changed in Washington in recent days. Biden announced Sunday he was exiting the presidential race; by Tuesday, Harris had become the likely Democratic nominee.In her remarks, Harris reiterated that she remains a firm backer of Israel, reflecting on collecting money to plant trees in Israel as a young girl, while also expressing serious concern about some of Israel’s conduct in its unrelenting military campaign in Gaza.As Harris moves forward in the presidential race, she will find herself needing to further define her positions on key issues, especially the Israel-Gaza war, and where, if any, there is daylight between her and the president.Harris has not publicly diverged from Biden’s approach to the war, but she has pushed the administration to more heavily consider Palestinian suffering in its response and often been the highest-profile official to speak emphatically about civilian casualties.“Israel has a right to defend itself, and how it does so matters,” Harris said, adding that she has “serious concern about the scale of human suffering in Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians,” and “images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety.”“We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering, and I will not be silent,” she said.John Kirby, a White House spokesman, said Harris has “been a full partner in our policies in the Middle East, particularly with our policies toward Israel and the war in Gaza.” He added that she has been involved in nearly every conversation between Biden and Netanyahu since the conflict began.On Thursday morning, as part of that continuing balancing act, Harris — not Biden — released a strongly worded statement about the protests near the U.S. Capitol, while Netanyahu was delivering an address to Congress, calling out “despicable acts by unpatriotic protesters and dangerous hate-fueled rhetoric.”“I condemn any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organization Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate the State of Israel and kill Jews,” she said. “Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent, and we must not tolerate it in our nation.”Before he met with Harris, the Israeli leader met with Biden, whom he has known for decades, in the Oval Office. The two leaders appeared genial at the start of their meeting, despite deep underlying tensions over the ongoing conflict and a path forward.“Well, welcome back, Mr. Prime Minister,” Biden said before the meeting. “We’ve got a lot to talk about. I think we should get to it.”Biden has repeatedly said a cease-fire deal was imminent in recent weeks, even though the United States and other negotiating partners have been frustrated for months by the lack of an agreement.The meetings, part of Netanyahu’s hours-long visit to the White House, came a day after the Israeli leader delivered a defiant speech to a joint meeting of Congress. Netanyahu rejected criticisms from international organizations about Israel’s conduct, posited without evidence that Iran was funding pro-Palestinian protesters surrounding the Capitol, and vowed Israel would settle for nothing less than “total victory.”Since announcing his decision not to seek reelection, Biden has said ending the war remains a top priority in his final months in office.“I’m going to keep working to end the war in Gaza, bring home all the hostages, and bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war,” Biden said Wednesday during his Oval Office address.Kirby told reporters Thursday that the negotiating parties are closer “than we’ve been before” to a deal, though he emphasized there are still important gaps to bridge.The first phase of an agreement would include a six-week pause in fighting and the release of some hostages. The second phase would continue a cessation of hostilities while Hamas and Israel negotiate a permanent cease-fire, determining the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.Biden’s meeting on Thursday was his first face-to-face encounter with Netanyahu since the president traveled to Israel in the days after the Oct. 7 attacks. Thursday marked only the second time Harris met with Netanyahu, a White House official said. They met once in 2017 when she was in the Senate; since the Oct. 7 attacks, she has been on more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu.The president tightly embraced Israel in the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attacks, but as Netanyahu has continued an all-out assault on Gaza, he has become more critical, calling on Israeli leaders to allow more aid into the territory, where nearly 2 million civilians are suffering from widespread starvation and a collapsed health-care system.In his brief public remarks, Netanyahu spoke warmly about Biden, though after leaving the White House, the Israeli leader will head to Mar-a-Lago to meet with former president Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president.“From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,” Netanyahu said to Biden.Despite the ongoing tensions, Kirby said Biden and Netanyahu have a “healthy relationship,” though he did not know if the president had watched Netanyahu’s speech on Wednesday.“And by healthy, I mean they’re not going to agree on everything,” Kirby said. “They haven’t, through the long political lives that both of them have enjoyed, always agreed on everything. They come from two different political traditions, but they know one another.”After their bilateral meeting in the Oval Office, the two leaders met with families of Americans held hostage by Hamas. By including the families, the White House hoped to elevate their message that Netanyahu needs to stop making new demands and agree to the hostage cease-fire deal on the table, officials familiar with the matter said.Netanyahu’s government is negotiating for the release of more than 100 Israeli hostages, though of that number, many are believed to be dead.Following their meeting with Biden and Netanyahu, the hostage families said they were now “more optimistic” than at any other time since November, when Hamas released more than 100 people in the war’s first — and only — negotiated hostage release, said Jonathan Dekel-Chen, father of American hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen.Speaking in front of cameras outside the West Wing, Jonathan Dekel-Chen said the families were given “absolute commitment from the Biden administration and from Netanyahu that they understand the urgency of this moment now to waste no time and to complete this deal as it currently stands, with as little change as humanly possible within it.”The families also emphasized the convergence among Biden, Harris and Trump in supporting an immediate deal.“We’ve got a rare moment now where the current president of the United States, and anybody who might become president of the United States — both Vice President Harris and Donald Trump — are all aligned in saying this deal must get done now,” said Jon Polin, father of American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin.Since the start of the Gaza war, Netanyahu has come under criticism for putting his military objectives related to the total destruction of Hamas ahead of the urgency of securing the release of hostages.Earlier this summer, the United States blamed Hamas for adding new demands to the deal, but that outlook shifted earlier this month when Netanyahu directed Mossad chief David Barnea to negotiate further stipulations that moved the goal posts, said diplomats who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations.Under the new conditions, Israel would not agree to withdraw its forces from the Philadelphi Corridor along the Egyptian border, the diplomats said. Israel would also not allow unrestricted access for Gazans seeking to return to their homes in the north — insisting that its forces be permitted to establish checkpoints to monitor the movement of the displaced."
WaPo_7,"As Harris reintroduces herself, her allies — and Trump’s — launch ad barrages",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/25/harris-address-teachers-ahead-meeting-with-israeli-prime-minister/,2024-07-26 08:00:02.590294,,"As Vice President Harris continued to introduce herself as a 2024 presidential candidate Thursday — an effort that included a high-stakes meeting at the White House, a speech to an influential teachers union and a campaign launch video set to Beyoncé’s 2016 hit “Freedom” — her Republican foes and Democratic allies revealed plans to spend tens of millions of dollars trying to shape her public image in the weeks ahead.MAGA Inc., the main super PAC supporting Republican nominee Donald Trump, is adding $32 million in ads attacking Harris through Labor Day, according to a super PAC official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the group’s plans. Future Forward, the largest Democratic-leaning super PAC, will spend $50 million on advertising in six states over the next three weeks to boost Harris, the group said Thursday.The dueling efforts to tarnish and burnish Harris’s record were announced as the vice president was aiming to outline her vision on domestic and foreign policy. After addressing the teachers, Harris returned to Washington on Thursday to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a preview of the delicate political and policy terrain she must navigate during her shortened and frenetic presidential campaign.The developments Thursday reflected the unsettled state of the presidential race four days after President Biden abruptly ended his reelection bid and endorsed his vice president. Though Harris has succeeded thus far in uniting and energizing Democrats behind her presidential bid, the impending onslaught of ads and the complex politics of U.S.-Israel relations threaten to complicate her sprint to Election Day.“Israel has a right to defend itself — and how it does so matters,” Harris said after her meeting with Netanyahu, which she described as “frank and constructive.” She named each of the Americans held hostage by the “brutal terrorist organization” Hamas and addressed the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.“I also expressed with the prime minister my serious concerns about the scale of human suffering in Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians,” she said, again speaking about the plight of Palestinians in more forceful and empathetic terms than Biden has.“We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies,” Harris said. “We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering. And I will not be silent.”Harris’s address to the American Federation of Teachers on Thursday morning was the latest in a string of events that have demonstrated support for her bid to defeat Trump. After a rally in Milwaukee on Tuesday and a speech to thousands of Black women at a sorority convention in Indianapolis on Wednesday, Harris’s speech to the AFT, a 1.8 million-member group that has endorsed her candidacy, was yet another foray into friendly territory with large, adoring crowds.Harris’s one-on-one meeting with Netanyahu was more staid. In her first sit-down with a foreign leader since launching her campaign for president, Harris confronted the rifts that have emerged between the United States and Israel over the war in Gaza. Voters who had vowed not to vote for Biden over his handling of the war have said they will be watching Harris closely as she publicly deals with a thorny foreign policy matter for the first time since Biden’s exit from the race.Earlier Thursday, Harris released her campaign launch video in an attempt to introduce herself to the country during the 100-plus-day sprint to Election Day. The video aimed to draw a sharp distinction with Trump and amplify the pro-freedom theme that has become central to Harris’s pitch.“In this election, we each face a question: What kind of country do we want to live in?” Harris says in the video, which campaign officials said would air across social media platforms beginning Thursday. “There are some people who think we should be a country of chaos. Of fear. Of hate. But us? We choose something different. We choose freedom.”Meanwhile, Trump and his allies have criticized Harris more directly in recent days, aiming to define her before she has an opportunity to introduce herself more broadly to the public.At a rally in North Carolina on Wednesday, Trump referred to Harris as a “lunatic” and “incompetent,” attacking her on immigration and painting her as incredibly liberal.“If Kamala Harris gets in, she would be the most radical, far-left extremist ever to occupy the White House, times 10,” Trump said.The new ads from MAGA Inc. are expected to criticize Harris’s handling of the southern border — for instance, her past comments that “the border is secure” — as well as her record as a prosecutor. The MAGA Inc. official said the group plans to spend tens of millions of dollars on commercials from now until Labor Day on Sept. 2, which often ushers in a ramped-up final stretch of campaign activity. Politico first reported the new ad spending.The attack ads will be focused in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona, the MAGA Inc. official said.Voters in those states and others will also see pro-Harris ads from Democratic-leaning groups, including Future Forward, American Bridge 21st Century and Women Vote. Future Forward’s will begin airing Saturday, with a positive biographical spot about Harris.During a Thursday interview on Fox News, Trump previewed the attacks he will use to paint a more negative portrait of Harris, calling her “nasty” and accusing her of staging a “palace coup” against Biden.Harris’s campaign shot back Thursday by describing Trump as a “78-year-old criminal” and calling him “old and quite weird.”“After watching Fox News this morning, we only have one question: Is Donald Trump OK?” the campaign said, offering Harris as “an alternative.”Harris said Thursday she was eager to debate Trump directly, arguing that voters deserved to see a “split screen” between the two candidates.“I’m ready to debate Donald Trump,” Harris told reporters Thursday. “I have agreed to the previously agreed upon September 10 debate. He agreed to that previously. Now, here he is backpedaling.”Trump has suggested he is having second thoughts after agreeing to a Sept. 10 debate against Biden on ABC. After Biden dropped out, he has said the debate should take place on Fox News.Some Republicans are still searching for the best way to attack Harris, who has entered the race with momentum in the form of record donations, growing crowds and a series of polls showing her closing the gap with Trump. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has asked GOP lawmakers not to make comments about Harris’s identity after some members referenced it in challenging her credentials.More than two dozen Democratic female lawmakers gathered on Capitol Hill on Thursday to show support for Harris, forcefully pushing back on GOP attacks on her credentials. Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) called Harris a “DEI vice president” — referring to the “diversity, equity and inclusion” initiatives in federal programs — and Rep. Harriet Hageman (R-Wyo.) said in a local news interview that Harris was “a DEI hire.”“These are no longer dog whistles. These are full on bullhorns, and it’s predictable,” Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) said.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the attacks were “disgusting.”Harris has largely focused on domestic policy in her appearances this week, while Biden has indicated he would spend the final six months of his term leaning into foreign policy objectives.But groups like the American Federation of Teachers, while mostly focused on issues like educator pay, recruitment, school funding and collective bargaining, have also taken interest in the war in Gaza, calling for a cease-fire and debating whether to divest from companies linked to Israel’s military campaign. The conflict has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and created a humanitarian calamity in which thousands of children have been out of school for months.Biden met with Netanyahu on Thursday and spoke privately with the families of hostages who were among the 250 taken captive during Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack, which Israel estimates killed about 1,200 people. During an address to Americans on Wednesday evening, Biden pledged to use his remaining months to bring resolution to the long-running conflict.“I’m going to keep working to end the war in Gaza, bring home all the hostages, and bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war,” he said.Hours earlier, Netanyahu had delivered a defiant speech to Congress — one that Harris skipped — in which he described pro-Palestinian protesters as “useful idiots.” Thousands of protesters took to the streets to decry Netanyahu’s visit, and some burned an American flag near Union Station in Washington.Harris issued a statement Thursday condemning the protesters who engaged in property destruction or hateful rhetoric, saying the flag “should never be desecrated in that way.”“I support the right to peacefully protest, but let’s be clear: Antisemitism, hate and violence of any kind have no place in our nation,” she said.Harris steered clear of the issue during her speech in Houston, instead speaking out in favor of unions and the public education system and contrasting her positions with Trump’s views.Calling herself a “proud product of public education,” Harris extolled the “noble” work of educators and attacked Republicans who have called for arming teachers to prevent school shootings.“Just think about it. We want to ban assault weapons, and they want to ban books,” she said during the speech, which wrapped in a range of issues such as collective bargaining, abortion, gun violence and same-sex marriage under the broader theme of “fundamental freedoms.”Hundreds of teachers and other attendees lined up at the American Federation of Teachers national educators union convention in Houston’s cavernous downtown convention center to hear Harris speak.Some wore Biden-Harris shirts and said they were excited to hear her speak about education, particularly public schools and teacher recruitment. “It’s a special opportunity, being part of the democratic process,” said Eric Sutz, 45, an elementary school teacher from Long Island Sutz said he’s an independent but a Harris supporter, and he wore a Biden-Harris T-shirt. He said he was pleased to see so many Democrats endorsing Harris. “It should be whittling down to the best people,” he said, and if Harris becomes the nominee, he considers that “the best outcome.”In describing various freedoms she says are at risk in the coming election, Harris has often listed key issues that Democrats hope will drive voter turnout, including gun control and abortion.“The freedom not just to get by, but get ahead,” Harris says in her campaign launch video. “The freedom to be safe from gun violence. The freedom to make decisions about your own body.”At one point in the ad, when Harris says that “no one is above the law,” an image of Trump’s mug shot flashes on the screen. But during her speech in Houston, she did not mention Trump’s felony convictions, a departure from recent events in which she has contrasted her record as a prosecutor with the former president’s long list of indictments.Harris is continuing to ramp up her travel schedule. She plans to hold a campaign event in Atlanta on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the trip who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview an event that has not been publicly announced. The visit will be Harris’s first campaign stop in the battleground state of Georgia as a 2024 presidential candidate.Although Georgia was once more reliably Republican, the state helped deliver the presidency to Biden in 2020. That year, Georgia voters also elected two Democrats to the Senate.Michael Scherer, Hannah Knowles, Maegan Vasquez and Maeve Reston contributed to this report."
WaPo_8,Pentagon to review Medals of Honor awarded for Wounded Knee massacre,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/25/dod-review-awards-wounded-knee/,2024-07-26 09:44:02.619717,,"Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has directed the Pentagon to review 20 Medals of Honor awarded for actions during the 1890 Wounded Knee massacre, in which the U.S. Army’s 7th Cavalry opened fire on hundreds of Native Americans, including women and children.The effort is meant to ensure no troops were recognized for “conduct inconsistent with the nation’s highest military honor,” the Defense Department said in a Wednesday news release. Disqualifying actions include attacking civilians or combatants who already surrendered, murder, rape, and “engaging in any other act demonstrating immorality,” Austin wrote in a July 19 memo directing the review.The news, first reported by Military.com, follows requests from South Dakota state lawmakers and members of Congress, and over two decades of pressure from Native American groups.“The fact that the title of the event is ‘massacre’ would not seem to be the kind of thing you award medals for,” said South Dakota state Sen. Lee Schoenbeck (R), who helped oversee a state resolution earlier this year calling for an official inquiry into the awards. “It’s time to get it right.”On Dec. 29, 1890, U.S. Army soldiers killed an estimated 350 Lakota people in the southwest corner of South Dakota in what is now part of the Pine Ridge Reservation. Historians believe the event was preceded by a single shot stemming from a disagreement between the soldiers and Native American warriors they were attempting to disarm.“I have never heard of a more brutal, cold-blooded massacre than that at Wounded Knee,” Maj. Gen. Nelson A. Miles, who was an Army commander during the American Indian Wars, wrote in a November 1891 letter. Miles wrote that women, small children and babies were among the dead.The citations for some troops who were awarded the Medal of Honor, the military’s highest honor, after the massacre are simply for “bravery” or for continuing to fight while wounded, according to the Defense Department memo.Criteria for awarding Medals of Honor during the Indian Wars was subject to much less scrutiny compared to today, when the process can take years. More than 425 Medals of Honor were awarded for action during that campaign, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs.During the Civil War, the lack of stringent award oversight contributed to veterans receiving the highest number of Medals of Honor ever — over 1,500 — compared to veterans of later conflicts, according to VA. In some cases, recipients were awarded a medal for recapturing unit flags.Today, the Medal of Honor is awarded based on criteria drafted in 1963, and is reserved only for troops who are distinguished by the highest level of bravery and who risk their lives while fighting against an enemy of the United States.A report on the review of awards from the Wounded Knee massacre, as well as decisions on whether they should be rescinded, is expected within three months, according to Austin’s memo.Members of Congress in 2019 introduced legislation to rescind the awards, known as the “Remove the Stain Act.”“The horrific massacre of hundreds of Lakota men, women, and children at Wounded Knee should be condemned, not celebrated with Medals of Honor,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who in 2021 was among the senators to reintroduce the act, said in an email to The Post Thursday.She called the review “an important step toward righting this profound wrong and removing this stain on our nation’s history.”Oliver Semans, a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe who has previously advocated to strip the awards, said he is pleased about the Pentagon’s review. But he said he was skeptical about whether the review could be undertaken thoroughly on the timeline laid out in the memo.“I don’t want it just to happen to get it off the table and move on,” Semans said. “We’re talking about the descendants who lost their relatives there and they should really be given true justice.”Alex Horton and Kayla Epstein contributed to this report."
WaPo_9,George Washington said his lack of ‘immediate offspring’ was good for U.S.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2024/07/25/george-washington-no-children-jd-vance/,2024-07-26 09:37:02.619717,,"In an undelivered draft of his first inaugural address, George Washington wrote that his lack of biological children would benefit the country.“Divine Providence hath not seen fit, that my blood should be transmitted or my name perpetuated by the endearing, though sometimes seducing channel of immediate offspring,” the first U.S. president had considered including in the April 30, 1789, speech. “I have no child for whom I could wish to make a provision — no family to build in greatness upon my Country’s ruins.”In other words: There would be no American royal dynasty, as The Washington Post reported more than 225 years later.The subject of politicians without biological children made a wave of fresh headlines this week after a 2021 video resurfaced in which Sen. JD Vance (Ohio), the Republican vice-presidential nominee, described Vice President Harris and other Democrats as “childless cat ladies” in an interview with Tucker Carlson.“The entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,” Vance said in the footage, which has racked up more than 28 million views on X. “And how does it make any sense that we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?”Vance said in a 2021 speech that the Democratic Party had become “controlled by people who don’t have children” but added that his remarks were not directed at people who are unable to have children, including for medical reasons. Asked for comment Wednesday on the “childless cat ladies” remark, a spokesman for Vance responded with statements from the senator’s aunt and sister.“JD was raised by some of the strongest women I know and went on to marry an incredibly strong woman in Usha,” his wife, said Lindsay Lewis, Vance’s sister. “JD is a testament to the women in his life, and the attacks from the media and Democrats that assume anything otherwise is vile.”While Harris would be a pioneer in many respects if she is elected in November — namely, becoming the first female president — she would not be the first president without biological offspring. In addition to Washington, four other commanders in chief have not had biological children. Several had nonnuclear families, like Harris’s.Barbara Perry, a professor of presidential studies at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center, said American politicians have long campaigned alongside their families to try to appeal to would-be constituents. In the 1950s, sitcoms such as “Leave It to Beaver” and “Father Knows Best” helped cement the idea of a traditional family.“This norm of a big, American, happy family really took off,” Perry said. “And then again, why wouldn’t politicians speak to that and say, ‘Look, I’m like you'?”But for Washington, having no biological children served a specific purpose.When he stepped into the role in 1789, about six years after the Revolutionary War ended, there was widespread concern that the presidency would become hereditary, like the British monarchy, said Lindsay Chervinsky, executive director of the George Washington Presidential Library. Some also feared that John Adams, Washington’s successor, wanted to put his son, diplomat John Quincy Adams, in line after him, she added. Term limits had yet to be established, further heightening fears about the presidency.In his personal writings, Washington expressed regret about not having biological children. Publicly, Chervinsky said, he pointed to that fact to highlight that he could not pass down the presidency.“He was almost using it as a way to reassure the American people and demonstrate that he was a safe person to trust with that type of authority,” she said.Like Harris, whose stepchildren Ella and Cole refer to her as “Momala,” Washington was a stepparent to two children, Patsy and Jacky, from his marriage to Martha Custis. Washington had an active role in their lives, as well as those of his grandchildren, Chervinsky said. In one well-known portrait of the family, he and his wife are shown alongside two of their grandchildren at their Mount Vernon estate.Former presidents James Madison‚ James Buchanan, James K. Polk and Andrew Jackson also did not have biological offspring.Madison, who was referred to as the “father of the Constitution,” had a stepson from the first marriage of his wife, Dolley. Buchanan during his presidency served as a guardian to his niece, Harriet Lane Johnston, who took on the duties that a first lady would typically have because Buchanan was unmarried. Jackson and his wife, Rachel, adopted one of her nephews when he was an infant and were guardians of several other children in their family.In Washington’s case, scholars have posited that his lack of biological children lent itself to his idolization. In the 2010 biography “Washington: A Life,” Ron Chernow wrote that the president having no children “made it seem that he had been divinely preserved in an immaculate state to become the Father of his Country.”"
WaPo_10,"Yvonne Furneaux, globetrotting actress of ‘La Dolce Vita,’ dies at 98",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/07/25/yvonne-furneaux-actress-dies/,2024-07-26 09:12:02.619717,,"Yvonne Furneaux, a raven-haired actress raised on both sides of the English Channel who found acclaim playing women navigating the sexual freedoms of the 1960s in films including “La Dolce Vita” and the psychological drama “Repulsion,” died July 5 at her home in North Hampton, N.H. She was 98.The cause was a stroke, said her son, Nicholas Natteau.Born in France to British parents and multilingual, Ms. Furneaux fit well into the spirit of an age when cultural and social boundaries in Europe were being toppled by a postwar generation impatient for change. She worked with French, German, Spanish, American and British directors — as well as Italian filmmakers in her breakout roles — in more than 30 films from dark comedies to horror.She was best known, however, for characters who embraced the free-spirit modernity of the jet set, or as playing the “other woman” in turbulent and ill-fated relationships.The British press in the 1960s sometimes referred to her as a “tigress” of cinema, commenting on her sexually confident roles, her striking green eyes and an accent that could be flavored with hints of French and Italian.She laughed off the descriptions. She reminded interviewers of her early films playing damsels in distress in swashbuckling films starring Errol Flynn in the 1950s and as a 4,000-year-old princess in 1959’s “The Mummy” by Britain’s horror-flick factory, Hammer Films.Yet she also liked to cultivate an image as a screen siren and a real-life devotee of a flirty and fun-seeking ethos. Shortly after the premiere of Federico Fellini’s “La Dolce Vita” in 1960, Ms. Furneaux met with a correspondent for Britain's Evening Standard for cocktails near Rome’s Spanish Steps. She claimed to enjoy the attentions of Italy’s sweet-tongued lotharios.“They will tell the most dreadful lies,” she said. “No girl is safe here. Oh, it’s just marvelous.”In Fellini’s film, Ms. Furneaux played Emma, the anguished live-in girlfriend of a philandering journalist, Marcello Rubini (Marcello Mastroianni). Their toxic life together was part of Fellini’s commentary on decadence, consumerism and a man adrift amid temptations and self-doubt. (The other women in Marcello’s life in the film include a wealthy lover played by the French actress Anouk Aimée and an innocent soul portrayed by Anita Ekberg.)In one scene, Marcello returns home after spending the night with a prostitute to find Emma had attempted suicide by overdose. As their relationship reached a breaking point, Emma and Marcello quarrel in a car parked in the bleak outskirts of Rome. “What have I done to be treated this way?” she tells Marcello after declaring her love for him. “Not even a dog gets treated like this.” Marcello accuses her of smothering him with “sticky, maternal love.”Emma bites his hand when he tries to toss her out of the car. He slaps her. As dawn breaks, she is shown holding wildflowers, alone by the roadside. Marcello, contrite for the moment, returns and she rides back home with him.Fellini praised Ms. Furneaux’s performance as deeply authentic, saying that Ekberg and others received more attention from reviewers because their characters were more “mysterious, were thus more intriguing.”In her next major film, Ms. Furneaux was cast by director Roman Polanski in his exploration of London’s Swinging Sixties in “Repulsion” (1965).Ms. Furneaux’s character, Helen, finds liberation in the club scene and casual sex with her married boyfriend, while her sister Carol (Catherine Deneuve) slips deeper into a nightmarish cocoon of self-loathing and rejection of pleasure.After the movie’s release, New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther lauded Ms. Furneaux for a convincing performance as the “subtly contentious older sister” who allowed the brewing “maelstrom of violence and horror.”According to the 2007 book “Polanski: A Biography” by celebrity chronicler Christopher Sandford, Ms. Furneaux and Polanski had their own tense moments. The director reportedly tried to provoke anger and unease among the actors, seeking to have them carry those emotions onto the set. Ms. Furneaux pleaded with executive producer Michael Klinger to have Polanski ease off, Sandford wrote.“Why are you giving the girl such a hard time?” Klinger asked the filmmaker. “Michael, I know she’s a nice girl,” Polanski replied, according to the book’s account. “She’s too bloody nice. She is supposed to be playing a b----. Every day I have to make her into a b----.”Ms. Furneaux was born May 11, 1926, in Roubaix, France, and named Elisabeth Yvonne Scatcherd. Her father was a director at a Lloyds Bank branch, and her mother, whose family name was Furneaux, tended to the home.The family moved to Britain when Elisabeth was 11 and she later studied modern languages at St Hilda’s College at the University of Oxford, learning Italian and perfecting her French. She was then accepted at London’s Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, graduating in 1951.She found her first professional roles on the London stage in productions that included Shakespeare’s “Macbeth” and “The Taming of the Shrew.” In the January 1953 issue of Vogue magazine’s British edition, she was part of a photo spread (with her newly adopted name Yvonne Furneaux) on the theater world’s promising young talent.Film roles soon came. She played a jilted lover in Peter Brook’s musical “The Beggar’s Opera” (1953), starring Laurence Olivier; and made three adventure films starring Flynn, the last being “The Dark Avenger” (1955).That year she made her Italian cinema debut in Michelangelo Antonioni’s “Le Amiche,” or “The Girlfriends,” starring with four other women (Eleonora Rossi Drago, Madeleine Fischer, Valentina Cortese and Anna Maria Pancani) dealing with the ups and downs of life in Turin.Ms. Furneaux’s character, Momina, worldly and jaded, is recently separated from her husband, has a new lover and finds the best way to deal with problems is to talk them out over drinks. When the series “Sex and the City” first aired in 1998, many reviewers looked back on Momina as something of a mid-1950s prototype for Kim Cattrall’s character Samantha.After Ms. Furneaux co-starred in Ray Milland’s crime drama “Lisbon” (1956), a Hollywood production shot in Portugal, she returned to the theater for a Shakespeare tour in India. On her return in 1958, she stopped in Rome for a short holiday. A call came from the office of American producer and talk show host David Susskind, who wanted to cast her in a CBS television production of Emily Brontë's novel “Wuthering Heights.”“I screamed,” she told the Daily News. “I was so excited! America at last … I caught the next plane out, without even seeing the Colosseum.”During the 1960s, she appeared in films including “The Story of the Count of Monte Cristo” (1961) — where she met her future husband, cinematographer Jacques Natteau — and the 1967 thriller “The Champagne Murders,” co-starring with Anthony Perkins. She mostly retired from acting in the early 1970s but made a brief comeback in the oddball comedy “Frankenstein’s Great Aunt Tillie” (1984).Ms. Furneaux and Natteau were married in 1962. Natteau died in 2007. Survivors include her son.Her reputation as a self-assured achiever was far from reality, she said. She described herself as full of insecurities during her years on the stage and screen.“I’m so nervous,” she once told the Manchester Evening News. “I always think this part is going to be my last.”"

The system had to be turned off, causing increased temperatures and humidity as temperatures climbed into the mid-80s.The D.C. Department of Health worked with the hospital to divert ambulances to other hospitals in the region, which sometimes happens.“To protect the wellbeing of patients and staff, DC Health is working with MedStar and relevant emergency responders to ensure that patients can access treatment and track progress as the hospital re-establishes standard environmental conditions,” agency spokesman Dorian Walker said in a statement.The minor leak affected two rooms in the emergency department but was quickly resolved, Pak said.The air conditioning issue was discovered on Tuesday, and the hospital’s facilities team had hoped to repair a pipe without turning off the air conditioning. But on Thursday morning the leak got larger, requiring the system to be shut off during repairs, Pak said.Although the system was working by about 10 a.m., the hospital and the D.C. health department decided to divert emergency medical services traffic to other hospitals. Elective procedures were put on hold, Pak said.The diversions ended by 8 p.m. Thursday, Pak said.The hospital was also using spot coolers. Other repairs are ongoing, Pak said.The 912-bed hospital is a trauma center and a major teaching and research facility in the District.Meagan Flynn contributed to this report."
WaPo_12,Judge in Washington state dismisses safety violation allegations at Amazon,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/25/amazon-workers-safety-washington-dismiss/,2024-07-26 10:48:02.688339,,"A Washington state judge decided in favor of Amazon in a major workplace safety case, a significant win for the e-commerce giant, which has grappled with allegations that it sets a grueling pace for warehouse workers, exposing them to injury and illness.The judge threw out four serious safety violations Amazon had been charged with by state workplace safety officials in recent years, according to court documents shared with The Washington Post by Amazon.“Amazon presented persuasive evidence it has a robust safety and health program. It fully communicates safety and health policies to its employees,” said Judge Stephen Pfeifer in the decision issued Wednesday.“We appreciate that the court took a close look at the facts about how we prioritize employees’ health and safety, recognized the progress we’ve made, and vacated all the citations at the heart of this case,” Amazon spokesperson Maureen Lynch Vogel said in an email statement.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.The court’s decision was filed with Washington’s Department of Labor and Industries on Wednesday. Officials are working to redact the document, and plan to officially release it Monday, state officials said.“We disagree both with the judge’s characterization of the facts and interpretation of the law, and are already preparing our appeal,” said Matt Ross, a spokesman for the Washington state labor department.  The Amazon case in Washington began last summer, stemming from allegations by state labor regulators that the company had created an unsafe working environment. The state alleged that Amazon put warehouse staff at unnecessary risk of ergonomic injury and musculoskeletal disorders, and willfully continued to do so after state intervention. Amazon appealed those citations, which have now been dismissed.In the case, the state had argued that Amazon’s warehouses failed to comply with the rules of ergonomic science, and that the layout of the facilities would have to be altered to protect workers. Amazon said its process is unique, and that workplace standards for typical warehouses don’t apply. In his decision, Pfeifer said the state’s argument failed to convince him that “there were economic and technically feasible means to eliminate or materially reduce the alleged hazards beyond which Amazon had already implemented.”Former Occupational Safety and Health Administration director Debbie Berkowitz said that Washington labor officials can appeal the decision.“The state clearly showed that Amazon’s warehouse workers have suffered very high numbers of musculoskeletal injuries and that Amazon had not implemented the ergonomic changes needed to prevent these injuries,” she said in an email statement. “Sadly, Amazon still fails to take responsibility for designing the jobs that caused these injuries.”The federal OSHA has also been investigating reports of alleged ergonomic injuries at Amazon, and could pursue a company-wide settlement strategy, though fines so far have been limited, former OSHA officials previously told The Post.This month, preliminary results from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)’s senate committee investigation into Amazon worker injuries were released, including findings that during peak periods in 2019 as many as 45 percent of Amazon workers suffered injuries. Amazon disputed those findings saying there was “flawed methodology and gaps in the research.” The U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York announced an investigation into Amazon’s workplace injury rate and recordkeeping in 2022, but no findings have been released and the agency has declined requests for comment on its status.Lawmakers and labor regulators, including OSHA and the National Labor Relations Board, are increasingly under pressure to take action on Amazon workplace issues before the presidential election.Earlier this year, the state of California fined Amazon $5.9 million for violating a new law limiting workplace productivity quotas, or rules that require employees to complete work at a certain rate of speed. Similar quotas exist in New York, Oregon and Minnesota, and Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) has introduced federal legislation."
WaPo_13,Asking Eric: Grandma critiqued for how she folds her son-in-law’s clothes,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/07/26/asking-eric-grandma-babysitting-laundry/,2024-07-26 11:59:02.788762,,"Dear Eric: I am a youngish widow with an empty nest. Last year I moved to be near my daughter to help her with her young twins. My daughter and her husband have jobs that require them to leave home at about 6 a.m. I arrive at their home at six, and they leave. The kids are still sleeping.While I wait for them to wake up, I do a few chores. These are not deep cleaning, just things I would have loved to come home to as a working mom with young kids. I unload the dishwasher, clean up the kitchen, gather up any laundry, run a load of wash and fold whatever clean clothes are in the dryer.By this time the kids are waking up. They are three years old and not fully potty trained. So, I am busy changing, feeding, dressing them and then taking them to day care.Sometimes the laundry doesn’t get folded “right.” By that I mean I put all the kids’ clothes in one stack, my son-in-law’s in a stack, my daughter’s in a stack and towels in another. Frequently the clothes come out of the dryer inside out. I am quickly folding, feeding, and cleaning.My daughter has indicated my son-in-law is not happy with the way I fold the clothes and sometimes I just fold the T-shirts and don’t turn them right side out. I am tempted to just leave his clothes in the dryer, but that seems petty. I don’t want to interfere in her marriage, but I would appreciate an outside opinion.— Clothes'd OffClothes’d: Once a friend of the family came to babysit me and my brothers while my parents were away. She did a load of laundry and folded the towels in halves. We, as a family, fold the towels in thirds. My brothers and I found this outrageous. Well, let me be honest, I found it outrageous. I doubt my younger brothers cared. But when my parents came home, they were just grateful to have had the help.Your daughter should stop reporting to you about what your son-in-law likes or doesn't like in regards to the laundry. Getting this help is a privilege. And, at the end of the day, the clothes are going to get unfolded and put on bodies. (Well, actually the clothes are getting put on bodies at the beginning of the day.)We all like the aspects of our home lives to be as we'd like them to be, but your son-in-law is making a mountain out of a pile of T-shirts.Ask your daughter, “Would you rather I leave the laundry alone?” Maybe the answer is yes, which feels like a foolish choice on their part. However, if that is what they want, you may want to follow up by asking who will be doing the laundry if not you. The task shouldn't automatically fall to your daughter, especially if it's your son-in-law who is chock full of opinions.Dear Eric: My 50th high school reunion is later this year and I’m not sure if I should go. I was a smart kid who moved to an ex-urban town immediately before high school began. I was a science geek, creative, on the autism spectrum but undiagnosed, and a hardcore introvert who didn’t have traditional interests like other girls.I was bullied by popular girls and jocks because I was a hippie who never conformed to the school's culture. Needless to say, I moved to the city as soon as I could and never kept in touch with anyone.Rather than immediately dismiss the idea of attending the 50th reunion, I’m somewhat curious about these people. There’s also a big part of me that fears they’ll still look down on me even though I did quite well professionally, creatively, and personally. An even bigger fear is that I still don’t have the social skills to navigate among people who are completely different from me and I’ll come off like an arrogant weirdo. Should I go or send my regrets?— A Class AboveClass: First, let me say that every class reunion I’ve been to has been delightfully awkward. Standing around eating chicken skewers while updating someone you had biology class with on the events of the last 50 years doesn’t come naturally. So, embrace the awkward and go. If you don’t feel comfortable, you can leave and return to your successful life, but you’ll always be a little curious if you don’t.Remember: this isn’t an accounting of your life’s progress. And it doesn’t have to mean comeuppance for your bullies (unless you want it to!) A reunion is a one-night coda on a particular, sometimes difficult, period in the past. Good for a momentary visit, but don’t stay too long.(Send questions to R. Eric Thomas at eric@askingeric.com or P.O. Box 22474, Philadelphia, PA 19110.

WaPo_14,Carolyn Hax: Did she wear a see-through dress to the wedding out of spite?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/07/26/carolyn-hax-see-through-dress-wedding/,2024-07-26 11:59:02.788762,,"Dear Carolyn: We got married overseas and did the “legal bit” in a courthouse. Since the courthouse was small, we invited only close family and the wedding party, no significant others — who joined us for lunch after.Friends and family were fine with this. However, my now-brother-in-law’s girlfriend interpreted this as a personal slight. BIL sent my husband a barrage of texts arguing for her to attend. I met with her to explain the seating (my aunt’s husband wasn’t going!) and said it wasn’t meant as a slight. She made clear she would not forgive me.The courthouse ceremony went well, so imagine my surprise when she wore a transparent mesh dress with a black thong and no bra to our religious wedding. She has no history of wearing revealing clothes. I’m an only child, and this was an important day for my parents, so I am angry that she thought this was the way to voice her frustrations.The wedding was amazing and we had the best time, but what do we do going forward? My husband and I have always been friendly with her. We’ve privately not had a high view, since she screams at waiters, is rude to my brother-in-law’s friends (I think he’s been isolated from them), etc., but never voiced these concerns. I don’t even know how to behave around her now.It doesn’t help that my husband’s family insist this must have been an accident and we are being paranoid. They want my husband to reach out to his brother to “hear his side.”We think his brother will propose soon, which is obviously his choice, but means even more time with her. I want to let this go, but on top of feeling disrespected by the girlfriend, I now feel betrayed by the family. How do I move forward?— AngryAngry: You can “move forward” in one thought if you can agree with one thing:The girlfriend’s big mistake wasn’t to flip you the bird in a peekaboo dress. (Though, wow. Talk about showing people who you are.) It was taking her courthouse exclusion as a personal insult when it wasn’t about her personally.Agree? Then apply it to your outrage right now:You’ve taken her dress as a personal insult. But if you reread your letter, I think (hope) you’ll see the girlfriend is an angry, insecure, unstable, chaotic emergency of a person — which is no more a personal statement about you than your courthouse rule was about her.How people respond to situations is always about them, fundamentally. But for someone in a plainly dysfunctional place — which I’ll define as “visible even to untrained eyes, through behaviors like screaming at staff, isolating from friends and baring spite-nipples” — it’s important to put up extra mental sticky notes that she’s subject to acting out, so one must disengage accordingly.Meaning: She didn’t “disrespect” you with her clothing, she called attention to herself. (You all had a choice whether to grant it.) Your husband’s family hasn’t “betrayed” you; they’re merely as distracted as you are by her show, into believing it deserves a response at all.She warrants attention in one sense: for the entirety of the emotional hot mesh. That problem is only worsening for your brother-in-law and his family.You asked about her wedding antics, so I addressed them, but the real headline is the evidence she’s abusive that you’ve witnessed but not discussed.So. Cancel the dress scandal. Politely disengage from the girlfriend. Nurture the brother-in-law bond; he needs allies she can’t scare away. And read up fast at thehotline.org."

We’re neither young nor rolling in cash, so we have a very tight budget and need to keep the guest count on the low side.I would like to include two or three of my co-workers with whom I’m close, but I’m concerned about other co-workers feeling slighted. How does one manage this kind of situation?A wedding is not (or should not be) a networking event. Therefore, etiquette actively discourages inviting co-workers who are not legitimately friends outside of work.If those who were not invited are bold enough to ask, you may simply tell them it was a small wedding. But Miss Manners suspects that at least one of them will be relieved at not having to spend Saturday evening pretending to be closer with work acquaintances than is the case.Dear Miss Manners: My wife and I were dining at a midpriced restaurant. I ordered the special, which ended up sounding much better than it tasted. It wasn’t spoiled and I didn’t send it back, but it was very bland and the consistency was not great.We were seated close to another couple, and couldn't help but overhear some of their conversation. The lady mentioned that she thought the special sounded really good and was planning to order it.I thought about telling her that it wasn’t very good. I decided not to say anything, but I’m wondering: Would it have been rude to share my observations?Yes, since more than likely, you do not share this lady’s taste buds.Dear Miss Manners: My hair is a natural shade of auburn. How do you respond to a stranger asking if your hair color is real?“Last time I checked.”Dear Miss Manners: I am a happily married woman in my 30s with three children and a successful career. My husband and I have decided that our family is complete.My widowed mother was fortunate to meet a nice man some years ago. They share their lives and make each other happy. This man often suggests to me that I should have more children. He also says such things to other women in our family regardless of age, marital status or stage of life. He says that he “wants a baby to hold.”I’m sure he doesn’t mean to offend, yet we find this quite inappropriate. It makes us uncomfortable to be told that we should be making babies. I’m looking for a polite way to suggest to this man that family planning decisions are not things about which women appreciate unsolicited opinions.Talk to your mother about it: “It is so sweet that Earl loves babies and wants to share in grandparenting with you. But the women in the family are a bit uncomfortable with his constant asking. Perhaps you two can find another outlet for baby-holding. Or,” Miss Manners might add, “adopt a pet.”New Miss Manners columns are posted Monday through Saturday on washingtonpost.com/advice.

WaPo_16,Is this the beginning of the end for the Maduro regime in Venezuela?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/26/maduro-venezuela-election-landslide/,2024-07-26 11:59:02.788762,,"You’re reading an excerpt from the WorldView newsletter. Sign up to get the rest free, including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know, sent to your inbox on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.Is the moment finally here? For the span of a generation, Venezuela’s opposition has toiled fitfully and, at times, ineffectually to claw back power from an increasingly autocratic regime entrenched in Caracas. They mobilized mass demonstrations and endured brutal crackdowns. They saw myriad false dawns, intense factional infighting and constant intimidation and attacks by forces loyal to President Nicolás Maduro, who has ruled since the death of the charismatic socialist demagogue Hugo Chávez in 2013.Now, after a decade of economic calamity and political repression, Venezuela stands on the brink of once-unfathomable change. A presidential election Sunday could see Maduro not just lose, but lose by a landslide. Opinion polls have him trailing the opposition challenger, Edmundo González — a soft-spoken, 74-year-old former diplomat who became the candidate after authorities disqualified popular opposition leader María Corina Machado — by double digits. It’s far from clear whether Maduro will stomach defeat and allow such an outcome, but his opponents are hopeful.“We are confident that our margin of victory will be so overwhelming that it will open a new political reality in the country and that will open spaces for negotiation,” González told my colleagues earlier this month.“If the margin is as wide as we expect it to be, it’ll be something that’s impossible to hide, and the legitimacy of the regime will have vanished,” Roberto Patiño, a prominent social activist and community organizer, told me this week. Maduro, sensing the narrowing of his political horizons, recently scare-mongered about an opposition victory, saying it would lead to “a fratricidal civil war provoked by fascists” and warned of a “bloodbath.”Maduro sits atop the hollowed-out ruin of the socialist state Chávez built. The latter’s populist pitch and redistributive zeal won him a huge base of support in the country, which at the turn of the 20th century was one of the richest in Latin America but also one of the most unequal. But years of kleptocracy and mismanagement wrecked the critical Venezuelan oil industry and ravaged the country’s economy. U.S. sanctions and the toll of the pandemic haven’t helped either. As a result, close to 8 million Venezuelans — roughly a quarter of the population — have been forced to flee the country as economic migrants, an exodus that’s trailed its way across the hemisphere, and up to the United States’ southern border. For many who remain, including vast segments of the working class that once supported Chávez, a vote against the regime offers a glimmer of hope.The impoverishment of the country has been accompanied by mounting autocracy. “Politically, the regime is no longer properly populist. But neither is it leftist, like Chile or Brazil. Venezuela is a political-military dictatorship akin to Russia and Iran — and above all Cuba, its ideological ally,” wrote Enrique Krauze in The Washington Post’s opinion pages. “The specific instrument of power has been co-optation and repression — of political parties, candidates, business executives, academics, students and journalists. Separation of powers, freedom of expression, guarantees of individual rights and confidence in the electoral system — all these things have long since disappeared in Venezuela.”Analysts expect a change in leadership can start a new chapter for the country and inch it toward fiscal stability and better economic prospects. But even if the Maduro regime allows the election to take place and the opposition to win, few expect a straightforward transition. “It’s necessary to recognize that changing an authoritarian system does not happen overnight,” Patiño told me.Even if Maduro loses, his allies will still dominate the country’s judiciary, its rubber-stamp legislature, and the armed forces. Most of the country’s major provincial governors and city mayors are in Maduro’s camp. The opposition anticipates some process of negotiation with Maduro that can give him a gentle off-ramp. Patiño pointed to historical precedents for such processes in how Chile moved away from dictator Augusto Pinochet or Venezuela’s own toppling of its military dictatorship in 1958.But that’s all still hypothetical. The opposition has had to wage an election campaign with all the cards stacked against it. Machado won an opposition primary last year that saw huge turnout and galvanized momentum for change. The vote was allowed to take place after negotiations between Maduro’s regime and the Biden administration, which relaxed some oil sanctions as an incentive; those were reinstated in April, however, after Venezuela’s Supreme Court controversially disqualified Machado from holding public office.Nonetheless, Machado has remained the face of the opposition, and barnstormed her way through the country despite a huge slate of restrictions on the opposition’s ability to hold events and widespread arrests of her colleagues. The campaign operates on word-of-mouth, social media and sheer public enthusiasm. “When I go to an event, I don’t know if I’ll have a stage, I don’t know if I’ll have sound, I don’t know if I’ll have transportation,” Machado told my colleagues Ana Vanessa Herrero and Samantha Schmidt. “We are breaking all the myths of a political campaign.”The moment marks a departure from an earlier period when the opposition would eschew participation in elections held by the Maduro regime on grounds that they were illegitimate. “We realized that boycotting elections and hoping the international community will do the job is no longer going to work,” Patiño told me. “All change has to come from within. The starting point is the Venezuelan people.”Still, he acknowledges that international pressure and engagement is vital in a scenario where Maduro has to face defeat. Positive signals came earlier this week from Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a leftist with a close relationship to the late Chavez. He warned against Maduro’s “bloodbath” rhetoric.“I have told Maduro that the only chance for Venezuela to return to normality is to have a widely respected electoral process,” he told reporters Monday. “He has to respect the democratic process.”The Biden administration, too, may yet be able to claim a major foreign policy win should the election pave the way for Maduro’s exit.“A year ago the naysayers would have said none of this is going to happen, the opposition will never unite, the regime will never allow an election,” a senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the administration, told my colleagues. “The fact that we’ve come this far I think is a significant statement that the effort was worth it.”"
WaPo_17,Canada Olympic soccer coach sent home over drone use as scandal widens,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/26/canada-removes-olympic-soccer-coach-drone/,2024-07-26 13:11:02.693007,,"A growing scandal at the Paris Olympics over Canada Soccer’s use of drones to make unauthorized recordings of opponents’ practices took a major turn Thursday when the country’s Olympic committee removed women’s national team coach Bev Priestman.Having arrived in France with the goal of winning a second straight gold medal as Canada’s coach, Priestman instead was suspended and could face further discipline. In a news release, the Canadian Olympic Committee said she would be replaced by assistant coach Andy Spence.“Over the past 24 hours, additional information has come to our attention regarding previous drone use against opponents, predating the Paris 2024 Olympic Games,” Canada Soccer CEO Kevin Blue said in a statement. “In light of these new revelations, Canada Soccer has made the decision to suspend Women’s National Soccer Team Head Coach, Bev Priestman for the remainder of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, and until the completion of our recently announced independent external review.”The news release was issued shortly after the publication of a TSN story alleging that staffers and contractors for both the Canadian women’s and men’s national teams attempted to film training sessions of upcoming opponents for several years.Earlier this week, Priestman sidelined herself for the women’s Olympic opener Thursday and two members of her staff were sent home after Canadian officials learned that drones were flown over two recent practices staged by New Zealand, Canada’s upcoming opponent. At the time, Canadian Olympic Committee CEO David Shoemaker said Priestman told officials “unequivocally” that she did not know recordings had been taken of the Football Ferns’ training sessions in Saint-Étienne, France, where Canada won Thursday’s game, 2-1.The story raised questions about whether Canada’s national soccer programs have long encouraged such subterfuge. TSN cited two people who had “first-hand knowledge” of the methods allegedly used by the teams, both of whom were said to have spoken on the condition of anonymity out of concerns over possible retaliation. One person alleged that efforts among members of Priestman’s program to film opponents’ practices, sometimes by stationing a staffer behind a fence or a tree outside a training facility, goes back at least as far as the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, where her team won its first gold medal.Canada's men's and women's soccer teams have relied on drones and spying for years, sources sayCoaching staff and contractors working with Canada’s men’s and women’s national soccer teams have been engaged for years in efforts to film the closed-door training sessions of their… pic.twitter.com/GuwijxTMNmTSN also cited a person close to the situation who claimed that Canada’s men’s squad used a drone to record a U.S. team practice ahead of a 2019 match in Orlando. That team was coached by John Herdman from 2018 until August 2023, when he departed to become coach of MLS’s Toronto FC. Herdman was eventually replaced this spring on a permanent basis by Jesse Marsch, who earned praise for guiding the team to the semifinals of the recently concluded Copa America.Before leading the men’s team, Herdman coached the Canadian women from 2011 to 2018, during which Priestman spent some time as an assistant and in other roles. She also overlapped with Herdman in the New Zealand national soccer program when he coached that country’s women’s’ team from 2006 to 2011. Both Priestman, 38, and the 49-year-old Herdman hail from a small town in the Northern England town of Consett, where they first met when she was a youth soccer player.A spokesperson for Toronto FC did not immediately respond to a request Thursday evening for comment on Herdman. A spokesman for U.S. Soccer said that organization had no comment on the reports regarding Priestman and Canada Soccer’s use of drones.“Most people see this as cheating, which it is,” one of the people familiar with the situation told TSN. “Some of our coaches just see it as a competitive advantage and justify it by saying everyone does it, which is also not true. Not everyone cheats, and neither should we.”The two staffers sent home this week by the Canadian Olympic Committee were Jasmine Mander, an assistant coach, and Joseph Lombardi, 43, who was described by the organization as “an unaccredited analyst” who reported to Mander.According to a biography on Canada Soccer’s website, the 43-year-old Lombardi appears to have held a variety of more formal roles within the organization, including as a team staffer at last year’s Women’s World Cup and at six FIFA youth tournaments dating back to 2012. As noted Thursday by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., Lombardi also was listed as a member of Priestman’s staff in a COC news release earlier this month detailing the women’s Olympic team.It turns out Canada Soccer’s “unaccredited analyst” at the centre of the Olympic drone fiasco is the director of a national youth program with the organization, and previously served under John Herdman, then the men’s team’s head coach https://t.co/1FBB98F79TLombardi, who served as analyst under Herdman from 2018 to 2019, matches the description of a Canadian national who was arrested by police in Saint-Étienne on Monday after flying a drone over the stadium in which the New Zealand women’s team was practicing. Authorities there said in a statement that the person had recorded footage of the training session that day and of a Football Ferns practice the preceding Friday. The man was said to have told police that he was an “independent sports analyst” working for Canada Soccer, and that his recordings “enabled him to learn the tactics of the opposing team.”The New Zealand Olympic Committee said Tuesday it was “deeply shocked and disappointed by this incident.” Canada’s committee then followed with an apology in which it echoed that language and said it “stands for fair-play.”FIFA said Wednesday that its disciplinary committee has “opened proceedings” against Priestman, Lombardi, Mander and Canada Soccer.In a statement shared by the COC on Wednesday, after Priestman stepped aside for the New Zealand game but before she was suspended and removed from the Olympic campaign, she said the episode “does not represent the values that our team stands for.”“I am ultimately responsible,” Priestman added, “for conduct in our program.”"

The wildfire, which authorities believe was an act of arson, reached more than 145,000 acres by late Thursday and was only 3 percent contained. It is California’s largest this year.Butte County fire chief Garrett Sjolund told a news conference Thursday that the fire “quickly began to outpace our resources because of the dry fuels, the hot weather, the low humidity, and the wind.” Gusty winds and dry conditions were predicted for the region until at least late Friday, with a National Weather Service Red Flag warning for critical fire weather conditions in effect.The fire started about 3 p.m. Wednesday and “exploded from a 400-acre fire to a more than 71,000-acre inferno consuming everything in its path” overnight into Thursday, Cal Fire said on social media. By late Thursday it was burning across more than 145,000 acres in Butte and Tahoma counties and had produced several fire tornadoes.About 4,400 residents were under evacuation orders, including the communities of Cohasset and Forest Ranch and areas in northeast Chico, authorities said. There had been two minor injuries, and photos showed multiple homes damaged or destroyed.District Attorney Michael L. Ramsey said Chico resident Ronnie Stout, 42, would be arraigned Monday on to-be-determined charges related to arson. Investigators allege a witness saw him pushing a flaming car off an embankment in upper Bidwell Park, starting the blaze.“She saw him get into the vehicle, do something in the vehicle, get out of the vehicle, and then push the flaming vehicle down the embankment,” Ramsey told reporters. “ … We are here today because of that.” He said the vehicle was Stout’s mother’s car.Stout was arrested early Thursday on a no-bail warrant, Ramsey said.Butte County Sheriff Kory L. Honea urged residents and visitors to pay close attention to authorities’ warnings. “This county has seen time and time again where people have waited too long and they have lost their lives,” he said. The area was devastated by the nearly 1 million acre Dixie Fire in 2021 and the 153,000 acre Camp Fire in 2018, which killed 85, the deadliest wildfire in California history."
WaPo_21,How one Chinese machine tool maker is helping Russia’s war against Ukraine,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/26/russia-china-military-drones-ukraine-war/,2024-07-26 17:00:02.644297,,"When NATO this month accused China of being a “decisive enabler” of Russia’s war in Ukraine, the bloc wasn’t referring to Chinese tanks, or ammunition, or troops.The statement instead pointed to Chinese transfers of “dual use” equipment, like sophisticated machine tools, that have been used to make Russian weapons. China’s exports of those machine tools more than doubled last year, according to trade data collated by the United Nations.One of the companies that has benefited from Russia’s hunger for these goods is a midsize laser machine tool company called Shandong Oree Laser Technology Co. — one of dozens of Chinese companies that the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned last month.The Washington Post reviewed company records, videos, advertising materials and other open-source material to sketch a profile of Oree Laser, offering a glimpse into the myriad ways the Russian war effort relies on Chinese industry.Oree Laser is emblematic of the vital and increasing support that Chinese companies are providing to Russia: It makes fiber laser cutters, which have civilian applications but are also used in the production of military drones, a weapon that has defined the war in Ukraine.Beijing confirmed this week that it will not supply weapons to Russia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday after his foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, met his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi.But analysts say that Chinese exports to Russia — not just in sectors like machine tools, but also specialized electronic equipment and other high-end technology components — enable Moscow to expand its military productive capabilities and evade global efforts to end the war in Ukraine, which will enter its 900th day next month.Oree Laser was one of the dozens of Chinese companies that the U.S. Treasury sanctioned last month in an effort to curb “Russia’s ability to benefit from access to foreign technology, equipment, software, and IT services.”The Treasury said Oree Laser has shipped metalworking and other related equipment to Russia, and sanctioned it under the category of “PRC-based suppliers to Russian Military-Industrial Base.”A review of the United Nations’ Comtrade database following NATO’s unprecedented assertion this month showed that China exported more than $245 million worth of laser machine tools to Russia last year and $162 million in 2022, according to the latest available U.N. Comtrade data. Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. In 2021, Chinese exports of laser machine tools to Russia totaled only $90 million, according to the database.China also separately exported $390 million in metalworking machines to Russia in 2023, up from $94 million the year before.Russia “has become completely dependent from supplies of all types of machine tools and their parts from China,” said Pavel Luzin, a visiting scholar at Tufts University and an expert on the Russian armed forces.Luzin estimates that 90 percent of imported machine tools come from China, and even those made in Russia are produced with Chinese components, parts and engines.Beijing has not officially, on a state level, provided military support to Russia in a substantial way, and it has dismissed U.S. and NATO accusations that it is supporting the Russian war machine, calling these politically motivated and groundless.Still, analysts say Beijing, which tightly controls its private sector, has allowed companies to continue doing any business it wants with Russia — a relationship that is working for both Russia and China.“[Russia] knows that its strategic partnership with China will likely be a lasting one, which gives it confidence to focus on its confrontation with NATO,” said Cheng Chen, a professor of political science and an expert on Russia-China ties at the University at Albany, SUNY.Oree Laser’s business dealings with Russia predate Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, with the company posting videos taken before 2022 showing Russian customers posing next to their machines with a thumbs-up sign, saying it had their “trust and praise.”But the business relationship appears to have deepened after the invasion and Russia’s increasing isolation.Oree Laser is privately held and does not release financial statements or trade data, but says on an advertising page that it ships the products it makes — laser machine tools — to 100 countries, including Russia.Oree Laser did not respond to a request for an interview or to emailed questions sent Tuesday about its business in Russia, if it knows the end use of its equipment there, and the recent sanctions. It has not commented publicly on the Treasury designation.The company has leaned heavily into business with Russian clients after the war, including by hiring more Russian speakers and participating in major Moscow-based trade fairs.Oree Laser posted ads last August looking for salespeople who spoke Russian, and it separately advertised for employees to be stationed in the country to join the nine fluent Russian speakers it says it has there for “good customer service.”An Oree employee last July uploaded a video to Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, enthusiastically giving Russian clients a tour of the factory and a demonstration of its machines. “Welcome Russian customers,” the employee wrote in a caption. “We hope that our cooperation will be smooth and that our customers will not regret their visit!”The company has made other accommodations to adapt to the needs of Russian clients. At the trade fair in Moscow last year, an employee promoted a cutting machine that could have its operating system in Russian.Oree Laser participated in the same trade show this year, where it said Russian visitors were “captivated by the live demonstrations showcasing the precision and speed of our machines.”Russia’s own manufacturing sector does not produce machine tools like the precision laser cutters Oree manufactures, and it has long relied on imports to procure these tools and the parts needed to operate them.Before the invasion, it sourced these tools from European, Japanese, South Korean and other manufacturers. But many of those supply lines have been cut off, analysts say, either because of sanctions or concerns about their application for military purposes.The company’s fiber laser tools are an example of machines that have been used by Russia’s defense industry to produce military drones, reactive armor and other military equipment, said Allen Maggard, an analyst at the Washington-based global security nonprofit C4ADS, who reviewed Oree Laser’s company advertisements.Fiber laser cutters are able to cut metal into precise shapes, something that cannot be replicated by the human hand, and are used to create parts such as military drone frames.“Oree Laser’s overall profile aligns with other Chinese manufacturers of laser machine tools used by the Russian defense industry,” said Maggard. Laser cutters, he added, have been used by Aeroscan, a Russian manufacturer of military drones, while other Russian companies use Chinese laser cutters to manufacture buggies and reactive armor for military users.A recent article in a government-owned newspaper said Oree Laser’s products have been sold to industries including the military — without specifying which military — and are also used for automobile manufacturing and to make precision instruments. In promotional videos, it has touted its machines’ usage in bridge construction and shipbuilding.Oree Laser is among the Chinese companies that have been elevated and supported by local officials, despite mounting Western pressure on third-country support for Russia’s war machine.Beijing has so far done little to stop private companies from supplying the Russian defense industries, even though it can and does have significant control over its industries. NATO will not be able to stop the export of dual-use goods like these laser machine tools without Chinese government cooperation, analysts say.There has been “little incentive to crack down hard as its strategic competition with the U.S. continues to heat up,” said Chen of the University at Albany, SUNY.For Oree Laser, business seems to be going well. It said in April that it would be expanding significantly so that it could produce 10,000 medium- and high-end laser machines per year, with construction expected to be completed this year.🚀 Exciting news alert! Oree Laser has officially launched our new manufacturing production base expansion project! Learn...The expansion plan has been selected as a key project of the city of Jinan, where Oree is based, for 2024. Communist Party officials from Jinan have visited Oree every month since May to learn about the expansion and Oree’s needs, according to posts on its website.Just this month, officials said the expansion was a key project for the city, as well as wider Shandong province, as an “important engine” for economic development.Still, burgeoning business ties with Russia come at a cost, even if that is difficult to quantify because of its opacity.Oree Laser officials had been preparing to go to Chicago in September for the International Manufacturing Technology Show, the largest trade fair of its kind in the Western Hemisphere. It posted on its YouTube page, offering exclusive deals and discounts.The Association for Manufacturing Technology, which organizes the trade show, canceled Oree Laser’s participation after seeing it was sanctioned by the Treasury.“As soon as we saw their name, we removed them from the show,” said Bonnie Gurney, the association’s vice president for strategic content and partnerships.Some analysts say, however, that some sanctioned companies will remain undeterred and isolation could push these companies to go all in on Russia.“When a company has been sanctioned, it is then free to switch its entire business to Russia,” said Jack Watling, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. “It doesn’t have an alternative market, so it may as well go with it.”Mahtani reported from Singapore and Wu from Taipei.

WaPo_22,Olympians are approaching the limits of human performance,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/interactive/2024/olympics-records-athletes-unbreakable-human-limit/,2024-07-26 17:00:02.644297,,"On a Saturday morning last month inside a hotel ballroom in Manhattan, Noah Lyles opened the calculator app on his phone and reduced the outer boundary of our species’ athletic performance to arithmetic.
Of the billions and billions of ambulatory human beings to grace this planet over the past several millennia, Lyles has sprinted faster than all but two. He is adamant that number will soon be zero. He typed in the number of seconds it took Jamaica’s Usain Bolt to cover the first half of his world’s fastest 200-meter race. Lyles added his own time from the second half of his best 200.
“Why can’t I?” Lyles said. “Your body doesn’t know the history of the world. Your mind knows that. If you turn your mind off and let your body just run, you see amazing things happen.”
At the Paris Olympics over the next three weeks, thousands of athletes will compete to win medals and stand on podiums. A select handful, such as Lyles, will be striving for something even greater. The Olympics are not only a spectacle for determining the world’s best athletes. They are a quadrennial window into the limits of human performance.
A Washington Post analysis of the progression of records in swimming and track and field events illustrates the varying degrees technology, training and talent have influenced both sports. It also shows what Lyles is up against: While swimmers continue splashing through perceived boundaries, track records — especially in short sprints — may be approaching the razor’s edge of possibility.
How the times of Olympic champions have changed
In the men's sprint events in track, gold medal-winning times have plateaued. Compared to 1972, none of the top marks in Tokyo was more than 4 percent faster. In the men's 100-meter swimming races, winning times continue to improve.

The pursuit of peak athleticism has obsessed competitors, riveted fans and fascinated scientists. The imperative to extend human progress is embedded in the Olympic motto: “Faster, higher, stronger,” not fastest, highest, strongest. “The record stands as a symbolic message of human greatness and infinite possibility,” Norwegian philosopher Sigmund Loland wrote in a 1998 paper.
The possibilities will be infinite for only so long. In sports measured by a clock, there is a logical threshold. Because it is categorically unfeasible for a human to run 100 meters in less than one second, the limit exists somewhere between there and Bolt’s current 9.58-second record. Researchers have studied, speculated and theorized about the boundary humans cannot surpass — and how close we may be to it.
“I don’t know what the threshold is,” said retired swimmer Janet Evans, a four-time Olympic gold medalist. “That’s why we’re so intrigued with all of this. How fast can someone run the 100 meters? How fast can someone swim the 50 meter? Let’s see how far we can go. It’s kind of why we do it.”
The answer depends not only on physiology but also sociology and technology. Compared with decades ago, more potentially elite athletes from more corners of the globe are receiving the opportunities and resources to compete at an elite level. Experience and the connective power of the internet have created massive leaps in coaching and the selection of athletes to sports that best suit their skills and body types. Specialization and optimization reign.
Setting aside the specter of performance-enhancing drugs, athletes have pushed limits through advances in equipment and training science. Jesse Owens ran on a cinder track and used a garden tool to dig holes to place his feet at the start of a race. Mark Spitz swam without goggles. Athletes have evolved alongside innovation.
“It’s part of who we are as a species to push limits and to push beyond what we think we’re capable of doing,” University of Oregon physiology professor Brad Wilkins said. “It’s probably part of why our species survived as a species — because we were driven to go further and build things and do things our Neanderthal counterparts weren’t able to do. I do believe a human is limited. But humans are not.”
History is littered with cases of humanity applying, and then exceeding, artificial restrictions.
Swimmers shattered records in 2008 and 2009 while wearing suits the sport’s governing body banned soon thereafter. “I thought maybe we were pushing the limits,” legendary coach Bob Bowman said. “Maybe that was it.” But many of those records have since fallen, and in three-quarters of swimming events, the gold medal-winning time in Tokyo in 2021 was faster than it was at the Beijing Games in 2008. Similarly, in the 1950s, people predicted a runner would die if he ran a mile in four minutes before Roger Bannister broke the barrier. Today, top high school runners routinely clock four-minute miles, and the world record is 3 minutes 43.13 seconds.
“It’s taken 70 years to get there,” British physiology professor Andrew Jones said. “I don’t imagine we’ll be 17 seconds faster again in another 70 years. The rate of progression must naturally slow down. It’s as much as for an artist as a scientist to imagine what that limitation might be.”
In its December 2008 issue, Journal of Experimental Biology published an article with this title: “Limits to running speed in dogs, horses and humans.” It was written by a Stanford marine biologist named Mark Denny who had set out to test a theory. He expected to find the rate of world records correlated with human population. “In my lifetime, human population has more than tripled,” Denny said. Breaking barriers, he assumed, was strictly a matter of probability.
“Well,” Denny said, “the stats don’t show that.”
Denny took a novel approach. He mined data on thoroughbred horses and racing greyhound dogs. Starting in the 1960s and ’70s, he said, their performance had plateaued. As breeders pushed for greater speed, the traits that made the animals faster also made them too fragile.

“They just break,” Denny said. “At some point, humans are going to run into the same thing.”
Denny paired the data from racing animals with reams of track and field official records. With no consideration for mechanics or physiology, he created a model that predicted when the curve for humans would match the animals’ speed plateau. For every major track distance, both men and women, he affixed what he asserted were the fastest times humans would ever be able to run.
The absolute 100 meters, his analysis showed, was 9.48 seconds. The women’s 800? It would never be run faster than 1:50.83. In the more than 15 years since Denny’s paper was published, just one of his absolute records has been surpassed: Four women, led by Tigst Assefa’s 2:11:53 in 2023, have run a marathon faster than 2:14:57. Denny pointed at a relative dearth of data from the era when competitive women’s marathons were rarely held.
“Things that on two legs versus four legs, things that weigh half a ton versus things that weigh 30 to 40 pounds, it says that there’s something going on here that is universal, at least among mammals,” Denny said. “It confirmed that humans just aren’t exceptional when it comes to athletic performance.”
Denny roots for athletes to break the absolute records, and he acknowledged his consideration of statistics alone made the article, sophisticated as it may be, mostly “fun with numbers.”
The physiological approach to determining a limit is multifaceted. At the highest level, even physics constrains humans. “The faster you go, the greater is the retarding force of the air resistance,” Jones said. “If you can improve your power by a couple of percent, that doesn’t mean you go a couple of percent faster.”
Peter Weyand, the director of Texas Christian University’s Locomotor Performance Laboratory, specializes in studying sprint speed. He refers to sprinters as “force application machines.” For something we do without thinking about, locomotion is remarkably complex, a tangle of bodily systems working in unison. What speed distills down to is how hard a sprinter can strike the ground relative to his weight.
Sprinters control two variables: the time their foot stays on the ground and the force their muscles apply to the ground. The only way to shrink that time is to apply greater force. If Weyand knows a sprinter’s contact time and the length of his leg, he can predict with uncanny accuracy how fast he is running. He is hesitant, though, to place a number on the fastest possible combination.
“Is it faster than the current world record? Of course it is,” Weyand said. “Bolt already did that, and there’s no such thing as a perfect race. Bolt on his perfect day could have run faster than 9.58. How much faster? I don’t know.”
The factors that limit sprinters differ from those that limit distance runners. Endurance performance is fundamentally governed by an athlete’s maximal oxygen uptake, called VO2 max — how much oxygen a person can use during exercise. An athlete’s VO2 max is analogous to a car’s engine size. Training can improve it — but only to a point. The highest VO2 max, which measures milliliters of oxygen consumed per minute per kilogram, ever recorded for a man is 97.5.
“It’s hard to imagine how or why we would have higher values than that in 10 or 20 years, at least naturally,” Jones said.
In a 1991 paper, Michael Joyner studied elite distance runners and determined the best possible VO2 max, lactate threshold and running economy. If a runner could achieve all three at the same time, he stated, the fastest possible marathon would be 1:57:58. Joyner, an expert in human performance at the Mayo Clinic, still sticks to his calculation, with the actual record currently at 2:00:35.
“Right now, we’re seeing a lot of world records being set or broken primarily due to technology first, sociology second,” Joyner said. “And I don’t think the athletes are physically better than they were 20 years ago.”
In analyzing the progression of athletic achievement, two sports that use a clock, fixed distances and minimal equipment beg for comparison. The data makes it clear: Top performances in running have plateaued compared with swimming. In the past decade, swimming world records have been broken 43 percent more often per event than in individual Olympic track races.
The best Olympic performances highlight faster progress in swimming. In individual track races, none of the Tokyo Olympic champions in 2021 won with a time more than 6 percent faster than the 1972 Olympic champion. Meanwhile, every individual swimming gold medalist in Tokyo posted a time at least 7 percent faster than the 1972 champions; in 10 events, they were at least 10 percent faster.
Swimmers, like runners and throwers, have benefited from technological advances: better suits, improved pool gutters that reduce turbulence, deeper pools that allow faster swims. But experts see the difference between the sports lying in the utilization of technique.
“Swimming is such an unnatural thing for humans — land-based creatures — that I’d say humans in water are still evolving,” American Swimming Coaches Association adviser Russell Mark said. “We’re still learning. We’re still figuring out best practices and best things to do. Running has evolved ever since people have existed. We’ve had a lot of time to perfect it.”
At last year’s world championships, Frenchman Leon Marchand shattered the last record Michael Phelps held, a 400-meter individual medley time that had stood since 2008. Marchand weaponized underwater kicking, which Bowman said is the feature “that’s probably having the most impact now” in swimming technique. “That’s Leon’s thing. That’s something we’re just starting really to understand.”
It’s not that individual runners can’t improve their form — Lyles’s rigorous work on his starting technique has enabled him to take aim at Bolt. But today’s runners can’t reinvent form the way Marchand has.
“If you can find people who have freakish genetics, that’s great,” Jones said. “On the nurture side, I’m not sure there’s much more we can do in terms of training.”
Swimming’s capacity for improvement may only grow as data-tracking technology improves. Track coaches already use motion-capture sensors that send immediate, granular data — the angles of joints, velocity out of the blocks, foot contact time on the ground — to a coach’s iPad. Swimming is scratching the surface of how similar devices could help athletes, for exactly the reason one would expect.
“Water is undefeated,” said Mike Levine, the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee’s director of performance innovation. “Sensors come off. They’re permeated by water, so they just break.”
The idea that technology is pushing forward human performance is not new. “I’ll tell you why men are running 100 yards faster today than they did years ago,” Jim Thorpe wrote in an article published in the Rotarian in 1940. “It’s not that one human body is more perfect than the other. It is the outside factors.”
It is not difficult to find experts who believe that human performance on its own has peaked and that improvements have derived from technology that supports performance, whether in competition or training.
“If you were to put that group of people from the ’50s and put them in the conditions with the technology and the time that the other athletes have been at this today, and the strategies they’ve been using throughout their careers, I think we would see the same times,” said Wilkins, the Oregon physiology professor. “I don’t think humans in particular have adapted in any way between the 1950s and now to have some fundamental changes in their physiology.”
In a 2014 speech, author David Epstein described a biomechanical study designed by sports scientist Ross Tucker. Based on the speed of Owens’s joints, the study showed that if Owens — with the training and nutrition available in 1936 — ran on the same track as Bolt, he would have finished a single stride behind Bolt on the day of his world record 100-meter sprint. In 1981, without modern suit technology, modern pool design or even goggles, Mary T. Meagher swam the 200-meter butterfly in 2:05.96, a time that would have advanced her to the Olympics at this year’s U.S. trials.
“People have been training as hard as possible, at least some of them, since the 1950s and certainly since the ’60s,” Joyner said. “Their lab values show that they’re not any different from what we see today. So what’s happened? The races happen at the best times. The tracks are way, way better. People have longer careers — remember, it was amateur hour.
“Go watch Bob Hayes run 10 flat on a dirt track. And he was 21 years old, and he was playing football. What do you think Bob Hayes could do if he was training full time for track, not getting beat up in the fall?”
If humans have been capable of running the same times for generations, it raises a thorny set of questions with no clear answers. Is a world record a celebration of human achievement or a marker in the progress of human innovation? Is it a feat of physical prowess or scientific advancement? Do technological advances allow athletes to express the full extent of their talent, or do they enable performances that, even if fully ethical, humans could not naturally access? Is technology a platform or a crutch?
One pursuit explored and exposed those questions: the Breaking2 project, Nike’s attempt to engineer a marathon completed in less than two hours.
In 2016, Nike signed world record Kenyan marathoner Eliud Kipchoge and two others to contracts that made them the hub of a performance experiment. A team of engineers, scientists and physiologists — including Wilkins and Jones — designed ideal conditions for a private race with the goal of breaking a two-hour marathon.
Breaking2 implemented a dividing line: Any technology that introduced energy into the runners’ system would be prohibited. Technology that prevented the dissipation of energy within their system would be permitted.
“Technologies that remove barriers and allow us to reach our true potential, I do not consider doping,” Wilkins said. “I consider that our natural way of performing and optimizing our own true potential.”
Runners ran around Kipchoge in an arrowhead formation to reduce wind resistance. A car drove in front of the runners with a clock mounted on the roof, keeping a constant pace.
The most lasting effect came from the shoes Kipchoge wore. The Nike Vaporfly would change distance running forever. The combination of a thick foam sole and a carbon plate created a springlike effect and made runners naturally more economical. Wearing the shoe reduced runners’ energy costs by 4 percent, Jones said, a remarkable gain in efficiency.
Middle-distance and distance records have been rearranged. In the women’s 5,000 meters, as one example, Ethiopian Tirunesh Dibaba’s 2008 record of 14:11.15 lasted more than 12 years. Since 2020, four runners have surpassed her time, with countrywoman Gudaf Tsegay lowering the record last year to 14.00.21 — an 11-second plummet in three years after a dozen years of stagnancy.
In swimming, high-tech suits that increased buoyancy and reduced drag upended records in 2008 and 2009 before the sport’s governing bodies banned them. They still show how technology can be powerful even when it can’t be used in competition. In 2016, as Phelps prepared for the Rio de Janeiro Olympics, he struggled with his underwater kicking technique. Nothing solved the problem until Bowman unearthed a banned full-body suit that Phelps had worn in 2008.
“As soon as he did a fast thing in that suit, he was like, ‘Now I remember,’” Bowman said. “It really impacted his swimming when he took the suit off. He could really get a feel for what it was like to be that fast and have that motion. The suit gave him that proprioception.”
At the conclusion of the Breaking2 project, Kipchoge finished the race in 2:00:25, falling less than half a minute short. In a similar exhibition in 2019, he broke the two-hour barrier.
At the 2023 Chicago Marathon, Kenyan Kelvin Kiptum reset the official record to 2:00:35, just 10 seconds slower than Kipchoge’s first sub-two-hour attempt. That time, many who worked on the Breaking2 project believe, was made possible by Kipchoge showing what could be done.
“It’s not your legs that run,” Kipchoge once told Wired magazine. “It’s your heart and your mind.”
Lyles first decided he could sprint 200 meters faster than anyone ever when he was a freshman at T.C. Williams (now Alexandria City) High. At a district meet at Lake Braddock High, Lyles won the 200 in 21.2 seconds. The time fulfilled his goal of shaving one second each year. His mother had also been a sprinter, and one of her old track coaches called Lyles and asked, “Do you realize that the time you just ran was the exact time Usain was running at your age?”
“I didn’t realize this goal I had set was such a high standard compared to everything else and everybody else that has gone on this path before me,” Lyles said. “At that moment it was like, ‘Okay, if I’m going after this goal, I’m going to have to get myself into the mindset that I’m going to have to attempt things from this age on that nobody has ever seen or even done.’”
For those with the physiological baseline necessary, trying to extend human performance also demands a psychological requirement. Lyles inspires himself through outlandish bombast. Phelps focused on the granular.
In 2003, Phelps muddled through the first two days of a midseason meet in Santa Clara, Calif., not even bothering to shave his leg hair. On the final day, Bowman sensed him perk up. As Phelps warmed up, Bowman gave Phelps target times for each leg of the 200-meter individual medley. Phelps started doing the math.
“That’s faster than the world record,” Phelps told him.
“So?” Bowman replied.
Phelps swam the race in 1:57.94, which broke a record that had stood for nearly nine years.
“It’s more a focus on maximizing what they can bring to the table,” Bowman said. “If they have talent and they’re well-trained and all these other things happen, that pushes them past these records. The records are kind of a nice milestone and a nice validation of the process.”
Before he first broke the shot put world record, Ryan Crouser had been throwing past the mark in practice for three years. At least five times, he arrived at a track meet certain that “the world record was in the bag,” he said. “And then I would get there. I would get a little bit tight. I wasn’t relaxed. You get a little bit of tension, you don’t hit those same positions.”
At the 2021 U.S. Olympic trials, Crouser surpassed a mark that had stood for 31 years. With that weight lifted, Crouser broke it again in 2023, at a midseason meet. The men’s discus record stood for nearly 38 years until it fell this spring, and no man has broken a world record in the javelin since 1996 or the hammer throw since 1986. Apart from Swedish pole vaulter Mondo Duplantis, who has upped the world record by a centimeter eight different times (which maximizes financial bonuses), men’s jumps have had a similar dearth in records.
Humans can be confounding creatures. In the 100-meter final of the 2008 Olympics, as he left his competitors in his wake, Bolt peeked over his shoulder and spread his arms in celebration with roughly 20 meters left. He lowered the world record to 9.69 seconds, but Denny believes he could have matched — if not beaten — 9.48 seconds.
“It’s so many little things like that that are going to set these things — not just performance but mental behavior as well,” Denny said”
Lyles rejected the very idea of a limit. Presented with the premise that a sprinter will never run 100 meters in, say, five seconds, Lyles wondered what humans could accomplish an eon from now. He was then asked how much further Bolt’s 200-meter record could be pushed.
“I plan to run 18.6 by the time I leave,” Lyles said. “Or at least that’s the idea I’m going to have in my head. I just want it to be so that it’s not going to be broken for 1,000 years.”
Lyles had not read Denny’s article. If he had, he would have seen the scientist’s prediction produced for the fastest possible 200-meter race: 18.63 seconds.
When Denny’s paper was published, the prevailing response he received was anger at the notion of a human limit.
“People were upset with the thought that you could watch the Olympics and nobody was going to break the world record,” Denny said. “With things that are measurable, I think people just have it in their head that records were meant to be broken, and they will always be broken. Logically, that can’t be true.”
Extended to the logical extreme, humans reaching their limit warps the nature of competition. First one human would reach the limit, then another and then another. Over enough generations, the 100-meter final at the Olympics would end up consisting of nine sprinters who run the same speed with no realistic chance to run faster.
Even in such a dystopian scenario, the act of training and competing would remain profoundly human. When the first Breaking2 project ended, Wilkins left with a changed perspective. It had nothing to do with training or technology. It was about how Kipchoge lived.
Kipchoge, a multimillionaire with access to cutting-edge training science, lived away from his family for months with his partners in a minimalist house. They did their own cooking, washed their own shoes and took turns cleaning the camp. They didn’t use the GPS watches they were given.
“Eliud almost put himself in a condition where he had to suffer because he knew that suffering was the path to becoming more mentally prepared and more physically prepared to perform these really amazing feats,” Wilkins said. “In my mind — maybe this is just a story I tell myself — it’s all about suffering and knowing that’s the way you’re going to be better.”
Unsettling as an end point to human performance may be, the futile effort to advance beyond it confers a certain honor. To struggle against inevitability, after all, is merely a feature of the human condition. The real point is to try.

The Post analyzed Olympic results from olympedia.org. Historical world record data for track and field is from World Athletics, and the same data for swimming, as well as the all-time top performances lists, is from USA Swimming. In general, only individual events that will be contested at the Paris Olympics were included in the analysis. The Post’s analysis is current as of July 15.
Analysis of swimming performances does not include open water events. In the women’s 100 meters at the 2000 Olympics, the gold medalist admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs, but her gold medal was not awarded to the second-place finisher. The bronze medalist was elevated to silver, so there are two silver medalists. The Post’s analysis of gold medal-winning times includes the best mark of the two silver medalists."
WaPo_23,Harris embarks on sprint to find Democratic running mate,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/26/kamala-harris-running-mate-search/,2024-07-26 17:00:02.644297,,"Vice President Harris is in a two-week sprint to lock in a running mate after President Biden’s stunning decision to end his reelection campaign, a search that suddenly elevates the potential political assets — and vulnerabilities — of the Democratic Party’s bench.Harris is considering roughly a dozen potential vice-presidential candidates, though allies say three have risen to the top: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D). The allies, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a confidential process, cautioned that the process is in its early stages and that Harris’s aides are still mulling an expansive group of contenders.The process officially got underway Tuesday, and Harris plans to make a decision by Aug. 7, aligning with the national party’s plan to virtually nominate a ticket by then.“She has a lot of great people to choose from,” Cooper told The Washington Post on Thursday, declining to comment on his own interest. “She has to win. I want her to win. I want her to pick the person that can help her win. I respect her process, and I don’t want to comment on that process.”During local news conferences and cable news appearances, potential vice-presidential candidates have spent recent days playing coy about their intentions while also testing out lines of attack against Republican nominee Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio). Some will get a chance to audition on the campaign trail in the coming days — including Shapiro, who is set to co-headline a Harris campaign event Monday in Pennsylvania.Among those navigating the new and intense speculation is Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear (D). During a news conference Thursday in his home state, Beshear began taking reporters’ questions by proactively addressing what he said was “likely to be asked over and over again.”“I am honored to be considered and regardless of what comes next, I’ll do everything I can between now and Election Day to elect Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States of America,” Beshear said.The decision is an early and major test for Harris’s days-old presidential campaign. Biden picked her as his running mate in 2020 because he wanted someone who shared his values and could immediately be effective on the job — and Harris is said to be approaching the search similarly.Harris initially considered some military and business leaders, though one of them, retired Navy Adm. William McRaven, said Wednesday that he had removed his name from consideration. And while she is thinking about some female politicians, her shortlist overwhelmingly contains White men, reflecting assumptions that voters would prefer gender and racial balance with a Black women leading the ticket.“Vice President Harris has directed her team to begin the process of vetting potential running mates,” Harris campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said in a statement. “That process has begun in earnest and we do not expect to have additional updates until the Vice President announces who will be serving as her running mate and as the next Vice President of the United States.”Many Democratic Party leaders are giving Harris space to make her decision and declining to publicly offer their preferences. But some local and state parties and individuals have formally backed potential vice-presidential nominees from their area, including in Arizona, Pennsylvania and North Carolina.“The path to the White House runs through Arizona, and we are confident that with Kamala Harris and Mark Kelly at the top of the ticket, Democrats will win in November,” Arizona’s party chair, Yolanda Bejarano, said in a statement.Rep. Angie Craig (Minn.), among the earliest House Democrats to call on Biden to step aside, is openly pushing for her state’s governor, Tim Walz.At the same time, the potential running mates are suddenly seeing their records scrutinized by fellow Democrats.Kelly on Wednesday sought to neutralize one of his political vulnerabilities, making clear he supports the Pro Act, which would ease the path toward forming unions and winning labor contracts. Kelly has drawn scrutiny from labor groups because he is one of the few senators who caucus with Democrats who have not signed on to that legislation over the years.Harris shouted out the Pro Act during a trip to Houston on Thursday. Addressing the American Federation of Teachers, Harris said Biden had promised to sign the legislation into law if it reached his desk — and “I promise you I will keep that promise.”During a Democratic National Committee media call Thursday with union leaders, reporters asked whether there were concerns over Kelly being considered for the vice-presidential slot. Abhi Rahman, a DNC spokesman, did not directly respond to the question, saying, “As a reminder, the DNC is still going through a process — an open and transparent process — to select our next nominee.”The DNC Rules Committee approved a nomination process Wednesday under which virtual voting could start as soon as Aug. 1. DNC officials have long aimed to wrap up the process by Aug. 7 to avoid potential GOP litigation related to Ohio’s ballot certification deadline. Ohio lawmakers moved it back from Aug. 7 to accommodate Democrats, but Democrats say they do not trust the GOP-led legislature and do not want to take any chances.In Pennsylvania, Shapiro has sought to carve out a distinct ideological profile that includes some positions at odds with his party, including support for school vouchers, which tap tax dollars to send students to private schools. A coalition of pro-public education groups sent a letter to Harris on Wednesday asking her to not pick Shapiro.Shapiro has also been an outspoken supporter of Israel after Hamas’s attack on the country last year, putting him at odds with some Democrats who want the United States to push back harder against the country’s war effort. At the same time, Shapiro, who is Jewish, has lined up with fellow Democrats in criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying in January that he is taking Israel in the “wrong direction.”“The things that Josh brings to the ticket, looking at it purely from an electoral contest standpoint, is accomplished governor of a swing state, absolutely relentless campaigner,” said Daniel Bauder, president of the Philadelphia Council AFL-CIO. “When Josh ran in ’22 for governor, he ran against a deeply unpopular Republican opponent, but he treated the race as if he were running neck-and-neck the entire time.”Bauder said he did not think any party-splitting positions would necessarily be “deficiencies when examining Josh as a potential running mate.”“Ultimately the platform is set by the party and the president,” Bauder said.One consideration regarding Cooper is that under the North Carolina Constitution, the lieutenant governor becomes the acting governor whenever the governor leaves the state. That means that if Cooper were to be out campaigning for Harris, the acting governor would be Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, a GOP firebrand running for governor.Last year, while Cooper was traveling in Japan, Robinson used his temporary powers to declare a week of solidarity with Israel after the Hamas attacks on the country. Cooper responded critically, calling it a political stunt given Robinson’s history of antisemitic comments.On Thursday, Cooper’s office argued that its legal analysis shows the governor’s powers “do not transfer to the Lieutenant Governor so long as the Governor is able to remain in communication and direct state government action when traveling.”“If the Governor ceded official responsibility and authority during any physical travel outside North Carolina, it would lead to chaos and confusion,” Cooper spokesperson Sadie Weiner said in a statement.Cooper, in a Post interview, said he has been able to manage the state “pretty well” while traveling as governor.Chris Cooper, a political science professor at Western Carolina University, predicted that Robinson would not have that much impact as acting governor.Chris Cooper noted Republicans in the state legislature already have veto-proof majorities, so there would be little political incentive for them to jam through a bill for Robinson’s signature while Roy Cooper is gone.“The big 10,000-foot deal is the North Carolina governor is incredibly weak — arguably the weakest in the country — and a one-day governor is even weaker,” Chris Cooper said.Mariana Alfaro contributed to this report."
WaPo_24,Online portals deliver scary health news before doctors can weigh in,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/07/14/medical-test-results-online-patient-portal/,2024-07-26 17:00:02.644297,,"More Americans are learning of devastating health diagnoses through their phones and computers instead of personally from their doctors because of a federal requirement that people receive immediate access to medical test and scan results, from routine bloodwork to MRIs.This shift has sparked a debate in the medical community about whether instant information empowers patients or harms them.The new medical landscape resulting from a bipartisan law promoting transparency has exposed fault lines in a stressed health-care system where the promises of technological advancements are undercut by the heavy workloads foisted on medical professionals.As more people receive troubling results online at the same time as their doctors — often waiting days or weeks for treatment plans — medical associations have been pushing to give doctors more time to release records revealing cancer and other grim diagnoses so patients don’t have to bear the news alone.Mike Day’s cancer diagnosis arrived while he lounged in his living room recliner last summer. His wife, a former registered nurse, spotted “adenocarcinoma” in biopsy results posted to his electronic patient portal. His gastroenterologist was on vacation.After unsuccessfully trying to make an appointment to discuss the cancerous tumor in his esophagus, the Days went to a crowded emergency room where he laid on a stretcher in a hallway while a specialist discussed his prognosis. There was no privacy as the doctor, speaking loudly within earshot of passersby, warned the cancer was incurable, Day’s wife recalled.Four weeks later, Day, a retired U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent in Bangor, Maine, died at age 75. His family is astounded by how much trouble they had to go through to get an explanation for a cancer that serious.“Getting medical results shouldn’t be like tracking a DoorDash order,” said Andrew Day, Mike’s son. “It’s unconscionable that information is out there to just gobsmack a family without having a proper conversation about it.”The idea of medical transparency undergirding provisions in the 2016 Cures Act is broadly supported. But implementation of the regulations expanding access to medical records, which took effect in 2021, has been more divisive.Congress has taken little interest in this issue, and federal health officials have stood by the rules, arguing that concerns will be resolved as technology improves and as medical practices adjust how they prepare patients for results.“There is just a moral imperative here, which is for patients, this is their information. They ought to be able to access it whenever they want,” said Micky Tripathi, the national coordinator for health information technology whose office crafted the requirement for the Department of Health and Human Services. “They also pay for it. They ought to be able to get things they pay for.”Some patients say they’re now equipped to ask better questions, notice things their doctors do not and better manage their own care. Others panic over results that appear alarming but are mundane when interpreted by a medical professional.Danielle Ofri, a primary care physician at Bellevue Hospital in New York, carves out about an hour a day on her vacations to review scans to avoid leaving patients hanging and makes time to call the patients she knows have greater health anxiety. But such calls are not reimbursed by major insurance plans, and the time can quickly add up. In some cases, she consults specialists before calling the patients to better answer their questions and present a treatment plan.During a recent appointment, a patient was upset that Ofri didn’t call after seeing the word carcinoma in the results of an MRI scan. But the report actually said there was no evidence of carcinoma, a word buried in enough medical jargon that the doctor could understand the confusion.Such misunderstandings aren’t unusual, she said. Since the notification requirements went into effect, Ofri said, she has received a constant flow of messages from patients asking about clinically irrelevant lab results. For example, a lay person reviewing a complete blood count test could be worried by a single component outside the normal range, but a doctor wouldn’t fret as long as other parts of the test came back normal. What could look like a serious issue on a radiology scan of the spine could be the normal wear and tear of aging.“Putting it all out there? That’s not transparency. That’s a data dump, and it’s really not fair to patients to throw it out there and wash your hands of it,” said Ofri, who wrote about her experiences for the New Yorker.The American Medical Association has been lobbying federal health officials, unsuccessfully, to adopt a rule providing physicians 72 hours to reach patients before electronically releasing life-altering results or deadly diagnoses. California and Kentucky have enshrined similar exceptions in recent state laws.“It’s one more instance in which we feel like there are other people who don’t know our patients who are getting in the way of that really sacred doctor-patient relationship,” said Jack Resneck, the medical association’s former president who led the group’s advocacy on the issue.But exceptions similar to those adopted in California have resulted in unintended consequences, said Scott MacDonald, a primary care physician and chief medical information officer for the University of California at Davis health system. The health system withholds almost any scan that could theoretically show cancer, even if they were ordered for other issues, he said.One of MacDonald’s patients couldn’t immediately receive results of an MRI of a torn meniscus in his knee, and his wife had to wait days for a scan that confirmed her breast cancer did not metastasize.“I’m not a paternalistic physician, and I feel the anxiety of waiting to hear the test result can be more than the anxiety of hearing a result that’s difficult to hear,” MacDonald said.Experts say more research is needed to understand how patients are reacting to greater access to their medical records and the effects on their health. A survey of more than 8,000 patients at four medical institutions found that 96 percent wanted immediate results even if their provider hadn’t reviewed the results. And 7.5 percent of respondents said reviewing the results before talking to a doctor increased their worry.Some experts say the study’s findings should be tempered by the fact that respondents were a self-selecting group because they opted to complete the survey and did not represent U.S. patients overall. Respondents were also disproportionately White.Cait DesRoches, executive director of OpenNotes, a research initiative affiliated with Harvard Medical School that was involved in the study, said patients would worry less if their health provider explained in advance why they’re conducting the test and what they might see.The organization is preparing a new study that focuses on the experiences of cancer patients, for whom test results can be life-changing.“Sometimes we underestimate what patients can handle,” said DesRoches, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. “For every oncologist we heard from saying this is a problem, cancer is different, we heard from patients with cancer saying I would rather get my results at home where I can think about it, process it, discuss it with my family and be ready to have a conversation with the provider. If I hear bad news during a visit, then I don’t hear anything else that person tells me.”Loriana Hernández-Aldama finds comfort in seeing instant test results after surviving acute myeloid leukemia and breast cancer, which she said left her with post-traumatic stress disorder after the near-brushes with death. Having been treated dismissively and given partial information by some doctors, she said she would prefer to see her medical records herself.“For me, it’s been like marching orders. I read it, I run with it, start researching it,” said Hernández-Aldama, 51, of Peachtree City, Ga., who received a result about a lesion on her stomach last year that she had interpreted as possible stomach cancer. “I said to my husband: ‘I’m done. Our kid is not going to have a mother.’”The lesion ended up not being a big deal. Her husband, Cesar Aldama, pleads with her to avoid checking the patient portal between appointments because he sees her anxiety rising when test results are unclear.“She is knowledgeable, but she’s not a doctor,” Aldama said. “I’m trying to derail any anxiety attacks. … Am I successful? Not often.”Aldama believes the solution is not to take away his wife’s right to see her results, but to have more people in the health-care system who can offer guidance.Grace Cordovano, a patient advocate, said one of the best ways to ease anxieties without overwhelming doctors is for insurers to pay health navigators who can prepare patients before they meet with a physician. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services created billing codes to allow the public insurers to pay for “principal illness navigation” to connect patients with cancer and other high-risk conditions to health and social services.Before medical records were readily accessible, Cordovano said, patients struggled to obtain the documents needed to get a second opinion, enroll in clinical trials or book appointments with specialists.“I’m working with patients for whom the hourglass and sands of time are pouring against them,” Cordovano said.L.C. Osadchuk, who navigates the aftermath of the hormonal condition Cushing’s syndrome, said people with rare diseases rely on immediate access to test results to manage their health because few providers understand the complexities of their conditions.She must take steroids and other medication and undergoes weekly comprehensive metabolic testing and monthly bloodwork to track her electrolyte and cortisol levels, which can fluctuate quickly to detrimental effect.When her adrenal glands were first removed, Osadchuk would sometimes wait two days for a doctor to call with results that might necessitate fluid infusions at a hospital or receiving large doses of hydrocortisone or vitamins.Removing that wait has made it easier to maintain an athletic lifestyle competing in ultramarathons and bicycle motocross races. She can participate if her test results are normal instead of erring on the side of caution and sitting out.“Having to wait for those test results was just excruciating,” said Osadchuk, 46, of Bellingham, Wash. “You might as well have just killed me four times over because the stress was like, ‘Ahhhhh!’”Aaron Gregg contributed to this report."
WaPo_25,Ice Spice is here for a good time — not a long time — on debut ‘Y2K!’,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/2024/07/26/ice-spice-y2k-review/,2024-07-26 17:00:02.644297,,"Coco Chanel once said, “Before you leave the house, look in the mirror and take one thing off.” For Ice Spice, that is advice to live by, both sartorially and sonically. And not just because she once rapped, “Hundred bands in Chanely / But I’m still shakin’ a-- in a deli.”That mix of high-life couture and lowlife shenanigans continues on “Y2K!,” the debut album from Ice Spice, on which the Uptown upstart bangs out 10 songs in about 20 minutes, shrugging off lyrics about hip-shaking and check-signing, hooking up and stepping out, in pint-size blasts of twitchy exuberance. Perhaps with Coco in mind, the songs make their points without over-accessorizing: a couple of verses, a couple of choruses and nary a bridge in sight.For old-school heads and pop-music tsk-tskers, Ice Spice is a harbinger of hip-hop’s doom and cultural decline. Even her kitschy album art, which emblazons “Y2K” on an overflowing garbage can, seems to be a manicured nail in the eye of her haters. But for a generation of kids white-knuckling dystopia through TikTok and fast fashion, the 24-year-old is making the mood her own.Ice Spice burst onto the scene less than two years ago with tunes such as “Munch (Feelin’ U)” and “In Ha Mood” that generated slang at a rapid clip and introduced a wider audience to drill, a bleak and battering style of rap born in Chicago that picked up new tics as it was exported to London and reimported back to New York.“Y2K!” picks up where her previous output left off, with Ice Spice’s quick-and-to-the-pointless quips focused on who has the thickest body, the dankest weed, the brightest jewels. She hasn’t grown much as a lyricist (her perplexing scatological fascination continues), but she’s found new ways to contort her voice, sharpening her flow into a Minajish patter, exhaling gasps like clouds of smoke and burping out words as groans and croaks.In that way, Spice’s lyrics are just another element of the sonic collages assembled by producer RiotUSA, who has served as the architect of her sound. The beats of “Y2K!” continue to meld the shiftiness of drill with the insistence of club music: high-hats tap on the glass like a horror movie slasher, while drums bang at the door like the cops. The album proves that Ice Spice can find the pocket no matter how cacophonous or sinister the beat, yet another reminder that rap hasn’t been a boys’ club for years.Those expecting “Y2K!” to serve up turn-of-the-millennium nostalgia like “brat summer” in the Bronx will be disappointed. The album’s short but sweet title serves only as a nod to Jan. 1, 2000, the day Ice Spice was born as Isis Gaston (which is probably an even better moniker than her nom de rap). In the same way that a much-hyped tech disaster didn’t go down that day, Ice Spice’s music doesn’t signal the end of the world — just another way to get through it."
WaPo_26,Barack and Michelle Obama endorse Kamala Harris for president,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/26/barack-michelle-obama-kamala-harris-endorse/,2024-07-26 17:00:02.644297,,"Former president Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama endorsed Vice President Harris for president on Friday, becoming the final key leaders in the Democratic Party to unite behind Harris after President Biden abandoned his bid for a second term.A video posted on social media shows the Obamas calling Harris to inform her of their endorsement.“We called to say Michelle and I couldn’t be prouder to endorse you and to do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office,” the former president says to Harris.Michelle Obama adds, “I can’t have this phone call without saying to my girl Kamala: I am proud of you. This is going to be historic.”In a separate statement, the Obamas pledged to “do everything we can” to elect Harris and called on their legions of supporters to join the effort.They praised Harris’s record of accomplishments, listing each of her previous roles in what could be interpreted as a rejoinder to Republicans who have labeled her a “DEI hire” — a reference to “diversity, equity and inclusion” initiatives often used derisively to suggest that Harris only reached the upper echelon of American politics because of her race and gender.“But Kamala has more than a résumé. She has the vision, the character, and the strength that this critical moment demands,” they wrote. “There is no doubt in our mind that Kamala Harris has exactly what it takes to win this election and deliver for the American people. At a time when the stakes have never been higher, she gives us all reason to hope.”Their call with Harris took place on Wednesday. Barack Obama said the Democrats would be “underdogs” but pledged to work hard for her election.“Bottom line is, we are ready to get to work,” he said during the call, according to a transcript. “We are telling everybody to kick off those bedroom slippers and get off the couch and start knocking on doors and making phone calls.”Many Republicans seized on the fact that Obama did not mention or endorse Harris in his initial statement responding to Biden’s abrupt exit from the race Sunday.“We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead,” he said in that statement. “But I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges.”On Thursday, Donald Trump’s campaign seized on Obama’s lack of an endorsement to make the case that Harris’s path to the nomination was not a done deal. Steven Cheung, a campaign spokesman, said Trump would not agree to debate Harris until she was officially the Democratic nominee, suggesting without evidence that Obama and other top Democrats were considering backing a different candidate.“There is a strong sense by many in the Democrat Party — namely Barack Hussein Obama — that Kamala Harris is a Marxist fraud who cannot beat President Trump, and they are still holding out for someone ‘better,’” Cheung said in a statement Thursday evening. “Therefore, it would be inappropriate to schedule things with Harris because Democrats very well could still change their minds.”The Obamas’ endorsement comes after Harris already secured enough pledges from delegates to become the likely nominee. Biden exited the race on Sunday and immediately endorsed Harris, who quickly coalesced much of the Democratic Party behind her bid.Just before Biden dropped out of the race, Obama told allies that the president’s path to victory had greatly diminished and he thought the president needed to seriously consider the viability of his candidacy, according to multiple people briefed on his thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential conversations. In those conversations, Obama emphasized he felt protective over Biden as a friend and was concerned about his legacy."
WaPo_27,"Arson disrupts France’s high-speed trains hours before Olympics, officials say",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/26/france-rail-disruptions-scnf-olympics/,2024-07-26 17:29:02.644297,,"High-speed train lines in France were targeted by “arson attacks,” causing massive disruptions hours before the Opening Ceremonies of the Paris Olympic Games, the country’s national rail service said.Gabriel Attal, the French caretaker prime minister, said that the “acts of sabotage” were carried out early Friday morning in a “prepared and coordinated manner.”“The consequences on the rail network are massive and serious,” he added in a post on X, adding that “our intelligence services and law enforcement are mobilized to find and punish the perpetrators of these criminal acts.”France’s state-owned, national rail service SNCF said Friday several “malicious acts” targeted three of its high-speed train lines. In an email to The Washington Post, it said it was the “victim of a massive attack to paralyze high-speed lines.”Fires were set “to damage our facilities,"" SNCF said, also noting that some disruptions are expected to last through the weekend until Monday.Some 250,000 travellers were expected to travel today, SNCF said, and 800,000 during the weekend.The Eurostar trains, one of the principal transport lines from the United Kingdom to the European continent, also announced delays “due to a problem with the overhead power supply in France” and listed trains arriving in France an hour later than scheduled. It advised travelers to postpone their trips.SNCF said its Atlantic, northern and eastern high-speed lines were affected and advised customers to postpone travel. SNCF that it also prevented another “malicious act” targeting the Southeast line.Officials said they were assessing the impact on travelers and athletes set to compete.Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete strongly condemned what he called the “coordinated” acts. He told BFM TV that an investigation is underway but said the coordinated timing of the incidents suggested the fires were “criminal” in nature.“At this stage, it probably one or several acts of vandalism, a kind of coordinated sabotage,” French Sports Minister Amélie Oudéa-Castéra told Le Parisien. “We will evaluate the impact for today, for travelers, the impact for the athletes and for this weekend.""The SNCF said its teams were “on site” to establish the problem and begin repairs, noting “some trains are diverted, a large number of trains are canceled.”A Paris 2024 spokesperson said in an email that it had “taken note” of the incidents, adding: “We are working closely with our partner, the rail operator SNCF, to assess the situation.”Attal thanked “firefighters who intervened on the affected sites” and “the SNCF agents who will carry out the necessary work to restore the network” — and impacted travellers for “their patience, their understanding and the civic-mindedness they demonstrate.”Valérie Pécresse, the president of the regional council of the Île-de-France region, called the incidents “coordinated sabotage” and “an attempt to destabilize just as we launch the Olympic Games.”“We ask travelers from the Ile-de-France region who have to take a TGV [high-speed train] not to go to the station and to wait for personalized information, which will be sent by SMS,” she said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.Speaking to BFM TV, Pécresse said the incidents are “not a coincidence” but rather a “massive and coordinated attack.”Paris was just supposed to be a quick layover on a long journey from Coco Zurita’s hometown in Chile to Amsterdam, where he was headed to visit friends on Friday.But after he collected his bags at Paris’s Charles de Gaule international airport on Friday morning, he learned that his train to the Netherlands was canceled because of the overnight disruptions to rail lines.Two trains along that route had been canceled, and there was a “massive line” in front of the customer service counter at the airport of passengers hoping for spots on a third, functioning train. Someone told Zurita he might have better luck if he headed to Gare du Nord instead.So the 40-year-old made his way into the city and bought a ticket here, for a train that was slightly delayed but still scheduled to run mid-morning. He was tired after 24 hours of travel and the delay added to the journey, Zurita said, “but it was kind of nice to come to this station” and see a bit of Paris.Claire Parker contributed to this report."
WaPo_28,Money buys a better position. Just look at Southwest’s new seating.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/26/southwest-seating-money-buys-better-position/,2024-07-26 18:59:02.884520,,"Et tu, Southwest?It was only a matter of time. Southwest Airlines, which set itself apart from its nickel-and-dime competitors, will soon scrap its open-seat policy and charge folks for more legroom.It’s a momentous change that, in some respects, speaks to a metaphor I’ve written about before — airline seating is much like America’s economic divide — the less room you have to be comfortable, the more likely you’ll get stuck in a miserable middle position.For those not familiar with the carrier’s long-standing seating policy, passengers are not assigned a seat. It’s first-come, first-served, making it an outlier among the major carriers.For five decades, Southwest’s system was an good example of how equitable treatment can work — for the most part.I’m a frequent Southwest customer, and its boarding stood out because price-conscious passengers were essentially treated the same. Of course, the coveted bulkhead and exit aisle seats are quickly snapped up, but almost all other seats are the same size.Everyone can check up to two free bags. With a boarding number, there’s no need to crowd the boarding gate to compete to be among the first to board. On Southwest, there is just a little bit of privilege.“Business Select” passengers don’t get special seating at the front of the aircraft. They get priority boarding (after those needing assistance). Then there is “EarlyBird Check-In.” For a fee, these customers are automatically checked in, which also has the benefit of an earlier boarding position, which increases their odds of snagging a preferred seat and coveted overhead bin space.But during the boarding process, you don’t have to walk past first — or business-class — fliers in their enviably wide seats, as they sip drinks delivered to them on a tray while you slog to your cramped quarters, hoping there is still overhead space for your carry-on bag.On Southwest, there are no curtains physically and psychologically separating the haves from the have-nots.Under its new policy, Southwest expects roughly one-third of the seats across its fleet to come with extended legroom. The new seating configuration is expected to be available in 2025.Southwest said its research found that many customers strongly prefer a premium seating option.“Although our unique open seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice — at the right time — for our Customers, our People, and our Shareholders,” Bob Jordan, Southwest’s president and chief executive said in a statement.I don’t doubt that many folks will want to pay for the comfort. More wealth has always allowed people to buy a better position in life and on airlines.“Wealth inequality is higher in the United States than in almost any other developed country and has risen for much of the past 60 years,” according to an April report by the Urban Institute.In 1963, the wealthiest families had 36 times the wealth of middle-class families. By 2022, it had jumped to 71 times that of families in the middle. Those richer than 99 percent of all families saw their wealth increase more than sevenfold — from $1.8 million to $13.6 million.The economic inequity for minorities is worse, the result of “long-standing effects of racist policies, not individual intentions or deficits,” the report points out.In 2022, the average wealth of White families was $1.4 million. That compares with $211,596 and $227,544 for Black and Hispanic families, respectively.“In a nation that professes that those who work hard and play by the rules should be rewarded with social and economic upward mobility, these persistent disparities are a stark reminder that, as a society, we have not achieved this goal,” the report said.Southwest’s move is also indicative of shareholder expectations.Solid returns are not enough because companies have to feed the beast that is Wall Street.Even with recent market turbulence, investors are doing well overall. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all hit record highs in July.But such demands come with a cost: For companies to deliver bigger earnings quarter after quarter, year over year, there invariably is an erosion in affordability for many consumers.Like legroom and seat widths on many airlines, the middle class is shrinking. A larger percentage of Americans cannot afford a college education, a home or an automobile.A report earlier this year from the Pew Research Center found that the share of adults who live in middle-class dropped from 61 percent in 1971 to 51 percent in 2023.Pew reported that the median income of middle-class households increased from about $66,400 in 1970 to $106,100 in 2022. During this same period, the median income of upper-income households increased from about $144,100 to $256,900.You may argue that it’s only fair that people with means buy the upgrades they want. But we can’t ignore what economic inequity does to a society.Folks fight over what’s left.Continuing with the airline example, passengers are battling over bin space. Tension flare when people recline their seats, making it more uncomfortable for the passengers behind them.A more equitable airline cabin could make flying less stressful and more comfortable for everyone. Closing the wealth gap creates a better world. The rich can still have their luxuries, but lower- and middle-income families can enjoy a better life as well.During an earnings call, Southwest’s chief executive said there are no plans for the company to add a first-class section or eliminate its policy that bags fly free.Jordan said the airline won’t be putting in seats that have doors or ones that give you a massage. There won’t be ovens to prepare hot, plated meals for privileged passengers.There also won’t be curtains."
WaPo_29,Airline safety videos are getting bigger and buzzier. Are they more effective?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/07/26/british-airways-safety-video-bridgerton/,2024-07-26 18:42:02.884520,,"Passengers flying British Airways these days may be surprised to find themselves traveling not to Heathrow or Gatwick, but first to 19th-century England: complete with men on horseback, women in carriages and a corset so tight the lady might needeth an oxygen mask.The airline’s new safety video is replete with references to British culture, and draws on the success of hit period dramas such as “Bridgerton” — part of a trend of airlines using increasingly cinematic safety briefings to show passengers a lot more than where they can find a life vest. British Airways said the new film is meant to “keep customers engaged with important safety messaging.”But experts are split on whether these buzzy videos, which seem to aspire to virality, effectively share vital safety information — or just provide entertainment on top of brand or cultural awareness.Industry watchers trace the rise of quirky safety videos back to a playful cartoon briefing from Virgin America in 2007 and Air New Zealand’s 2009 briefing, which included crew members wearing little more than body paint as they demonstrated the “bare essentials of safety.” In the years since, celebrities, traditional dancers, high-profile directors such as Taika Waititi, and even a K-pop group have featured in ever more elaborate productions in the name of airline safety.Experts and officials stress that air travel is incredibly safe — the U.S. airline system has gone 15 years without a fatal crash — and experiencing an emergency onboard is unlikely. Blaise Waguespack, a professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida and an expert in airline marketing, said the emergence of creative safety videos reflects an attempt by carriers to break through the constant “clutter of content” on digital devices and reach distracted passengers — which is “always an issue when attempting to deliver information today.”Some experts praised the efforts. Kevin Kuhlmann, a professor of aviation and aerospace science at the Metropolitan State University of Denver, said that for a long time briefings “have been mandated and scripted in a manner that was benign and mundane,” prompting regular fliers to tune out. He applauded the creative videos for bringing “the briefing back into focus.”Safety videos set in, say, a Pixar-like sci-fi animation or the world of Lord of the Rings offer plenty of visual distractions as they take a scenic route to safety. But Scott Koslow, a professor of marketing at Macquarie University in Australia, said that with these videos “you might actually get attention that you couldn’t get otherwise” and “a little bit of confusion might just be a decent price to pay to get people to look at the screen.”Whether that attention translates to retention is a different question, though. Some airline personnel have attributed the successful evacuation of a Japan Airlines plane that collided with another aircraft earlier this year to the airline’s short and simple safety video. And the little research that exists on the topic suggests the airlines’ Hollywood glow-up may have mixed results.One 2015 study, with 45 participants, suggests that once a viewer is watching a safety video, a humorous video is better at holding attention than a video featuring a celebrity or a standard video. Another study from the same year, with 82 participants, found that while safety briefings that are funny or use movie themes positively affect participant’s moods, “there was a trade-off between entertainment and education” and “the greater the entertainment value, the poorer the retention of key safety messages.”Brett Molesworth, a professor at the University of New South Wales in Australia and an author on the papers, said in an interview that the research is clear that “any, overlap or confusion at the point of the key safety message — whether that’s entertainment, humor, etc. — undermines the safety message.”Molesworth says we can only process so much information at a time, and when we encounter something entertaining or funny “it often consumes all of our working memory capacity.” It’s not that airlines can’t be fun, he said, explaining that they just need to “divorce those funny bits or the entertaining bits from the key safety messages.”Experts say it doesn’t help that these videos sometimes avoid even showing the aircraft. In the British Airways video, seat belts are donned on horseback and the plane exits are explained in a ballroom, while in an Air France safety video, the exit sign is transformed into an outfit worn on a catwalk at a fashion show.Xiaoyu Wu, a lecturer at Griffith University in Australia who studies aviation and safety practices, said these videos might “attract your attention because they put fake seats in, I don’t know, the jungle,” but they don’t always do a good job of showing the actual safety features of the aircraft. Such videos can miss what’s important, he said, stressing that “if it’s really working, it’s preparing people” in case of an emergency.At least one airline has made a public point of adopting that perspective. Earlier this month, Emirates released a “no-nonsense” safety video that received praise from several aviation bloggers.Right from the opening, it’s clear about its intent. “We do not have dancers breaking into song, characters from movies or celebrities trying to be funny I’m afraid,” one flight attendant says. Another says that while entertainment will be available later: “Safety always comes first.”"

The moment we’ve been waiting for all summer: the Olympic Opening Ceremonies are tonight. Tell us what Olympic sporting event you make sure to always watch. Send tips to earlytips@washpost.com. Thanks for waking up with us.In today’s edition … the Obamas endorse Harris ... Harris embarks on sprint to find a running mate … but first …Nine questions for... Republican pollster Whit Ayers. Every several weeks until the election we will speak with a pollster about what the polls are saying about the presidential race. This week we chatted with Ayers, founder and president of North Star Opinion Research, about how the presidential race has changed with Vice President Kamala Harris now likely to be the Democratic presidential nominee.What does the margin between the presidential candidates look like after the shake up at the top of the ticket?The initial data takes us back to the campaign before Joe Biden’s disastrous debate meltdown where the national polls were very close but Donald Trump had a significant lead in the Sunbelt swing states and a modest lead in the Upper Midwest swing states.There’s no evidence, but there’s a reasonable assumption that Kamala Harris could do better among African American and Hispanic voters but probably worse among older, blue collar, White voters that make up so many of the voters in the upper Midwest. So it’s reasonable to assume, I think, the Sunbelt states will get closer but you balance that with the upper Midwest states getting weaker for her than Joe Biden.So big picture you’re saying the race hasn’t fundamentally changed yet?I don’t think you could say that with the elimination of an 81-year-old incumbent president. But in a polarized country, you’re still likely to have a very close race. Trump won 47 percent [of the vote] in 2020. The number to watch is whether Donald Trump can break through that 47 percent. If he does, that changes things pretty significantly. If not, then we’re likely to have an election where both candidates are somewhere in the mid 40′s and the election is decided by close margins in the swing states.I do think that Kamala Harris inherits many of the negative views of the Biden-Harris administration on inflation, economy taxes, Gaza, and especially the most negative issue with the way she was put in charge of illegal immigration. So she’s got some challenges ahead, separating herself from the Biden administration in a way that doesn’t antagonize people who strongly supported Joe Biden.Does Kamala Harris’s candidacy exacerbate or highlight any weaknesses of Donald Trump?It depends upon how he reacts. If he follows the examples of some of the irresponsible members of Congress and starts taking shots at her race and her gender and talking about a DEI candidate, that’s going to backfire. On the other hand, if he focuses on policy differences and calls her a San Francisco liberal who wants to ban fracking, ban offshore drilling and eliminate private health insurance, then I think he will be helped by the Kamala candidacy.There was a big concern about apathy among the Democratic base with Biden and the double haters. Are Democrats more enthusiastic now?There’s no question that that helps the Democratic ticket up and down the ballot if Democrats are fired up and enthusiastic about voting.The real question in my mind is how Kamala Harris fares in the heat of an intense presidential campaign. Her last presidential campaign in 2019-2020 was an unmitigated disaster, beset by staff infighting and a confused message that caused the campaign to collapse before it ever got started. So the hope of Democrats must be that she is a whole lot better than she has been in the past.So there’s a lot of room for her to do better and a lot of room for her to do worse?Exactly. And it all comes down to how she can handle the pressure of a very, very intense presidential campaign.Is there any sense of what young voters, who seemed to be Trump curious before Biden dropped out, think about Harris or is it too early to tell?It’s really too early to tell.Was JD Vance the right choice for Trump to help him win?We’ll see how JD Vance performs on the stump, but it was obviously a very confident Donald Trump who chose JD Vance to double down on the MAGA voters as opposed to reaching out to more traditional Republicans with a different choice.Did Harris eviscerate the traditional post-convention bump for Republicans?I think it’s the post-convention, post-assassination bump that was modest but real. And now the excitement about Kamala Harris, or more precisely, the excitement about not having Joe Biden, has given the Democrats a little bump. But again, this is all about how it plays out over the next 100 or so days. We have a very different kind of race, even though many of the fundamentals remain unchanged. We have a very different kind of race, because we have a very different Democratic candidate.What are you going to be watching over the next few weeks?I’m going to be looking at the significant number of African American and Hispanic voters who at this point say they’re likely to vote for Donald Trump — somewhere in the 30s, which would be historically high, except for George W. Bush’s 44 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2004. I’m going to be looking to see if they stick with Donald Trump, or if they go back to Kamala Harris.I’m going to be interested to see how the blue-collar Whites in the Upper Midwest react to her candidacy. Because the White voters held fairly stable for Joe Biden, it was weakness in the non-White vote that caused the Upper Midwest to be so close.It’s also going to be fascinating to see if Donald Trump can break through that 47 percent, which has been his ceiling up to this point. That will indicate a significant change in the fundamentals of the race.When then-Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) called Rep. Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla.) in January 2019 to tell her she planned to run for president, the veteran Florida lawmaker with a penchant for festive headgear started screaming with excitement before Harris could finish her sentence.Her enthusiasm startled Harris on the other line.But as soon as Wilson hung up, another call came in — this time, from Joe Biden. When Wilson didn’t pick up — “I knew what he was going to ask,” the congresswoman explained — Biden then texted her, Marianna reports with our colleague Jacqueline Alemany.Five years later, Biden did just that — endorsing Harris, now his vice president, to succeed him. And so have most of the 30 Black women in Congress, who now stand as something of a national firewall for her candidacy with Harris poised to become the first Black woman to lead a major party ticket and competing to become the country’s first Black female president.They are in both a celebratory and get-down-to-business mood, sporting pink and green — the colors of Alpha Kappa Alpha, Harris’s college sorority — in the Capitol halls; privately pressing holdout colleagues to endorse Harris, and preparing to hit the trail and speak out against the racist and sexist attacks they, too, have been the target of.Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ga.) referred to Black women in Congress as Harris’s “armor bearers.” And Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) described her congressional sorority as a “shield of protection,” explaining she considered herself a part of Harris’s “truth squad” against challenges to the vice president’s credentials and experience.Black female lawmakers also made clear that they expect others to uplift and amplify Harris, too. After more than 40,000 people surprisingly joined a Zoom meeting hosted by the collective Win With Black Women hours after Biden endorsed Harris on Sunday, raising $1.6 million, over 20,000 Black men rallied the following night to tout Harris’s record. Soon enough, Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, organized a virtual meeting calling on White women to show up for Harris.Harris is in a two-week sprint to lock in a running mate in “a search that suddenly elevates the potential political assets — and vulnerabilities — of the Democratic Party’s bench,” our colleagues Patrick Svitek and Tyler Pager report. The process officially got underway Tuesday, and Harris plans to make a decision by Aug. 7.“Harris is considering roughly a dozen potential vice-presidential candidates, though allies say three have risen to the top: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D),” they write. “The allies, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a confidential process, cautioned that the process is in its early stages and that Harris’s aides are still mulling an expansive group of contenders.”House Majority PAC, the super PAC tasked with electing Democrats to the House, has sent an optimistic memo to its donors asking them to “double down” in the final stretch of the election, as Democrats have a “clear path” to winning the majority.The memo, provided to the Early, is the latest outlook for House Democrats since Biden stepped aside and endorsed Harris.It argues that blue states of New York, California and Oregon present opportunities to flip seats. “We will be on offense in territory that is extremely receptive to our candidates and their message,” the memo says.Democrats must net four seats to take the majority.The memo points to New York’s special election last year as a model. In that race, Rep. Tom Suozzi beat the Republican candidate to flip that seat by going on the offense on immigration and painting Republicans as extremists on abortion.“The Democratic message is popular, and when voters are able to hear about it, we win,” the memo says.Republicans, obviously, would disagree. Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told us last week that they’ll pick up seats.""So there’s 35 districts out of 435 that won by five points or less. That’s very few swing seats. So it’s not gonna be a big number, but but I’m confident we’re gonna pick up seats.Must-reads from The Post:A Trump shark’s tale: Whether to be eaten or electrocuted.

Under his ownership, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter has pulled back on policing misinformation, relying instead on the wisdom of the crowd to debunk falsehoods.Musk’s critics say that approach benefits the political right, with which Musk increasingly identifies. Under Twitter’s former management, conservatives often complained that the site was more likely to deem content they shared as misinformation than that from liberals.This week a pair of falsehoods that originated and gained traction on X mostly among left-leaning users provided a reminder that online misinformation can come from anywhere in the political spectrum — and tested Musk’s commitment to letting users decide the truth for themselves.The first one started as an absurdist joke. A pseudonymous X user with a modest following, whose account has since turned private, referred Wednesday to a nonexistent passage in Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance’s memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy,” in which Vance admits to attempting to have sex with a couch. (The post used cruder terms.) The joke spread, gradually at first and then to millions, ultimately reaching many who either didn’t realize or didn’t care that Vance’s book contains no such passage.An online Associated Press post that purported to debunk the claim served more to fan the flames than douse them. On Thursday, the AP retracted its fact check, drawing a fresh round of attention to the bogus post. Pointing out that it would be unfair to mentally associate Vance with couches became a bit like telling someone not to think of an elephant.Crusaders against online misinformation tend to assume that everyone who likes or shares it must believe it. But the Vance episode illustrates a nuance crucial to understanding why even fantastical falsehoods can flourish online: Often, the people circulating them don’t care whether they’re true. They just find them funny or effective as a way to embarrass the other side.A second falsehood that surfaced on Wednesday appears to have been a more classic hoax. Several X users posted screenshots of what they claimed was leaked, internal software code showing that the site had granted certain accounts special permission to post racial slurs. The fake list of accounts included those of Musk, Donald Trump and numerous other conservatives.Both X and Okta, the cloud software company whose services X was supposedly using to whitelist Musk and other users, said the code was not authentic.As of Thursday evening, the dubious story had found no traction in major U.S. media. Yet like the Vance smear, the screenshots were viewed by millions on X, while debunkings were few and far between.One of Musk’s stated aims for X is to bring about a world in which the “legacy media” are supplanted by “citizen journalists” posting directly to his platform. The agenda dovetails with the efforts of Trump, whom Musk has endorsed for president, to discredit what he calls the “fake news media.”Musk has often touted an X feature called Community Notes, which enlists the site’s own users to propose notes that fact-check or add context to a given post, as a swifter and surer source of truth than professional journalism or content moderation. But as the bogus whitelist for racial slurs circulated on Wednesday, it became clear that X was not about to leave this case to the amateurs.Within hours, one of the first accounts that posted it was suspended — a response so rare and heavy-handed that some users took it as a sign the leaks must be real. By Thursday, posts containing the screenshots had been tagged by X with warning labels suggesting that they had violated the site’s policy on manipulated media. The company told The Washington Post it had suspended a few accounts that had shared the images, citing its rules against trying to evade a ban.As of Thursday evening, few — if any — of the most popular X posts circulating either the Vance rumor or the false code leak appeared to have been labeled with Community Notes.In rolling back content moderation at X and throttling links to media websites, Musk has made the site more freewheeling than ever — and more welcoming of hoaxes, baseless claims and conspiracy theories. So far, that trend has been largely welcomed by the right and decried by the left, who continue to be targeted by false claims on the site, including a fresh wave this week aimed at Kamala Harris.But this week’s hoaxes show that liberals too share falsehoods, and conservatives aren’t immune from their consequences.

It was a romantic comedy-drama set in a Scotland on the edge of fantasy, with a headstrong young woman (played by Wendy Hiller, a dead ringer for my mom) trying to reach an island so she can marry a rich industrialist she doesn’t love, while being grounded by weather with a poor Highland laird (Roger Livesey) she does.“I Know Where I’m Going!” (1945) eventually showed up at a Boston revival house in the 1970s, and I gorged on its misty black-and-white imagery, its wit and eccentricity, while experiencing the kind of insight into a parent’s youthful dreams that all children hope for and so rarely get. That was my introduction to the movies of the Archers, a.k.a. Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger — among the most magical feats of celluloid ever to come out of the British Isles.You might have your own Archers origin story; Martin Scorsese certainly does. In the invaluable new documentary “Made in England: The Films of Powell and Pressburger,” presented and narrated by Scorsese from front-row center, he talks about seeing “The Thief of Bagdad” (1940), that Arabian Nights fever dream, on a tiny TV screen in his parents’ Little Italy apartment. The movie’s in riotous color, the TV set was black and white, and still little Marty was pulled into the vortex of its strangeness.Repeated viewings of the Archers’ opera adaptation “The Tales of Hoffmann” (1951) on New York’s “Million Dollar Movie” “taught me pretty much all I know about the relation of camera to music,” Scorsese says in “Made in England.” When he got to the Technicolor maelstroms of “Black Narcissus” (1947) and “The Red Shoes” (1948), a grander alchemy occurred: “I was so bewitched by their films that they took up a big part of my cinema subconscious.”The documentary, from British director David Hinton, allows Scorsese to demonstrate via film clips the lessons he applied from “The Red Shoes” to his own “Raging Bull” (1980) — “it’s dance, and you stay in the ring” — and from the Archers’ wartime epic “The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp” (1943) to Scorsese’s “The Age of Innocence” (1993). (“That’s what attracted me — that emotion is repressed and reserve is a must.”)But “Made in England” is more than a great filmmaker’s genuflection. It’s a welcome introductory immersion for newcomers to Powell and Pressburger and, for old hands, a way to connect the dots of their films and their singular place in the history of cinema. The most well-known director to come from England during the studio era was Alfred Hitchcock, of course, but the Archers rank just below him in inventiveness while outstripping him in sheer emotional intensity and a preference for surrealism and spectacle over commercial notions of “good taste.”They were as mismatched a pair as can be imagined. Powell was a proper British dreamer who worked his way up in the movie industry during the silent era and mastered his craft cranking out “quota quickies” in the 1930s, while Pressburger was a Hungarian Jew who arrived in England ahead of the Nazi wave. They met on the production of “The Spy in Black” (1939), and Powell later confessed, “I have never met a person who not only understood what I was driving at but guessed half of it before I said it.”Pressburger wrote the original scripts, both men worked out the dialogue and Powell handled the directing. “They never argued,” Scorsese says, and “Made in England” shows how the war gave depth and purpose to their work, from the startling concept of 1941’s “49th Parallel” (Nazis on the run in Canada) to the aching heaven-can-wait fantasy of “A Matter of Life and Death” (1946). “Black Narcissus” is an erotic thriller set in a Himalayan nunnery, with a performance by Kathleen Byron that burns itself into the brain of everyone who sees it, and “The Red Shoes” is both the greatest ballet movie ever made and a gorgeously obsessive film about obsession.The Archers’ partnership came undone in the 1950s — they finally argued — and without Pressburger anchoring him to a semblance of propriety, Powell made “Peeping Tom” (1960), a masterfully disturbing work about filmmaking, voyeurism, violence and madness that disgusted the public and destroyed his career. By the time Scorsese sought him out in the 1970s, Powell was living in a trailer in the English countryside. Scorsese helped “Peeping Tom” get rereleased to critical hosannas, introduced Powell to his go-to film editor Thelma Schoonmaker — the two wed in 1984 — and reestablished the Archers to their rightful place in the pantheon of 20th-century moviemakers.Pressburger died in 1988, Powell in 1990, but as long as “The Red Shoes” and “Black Narcissus” still cause jaws to drop and “I Know Where I’m Going!” lodges in people’s hearts, their movies live on. Thank you, Archers, for the films, and thank you, Martin Scorsese and David Hinton, for this reminder to treasure them. And if I may be allowed — thanks, Mom.Unrated. At the AFI Silver.

WaPo_38,Trump’s second-term agenda plans a purge of the federal workforce,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/26/trump-agenda-project-2025-federal-workers-schedule-f/,2024-07-26 18:00:02.884520,,"While Donald Trump’s agenda and a massive think tank document clearly indicate his second-term strategy for federal workers, nothing captures those plans as succinctly as a statement made by his running mate.If Sen. JD Vance (Ohio), the Republican vice-presidential nominee, were to give Trump “one piece of advice,” he said in 2021, it would be “fire every single mid-level bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state. Replace them with our people.”Vance pushed that line on a podcast, when he was running for the Senate, his first elective post. His office did not reply to questions about the statement, but the Trump campaign’s response makes it clear that a purge is the plan. Republicans have long favored hiring more private companies to do government work, but Trump has also taken particular exception to career bureaucrats he blames for blocking his agenda in his first term.“President Trump and Sen. JD Vance will take swift and unprecedented action to protect Americans from the out-of-control Deep State, fire rogue bureaucrats and career politicians, and return power back to the American people,” Karoline Leavitt, the Trump’s campaign national press secretary, said by email. She concluded with a Trump quote from a campaign video: “I will shatter the Deep State, and restore government that is controlled by the People.”Let’s assume Vance’s remarks were the ramblings of a rookie politician, who knew nothing about how the federal government works. That shouldn’t apply, however, to former presidents, including Trump, whose term was marked by repeated attacks on federal workers and particularly the unions representing them.Essentially calling federal employees swamp dwellers and deep state denizens defines Trump’s approach to the workforce. His Agenda47 outlines “my plan to dismantle the deep state and reclaim our democracy from Washington corruption once and for all. … I will immediately reissue my 2020 Executive Order restoring the President’s authority to remove rogue bureaucrats. And I will wield that power very aggressively.”That controversial order, which was never fully implemented by the Trump administration and then was quickly revoked by President Biden, created “Schedule F,” a federal employment category with “an exception to the competitive hiring rules and examinations for career positions.” For workers in that category, the order also eliminated civil service protections, which allow feds due process procedures to appeal terminations and other disciplinary actions.“The merit-based, civil service system appears not to align with the … loyalty viewed as necessary to fulfill a second Trump administration agenda,” Marcus L. Hill, president of the Senior Executives Association, said by email.Without competitive hiring and with increased ability to fire feds faster, administration officials would have more power to stock agencies with political favorites — “our people,” in Vance’s words. Importantly, civil service due process protects not just civil servants, but also the public from government actions unduly influenced by political prejudice. Even as the influential Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 calls for Schedule F to be reinstated, the right-wing think tank acknowledges the workplace protections were “meant to ensure that expert merit rather than partisan favors or personal favoritism ruled within the federal bureaucracy.”Schedule F has drawn harsh criticism from many government experts. To treat the federal workforce “as just another element of a never-ending campaign is a recipe for disaster,” said Terry W. Gerton, president and CEO of the National Academy of Public Administration, said in an email. “The federal workforce serves the people, not the president, and takes an oath to support and defend the Constitution. Asking them to do otherwise weakens the foundations of more than 200 years of democracy.”Agenda47 also would “require every federal employee to pass a new Civil Service test demonstrating an understanding of our Constitutional limited government,” even as Trump seeks increased executive power. He also would relocate agencies “immediately out of Washington to places filled with patriots who love America,” despite the fact that about 85 percent of feds already are outside of the D.C. region. After Trump moved Bureau of Land Management offices to Colorado during his first term, a decision which Biden reversed, the Government Accountability Office found the relocation led to staffing shortages, drove away experienced staffers and slashed diversity.Three 2018 Trump executive orders gutted federal labor organizations’ ability to represent not just their members, but all the employees in a bargaining unit covered by a union contract. President Biden quickly revoked those directives when he took office. Trump’s agenda section on his dismantling of the deep state doesn’t specifically mention the orders, but Project 2025 declared they “should be reinstated by the next Administration.”That thought leaves labor leaders like Randy L. Erwin shuddering. “Trump signed three executive orders that collectively wrecked labor-relations in the federal sector,” said the president of the National Federation of Federal Employees. “It is scary to think what a second Trump Administration would attempt do to inflict pain on federal employees and their unions. … Trump didn’t have his act together to wreak havoc last time around. He’s got his plan ready this time. It’s called Project 2025.”Two unions that rated Vance on his legislative record gave him abysmal ratings: 29 percent by the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) and 13 percent by the American Federation of Government Employees.Although Trump has distanced himself from Project 2025, it is led by director Paul Dans, an Office of Personnel Management chief of staff under Trump. Spencer Chretien, a Project 2025 associate director, was a Trump White House associate director of presidential personnel. Furthermore, the initiative’s chapter related to the federal workforce was co-authored by Dans and advocates for federal workforce policies that have been vigorously pushed by Trump and Republicans generally for years.“Contractors are less expensive,” Project 2025 says, echoing a familiar Republican argument for reducing the federal workforce, “because they are not entitled to high government pensions or benefits and are easier to fire and discipline.”Defending government workers, while harshly criticizing “the plot to demonize their service,” NTEU President Doreen Greenwald summed up Trump’s and Heritage’s workforce plans by saying “never in NTEU’s history have federal employees been the target of such a coordinated attack on their integrity, their qualifications, their patriotism and their dedication. … These extremists try to politicize the civil service for their own political gain.”"
WaPo_39,Who’s most likely to adopt — or get adopted,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/26/adoption-demographics-america/,2024-07-26 18:00:02.884520,,"You’ve sent in so many adoption questions that we had two choices: re-christen ourselves the Department of Adoption for the foreseeable future, or don our querying cap, crack each of our knuckles in order and answer as many as we could in one go.We decided to get cracking. Here goes.We suspect reader Ryan Hanlon might have an ulterior motive for asking this, given that his LinkedIn lists him as president and CEO of the National Council for Adoption.The answer: While adoption may have been more common in the tough-to-measure past, it’s surprisingly rare today.Depending on the source, adopted children seem to make up 1 to 3 percent of America’s under-18 population. It’s the fifth most common relationship between a child and a head of household, narrowly ahead of foster care, according to the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) from 2008 to 2022. The vast majority of kids are the biological children (88 percent) or grandchildren (8 percent) of the householder.While the ACS provides stellar big-picture numbers, it’s hamstrung by its focus on a child’s relationship to a single head of household, regardless of the presence of their parent or parents. To map relationships further, we turned to the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey (CPS). Unlike many of its rivals, the CPS lists both parents for every child.About 1.2 percent of U.S. children are adopted, though that’s just kids who are living only with  to an adoptive single parent or, more commonly, two adoptive parents. Another 0.5 percent live with one adoptive parent and one biological or stepparent. We assume those adoptions were made by folks who, after marriage or cohabitation, wanted to make the parent-child relationship official.This measure, at least, shows adoption is so rare that it’s about as  common to live with  only stepparents, a situation faced by 1.4 percent of children, roughly evenly split between those who have a single stepparent and those who have two stepparents, presumably because of family upheavals.Meanwhile, 63 percent of children live with two biological parents and 25 percent live with a biological single parent.In the case of stepparents, the answer seems obvious. The rest usually rely on foster care or private agencies.There were 368,530 children in foster care in as of September 2022, according to the Children’s Bureau at the Department of Health and Human Services. Of those, 108,877 were waiting to be adopted. That year, 53,665 children were adopted with public agency involvement, typically meaning they came from the foster care system.We don’t yet have estimates for 2022 adoptions outside of the foster system. With no national source (yet), folks have to cobble together the data from state and county records as it dribbles out. But Hanlon estimates that there were about 50,000 domestic private adoptions in 2019 and a pandemic-reduced 40,000 in 2020. In both years, about half of those adoptions involved stepparents.Another 1,275 children were adopted from abroad in the year ending in September 2023, according to the State Department.You may remember reader Kevin Foster from his peerless paper-check data. Well, Foster was moseying home from a Massachusetts grocery store one day when he overheard someone say, “Well, I’m adopted, so it’s okay.” No other context, but it got him thinking: What demographic groups are most likely to adopt?It turns out gay married men with kids are12 times more likely to have adopted at least one of them than their straight married counterparts, according to the ACS. Women in same-sex marriages are over eight times more likely to adopt.Paradoxically, as we’ll see later, the states with the fewest same-sex couples often adopt at the highest rates. That’s because same-sex couples, even today, only lead 1.6 percent of U.S. households, and a large majority of such households don’t include children. So even with sky-high adoption rates among same-sex couples with children, such couples only account for about 3.6 percent of adoptive families — usually not enough to move the needle.Instead, national trends seem to be driven by race, particularly by high adoption rates among America’s White majority — only Native Americans have higher adoption rates. Adoption is also more popular among rural Americans and veterans.Older couples with children are also more likely to have adopted. We assume that, as with same-sex couples, they’re choosing adoption due to biological factors as much as cultural ones.West Virginia! It also had the fastest-rising adoption rate in the country between 2008 and 2022, according to the ACS. Based on your questions, we’re guessing some of you might point to the state’s abortion rate as an explanation — it was the fourth lowest in the country in 2019 and 2020 according to the Guttmacher Institute.Beyond that Appalachian enclave, we saw a correlation between higher abortion rates and lower adoption rates, but it wasn’t entirely consistent. The states with the second and third highest adoption rates, Montana and Alaska, both protect abortion in their state constitutions according their courts and to KFF. They are, however, two of the states with the largest concentrations of Native Americans.These demographic trends appear to drive most adoption trends. In addition to race, immigration — or lack thereof — seems to play a starring role. Native-born Americans are about twice as likely to adopt, and West Virginia has the lowest immigrant concentration of any state. Three of the states with the lowest adoption rates — California, New York and New Jersey — also have the most immigrants, even after adjusting for population size.We had no answers until Angelique Day, associate professor at the University of Washington’s School of Social Work and faculty affiliate at the Indigenous Wellness Research Institute, stepped in and did all our work for us. She confirmed her theories with a colleague, then called to walk us through an elegant explanation.Native Americans are much more likely to be in the foster care system than their peers, ACS data shows. But while other marginalized groups with high foster care populations, notably African Americans, often get adopted by White families, many Native American children get placed with Native families thanks to the Indian Child Welfare Act.Passed in 1978 to help counteract the horrific legacy of a system that removed a third of Native children from their homes, the act allows tribes to participate in adoption cases involving their citizens and prioritizes placing the child with relatives or members of the tribe.Day encouraged us to think of Native American adoptions as similar to international adoptions, in which the rules are set by agreements between two governments — because that’s really what agreements between tribes and the feds are. This relationship has helped the large Native population in foster care translate into many adoptions by Native American families in a way that’s not possible for non-tribal communities.The inverse relationship between immigration and adoption has, of course, one glaring exception: the adoptees themselves. Adoptees are about twice as likely to come from abroad as biological children, though that’s changing as international adoptions plummet.State Department data shows international adoptions peaked in 2004 at 22,987 and have fallen more than 94 percent since then. In 2023, a year when 3,591,328 children were born in America, a record low of just 1,275 were adopted from abroad. Over that time, the flow of adoptees from China has fallen from 7,038 to 16, according to the State Department.It’s not that Americans have lost interest in adopting from abroad or even just that geopolitics have changed, Hanlon told us. Instead, he ties plunging adoption rates to an international agreement to standardize adoptions that took effect in 2008. Meant to limit sketchy adoptions and human trafficking, it has instead raised costs and wait times to the point where many parents don’t dare begin the process.“There’s still plenty of children who need and would greatly benefit from intercountry adoption, and there’s plenty of U.S. families that are open to adoption,” Hanlon said. But “we’ve put up a lot of red tape.”A spokesperson for the State Department, which now oversees overseas adoptions, pointed out that such adoptions started their decline before the international agreement. Political changes, better living standards and other social and economic factors have reduced the number of children globally in need of adoption, the spokesperson said.Beth Herman in Colorado was one of several readers who asked about transracial adoptions. From 2020 to 2022, more than a third of adopted children came from a different racial background than their head of household. That’s more than three times the rate for biological children, and substantially higher than the rates for grandchildren or stepchildren.Put another way, most adoptions aren’t transracial. But only because 92 percent of White kids get adopted by White families, by far the highest in-group adoption rate. If you leave them out, the majority of non-White kids (56 percent) are adopted by parents of another race, and by “another race” we usually mean White.Most notably, White people have adopted 2 out of 3 Asian adoptees in America. Most Black and Hispanic adoptees are adopted by Black and Hispanic parents, but in both cases, it’s a narrow majority (54 and 51 percent respectively) with White families close behind.Herman tacked on a twist to the transracial adoption question: Do adoptees identify with the race of their adopted parents?Adoptees almost always identify with their birth group, at least according to whoever took the time to fill out the Census Bureau’s exhaustive survey (we have no way of measuring how the child would have described themselves). For example, 98 percent of adoptees born in China are listed as Asian, a decent match for the 98 percent of China-born American adults who identify as Asian.The only consistent exceptions, albeit minor ones, involve children from Hispanic countries. For example, 99 percent of Mexico-born adults in the United States describe themselves as Hispanic, compared with 95 percent of Mexico-born adopted children. Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and the Dominican Republican show similar patterns.That makes sense. Hispanic ethnicity has long been a cultural designation rather than a racial one, though the lines could blur under upcoming Census Bureau policy changes. If an adoptee has been removed from that cultural context, it makes less sense to apply the designation.Our friends at the Pew Research Center have seen the same trend among Americans descended from folks who hailed from Hispanic countries: Almost all first-generation immigrants identify as Hispanic, but their children and grandchildren are less likely to do so.We don’t have enough data quite yet. We do not see adoptions of younger children rising in the states with abortion bans based on the CPS, but a better picture will emerge as more detailed data is released and our friends in academia start cracking their knuckles, too.Greetings!

WaPo_40,"Va. health staff failed Irvo Otieno as he suffocated, experts say",https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2024/07/26/irvo-otieno-medical-response/,2024-07-26 18:00:02.884520,,"Virginia authorities moved quickly to investigate after Irvo Otieno, a 28-year-old Black man, was suffocated on the floor of a state psychiatric hospital in March 2023. By the following week, seven officers and three hospital orderlies who piled on him had been charged with second-degree murder, and that same month, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) promised an “aggressive transformation” of the behavioral health-care system that experts say failed Otieno.But a year later, the criminal case has fractured, and little public scrutiny has been given to the actions of the clinical staff, including doctors and nurses, at Virginia’s Central State Hospital in Dinwiddie County, where Otieno died. No clinical staff members at the psychiatric facility have been charged; the orderlies were “special management technicians,” a position that focuses on security and requires no medical training beyond knowledge of CPR, according to a job listing. Meanwhile, an investigation into potential abuse and neglect related to Otieno’s care is on hold pending the results of the criminal case, which now involves just two officers and an orderly facing downgraded charges of involuntary manslaughter.A new analysis by The Washington Post of nearly two hours of surveillance footage inside and outside the hospital, along with interviews with 10 medical and use-of-force experts, identifies serious shortcomings in Otieno’s care by clinical personnel as officers and hospital workers pinned him down for more than 11 minutes. Staffers failed to monitor Otieno’s condition, nor did they attempt to safeguard his life as he was suffocated, according to medical experts and video footage. After Otieno appeared limp, a nurse did not check for signs of life but injected him with a sedating mix of drugs that were later listed in court filings, according to video and experts, who described the action as medically unsound. When staff eventually attempted CPR, experts said, they performed it incorrectly.“I’ve admitted many, many patients within a setting that looks just like this,” Jhilam Biswas, director of the Psychiatry, Law and Society Program at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, said after reviewing surveillance footage for The Post. “But I’ve never seen that.”Experts say the stalled state behavioral health investigation — known as a DI-201 — is inadequate because of the magnitude of the mistakes. And while Virginia has moved forward with a series of behavior health initiatives — including passing a law named for Otieno that grants relatives improved access to loved ones facing mental health crises — officials have not offered an accounting of the actions of the medical staff at Central State that preceded Otieno’s death.“There absolutely should have been a review other than the stalled 201 investigation,” wrote Jack Barber, who served as interim commissioner of the state’s department of behavioral health from 2015 to 2018 and previously was director of Western State Hospital in Staunton, Va. “This is too tragic an event to not examine thoroughly and make changes to prevent it ever happening again. If that has not happened (especially now a year later) it is a serious problem and, to me, would be unacceptable.”Both Central State and the agency that oversees it, the Virginia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services, declined to comment on The Post’s findings or to answer specific questions about whether clinical staff members were fired or faced any other repercussions while legal proceedings are still pending.“DBHDS and Central State Hospital have fully cooperated with the Virginia State Police in this investigation and will respect the legal process while staff continue to care for the patients at the hospital,” said Lauren Cunningham, a spokesperson for the department.Police detained Otieno — an aspiring musician whom family described as sensitive and caring — on March 3, 2023, for a mental health evaluation after a call that day about a suspected burglary. They took him to a Richmond-area hospital, and he was arrested there and transferred to the Henrico County Jail after he allegedly assaulted officers. On March 6, sheriff’s deputies took Otieno to Central State Hospital, where he was declared dead less than an hour and a half after entering.For decades, Virginia has struggled to care for and house its mentally ill residents, among them patients who have died waiting for hospital admission. A state oversight report from December found that overcrowding at Virginia’s public psychiatric hospitals, which include Central State, created unsafe conditions for patients and workers. Underpaid staff have left, creating shortages and deteriorating the quality of care for patients, the report found.After Otieno’s death, an investigation by the Virginia Department of Health into the events at Parham Doctors’ Hospital, where Otieno was originally taken, found that staff did not provide stabilizing care for the 28-year-old, who never saw a psychiatrist there. In response, the hospital said it had submitted an action plan to address the problems.“Virginia’s mental health system failed him from the moment he went into crisis,” said Colleen Miller, who is executive director of the disAbility Law Center of Virginia and has reviewed hospital records on the case.Otieno’s family said his condition deteriorated when he was locked up for a weekend at the Henrico County Jail without access to medication. The following Monday, footage showed deputies at the jail violently struggling with Otieno as they removed him from his cell for transfer to Central State Hospital.Staff at Central State appeared unprepared to admit Otieno once he arrived, said C.T. Woody, a former Richmond sheriff who took patients to the hospital over more than three decades on the city’s police force. After waiting outside for more than 15 minutes, video shows, deputies pulled Otieno from a vehicle and dragged him, handcuffed and shackled, into the hospital, down a hallway and into an admissions room as orderlies trailed behind.No one from the hospital but the orderlies appeared to initially approach Otieno once he was in the room.Central State and behavioral health department officials declined to say who at the hospital oversaw Otieno’s admission.“I think emergency people should have taken over as soon as the officers got him inside,” said Woody, who reviewed the surveillance footage.In the admissions room, the video shows that two deputies pushed Otieno to the floor and leaned his upper body against a large chair. Shortly afterward, a third deputy held down lower on his body, then a fourth pushed on his legs.Virginia State Police said in a statement after Otieno’s death that it was reported he had become combative during the intake process. But several experts consulted by The Post noted that Otieno offered little visible resistance as he was taken into the hospital.“Otieno was handcuffed and shackled and presented no present threat to the sheriff’s deputies and hospital staff,” said Philip Stinson, a professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green University who reviewed the footage at The Post’s request.After Otieno appeared to briefly move, the video shows that deputies and orderlies piled on him and that, for more than 11 minutes, as many as 10 people tried to restrain him. Otieno could be seen at times facing the floor as deputies and orderlies held him down. Central State policy at the time prohibited restraint of a person facing the floor, linking it to the risk of sudden death. The technique has been cited as a contributing factor in high-profile deaths at the hands of law enforcement, including George Floyd’s.Trained clinical staff should have intervened once Otieno was on the ground and substantial weight was being applied, especially to vital parts of his upper body, said Jeffrey Metzner, a professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of Colorado. That training should have included how to recognize whether someone was at risk for positional asphyxia, he said.According to a statement that lawyers for the Otieno family released May 30, after a Virginia prosecutor reduced charges against the three remaining defendants in the case, a witness said that “defendants were directed by staff more than once to place” him on his side. But surveillance video from the hospital has no sound and deputies did not wear body cameras, leaving it unclear when this allegedly took place or what else was communicated in the room.Video shows clinical staff passing in and out of the room without visibly intervening. The hospital personnel consistently nearest to Otieno were orderlies involved in the restraint.One hospital staffer entered the room several times holding restraint devices used by the hospital, which others attempted to place on his legs.But clinical staff did not appear to assess his condition before the attempts, the video shows. Hospital policy says restraints should not be applied before an assessment, according to documents obtained by The Post via a Freedom of Information Act request.Employees at Virginia public psychiatric hospitals told the state oversight body that reviewed facilities and issued the December report that they were not sufficiently trained in employing restraints in response to “patient aggression.”At 4:39 p.m., 11 minutes after deputies piled on Otieno, one of the officers seemed to register that something was wrong. In the video, a deputy appeared to jostle Otieno’s head and attempt a pulse reading. Otieno remained limp. Hospital staff still did not appear to check his vitals.A patient suffering from asphyxiation is in need of rapid medical intervention, experts said. Hospital policy requires staff to start lifesaving measures in such instances.“Once Otieno becomes nonresponsive, there should have been an immediate attempt to assess his responsiveness,” said Utsha Khatri, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. “If he does not respond to verbal or physical stimuli, a pulse should be checked and breathing should be assessed immediately. If no pulse is felt within five to 10 seconds, chest compressions should be started.”None of that took place as soon as it should have, she said.As a deputy continued searching for a pulse on Otieno’s neck, others rolled his limp body onto its back. For the first time, a hospital staffer stepped over and appeared to attempt a pulse reading.“The one thing that could have saved his life in my opinion is if the medical staff had tried to intervene to either access and assess the patient or warn the deputies about the possibility of restraint asphyxia,” said Peter Canning, a paramedic and EMS coordinator at UConn John Dempsey Hospital.Attorneys for some of those involved in handling Otieno have asserted that their clients had minimal physical contact and were positioned in such a way that it would have been hard to observe Otieno’s breathing.Surveillance footage shows that a nurse entered the admissions room and administered two injections to a motionless Otieno at 4:40 p.m., according to the video time stamp — at least a minute and a half after deputies first appeared to sense something was wrong. The nurse did not appear to check for vitals. At least a dozen other hospital staff members, some in scrubs, looked on.In court filings, prosecutors identified the drugs as olanzapine, an antipsychotic medicine, and diphenhydramine, a commonly administered antihistamine.Four medical experts consulted by The Post said Otieno appeared to be unresponsive at that time — and may have been unconscious for minutes. They said the drugs should not have been administered because of that.“If the patient is unresponsive, sedatives can have adverse effects,” said Biswas, the director from Brigham and Women’s Hospital.The state behavioral health department declined to comment on drugs that were administered to Otieno.In March 2023, then-Dinwiddie Commonwealth Attorney Ann Baskervill claimed at a hearing that the drugs injected into Otieno “didn’t have a chance to even go through his veins, because his heart wasn’t pumping at the time that it was given because he died of asphyxia, which shut down all of his organs.” The office of Virginia’s chief medical examiner declined to comment on that assertion. Baskervill stepped down from her position in June 2023, and a new prosecutor has since taken over the case.Hospital staff began chest compressions at 4:42 p.m. — at least three minutes after the deputy appeared to check for a pulse.Otieno was still handcuffed when hospital workers began compressions, which they did from a standing position. According to the American Red Cross and the experts consulted by The Post, a person should kneel to give chest compressions.“You can’t be effective that way, and there was no reason for the person not to get in the proper position to start chest compressions,” said Bill Toon, a retired paramedic and former EMS training manager for Loudoun County, Va.Initial attempts to ventilate Otieno using a bag valve mask began at 4:44 p.m., five minutes after a deputy first appeared to check his pulse.A minute later, staff tried using a defibrillator machine, then returned to chest compressions and continued doing those for about 25 minutes while waiting for an ambulance to arrive.It’s unclear exactly what was happening in the video when Central State called 911. A behavioral health department spokeswoman acknowledged that the time stamps on surveillance video in the admissions room are out of sync with other cameras by about two minutes.The department of behavioral health said the hospital did not have an emergency department. Barber, the agency’s former interim commissioner, said the hospital historically would not have employed an emergency physician. Clinical staff, he said, were typically not trained in advanced life-support measures and would rely on emergency services to respond to a patient in Otieno’s condition.Dinwiddie County Fire & EMS records show that it received a 911 call from the hospital at 4:40 p.m. requesting an ambulance for a patient who wasn’t breathing, then another at 4:48 p.m. and a third at 5:02 p.m. “This is just totally unacceptable, and y’all know it, too,” a caller from the hospital said about the wait. “Totally unacceptable.”According to the surveillance video, paramedics arrived in the admissions room at 5:08 p.m. and seven minutes later began to insert a breathing tube. They worked to revive him for another 25 minutes — but it was fruitless. At 5:48 p.m., they covered Otieno’s body with a white sheet.“This is delayed, and earlier intubation could have potentially made a difference,” said Khatri, the Mount Sinai physician.The state legislature tasks Virginia’s inspector general with investigating complaints about public psychiatric facilities like Central State, but an oversight report said the office reviewed less than 20 percent of the more than 600 complaints received in the last fiscal year. A spokesperson for the inspector general’s office declined to comment on whether it is investigating Otieno’s case. A spokesperson for Youngkin’s office said the only inquiry into the conduct of Central State staff is the halted abuse-and-neglect inquiry.Miller, of the disAbility Law Center, said state policy allows the director of psychiatric facilities to suspend investigations pending criminal charges.“If they make that decision to resume the investigation later, all that information is stale and unreliable,” she said.In September, the commonwealth and Henrico County and its sheriff’s office paid Otieno’s relatives $8.5 million to settle a wrongful-death lawsuit, but did not admit wrongdoing.Those still charged criminally in the case — orderly Wavie Jones and sheriff’s deputies Kaiyell Sanders and Brandon Rodgers — have pleaded not guilty, and their trials are scheduled to begin in September. Edward Riley, an attorney for Sanders, said in a statement that “Kaiyell did nothing wrong and he remains ready to defend himself against this allegation.”“Kaiyell, working with the other deputies, were doing their jobs,” the statement said. “They were tasked with getting the inmate to Central State where he could get the help needed to address his severe mental health issues. There was no desire or intent to hurt him.”An attorney for Jones declined to comment, and an attorney for Rodgers did not return messages. The prosecutor has said the cases were dropped against the others because she inherited the case and was unable to change her office’s trial strategy by the time she took over.Mark Krudys, a lawyer for Otieno’s family, said the criminal cases should not sidetrack any other investigations.Barber recommended that Central State conduct a wide-ranging review of Otieno’s death, “to identify changes to prevent it ever happening again,” he said. “This is not simply the right thing to do, but a debt we owe the deceased and his family.”Salvador Rizzo contributed to this report.

WaPo_41,From ‘sunny ways’ to cloudy days: Canadians have tired of Justin Trudeau,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/26/canada-justin-trudeau-polls-poilievre/,2024-07-26 18:00:02.884520,,"TORONTO — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rose to power in 2015 — and rescued the Liberal Party from irrelevance — on promises to bring “real change” and infuse Canadian politics with “sunny ways.”Nearly nine years later, the forecast for the progressive icon is cloudy. His party, which has been slumping in the polls for more than a year, now trails the Conservatives by as many as 20 points and is vulnerable not only in key battlegrounds but also in traditional strongholds.The most recent blow was a special election loss last month to the Conservatives in Toronto-St. Paul’s, a district that the Liberals had won (often, easily) since 1993. It was as if the Democrats had lost a special election in Manhattan, or the Republicans had fallen in Colorado Springs.Now Canadians are watching to see if Trudeau might be planning his own “walk in the snow,” a repeat of the solitary stroll that his father, Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, claimed to have taken in an Ottawa blizzard the day before he announced his resignation in 1984.In a much lower-key version of Democratic pressure on President Biden to drop out of the U.S. presidential race, several high-profile Liberals, including his former environment minister Catherine McKenna and Christy Clark, a Liberal former premier of British Columbia, have called on him to step aside to give the party a better chance of staying in government.Trudeau, 52, has given no indication that he plans to step down — and it’s unclear any of the alternatives would have more success turning things around. By law, the next federal election must be held by Oct. 20, 2025.“I want to be clear that I hear people’s concerns and frustrations,” Trudeau said after the by-election. “These are not easy times, and it’s clear that I and my entire Liberal team have much more work to do to deliver tangible, real progress that Canadians across the country see and feel.”Trudeau’s woes echo those of many incumbent leaders, who are struggling amid high inflation and concerns about affordability, particularly in housing. Most housing markets in Canada are at or near worst-ever affordability levels, the Royal Bank of Canada reported in December.“The prime minister and his government haven’t been able to respond to those concerns,” said David Coletto, chair of pollster Abacus Data. “As Canadians reflect on the state of the country, the state of the world, I think the conclusion increasingly gets to a point where they just want change.”Trudeau has won three federal elections. He has been in power for nine years — and accumulated nine years’ worth of miscalculations and other baggage: Ethics scandals, photos of him as a younger man in blackface, controversies over trips abroad and vacations at home, struggles to balance growing Canada’s economy with climate action. It’s been more than a century since a Canadian prime minister won four elections in a row.“A lot of people are talking about St. Paul’s being a bit of a wake-up call, but it really shouldn’t be surprising,” said Dan Arnold, Trudeau’s former head of research and advertising. “If it’s a wake-up call, it’s an 11 a.m. wake-up call, because there were many warning signs beforehand.”It’s not just political missteps that have cost the Liberals, analysts say, but the rise of Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, a populist firebrand who has emerged as the most formidable political opponent Trudeau has faced.The 45-year-old has taken control of the party trafficking in grievance politics, railing against public health mandates and championing the trucker convoy that shut down U.S.-Canada border crossings in 2022 and brought Ottawa to a standstill for several weeks.“Canada is broken,” said Poilievre, a member of parliament for two decades. He’ll fix it, he said, with a plan to “ax the [carbon] tax, build the homes, fix the budget, stop the crime.”He has focused his message on hammering the government for high interest rates, stubborn inflation and the historically high housing costs and shortages that have left many millennial voters — a key part of the coalition that brought Trudeau to power — disillusioned.“He hasn’t offered a lot of compelling policy alternatives,” said Lisa Young, a political scientist at the University of Calgary. “But he’s seen as being much more effective on the issue just because he was the one who was naming it before the Trudeau government started trying to respond.”Under Poilievre, the Conservative Party has smashed fundraising records — and worked to soften his image. An advertising campaign last year included a spot narrated by his wife, a Venezuelan immigrant, with video of the pair playing with their children.The Liberals, meanwhile, have been slow to respond. They have tried to cast him as Donald Trump-lite — the former president is deeply unpopular here — but there’s little evidence it’s having much effect.“I think the Liberals might have missed their opportunity to define him as dangerous or outside the … the boundaries of what’s acceptable in Canadian politics,” Young told The Washington Post.Trudeau has tried to reverse his slide. Last summer, he overhauled his cabinet in an effort to inject “new energy” into the government. He brought a marketer with a self-described focus on “understanding Millennials and Generation Z” to his team.He walked back part of the carbon tax, one of his signature policies, in what analysts said was a bid to shore up support in Atlantic Canada — angering not just his own environment minister, but also officials elsewhere who wanted carve outs of their own.He spent weeks on a cross-country tour to preview a budget aimed at “generational fairness,” breaking with a tradition of keeping budget details secret until the document is introduced in Parliament.None of it has helped.“I think they’re at a stage where it really doesn’t matter what they do or what they say,” said pollster Shachi Kurl, president of the Angus Reid Institute. “I hate to use this phrase, but it’s like they ‘jumped the shark.’ Nobody is listening.”The problem, Coletto said, is that “if the person delivering the message is the prime minister, people won’t listen to it.”Unlike the Democrats’ pressure campaign on Biden, Liberal lawmakers here have kept whatever angst they might feel about Trudeau private. One member of his caucus has urged him to step down, but there hasn’t been a full revolt — yet.That’s in part because there’s no clear successor to rally around, or compelling evidence that the people whose names are tossed around as possible replacements — Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland or Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly, to name two — would reverse the party’s fortunes.“[The Liberals] are very much perceived as, I think correctly, the party of Justin Trudeau,” Young said. “It’s really difficult to imagine someone else coming along and being able to redefine the party and the government in a meaningful way in the time that they have left before the next election.”When Trudeau became the Liberal leader in 2013, the party was a husk of the juggernaut that had so dominated Canadian politics that it was called the country’s natural governing party. It had been banished to the political wilderness; books proclaimed its death.The Liberals began the 2015 federal election trailing not only the governing Conservatives but also the New Democrats. Opponents bought ads dismissing Trudeau as “just not ready.” But the youthful and charismatic leader defied expectations. The Liberals entered the campaign with 36 of Parliament’s 338 seats. It finished with 184.“Many members of caucus see themselves as having been elected on Trudeau’s coattails,” Young said, “and they perhaps don’t see themselves as having much influence that they can bring to bear on this.”Analysts and members of Trudeau’s inner circle say the amateur boxer is accustomed to being underestimated, and he performs well when he’s on the ropes. The question is whether there’s time enough to reverse his party’s fortunes.“The desire of voters wanting change in the current environment is not limited to Canada,” said Arnold, chief strategy officer of the public opinion firm Pollara. “I feel like we’re in this post-covid funk across the Western world where people are just really frustrated with their quality of life …“Voters are just looking for change and they don’t really care if it’s left wing or right wing or someone with 34 convictions.”"
WaPo_42,‘Armor bearers:’ Black women in Congress mobilize to boost Harris,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/26/black-lawmakers-women-kamala-harris-congress-cbc/,2024-07-26 18:00:02.884520,,"When then-Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) called Rep. Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla.) in January 2019 to tell her she planned to run for president, the veteran Florida lawmaker with a penchant for festive headgear started screaming with excitement before Harris could  finish her sentence.But as soon as Wilson hung up, another call came in — this time, from Joe Biden. When Wilson didn’t pick up — “I knew what he was going to ask,” the congresswoman explained — Biden then texted her.“I’m so sorry,” Wilson, sporting a hot pink pantsuit and bedazzled cowboy hat this week on Capitol Hill, recalled texting Biden back at the time. “I love you. You know that, but I have pledged my support to my sorority sister and friend Kamala Harris, and maybe one day, you, too.”Five years later, Biden did just that — endorsing Harris, now his vice president, to succeed him — after dramatically announcing Sunday that he wouldn’t run for reelection in November. And so have most of the 30 Black women in Congress, who now stand as something of a national firewall for her candidacy with Harris poised to become the first Black woman to lead a major party ticket and competing to become the country’s first Black female president.Over a dozen Black female lawmakers who spoke with The Washington Post, several of whom have heard from Harris directly since Biden’s decision to exit the race,  described a fierce and personal commitment to an intense three-month sprint to organize and mobilize voters on behalf of Harris’s campaign. They are in both a celebratory and get-down-to-business mood, sporting pink and green — the colors of Alpha Kappa Alpha, Harris’s college sorority — in the Capitol halls; privately pressing holdout colleagues to endorse Harris, and preparing to hit the trail and speak out against the racist and sexist attacks they, too, have been the target of.Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ga.) referred to Black women in Congress as Harris’s “armor bearers.” And Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) described her congressional sorority as a “shield of protection,” explaining she considered herself a part of Harris’s “truth squad” against challenges to the vice president’s credentials and experience.“As a Black woman, especially, I know what she’s going to have to deal with,” said Lee. “And we’re communicating that to everyone.”Sen. Laphonza Butler (D-Calif.), the former president of Emily’s List, said this isn’t Harris’s “first rodeo” and underscored the sexist and racist treatment Black women encounter on a daily basis. But she described the role of Harris’s cohort of supporters at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue as a regenerative force, ready to deflect the anticipated mudslinging and propel her forward.“Black women know that our first task is to make sure that we are the hands at her back, knowing and giving her the energy to continue to walk through every name that she is going to be called, every derogatory comment that is going to be said, every sexual and sexist innuendo that is going to be made,” Butler said. “We are the hands in her spine, helping her to continue walking because the destination of a country that offers a vision for future generations is worth every bit of the journey.”If Harris succeeds in ascending to the presidency, Black women will be a big part of why. In 2020, exit polls showed 90 percent of Black women voted for Biden, by far the highest of any one group of voters. In this year’s race, they are expected to once again play a pivotal role in key swing states.At the Congressional Black Caucus’s news conference formally endorsing Harris  on Tuesday, lawmakers were visibly emotional as they thanked Biden for what they described as the most transformational administration in American history — and for tapping two Black women for high-profile jobs: Harris and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.Rep. Robin Kelly’s (D-Ill.) eyes welled up with tears as her colleagues expressed their gratitude, touted the accomplishments of the Biden-Harris administration and trumpeted Harris’s qualifications.“I’m heartbroken for him,” said Kelly, acknowledging  there was not unanimity among House and Black Democrats over whether Biden should step aside. “But there’s that sense, of course, of a lot of pride that a woman of color” could be the next president of the United States, Kelly added. “But push all that aside, a qualified, brilliant woman, too. I don’t want that to be lost. There’s a lot of firsts, but she’s qualified.”Some of the intraparty disagreement over Biden’s potential exit from the race extended beyond loyalty to Biden, and into concern for Harris’s future. Just two weeks earlier, Rep. Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.) stood up before her colleagues during an all-caucus meeting to argue that putting the vice president atop the ticket at this point in the election cycle would be setting Harris up for failure, according to two people familiar with the discussion.Those fears, however, quickly dissipated as Harris rolled out her campaign, electrifying some voters in a way that has drawn frequent comparisons by Democratic lawmakers to former president Barack Obama’s historic 2008 campaign. During the CBC news conference, members made the case for Harris, ticking off her accomplishments in a bid to counter GOP attacks that Harris is unqualified to serve.“She is ready, prepared, experienced, and a global leader as I said earlier — and people forget that,” said Lee, who was the first Hill lawmaker to endorse Harris for president in 2019. “There’s some that try to challenge her on all sorts of credentials. We say nuh-uh. She’s ready.”They’re also looking for tangible ways they can help the campaign.Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio) — who was the first person to visit Harris in her ceremonial office as vice president — said she had already spoken with Harris campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon. And freshman Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Tex.), clad in an ombre pink pantsuit on Tuesday despite being a member of a rival sorority, said that Harris surprised her with a call Sunday to thank Crockett for her work on the campaign so far.“I was kind of thrown off that she called me on the big day — of all people,” said Crockett. “I’m not a caucus chair. I’m not capable of raising tons and tons of money. But it speaks to how much she thinks of individuals and the fact that she called a freshman — I’m sure there are plenty of people that would have never thought to call me, but she did.”Black female lawmakers are also bracing for what they believe will be a pitched fight against racist and sexist attacks on Harris, the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India. Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) said in an interview Sunday that Democrats felt they needed to support Harris “because of her ethnic background,” after conceding it would be “more difficult to beat somebody who is not Joe Biden.” Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) referred to Harris as a “DEI hire” in an interview on Monday, using the initials for diversity, equity and inclusion programs. And an old clip of JD Vance attacking Harris for being “childless” quickly resurfaced.House Republican leaders, including Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), warned lawmakers this week to avoid attacking Harris on her identity and instead focus on her policy record.Black female lawmakers also made clear that they expected others to uplift and amplify Harris, too. After more than 40,000 people surprisingly joined a Zoom meeting hosted by the collective Win With Black Women hours after Biden endorsed Harris on Sunday, raising $1.6 million, over 20,000 Black men rallied the following night to tout Harris’s record. Soon enough, Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, organized a virtual meeting calling on White women to show up for Harris.“It is not just the responsibility of the Black community to defend this woman. ... We have a collective responsibility to tell allies to step up and fight for her because she’s fighting for all of us,” said Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-Calif.).Privately, some Democratic lawmakers — including Black Democrats — have expressed concerns about whether the country is ready for a Black woman president, invoking Hillary Clinton’s failed 2016 bid against Donald Trump. Those concerns grated on other members who have faced questions about their viability in their own races.The doubts have persisted, despite hurdles overcome by Black women who came before them, Beatty noted, naming Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman to be elected to the U.S. Congress; and Fannie Lou Hamer, a Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee community organizer who co-founded the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.“I hate when people say, are we ready?” said Beatty, arguing that while there was obviously more progress to be made, Black women throughout U.S. history have consistently cleared hurdles. “We have a hurdle, we jump over it — and I think this is another hurdle that we will jump over.”After recounting her text to Biden five years ago, Wilson felt inspired to text him again this week, thanking him for his “historic” presidency, including paving the way for Harris and Black women to rise.“I didn’t say who would be president, I didn’t say who would be VP, but one day that the two of you will be together on the same ticket,” she said, joking that she manifested Biden and Harris as a political partnership. “I hope he understands how many people in this country love him and appreciate everything he has done.”"
WaPo_43,In the galleries: A spirited reprise for Artomatic artists,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/art/2024/07/26/art-gallery-shows-dc-area/,2024-07-26 18:00:02.884520,,"If the Athenaeum’s current exhibition feels a little edgier than usual, the explanation is right there in the show’s title, “Curators’ Selects: Artomatic 2024.” Athenaeum curators Veronica Szalus, Twig Murray and Elizabeth Brown prowled this spring’s Artomatic in search of artists whose work they had never seen before. They invited 15 of their discoveries to participate in a group show that retains something of the uncurated arts fair’s improvisational spirit.The contributors are not all unknown quantities, and they include several who have had shows elsewhere in the region recently, including Eric Celarier, Ellen Cornett and Luis Del Valle. Celarier makes colorfully tinted contact prints of objects, some of them electronic, in teeming compositions that suggest organic life. Cornett offers precise but whimsical colored-pencil drawings of fashionable sheep, including one who sports a body-covering tie-dye design. Del Valle’s painting on an international-orange road sign is a partial portrait that emerges from a welter of graffiti.Del Valle’s substitute for a canvas is unconventional, but not all that atypical among his fellow Artomatic veterans. Christian Tribastone’s vast drawing-painting of a street and underpass was executed on an unfolded cardboard box. Rita Elsner’s sweeping mountainscape, viewed from a high vantage, was drawn with pastels on a series of paper bags. All three artists combine the reclamation of found materials with well-schooled technique.The influence of graphic novels and other forms of visual pulp fiction is widespread at Artomatic and can be seen here in the work of Camron Anderson and Jenny Kanzler. Anderson’s expressionist paintings of battered faces include the letters “XXX,” the circa-1980 insignia of D.C.’s underage punk rockers. The grayish hues of Kanzler’s tiny paintings are apt, since her subjects include confections made partly of metal. Elegant but eerie, Kanzler’s steely treats look as if they could be baked only by someone with access to an anarchist’s cookbook.Curators’ Selects: Artomatic 2024 Through Aug. 4 at the Athenaeum, 201 Prince St., Alexandria. nvfaa.org. 703-548-0035.The debut show at Alliance Gallery, the Arlington Artists Alliance’s new venue, takes its title from the Kansas state motto, which translates from Latin as “to the stars through hardship.” The slogan is meant to link all five artists in “Ad Astra Per Aspera: Empowerment Explored Through Textiles, Collage and Print,” which includes painting-stitchery hybrids by Anna Nazaretz Radjou and Nicole Tobin. But the most striking pieces address struggles of African American history.At the center of the Christina Papanicolaou-curated show is Eleftheria Easley’s hanging grid of hundreds of printed paper squares, some of them with multilingual text. Among these are tickets, coupons, stamps, maps, game cards, nutrition labels and Beatles lyrics. Solicited on social media, the scraps constitute a sort of World Wide Web of pre-internet artifacts, evocative and nostalgic.Photographer Pedro Ledesma III takes a much more local approach, limiting himself to Richmond. One of his pictures shows a statue in midair, presumably making a much-delayed retreat from a campaign to glorify the losing side of the Civil War.Justyne Fischer turns more directly to Black history with mixed-media portraits of John Lewis and Angela Davis. Fischer’s most ambitious contribution is a multilevel portrayal of the 1921 massacre in Tulsa’s Greenwood District, then one of the country’s most affluent Black neighborhoods. The artist hand-burned a scene of destruction onto two wooden panels and then printed a version of the same image on translucent fabric that hangs in front of the panels. As the gauzy curtain moves, a century-old infamy flutters into view.Ad Astra Per Aspera: Empowerment Explored Through Textiles, Collage and Print Through Aug. 18 at Alliance Gallery, The Crossing Clarendon, 2800 Clarendon Blvd., Arlington. arlingtonartistsalliance.org. 571-483-0652.The main event of Isabella Whitfield’s “Best regards,” is a field of 50 two-foot-high caution signs that nearly fill a room of the Hamiltonian Artists gallery. But just as important is a small item that’s barely visible, secluded in the back of the room and nestled near the ceiling. Both artworks are designed to perplex and to encourage viewers to take a second look at items that initially appear ordinary.Those signs resemble ones made of plastic and usually emblazoned with warnings that the nearby floor is wet. But Whitfield’s are fabricated from medical-grade cotton and lack any text. Rather than the customary bright yellow, they’re in a narrow range of pastel hues. While the sign-like pieces resemble things that are commonplace and functional, the smaller sculpture is mythic: Made of scrap steel, it depicts two dancing horses, one of them winged. The shiny steeds hint at an untold fable.These objects, along with the few others in the show, are exactingly made. The local artist doesn’t want any flaws in workmanship to distract from the desired effect, which is to be as familiar yet potentially deceptive as the email sign-off that provides the show’s title. Whitfield may have only the best regards for gallery visitors, but she wants to keep them guessing about her intentions.Isabella Whitfield: Best regards, Through Aug. 10 at Hamiltonian Artists, 1353 U St. NW. hamiltonianartists.org. 202-332-1116.When depicting threatened African and Asian animals, Holly Cole is realistic but not literal. The local artist’s “Vanishing,” an Art League show of painted quilts and soft sculptures, highlights both endangered species and the qualities of textiles. Cole’s roughly life-size head of a male lion, for example, features a mane made of tufts of torn, war-surplus burlap. The technique is rough, but the effect is majestic.Cole is a former costume designer whose career included work with the Muppets, so she knows how to give fabrics not just shape but also personality. Her sculpture of an orphaned baby elephant could hardly be more endearing. Equally charming are painted renderings of juvenile rhinos and elephants being tended by humans at a hand-rearing facility based on an actual one in Kenya.While her sculptures of African animals are substantial, Cole’s tribute to orangutans is more ephemeral. A set of multilayered curtains depicts the great apes in a tree canopy, swinging through dangling foliage. A three-part narrative, the installation moves from a healthy forest to one in which both animals and plants have almost disappeared. Cole’s amiable style doesn’t preclude outrage and pathos.Holly Cole: Vanishing Through Aug. 4 at the Art League, Torpedo Factory, 105 N. Union St., Alexandria. theartleague.org. 703-683-1780."
WaPo_44,Extreme heat is threatening humanity’s best ally in fight against climate change,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/07/25/forest-fire-heat-carbon-absorb/,2024-07-26 18:00:02.884520,,"Earth’s forests lost much of their ability to absorb the carbon dioxide humans pumped into the air last year, according to a new study that is causing concern among climate scientists that a crucial damper on climate change underwent an unprecedented deterioration.Temperatures in 2023 were so high — and the droughts and wildfires that came with them were so severe — that forests in various parts of the world wilted and burned enough to have degraded the ability of the land to lock away carbon dioxide and act as a check on global warming, the study said.The scientists behind the research, which focuses on 2023, caution that their findings are preliminary. But the work represents a disturbing data point — one that, if it turns into a trend, spells trouble for the planet and the people on it.“We have to be, of course, careful because it’s just one year,” said Philippe Ciais, a scientist at France’s Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences who co-authored the new research.But the results, he added, are still “worrying.” If extreme warming continues, society risks losing “the best friend of humanity” in forests.Earth’s wooded areas act as what is known as a carbon sink. The carbon dioxide that humans emit through activities such as burning fossil fuels and making cement encourages the growth of plants, which in turn absorb a portion of those greenhouse gases and lock them in wood and soil. Without this help from forests, climate change would be worse than what is already occurring.“This is a significant issue, because we are benefiting from the uptake of carbon,” said Robert Rohde, chief scientist for Berkeley Earth, who was not involved in the research. “Otherwise, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere would rise even faster and drive up temperatures even faster.”Ciais and his colleagues saw that the concentration of CO2 measured at an observatory on Mauna Loa in Hawaii and elsewhere spiked in 2023, even though global fossil fuel emissions increased only modestly last year in comparison. That mismatch suggests that there was an “unprecedented weakening” in the Earth’s ability to absorb carbon, the researchers wrote.The scientists then used satellite data and models for vegetative growth to try to pinpoint where the carbon sink was weakening. The team spotted abnormal losses of carbon in the drought-stricken Amazon and forests of Southeast Asia as well as in the boreal forests of Canada, where record-breaking wildfires burned through tens of millions of acres.The paper, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, was posted last week on the science preprint site arXiv. The researchers plan to present their findings next week at a scientific conference in Brazil.One big question overhanging this research is whether the results represent a one-year blip — or the start of troubling long-term trend.“If it’s the new normal, then climate mitigation will be even harder than it is now,” said Rob Jackson, a climate scientist at Stanford and author of the book “Into the Clear Blue Sky,” who also was not involved in the research. “We expect the land sink to slow eventually, but I hoped it wouldn’t happen so soon. If it slows this early, we’re in trouble.”Another key question, Jackson said, is whether the drop is due to the start last year of El Niño, a naturally occurring climate pattern that has been associated with carbon losses on land.Ciais, the researcher behind the study, said the tropical rainforests of South America and Asia have a better chance to bounce back than the snowy woodlands in North America, given how slowly those northern forests grow.“We have a strong buildup of evidence to predict that this northern sink is not going to become very strong again anytime in the future as this extreme warming continues,” Ciais said.The lost ability of some northern land to lock away carbon may also be a sign that a significant amount of organic material frozen in permafrost is thawing, according to Woodwell Climate Research Center ecologist Richard Houghton. Scientists have long worried about potentially catastrophic releases of greenhouse gases from thawing in and around the Arctic Circle.“It has always amazed me that the fraction of global carbon emissions taken up by land systems has remained so stable,” he said.Computer models disagree on when land will cease acting as a carbon sink, Rohde added — whether it will be soon, or well past the end of this century.“The worry is that we are approaching a level at which the ecosystem is getting harmed by our temperature changes to such a degree that it’s no longer helping us out by absorbing carbon,” Rohde said. “Because we don’t know when that is, something like this where we see it declining in real time is worrisome.”"
WaPo_45,A Trump shark’s tale: Whether to be eaten or electrocuted,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/26/trump-shark-ev-boat-electrocution/,2024-07-26 18:00:02.884520,,"Over the past 10 months, former president Donald Trump has periodically unspooled a nonsensical tale involving a sinking electric boat, a potential electrocution and a ferocious shark attack.Trump’s recounting of the saga goes roughly like this: In September, a South Carolina boat manufacturer warned him about the scourge of electric boats — arguing that the battery is so large that it leaves little room for passengers and, worse, the battery is so heavy that the boat might not even float.It was then that Trump claims he posed the “very smart” question the manufacturer said he had never before been asked: If the boat sinks under the weight of its own battery, couldn’t the boaters be electrocuted? And worse, if they jumped off the boat to avoid electrocution, might they then be devoured by a shark?“You know what I’m going to take? Electrocution,” Trump said when he unveiled the story for the first time at a rally in October in Ottumwa, Iowa. “I will take electrocution every single time.”The riff has all the hallmarks of a classic Trumpian yarn — full of fabrication, riddled with illogic, defying the laws of physics and, by turns, rambling and hyperbolic, humorous and head-scratching.It is a whale of a tale, and listeners could be forgiven for thinking they’re going to need a bigger boat to handle all of the exaggerations and flights of fancy.Electric vehicle and electric boat experts say that, like any boat or ship, the battery of a properly built electric boat is unlikely to cause it to sink and that even if the vessel did take on water for some reason, safety standards make it unlikely that anyone would be at risk for electrocution.“We have cargo ships that carry thousands of tons of cargo, so based on Archimedes’ principle — you just have to displace as much water as the weight of the battery pack,” said Jason Siegel, a research scientist in the University of Michigan’s mechanical engineering department who also is the education director for the university’s Electric Vehicle Center.As for the threat of electrocution, Siegel added that EV lithium-based batteries “are inherently more dangerous than a 12-volt lead acid battery you’d typically find on a boat — but because they are more dangerous, they have more safety precautions designed on the package so there’s virtually no way you can come in contact with the battery.”Siegel explained that the risk of electrocution with high-voltage systems normally occurs when “you become part off an electrical circuit between the positive and negative terminals of a battery.” So it’s possible, he said, that if “you just happened to lay across the battery pack, maybe you’d be in trouble.” But an individual would have to come in contact with both terminals of the battery — and these battery systems “are designed in a way that you don’t have access to the electrical connections of the battery pack.”In a text message, the Trump campaign declined to answer whether Trump truly believes his claims about electric boats and, if not, why he is continuing to repeat falsehoods about them.“The Washington Post is a pathetic institution no longer worth the paper it’s printed on and they should be embarrassed for wasting time writing a story about boats sinking when our country is sinking from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s failed leadership,” Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt wrote.Yet the former president has persisted in repeating the unlikely narrative.Trump rolled out the story yet again at a rally this past weekend in Grand Rapids, Mich. — his first public appearance with his running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), following the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee last week.“The press kills me all the time,” Trump said, before forging ahead with this favored hypothetical scenario. “If there’s a shark about 10 yards away, do I get electrocuted or do I go with the shark … because I will take electrocution all day long.”It was hardly the first time Trump had recounted the tale.“I said, ‘How bad would it be if you went all electric?’” Trump said in November at an event in Houston, segueing from concerns about the Army wanting to build electric tanks straight into his boat riff, and again referring to his alleged conversation at the South Carolina boat manufacturer. “He said, ‘Well, the one thing is it’s very heavy, so we don’t think the boat can float.’”“So they’re off to a bad start,” Trump said, to laughter.The former president continued: “I said, ‘What would happen if you’re out at sea and your boat sinks and you have a whole big electric deal under you — would you get electrocuted?’ He said, ‘You know, nobody’s ever asked me that question.’”Finally, Trump reached his denouement — the Hobson’s choice between electrocution and a shark attack, perhaps more at home at a slumber party game of “Would You Rather?” than in the words of a major-party presidential candidate.“So if that boat goes down and you have a shark that’s 10 yards away, so you have a choice of a shark or being electrocuted — I will take electrocution every single day. Do we agree?” Trump concluded. The former president’s tale of “The Old Man and the Shark” also offers a submersible journey into the deep recesses of Trump’s psyche, where institutions — like marine safety standards — can’t be trusted and abiding fears — like sharks — loom large.Trump has long disdained sharks, regularly expressing his unease toward the ocean predators. On July 4, 2013, before he was a presidential candidate, Trump tweeted, “Sorry folks, I’m just not a fan of sharks — and don’t worry, they will be around long after we are gone.” Just minutes later, he returned to the topic again with another missive, writing, “Sharks are last on my list — other than perhaps the losers and haters of the World!”As president, he again reaffirmed his dislike of the finned underwater carnivores, telling a confused Pennsylvania crowd: “It’s true — I’m not a big fan of sharks either,” before worrying aloud he might have alienated the shark demographic: “I don’t know, how many votes am I going to lose?”Another claim of Trump’s shark obsession came from adult-film star Stormy Daniels, who said in a 2018 interview with In Touch Weekly that when she met him at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2006, she found Trump watching the Discovery Channel’s Shark Week, describing him as both “terrified of” and “obsessed with” sharks. Trump this year was found guilty of 34 counts of business fraud for covering up a hush money payment to Daniels to hide his relationship with her during the 2016 election.“He was like, ‘I donate to all these charities and I would never donate to any charity that helps sharks. I hope all the sharks die,’” Daniels told the magazine.Trump’s recent shark’s tale began in late 2023, following a September visit to Sportsman Boats, a boat manufacturer in Summerville, S.C., where Trump claims he first heard the concerns about electric boats. Sportsman Boats did not return several calls requesting comment.Less than a week later, on the first day of October, Trump recounted the story in Ottumwa, Iowa, for the first time, repeating it twice more that month as he campaigned across the state, and again in Texas in November. Each retelling remained remarkably consistent: The concerns from the boat manufacturer, the former president’s question about the threat of electrocution and then the surprise twist of a shark just “10 yards” away.He revived the yarn in June in Las Vegas. But this time, the riff seemed to come out of nowhere, and was even more circuitous than usual.At one point, he paused to opine on shark attacks generally — “By the way, a lot of shark attacks lately, you notice that?” he asked — before digressing into an aside about sharks that “bit off the young lady’s leg” because they “misunderstood who she was.” (Trump seemed to be referring to a trio of shark attacks two days prior at western Florida beaches that injured three swimmers, including two teenage girls.)According to the Florida Museum of Natural History’s International Shark Attack File, there were 69 unprovoked shark bites on humans and 22 provoked bites in 2023, the last year for which the file has released data. But Gavin Naylor, director of the Florida Program for Shark Research at the University of Florida, said 2024 “is absolutely spot-on for an average year” and that shark attacks have consistently been declining over the years.Nonetheless, it was after this Las Vegas retelling that Trump’s shark diatribe went viral. “Trump Jumps the Shark,” blared several headlines. “Cognitive Decline? Trump Short-Circuits During Bonkers Rant,” wrote the New Republic, adding, “The former president glitched during a tirade about sharks and batteries.”The absurdity of Trump’s hypothetical is only heightened by his incorrect facts and assumptions.Craig Scholten, vice president of technical for the American Boat and Yacht Council, which writes safety standards for the marine industry, said the weight of a battery for an electric boat is handled similarly to a traditional fuel tank.“A battery bank on an electric boat is not different than a gasoline or diesel fuel system, and the weight of the fuel is determined in the boat weight and then there’s a safety margin that is put in place,” Scholten said, explaining why an electric boat will remain buoyant and float.Elaine Buckberg, who served as chief economist of General Motors and oversaw the company’s long-term forecasting for vehicles — including the EV market — said that when GM did an analysis on a hypothetical electric pontoon boat, none of Trump’s concerns came up.“At no time in any of those discussions did I hear any concerns about safety,” said Buckberg, a senior fellow at Harvard University’s Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability. “I heard nothing about it could sink from the battery weight. I heard nothing about risk of electrocution.”After his Las Vegas event, even Trump seemed to realize that his story was being mocked, and he defended it later in June at a gathering of conservatives in Washington, D.C.“You heard my story on the boat with the shark, right? I got killed on that. They thought I was rambling — I’m not rambling,” he said, before launching anew into the watery depths of his riff.This time, Trump became especially animated as he imagined “a shark about 10 yards over there” — gesturing with his left hand at the invisible predator — and, conjuring images of “Dr. Strangelove,” again asked, to laughter, “Would I immediately have to abandon or could I ride the electric down?”“It’s actually not crazy,” he concluded. “It’s sort of a smart story, right?”And for all the tale’s twists and turns, at least one thing remains remarkably clear: Trump would definitely prefer electrocution to a shark encounter.Others, however, weren’t so sure.“I mean, I’d be staying on the boat as long as I could,” Siegel said, when pressed on Trump’s fictitious scenario.Then, he mused further: “Depends on how big the shark is,” he said. “I’ve seen some pretty scary-looking bull sharks, and some pretty benign-looking sand sharks.”Clara Ence Morse contributed to this report."
WaPo_46,Trump White House was warned sanctions on Venezuela could fuel migration,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/26/venezuela-crisis-immigration-us-sanctions-trump/,2024-07-26 18:00:02.884520,,"The Trump White House was warned that harsh sanctions on Venezuela could accelerate that country’s economic collapse and speed an exodus of millions of migrants to neighboring nations, according to three current and former U.S. government officials.The Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis delivered the classified assessments — part of a broader examination of how Venezuela’s economic implosion could affect migration in Latin America — to the White House National Security Council and the top two DHS officials in at least four reports between 2017 and 2019, the people said.The Trump administration nevertheless imposed some of the harshest economic penalties in U.S. history on Venezuela in response to documented human rights abuses, extrajudicial killings and corruption by the regime of dictator Nicolás Maduro. The sanctions are fiercely defended by proponents, who say they were a necessary response to one of the most brutal crackdowns on civilians in two decades.Today, however, Maduro remains in power, and a surge in Venezuelan immigrants has emerged as a flash point in the U.S. presidential election. Though Venezuelan mass migration to the United States only began after President Biden took office, concern among Trump officials about the sanctions’ potential effects, including on migration, was more extensive than previously known, according to interviews with more than two dozen current and former U.S. officials.“This is the point I made at the time: I said the sanctions were going to grind the Venezuelan economy into dust and have huge human consequences, one of which would be out-migration,” said Thomas Shannon, who served as undersecretary for political affairs at the State Department under President Donald Trump.“The sanctions clearly helped generate faster out-migration,” Shannon said. “And you knew it was only going to be a matter of time before these people decided to migrate north.”U.S. sanctions have surged in the past two decades and are in effect in some form in almost a third of all countries. In the case of Venezuela, U.S. officials were — and remain — sharply torn over the financial fusillade.Proponents, such as former top Trump aide John Bolton, defend the sanctions as a critically important, though unsuccessful, effort to force out Maduro, or at least limit the funds at his disposal. Venezuelans had already started fleeing before the sanctions were imposed, they stress, escaping an economic crisis rooted not in U.S. penalties but in mismanagement by Maduro and his predecessor, authoritarian leader Hugo Chávez.But other former Trump officials, particularly at the State and Treasury departments, say it is clear U.S. sanctions aggravated an already dire situation with little clear upside. Venezuela’s economy contracted by a staggering 71 percent from 2012 to 2020 — the largest such drop in modern history for a country not at war — as the U.S. impeded its oil industry and curtailed access to international markets.
More than 7 million Venezuelan migrants have left the country since the start of the economic crisis, which began in 2014, before the sanctions. Migrants initially went to neighboring countries, such as Colombia and Peru. Many later joined others headed to the United States, where federal border authorities have encountered more than 800,000 Venezuelans since 2021. Some federal officials were concerned about that risk before the sanctions were imposed — although multiple factors, including the effects of the pandemic, have driven Venezuelans to the U.S., and their numbers only spiked after Biden took office.
The fallout in Venezuela underscores the difficulties of the U.S. money war, which forces officials to balance between trying to punish bad actors abroad and limiting the damage to innocent civilians.
The Biden administration temporarily lifted key sanctions on Venezuela last year in exchange for promises from Maduro to allow a competitive presidential election, which is set to take place on Sunday. But because Maduro has failed to follow through on most of his commitments, the Biden administration reimposed the sanctions.In 2018, when Mauricio Claver-Carone saw the bottom falling out of the Maduro regime, he saw it as the kind of opportunity the Trump White House should seize.Twenty years of mismanagement by Chavez and Maduro had collided with a global downturn in oil prices to almost shatter Venezuela’s economy, sparking inflation of more than 800 percent and chronic shortages of food and other goods. Maduro’s dictatorship viciously crushed widespread street protests, with political dissidents rounded up, jailed and even tortured.Claver-Clarone, a senior official at the National Security Council, saw a viable opposition forming around Juan Guaidó, the leader of the country’s democratically elected National Assembly. He also saw clear signs of unrest among military officers, who could form a rival power base. The United States, he thought, had to act decisively and forcefully.Obama administration sanctions on Venezuela had narrowly targeted Maduro allies and done little to prevent the broader crackdown. If the Trump administration could use sanctions to sabotage the state-run oil industry, through which Maduro secured the loyalty of the armed forces, Claver-Carone and other senior officials believed they could bolster Guaidó and reverse the nation’s descent into a humanitarian and political catastrophe. His approach was backed by Trump and Bolton, the national security adviser; a vocal group of lawmakers on Capitol Hill; and the leaders of many of Venezuela’s neighbors, such as Colombia and Ecuador.Claver-Carone’s reasoning reflected in part why U.S. sanctions have become so frequently used: They carried much less risk to Americans than deploying troops to Venezuela, which Trump briefly considered. And they could deliver an immediate shock to an adversary refusing to respond to diplomatic overtures.In 2017, Trump had imposed sanctions blocking the Venezuelan government and oil firms from accessing international credit markets. The administration expanded sanctions during the following three years to severely restrict oil exports, the lifeblood of Venezuela’s economy, particularly as the opposition movement to Maduro appeared to be gaining strength.“If we were going to seize the moment — if we were going to do a campaign to restore the democratic order in Venezuela and change their government — we needed something that went to the maximum,” Claver-Carone said. “We needed the greatest impact in the shortest amount of time.”Other government officials saw risks in that approach. U.S. sanctions are formally implemented by the Treasury Department, which had a chance to weigh in on every step.At roughly biweekly coordinating meetings in the White House Situation Room, Treasury officials raised objections to the scope of most of Claver-Carone’s proposals, according to four people who attended the meetings, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe classified discussions.“It was a screaming match almost once a week,” one person said.As the Trump administration ratcheted up sanctions from 2017 to 2019, Treasury staffers arrived at the White House armed with data showing the Venezuelan economy was already disintegrating. The country was besieged not only by hyperinflation and a massive economic contraction, but also soaring infant mortality and a lack of safe drinking water.At one point in the summer of 2018, Treasury representatives got into a shouting match with Claver-Carone in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building over their attempts to broaden humanitarian exemptions to allow more civilian goods into the country. Sigal Mandelker, then Treasury’s undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, cited examples of malnourished Venezuelans as a reason to be wary of the humanitarian consequences of overly broad U.S. sanctions, the people said. Her fears, two of the people said, were shared by Michael Kaplan, another senior Treasury official. Mandelker and Kaplan declined to comment.“Across the Treasury staff, we were all asking, ‘What are the second and third order effects of this?’” one former official said. “Out-migration was one piece of that.”The disputes went all the way to Trump’s Cabinet. In January or February 2019, then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin expressed concern to Bolton over potential collateral damage from tighter sanctions, Bolton recalled in an interview.“There was no doubt the sanctions, along with the general economic deterioration before we imposed them, was driving a lot of people out of the country,” Bolton said. “ … That, to me, was a way to put pressure on the country.”As Venezuela’s economic collapse accelerated, U.S. officials throughout the federal government started keeping a closer eye on the surge of migrants out of the country.Their concern, especially at first, was not that many would wind up in the United States. Instead, U.S. officials were worried about neighboring countries, particularly Colombia, which was struggling to absorb a massive influx. The numbers were startling: In a nation of 30 million people, more than 1 million had left Venezuela by 2017 — even before sanctions began to bite.As U.S. authorities explored their options, DHS officials started analyzing how much worse the situation could get, including under much tighter sanctions. From 2017 to 2019, DHS officials produced these estimates approximately every six months. It’s not clear how many senior officials read the final reports assessing the potential for additional out-migration; several senior White House and Treasury officials under Trump said they were unaware of any internal estimates of sanctions’ effect on Venezuelan migration.“The debate with the sanctions at the time within the White House and other agencies was: How do you not hurt the population?” one former senior intelligence official in the Trump administration said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to reflect internal talks. From the intelligence community’s perspective, the official said, “the focus wasn’t just on the cause and effect through migration. It was, rather, ‘Hey, policymaker, as you’re contemplating X number of moving parts, this could be an outcome of your decision-making as well.’’’Trump administration officials also appeared to be ignoring or downplaying warnings from U.S. allies. At a 2018 dinner in Mexico City, foreign ministry officials under left-wing Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador told senior Trump foreign policy aide Elliott Abrams that the administration’s Venezuela sanctions could lead to a stampede of migrants first through Mexico and then into the United States, according to two Mexican officials with knowledge of the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private conversation. In an interview, Abrams said he remembers the dinner and the Mexicans’ opposition to Venezuela sanctions, but not their migration warnings.“They were concerned about the impacts of U.S. sanctions on migration outflows,” said John Creamer, a former State Department official who worked with Mexico from 2018 to 2021. Mexican officials later communicated to their U.S. counterparts: “Look, you guys, your policy toward Venezuela is producing these outflows …'” Creamer said. “They saw huge numbers of Venezuelans rolling through their country.”One of the Mexican officials at the 2018 meeting said U.S. officials did not appear interested in hearing warnings about migration. “We told them several times, ‘This is going to happen,’” the official said. “And it did.”Although the Colombian government supported the sanctions, officials at the local and national level were highly concerned that the move could lead millions more people to cross the border from Venezuela, said Diego Chaves-González, who at the time worked closely with the Colombian immigration agency as a consultant for the World Bank.“Obviously, everyone was worried about the sanctions” as one of many factors that could fuel an increase in migration out of Venezuela, said Christian Krüger Sarmiento, then director of Colombia’s migration agency, who defends the measures as a justified attempt to oust Maduro. The concerns of Colombia’s migration agency were discussed by Treasury officials at the time, said two people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal conversations.The deteriorating relationship between Caracas and Washington, due in part to sanctions, also made it more difficult for the U.S. to deport Venezuelans. After Biden eased sanctions on Venezuela, the Maduro regime allowed some deportation flights to resume — but this year, after Biden reimposed the sanctions, the flights again have stalled.Many Trump officials, and even some U.S. officials who served during Democratic administrations, reject any attempt to link the sanctions to the migration crisis. The extent of economic mismanagement by Chavez and Maduro is difficult to overstate, they said: Venezuela’s authoritarian leaders raided the country’s piggy bank — its oil industry — draining it of investment and doling out billions to cronies to maintain their grip on power. Counterproductive price controls and exchange rate policies fueled the chaos. The country’s economy had contracted by double digits even before Trump took office.How Venezuelans came to the United States is also heavily contested. Republicans argue they did so in large numbers only after Biden lifted Trump-imposed restrictions and implemented softer border policies.Juan Cruz, who served as a senior official at the National Security Council under Trump, said of the effect of sanctions on migration: “Obviously, it contributed. But it’s not the cause.”“The suffering of the people is due to the Venezuelan government,” Cruz continued. “Some people wanted to bring up second- or third-order consequences, and say, ‘If we do this, the Venezuelan people will be eating rock soup.’ They were already eating rock soup.”Some Venezuelans who fled the country blame their government and U.S. sanctions.Rosa Grande, 38, said she was optimistic about the sanctions when they were first imposed. She hopes Maduro will “go to jail because he destroyed my future, the future of my children, and the future of my country.”But U.S. sanctions caused severe damage to her father’s business, she said, and that’s what forced her and her 13-year-old daughter to move to the United States in 2020. The sanctions “just led to more misery, and more hunger,” said Grande, who now lives in North Carolina.Only one peer-reviewed academic publication has tried to quantify the proportion of the downturn caused by U.S. sanctions. It was written by Francisco Rodriguez, a Venezuelan economist now at the University of Denver who was once intimidated by Maduro while he helmed the country’s budget office — and who says he warned Treasury officials under Trump of the potential effect on out-migration.Rodriguez estimates that U.S. sanctions were responsible for about half of Venezuela’s economic contraction, which he estimates as being three times as deep as the Great Depression in the United States.Venezuelans “left the country because the economy collapsed. And the economy collapsed partially because of sanctions,” he said. “There is overwhelming evidence of that.”Shane Harris contributed to this report."
WaPo_47,"Arson attacks target France’s trains hours before Olympics, officials say",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/26/france-rail-disruptions-scnf-olympics/,2024-07-26 18:55:02.884520,,"PARIS — High-speed train lines in France were targeted by arson attacks, causing massive travel disruptions hours before the Opening Ceremonies of the Paris Olympic Games, the country’s national rail service said. Gabriel Attal, the French caretaker prime minister, said that the “acts of sabotage” were carried out early Friday in a “prepared and coordinated manner.” “The consequences on the rail network are massive and serious,” he added in a post on X, adding that “our intelligence services and law enforcement are mobilized to find and punish the perpetrators of these criminal acts.” France’s state-owned, national rail service SNCF said Friday several “malicious acts” targeted three of its high-speed train lines, as some 250,000 people were expected to travel Friday and 800,000 during the weekend. In an email to The Washington Post, it said it was the “victim of a massive attack to paralyze high-speed lines.” Fires were set “to damage our facilities,” SNCF said, noting its Atlantic, northern and eastern high-speed lines were affected and advised customers to postpone travel. SNCF, which said it also prevented another “malicious act” targeting the Southeast line, noted that some disruptions are expected to last until Monday.“We have damage and intentional fires in pipes where a lot of cables pass, cables that are used for signaling,” Jean-Pierre Farandou, head of the SNCF, told reporters. “They must be repaired, cable by cable. It’s a very delicate work.” Before railway traffic can resume, he said, all repaired signal will also need to be tested. “It takes time,” he said.The Paris public prosecutor’s office said Friday that authorities are investigating “intentional damage caused to SNCF sites during the night of July 25 to 26.” The prosecutor’s office is looking into charges ranging from “damage to property affecting the fundamental interests of the nation” to “attacks on an automated data processing system.” Each of these potential charges could carry long prison sentences. Jean Castex, a former French prime minister and the current head of the Paris transport system, has ordered an “increased level of vigilance” across the capital region’s network. “We are deploying on all terrains,” he said, according to the French public broadcaster, with a particular focus “on the sensitive sites of our networks.”The Eurostar trains, one of the principal transport lines from the United Kingdom to the European continent, also announced delays due to coordinated acts of vandalism in France, affecting the high speed line between Paris and Lille” and listed trains arriving in France an hour and a half later than scheduled. It advised travelers to postpone their trips and said several trains had been canceled.Officials said they were assessing the impact on travelers and athletes set to compete.Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete strongly condemned what he called the “coordinated” acts. He told BFM TV that an investigation is underway but said the coordinated timing of the incidents suggested the fires were “criminal” in nature. “At this stage, it is probably one or several acts of vandalism, a kind of coordinated sabotage,” French Sports Minister Amélie Oudéa-Castéra told Le Parisien. “We will evaluate the impact for today, for travelers, the impact for the athletes and for this weekend.”“Shame on the vandals,” Tourism Minister Olivia Grégoire said, noting the impact on families leaving on summer vacation and the timing hours before the Opening Ceremonies of the Olympic Games.The SNCF said its teams were “on site” to ascertain the problem and begin repairs. It said that “some trains are diverted, a large number of trains are canceled.” A Paris Olympics spokesperson said in an email that it has “taken note” of the incidents, adding, “We are working closely with our partner, the rail operator SNCF, to assess the situation.”Attal thanked “firefighters who intervened on the affected sites” and “the SNCF agents who will carry out the necessary work to restore the network” — as well as impacted travelers for “their patience, their understanding and the civic-mindedness they demonstrate.”Valérie Pécresse, the president of the regional council of the Île-de-France region, called the incidents “coordinated sabotage” and “an attempt to destabilize just as we launch the Olympic Games.”  Speaking to BFM TV, Pécresse said the incidents are “not a coincidence” but rather a “massive and coordinated attack.” France and other European countries have seen suspected arson attacks on their railway systems before, usually attributed to criminals and at times to political activists, though the scale of this incident and timing with the Olympic Games puts these latest incidents in a whole new light. Security has been a major priority in the run-up to the Paris Games, with most preparations kept under wraps but plans announced for the deployment of 15,000 soldiers, 35,000 police and 22,000 private contractors working in and around the stadiums and sports facilities.The main security concern was expected to be some kind of terrorist attack, as happened in Paris in 2015 or Nice in 2016, but there are also fears of cyberattacks. France’s cybersecurity agency was quick to issue a statement Friday that the train disruptions did not have a cyber element.There has been added worry over reports that Russia has been paying amateur saboteurs to carry out operations throughout Europe and on Tuesday, French police detained a Russian national over a suspected plot to cause “destabilization” during the Games, prosecutors said.The tensions in the Middle East have been a major factor for security considerations at the Games as well, with armed guards escorting the Israelis into their first soccer game against Mali on Wednesday amid protests over the war in Gaza. There have also been online threats against the Israeli team, evoking memories of the 1972 Munich Games terrorist attack. There have also been bomb scares and false alarms.Friday’s arson attack so far seems to have had a less effect on the Olympic Games than the Parisians seeking to escape their city ahead of the Opening Ceremonies and begin the much hallowed national tradition of August holidays.Eloise Lecat sat on the floor of Gare Montparnasse, the Paris train station most affected by the disruptions, with her giant suitcase and her 3-year-old daughter, Léonie, on the floor in front of her.They were heading to Pays Basque to visit Eloise’s mother for August vacation — a cherished French tradition that coincides with the Olympic Games this year. But their 10:15 a.m. train was canceled due to the overnight disruptions, so Lecat was frantically searching for other transport options — bus, car or anything to get them out of Paris. Léonie was eager to see her cousins, she said. “We will look for a good solution and see what happens,” Lecat said.Claire Parker and Paul Schemm contributed to this report."
WaPo_48,How do I clean a flat-screen TV covered with fingerprints?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2024/07/26/advice-cleaning-flat-screen-tv/,2024-07-26 19:59:05.191342,,"Q: How do I remove fingerprints, including old ones, from a flat-screen TV?A: Back when the only screens in most homes were televisions that showed images projected from the back via cathode-ray tubes, cleaning fingerprints from the glass was easy. Manufacturers coated the back of the glass with tiny phosphor dots that glowed red, green or blue when struck by electron beams from the tube. But they didn’t coat the front of the glass, so you could rub away fingerprints with the help of any window cleaner that worked on glass. You could even use products with ammonia, such as the original Windex formula. And fingerprints weren’t such an issue then; touch screens were yet to come.Cleaning screens became more complicated beginning in the early aughts, when sales of plasma televisions took off, only to be nudged aside in later years by LCDs, OLEDs and QLEDs. Plasma televisions, the first flat screens, have two glass panels separated by a narrow gap filled with millions of tiny cells filled with gas that reacts when current passes through and causes phosphors on the inside of the glass to light up and create images. Glare from other nearby light sources made images on the screen hard to see, so manufacturers began applying anti-glare coating to the outside face of the glass. Cleaning with ammonia and some other cleaners could strip the coating and leave the screen with visible wipe marks. Improper cleaning can also permanently damage newer types of television screens, as well as computer and gaming screens.Phone screens are also vulnerable, but they need to stand up to being taken in and out of jeans pockets so they resist abrasion better. Because screen materials vary, it’s always smart to check the manufacturer’s recommendations for your specific product.

WaPo_50,How to enjoy the airport lounge without ruining it for everyone,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/tips/airport-lounges-access-rules-entry/,2024-07-26 19:59:05.191342,,"Grumpy security agents, the threat of flight delays, crowds massing at the gate: Together, they’re a recipe for traveler stress. If you have access, airport lounges can be a serene haven in which to counter it.Lounges have become easier to access and, at times, overcrowded. As airports open more of them, travelers should recognize the major do’s and don’ts.For fliers entering a lounge for the first (or 500th) time, here’s our etiquette guide to keeping the peace within the club.You’ve strolled into the lounge, and the doors to your airport retreat close behind you. Now, only one person separates you from the breakfast buffet and a preflight mimosa: the lounge agent.
“Be courteous to the people who are checking you in, much like flight attendants on a plane,” said Diane Gottsman, an international etiquette expert and founder of the Protocol School of Texas.
Don’t just assume you have entry. One lounge may be accessible with the right credit card, while another lounge next door could be restricted to certain premium passengers. Figure out which lounge you have access to before arriving at the airport.
A bonus: If you have multiple lounge options, a little research can tell you in advance which has the better champagne (or soften the disappointment if they don’t have any).You’ve strolled into the lounge, and the doors to your airport retreat close behind you.

If a lounge is particularly popular, that might even mean a line to get in.
Gottsman said that as with any public domain, there should be certain expectations of courtesy and respect. “Be conscientious of available seating, and don’t spread your belongings across several tables and chairs,” she said. When charging your devices, avoid monopolizing multiple power outlets if there are only a limited number available. The lounge also is not the place to conduct personal grooming sessions.
Flight delays happen, but if you need to take a quick snooze, keep to one seat rather than sprawling out. This is not your living room (or bedroom, for that matter). Thankfully, a handful of lounges, like Minute Suites, offer semiprivate nap pods.
And, for the love of all good things, please leave your shoes and socks on.Typically, airport lounges are shared public spaces.

Capital One Lounges, for instance, do not allow access more than three hours before your flight departure time. That means you can’t use these particular lounges as a dining room or home office all day.
No matter the rules, however, perhaps squatting in a lounge isn’t the most polite thing, especially if people are waiting to get in.Many airport lounges have instituted time limits, including the ability to enter only when departing — and not when arriving.

But with exclusive access comes responsibility.
When it comes to alcohol, a lack of self-constraint is more than a matter of etiquette; it might also prevent you from boarding a flight. “Gate agents and flight attendants can most certainly boot a passenger off a plane if they seem too intoxicated since it’s a safety issue,” said Stella Shon, a consumer travel expert at Upgraded Points.
As for the all-you-can-eat buffet? Perhaps save the overindulging for your destination, Gottman advised. And, for sanitary reasons, use the proper utensils and serving ware when retrieving food.
Finally, respect the rules of the dining area. “If there’s no clear indication you’re supposed to take things to go, don’t,” Gottman said.Sure, the reason you’re going into a lounge may be to indulge in a few drinks and sate your appetite.

Use headphones — always.
Many lounges now offer private pods to take calls, so be on the lookout. If those are not available, keep phone conversations at a low volume and be as brief as possible, or take calls in a corner of the lounge where it’s just a bit more secluded.Be mindful of your speaking volume.

WaPo_51,Iowa abortion ban taking effect as residents flee out of state for care,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/26/iowa-abortion-ban-takes-effect/,2024-07-26 19:59:05.191342,,"Planned Parenthood says it will continue providing abortions in Iowa but only in the very limited circumstances allowed by the state’s six-week abortion ban, which goes into effect at 8 a.m. Monday after a year of legal wrangling.The law restricts the procedure after six weeks of pregnancy, the point when fetal cardiac activity can be detected, with the only exceptions being cases of rape, incest, a fetal abnormality “incompatible with life” or if the life of the mother is in danger. Iowa had previously permitted abortions until 22 weeks of pregnancy.Reproductive care groups in neighboring states where the procedure remains legal are already seeing an influx of patients from Iowa. The Chicago Abortion Fund received more than 60 support requests from Iowa residents during the first three weeks of July, a 165 percent increase over previous months.“It’s staggering even to me,” executive director Megan Jeyifo said Wednesday.The Iowa Supreme Court’s sweeping decision on June 28 left abortion rights with the lowest level of constitutional protection, a ruling that reversed an injunction on the 2023 statute and paved the way for the near-total ban to take effect. The court on Monday declined a request from Planned Parenthood, one of the plaintiffs, to rehear the case. The following day, a district court judge lifted the injunction.“Our hearts are heavy as Iowans have lost the ability to make personal, private medical decisions,” said Ruth Richardson, president of Planned Parenthood North Central States. “We will continue to fight to restore their bodily autonomy.”Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who had pushed the GOP-led legislature to pass the measure, this week called the court ruling “a victory for life.”“There is nothing more sacred and no cause more worthy than protecting innocent unborn lives,” Reynolds said in a statement. She said she remained “deeply committed” to supporting women planning for motherhood by “elevating adoption” and “protecting in vitro fertilization.”Richardson estimates that the number of abortions performed in Iowa will drop by at least 97 percent starting Monday morning. More than 4,000 procedures were done in the state in 2023, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a policy and research organization that supports abortion rights.Eighteen states will now ban all or most abortions, a Washington Post analysis shows, with reproductive rights expected to be a key issue in the fall presidential campaign. Constitutional amendments to enshrine abortion rights already are on the ballot in five states.Since the U.S. Supreme Court ended federal protection for abortion in 2022, the Chicago Abortion Fund has helped 465 Iowans seeking the procedure and now anticipates even greater need. Jeyifo said Florida’s abortion ban, which took effect May 1, prompted a huge increase in pregnant patients coming to Illinois from there and throughout the south.The Iowa Abortion Access Fund has seen a 27 percent jump in requests for help since 2021, officials said, and requests to date this year are up 7 percent over 2023.Organizations in Iowa have been planning for the ban’s eventuality for months, according to Richardson. Planned Parenthood North Central States expanded certain locations — doubling the number of patient beds in Omaha and moving to a larger site in Mankato, Minn. — to assist women from Iowa, she said.Abortion measures are set for the November ballot in Florida, Nevada, Colorado, South Dakota and Maryland, with activists awaiting confirmation in Arizona, Missouri and Montana that they gathered enough signatures to also put measures on the ballot in their states. Voters have overwhelmingly supported abortion rights in ballot questions since 2022, including in red states such as Kansas and Ohio.Iowa’s process toward a constitutional amendment is complex and can take years. In 2021, conservative lawmakers there launched a measure asking voters to decide that there is no right to an abortion in the state, but it has not moved forward.The new law will limit the procedure to a time frame in which many women don’t yet know they are pregnant. The nonmedical exceptions will only apply if a sexual assault is reported to law enforcement or a health provider within 45 days for rape and 145 days for incest."
WaPo_52,When test results arrive before doctors can explain them,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/26/when-test-results-arrive-before-doctors-can-explain-them/,2024-07-26 19:52:05.191342,,"Good morning, I’m Fenit Nirappil and I’m a health reporter for The Washington Post. I was irritated when I got an email showing the results of the bloodwork from my annual physical without ever hearing from my doctor about the warning signs the test highlighted. Turns out I’m not alone, and that’s the subject of today’s newsletter.Today’s edition: Vice President Harris is touting her accomplishments on countering medical debt on the campaign trail. A Senate committee subpoenaed the leader of the nation’s largest physician-led hospital system. But first …Patient portals deliver scary news before doctors can weigh inMike Day’s cancer diagnosis arrived while he lounged in his living room recliner last summer. His wife, a former registered nurse, spotted “adenocarcinoma” in biopsy results posted to his electronic patient portal.His gastroenterologist was on vacation, and Day struggled to get an appointment to talk to a doctor about the cancerous tumor in his esophagus. Day died within weeks, and his family is astounded by how much trouble they had to go through to get an explanation for a cancer that serious.“Getting medical results shouldn’t be like tracking a DoorDash order,” said Andrew Day, Mike’s son.Day’s story provides a powerful example of the dilemma I covered in an article for The Washington Post: A new federal requirement requires people to receive immediate access to medical test and scan results. But does that help them or hurt them?The idea of medical transparency undergirding provisions in the 2016 Cures Act is broadly supported. But implementation of the regulations expanding access to medical records, which took effect in 2021, has been more divisive.As more people receive troubling results online at the same time as their doctors — often waiting days or weeks for treatment plans — medical associations have been pushing to give doctors more time to release records revealing cancer and other grim diagnoses so patients don’t have to bear the news alone.The American Medical Association has been lobbying federal health officials, unsuccessfully, to adopt a rule providing physicians 72 hours to reach patients before electronically releasing life-altering results or deadly diagnoses. California and Kentucky have enshrined similar exceptions in recent state laws.“It’s one more instance in which we feel like there are other people who don’t know our patients who are getting in the way of that really sacred doctor-patient relationship,” said Jack Resneck, the medical association’s former president who led the group’s advocacy on the issue.Federal health officials say the concerns will be resolved as technology improves and as medical practices adjust how they prepare patients for results.“There is just a moral imperative here, which is for patients, this is their information. They ought to be able to access it whenever they want,” said Micky Tripathi, the national coordinator for health information technology who oversees the requirement for the Department of Health and Human Services. “They also pay for it. They ought to be able to get things they pay for.”Grace Cordovano, a patient advocate, said one of the best ways to ease anxieties without overwhelming doctors is for insurers to pay health navigators who can prepare patients before they meet with a physician. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services created billing codes to allow the public insurers to pay for “principal illness navigation” to connect patients with cancer and other high-risk conditions to health and social services.Before medical records were readily accessible, Cordovano said, patients struggled to obtain the documents needed to get a second opinion, enroll in clinical trials or book appointments with specialists.You can read more about the effects of instant patient notification — good and bad — and the experiences of doctors and patients navigating the new environment here. How Kamala Harris is tackling medical debt — with Roy Cooper’s helpHarris has spent nearly three years steering federal efforts to alleviate medical debt — an often-overlooked effort she is likely to highlight as her presidential campaign takes shape, our colleague Dan Diamond reports this morning.Key context: Working with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other agencies, Harris-led initiatives in 2022 triggered credit reporting agencies to remove medical bills from the credit reports of about 30 million Americans. The administration also proposes blocking medical debt from being used to evaluate borrowers’ fitness for mortgages and other types of loans. That rule could be finalized next year, if she’s elected president.What’s next: Harris is coordinating with North Carolina officials on a pilot project to forgive the medical debt of about 2 million residents. Under the proposal, hospitals that take steps to relieve patients’ existing medical debt and adopt policies to prevent accumulation of new debt would receive additional funding through the Medicaid program. Federal approval from CMS could come today.“Getting sick or taking care of loved ones should not mean financial hardship, and I applaud North Carolina for their innovative proposal,” Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement.North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D), who is being vetted by the Harris campaign as a potential running mate, said he believed his state’s plan could be “a really big deal — if it works.” But some hospitals have suggested that they may not participate.We have already forgiven about $500 million of medical debt for hundreds of thousands of Americans across the nation. pic.twitter.com/pd73Qy8iPyThe Post’s Sabrina Malhi wants to speak with people who have taken the postpartum pill zuranolone, sold under the brand name Zurzuvae, for an upcoming article.

Community leaders and health workers have criticized leaders of the for-profit company for extravagant paydays while hospitals struggled to meet mortgage payments and cover other expenses.Senators echoed those concerns in a hearing yesterday, accusing Steward executives of “outrageous corporate greed” that harmed access to medical services, including spending nearly $100 million on a pair of private jets.“At a Steward-owned Massachusetts hospital, a woman died after giving birth when doctors realized mid-surgery that the supplies needed to treat her had been repossessed due to Steward’s financial troubles,” said Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), a physician and the panel’s top Republican. “Patients’ lives are at risk. Americans deserve answers.”The committee previously sought testimony from Ralph de la Torre, Steward’s CEO and founder, but was rebuffed.

WaPo_53,The life of two Boeing Starliner astronauts stuck indefinitely in space,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/26/boeing-starliner-astronauts-stuck-orbit-space-station/,2024-07-26 19:09:05.191342,,"Getting stuck on the International Space Station for an extended stay could be the ultimate dream vacation. Great views of Earth and solar system right out the window. Flying Superman-style in zero gravity while floating M&Ms into each others’ mouths. There’s even decent internet and an expansive movie selection.Unfortunately for Sunita Williams and Barry “Butch” Wilmore, the NASA astronauts who have had their stay on the space station extended indefinitely while NASA and Boeing determine what went wrong with their spacecraft, the bah-humbug bureaucrats at NASA aren’t allowing them a vacation. While engineers on the ground examine why several of the Starliner spacecraft’s thrusters failed on the way to the station, the astronauts have to work.The space station is, after all, an orbiting laboratory, and the astronauts’ job while there is to conduct science experiments and upkeep on the station. Now that there are two extra pairs of hands, the work, including the most tedious of chores (yes, even a little toilet maintenance), is being spread around among the nine astronauts on board living in a ship the length of a football field with the living space of a Boeing 747 airplane.Williams and Wilmore arrived at the space station June 6 for what was supposed to be about am eight-day mission that, as of Friday, has stretched to 51 days. The delay is because of the fact that during the approach to the station, five of the spacecraft’s thrusters shut off suddenly, and the spacecraft also sprung a series of small but persistent helium leaks in its propulsion system. Since then, engineers from Boeing and NASA have been running tests to determine what went wrong and to ensure that the spacecraft is safe to fly Wilmore and Williams home.At a briefing Thursday, NASA officials still could not say when that would be. They said that Starliner is probably still healthy enough to fly the crew home, but that decision would be made during an intensive review, involving top leadership from NASA and Boeing, that could be scheduled as early as next week.But they’ve said repeatedly that the astronauts are not stranded and that in the case of an emergency, they could fly home in Starliner. SpaceX’s Dragon capsule, which has been flying astronauts to the space station for NASA since 2020, could be used an a backup if necessary, NASA officials said.The mission is the first flight of Starliner with people on board, a test to see how the spacecraft performs before NASA allows a full contingent of four astronauts to fly to the space station for stays as long as six months.Despite their rocky ride to the space station, the astronauts said this month that they have full confidence in Starliner and are enjoying their extended stay in space, where they can remain in contact with friends and family at home. Wilmore, 61, is a retired Navy captain and fighter jet pilot from Tennessee who is married with two daughters. Williams, 58, is from Massachusetts and is also a retired captain in the Navy, where she served as a helicopter pilot. She is married and enjoys time with the family dogs.“We've been thoroughly busy up here, integrated right into the crew,” Williams said during a briefing with reporters. “It feels like coming back home. It feels good to float around. It feels good to be in space and work up here with the International Space Station team. So yeah, it’s great to be up here.”Wilmore added, “It's a great place to be, a great place to live, a great place to work.”Since arriving at the station, they have used an ultrasound machine to scan their veins to collect data on how space affects the human body. Williams worked on studies that examined the “use of microgravity to manufacture higher-quality optical fibers” than can be made on Earth. She also worked on a study using “fluid physics, such as surface tension, to overcome the lack of gravity when nourishing and watering plants grown in space.”In addition to science, there are chores to do, such as “maintenance that has been waiting for a little while — stuff that’s been on the books for a little bit,” Williams said.So they’ve been assigned, like a pair of hands on the crew of a ship at sea, to take inventory of the station’s food supplies. They’ve swapped out a urine processing pump. Wilmore, a bit of a handyman who builds tables and sheds for his church, was tasked with servicing a pair of freezers used to hold research samples as well as refilling the coolant loops in one of the station’s water pumps.They’ve even had a little bit of a scare. At one point last month, all the astronauts had to scramble to their respective spacecraft because a satellite broke apart at an altitude near the space station, potentially posing a threat. Williams and Wilmore jumped inside Starliner and began to prepare to undock in case debris from the satellite slammed into the station, forcing them to evacuate. In the end, the debris passed without incident and the crew resumed operations.Weightlessness is a joy, especially after astronauts adapt and fly around the station with ease. “Gravity sucks. It’s horrible,” veteran NASA astronaut Sandy Magnus once said.But despite the wonders of whizzing around the globe at 17,500 mph, experiencing a sunrise every 90 minutes and seeing entire continents in your field of view, space can get old. Even the most hardened astronauts get homesick. The station can feel cramped. Going to the bathroom, a delicate procedure involving suction, is unpleasant. And the lack of gravity makes astronauts feel constantly congested as fluids shift in their bodies.“I think the perfect space mission is probably about a month because it gives you enough time to start feeling normal, and then you would go home,” Scott Kelly, the former NASA astronaut who spent nearly a year on the space station, said in an interview.Having extra people on the station means the food supplies will be depleted more quickly, and the systems designed to scrub carbon dioxide from the space station’s air need to work harder. “They’re going to put a little bit of a strain on that,” Kelly said. “On the other hand, there are four extra hands to do more work. And there always seems to be a lot of work to be done up there. So that’s a positive.”Astronauts are trained for all sorts of scenarios, he said, especially when things go awry. And the crews on the ground work tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure the astronauts’ safety.“They have our lives in their hands, and they're very professional,” Kelly said. “It's spaceflight, it's risky, it's dangerous. Stuff can go wrong. But you’ve got to trust the hardware and the people, and I'm confident they're going to be fine.”Extending astronauts’ stays on the space station is something NASA has done before. In 2022, a Russian spacecraft that had flown NASA astronaut Frank Rubio and two Russian cosmonauts to the station sprung a massive leak, forcing Russia to send up a rescue craft to bring them home. As a result, Rubio’s planned six-month stay was doubled, giving him the record for the longest continuous stay in space for an American: 371 days.At first, he said, the extension was difficult. “It was challenging because you knew you’d be away from your family longer than anticipated,” he told NPR. “But you also knew that they were making the right decision as for our safety. … And so once you got over the initial shock and surprise, you just kind of focused on making the best of it and making sure that the mission was accomplished.”With that much time in space, he was able to truly adapt, he said, and get better at living and working in a weightless environment. He was, he told Space.com, “incredibly lucky in the fact that you’re able to take those lessons learned and immediately implement them. A lot of people have to wait five, six or 10 years [for a second mission] until they are able to implement those things that they just learned.”Before their flight on Starliner, Wilmore and Williams had waited years to return to space. Both are veterans of two previous spaceflights, with more than 500 days in space combined between them, and had been eager to return.Before the flight, Williams said in an interview she was aware that since this was a test flight she and Wilmore might be forced to improvise. “We do anticipate everything’s going to go as planned,” she said. “But if it doesn’t, we’ll take a moment and analyze it and talk about it, and we’ll be okay.

With such people, it is going to be very difficult to end the conflict.” She added: “All the windows will close shut.”For Russia, the tumult of Donald Trump’s presidency, his admiration for authoritarian rulers like Vladimir Putin and his bashing of NATO and the European Union, was a gift. Trump’s wild boast that he could end the war in Ukraine in a day suggested he could force Kyiv to surrender territory.And Biden, although he sent unprecedented military and financial aid to Ukraine, was appreciated by many Russian foreign policy hands as hailing from a Cold War era when Russia was feared as a superpower rival. They view Biden as a predictable actor who would not risk an escalation into direct hostilities with Russia and who understands and respects that Russia possesses a large nuclear arsenal. “Under Biden, there was at least an understanding of red lines,” Stanovaya said.Harris, largely unknown to the Russians, is viewed with alarm. “The deep state will lead under Harris,” said Sergei Markov, a Kremlin-connected political analyst.Ever since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the Kremlin has launched propaganda campaigns across the West aimed at undermining support for Ukraine, and promoting far-right isolationist views, internal Kremlin documents previously reported on by The Washington Post have shown.But Biden’s departure was the second recent unpleasant surprise for Russia in Western politics — following the unexpected defeat in the French parliamentary elections of the far-right party Moscow has backed as a political ally, National Rally.Some former Russian officials said they feared Harris’s candidacy was a sign the U.S. liberal establishment is engineering the elections to block right-wing isolationist forces. Given the Kremlin’s grip on Russian elections, some Russians struggle to believe elections can be fair and genuinely unpredictable, or to grasp the concept of coalition-building in parliamentary political systems.“Look at what happened in France,” said one close Putin associate, a former senior Russian official. Like others in this article, the former official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic relations.“There the so-called right-wing won by all indicators,” the former official said, referring to National Rally placing first in the first round of voting. “But then the far left joined with the government party and the faction with the most support was left without anything. Can this really be called democracy?”Liberal backers of the Democratic Party have “invested so much effort, they are not going to give up this field just like that,” the Putin associate said. “These people don’t make the same mistake twice.”The Kremlin has steered clear of publicly commenting on Biden’s departure. But propagandists inside Russia have begun pouring vitriol on Harris.  One TV host called her “crazy” and a leading academic, Andrei Sidorov, made a  racist comment, calling the biracial vice president “worse than a monkey with a grenade.”Although she is not known for deep involvement in foreign policy, Harris has called Russia’s war against Ukraine “barbaric and inhumane.”“No one is expecting anything good from her, since it’s considered she will be a hostage of the deep state and the level of uncertainty will more likely grow than lessen,” said a Russian academic with close ties to senior Russian diplomats. “Biden, however you view him, was a professional of the highest level in foreign policy. Kamala Harris will have difficulty competing with him here.”Trump was well-known for cultivating good personal relations with Putin, and has consistently advocated a more isolationist policy, questioning NATO’s relevance. This month, Trump said he is considering easing sanctions on Russia, while repeatedly claiming he would quickly bring Russia’s war to an end without saying how he would do so.But analysts and officials said they took a dim view of Trump’s ability to negotiate a deal and worried that he would be unpredictable.One Russian business executive said many in the Russian elite were nevertheless counting on Trump to restore relations. “They hope that if Trump wins, this would at the least mean an end to the escalation of sanctions and an end to the war — and a lowering of the risks for Russian business. No one wants to lose their money,” the executive said. “The Republicans don’t like Putin either, but they will be more pragmatic than the Democrats.”The Russian academic said longer-term hopes for change rested with Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, Trump’s running mate on the Republican ticket. Vance repeatedly has espoused a pro-Moscow isolationist line. He refused to call Putin an “existential threat to Europe” at this year’s Munich Security Conference, and in Congress, he opposed aid for Ukraine.“Vance is a very interesting figure,” the Russian academic said, noting Trump’s age of 78. “We still don’t know if Trump will make it to the end of his term if he is elected. It can’t be ruled out that Vance could become president. This would change a lot in U.S. politics.”Stanovaya suggested other ways Moscow could win. “The best scenario for Russia is if a U.S. leader appears who is strong enough to implement what he has proposed and can bring through Congress agreements that have been reached with Russia,” she said. “But this scenario is not viewed as possible at all. Putin wants what no one can give him.”“The next scenario, if this isn’t possible,” she said, “is that Moscow would rather everything burned down with a blue flame. There should be chaos.”"

WaPo_56,How Kamala Harris is tackling medical debt — with Roy Cooper’s help,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/07/26/vice-president-kamala-harris-medical-debt/,2024-07-26 19:00:05.191342,,"Vice President Harris has spent more than two years helping steer federal efforts to relieve the burden of medical debt — an initiative the likely Democratic nominee is touting as her presidential campaign takes shape.The vice president’s work to combat medical debt, which has received scant attention compared with her work advocating for abortion access and other priorities, could emerge as one of her signature policy accomplishments as she challenges former president Donald Trump. About 100 million Americans are affected by medical debt, advocates and officials estimate, saying it is a pocketbook issue that influences whether to seek health care, purchase a home and make other major decisions.“The Biden-Harris administration has done more to talk about medical debt than any other administration in history, and certainly Vice President Harris has really been at the forefront, often leading those efforts,” said Mona Shah, senior director of policy and strategy at the Community Catalyst Action Fund, a nonprofit health advocacy group.Working with officials at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other agencies, the Harris-led initiatives have sought to address a persistent problem that shadows patients with medical bills: the presence of unpaid medical debt on credit reports. As a result of those efforts, credit reporting agencies have removed medical bills from the credit reports of about 30 million Americans, a measure of relief even if patients still had to figure out a way to pay their debt.The administration also is proposing federal rules to ban credit reporting agencies from incorporating medical debt when calculating credit scores and to block medical debt from being used to evaluate borrowers’ fitness for mortgages and other types of loans. That rule is expected to be finalized next year, if Harris is elected president.The primacy of the issue was evident as recently as Wednesday, when Harris spoke to a national sorority convention in Indianapolis.“We believe in a future where the economy works for working people,” Harris said. “We are finally making it so that medical debt can no longer be used against your credit score.”While a record number of Americans now have heath insurance, patient advocates warn that medical debt continues to be a source of financial distress.“Our estimates are that for someone in the U.S. who gets a new cancer diagnosis, about 40 percent of them deplete their life savings almost in the first two years of cancer care,” said Karen E. Knudsen, chief executive of the American Cancer Society.Some researchers have concluded that reducing or eliminating medical debt may have little impact on individual behavior and finances, noting that many Americans rarely repay long-lasting medical debt.Benedic N. Ippolito, a senior fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, testified to Congress this month that federal initiatives such as removing medical debt from credit reports could have “relatively muted” effects, and he cautioned against taking additional steps to change how medical debt is treated.“Recent changes have already significantly reduced the impact of medical debts for many consumers,” Ippolito wrote in a text message to The Washington Post. “To me, there is a very strong argument for better understanding how these changes have played out before going further.”Colleagues who have worked with Harris on the initiatives say the vice president’s focus on medical debt echoes her work on issues such as tackling student debt and the mortgage crisis as California attorney general a decade ago.“I always see her thinking hard about the bills that consumers are facing, and what are the ways to lower those costs and how to make sure that debt is not blocking opportunities to advance the American Dream, especially when it comes to housing,” said Rohit Chopra, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Harris and her office are coordinating with North Carolina officials on a pilot project to forgive the medical debt of about 2 million people in that state. Under the proposed project, hospitals that take steps to relieve patients’ existing medical debt and adopt policies to prevent the accumulation of new debt would be rewarded with additional funding through the Medicaid program. Federal approval from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the project is expected Friday, according to three people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss forthcoming plans.Federal officials declined to comment on the status of North Carolina’s request.North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D), who said he briefly discussed Harris’s work on medical debt with her when she visited his state this year, said he believed North Carolina’s plan could be “a really big deal — if it works.” Some hospitals have raised questions about the initiative, suggesting they may not participate.“We think that if we can clear the deck with medical debt for low- to middle-income people, not only will that significantly relieve a burden for them, but it also can help make people healthier,” Cooper said. “They won’t have this fear of going to a doctor or going to a hospital if they needed.”Cooper, who The Post has reported is being vetted by the Harris campaign as her potential running mate, declined to comment on the prospect of joining Harris’s presidential ticket.“She has a lot of great people to choose from,” Cooper said. “I want her to pick the person that can help her win. I respect her process, and I don’t want to comment on that process.”Harris has backed efforts to use funds from the American Rescue Plan to buy medical debt from health providers — an initiative on track to forgive $7 billion for 3 million Americans by 2026, the vice president’s office said Thursday.Voters have repeatedly identified health-care costs as a priority ahead of this year’s presidential election. Seventy percent of adults said they worried about a medical or dental bill putting them into debt or worsening their existing debt, according to a poll released in February by KFF, a nonpartisan health-care research organization. Voters with financial struggles were more likely to say that Trump did more than President Biden to address health-care costs, the KFF poll found.Democrats have increasingly highlighted the issue of medical debt. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) this month convened a Senate hearing on the goal of eliminating medical debt, and local officials in New York, D.C., and other communities have partnered with Undue Medical Debt, a charitable group focused on relieving debt.Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) — who has also been floated as a potential Harris running mate, The Post has reported — signed legislation this month that would forgive nearly $1 billion in medical debt held by state residents. Pritzker also signed a state bill to ban medical debt from being included on credit reports, mirroring the federal effort.“This is just a very popular topic that we all have run out at the same time,” said Kody Kinsley, North Carolina’s health secretary.Democrats’ efforts to crack down on medical debt have drawn some criticism from the financial services industry and parts of the health system, worried about unintended consequences.The Biden administration’s plan to remove medical debt from credit scores “will increase the cost of medical care and force more upfront payments,” Scott Purcell, CEO of ACA International, the professional association for collection agencies, said in a statement last month. He added that reducing the incentive for people to pay their medical bills would harm health-care providers and “fundamentally alter the U.S. credit-based economy.”Allies and staff say Harris’s interest in combating medical debt dates to her time as California attorney general, when she helped defend the Affordable Care Act and its coverage expansion from legal challenges. Harris also tackled student debt at for-profit colleges, suing the now-defunct Corinthian Colleges.Chopra, who first worked with Harris when she was suing Corinthian, drew a comparison between medical and student debt, saying that a network of debt collectors and other companies have emerged to benefit from the explosion in both kinds of debt.“We really see that medical debt bears some eerie similarities to the run-up in student debt over a decade ago,” he said, warning that both create a “domino effect” that can harm other financial decisions.Harris in 2022 said she had “met so many people in so many communities in our nation who are struggling with this burden — many of whom are managing an illness or an injury at the same time and who stay up at night, staring at the ceiling, wondering if they will ever pay off their medical debt.”North Carolina’s pilot program to combat medical debt was conceived by Cooper and his staff after the state expanded Medicaid last year, officials said. Health leaders also observed how other states such as Illinois and Tennessee had received federal approval to put Medicaid funds toward their own health improvement efforts, drawing on those examples as they proposed their new approach to reward hospitals for combating medical debt.Kinsley, North Carolina’s health secretary, said he and his staff had coordinated their medical debt effort with Harris’s office, given her national attention on the issue.“I think our approach they saw as kind of a novel one that other states hadn’t thought of and could potentially be a model,” Kinsley said."

Like the previous Deadpool films and 2017’s Wolverine-centric “Logan,” this installment has extremely mature content for a Marvel movie. Expect constant bloody violence, strong language, suggestive references and dark humor. Gory scenes show decapitation, dismemberment, hand-to-hand combat, atomization, desecration of a corpse’s skeleton and more. “F---” is used in nearly every scene, plus “s---,” “a--hole,” “b----,” “c---” and a full range of creatively mashed-up curse words. Adult characters smoke, drink to excess and make drug references. The script also has plenty of crass sexual references, though fewer than in the previous Deadpool films (and there’s no nudity this time). Underneath all the gore and raunchy humor, the film (the 34th in the Marvel Cinematic Universe) embraces found family and teamwork, as well as redemption and courage.

The 11-year-old protagonist Kevin (Kal-El Tuck) travels back in time to important historical moments, including battles where he’s threatened by cannonballs and arrows. Expect lots of slapstick violence and implied deaths played for laughs. (A Stonehenge builder, for example, is flattened by an enormous stone.) While there are evil creatures, ominous scenes and peril, the series’s humor lightens the mood. It always seems like Kevin and the bandits will escape in the nick of time — and they do. Kevin’s parents tease and mock him while not understanding his obsession with history. Mild language includes “damn,” “oh my God” and insults like “stupid,” plus cursing-adjacent phrases such as “flipping heck” and the British slang “bloody.” Although the bandits are morally flexible at best, the show has positive messages about staying true to yourself, doing the right thing and being passionate about learning.

Characters (including, in one scene, Jane’s young sister) drink beer and wine. Expect a lot of swearing (“f---,” “damn,” “b----,” “s---head” and “hell”) and some sexual banter, plus scenes of kissing and simulated sex — though there’s little actual nudity beyond a man’s butt while he takes a shower. Infighting among royalty and commoners alike leads to some mild violence, including poisoning attempts and “dunking” (being tortured with water, a la the Salem witch trials).

WaPo_58,"Moses Ingram knows she killed it. (What’d you think, though?)",https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/2024/07/26/moses-ingram-lady-lake/,2024-07-26 19:00:05.191342,,"NEW YORKBefore the premiere of “Lady in the Lake” here earlier this month, Moses Ingram swears she’d been pretty Zen about her first starring role: “I was fine. I was fine. I was fine.”Production on the ’60s-set mystery wrapped two years ago. The Apple TV Plus project, set in Ingram’s native Baltimore, has been waiting patiently in the back of her mind ever since. It hit her just moments before she stepped onto the red carpet this month. “Oh,” says the 30-year-old actress. “People are going to watch it.”The anxiety, the nagging tug for approval, the industry’s reaction, the folks back in West Baltimore — all that swam around her stomach. A shot of Jack quelled the tidal wave of nerves. For a time.“I have a different sense of care around” this series, Ingram says. “It’s just special. It is home, you know.” She’s curled in the corner of a sofa after a photo shoot, dressed in gray sweats and a fuzzy sweater, exhausted but reflective.To put this rung of her climb into perspective, Ingram asks whether I’ve listened to rapper J. Cole’s “2014 Forest Hills Drive.” It didn’t matter to Cole, says Ingram, whether he won a Grammy (he didn’t) or whether anyone loved it. “He knew he made some of the best stuff of his life up to that point. And I feel like that. I really do.”Ingram has been stacking up knockout performances since her 2020 turn in “The Queen’s Gambit” (as Jolene, the tough and rock-solid friend of Anya Taylor-Joy’s chess prodigy). Now she’s straddling the line between supporting jaw-dropper and prestige-drama star. But there’s still that pit in her stomach, because this project hits different.Created by Alma Har’el and based on the Laura Lippman novel of the same name, “Lady in the Lake” is ostensibly about two very different women — one Jewish and one Black — navigating the seedy underbelly of Charm City circa 1966. But at its core, the story crisscrosses race, capitalism, patriarchy, parenthood, the very definition of storytelling and the cost of dreaming outside the lines.Natalie Portman co-stars as Madeline Schwartz (née Morgenstern), a Jewish housewife who goes nuclear on her nuclear family, blowing up her trad-wife life to fulfill her high school dream of becoming a reporter. Ingram plays Cleo Johnson, a Black mother of two whose dreams of overcoming her stifling circumstances are repeatedly cut short.Narrating the series from the great beyond, Cleo explains that she was punished for wanting more. The women’s lives collide when Madeline attempts to solve Cleo’s murder to earn herself an A1 byline and the respect that comes with it.Where Portman’s Maddie is uptight even as she becomes unwound, Ingram’s Cleo is chameleonlike, smoothly code-switching across Baltimore’s Black social strata. She moves through the world like a quiet storm.“I could just feel it immediately,” Ingram says of her connection to Cleo. “There’s this thing that we say, ‘Some things you get free.’” She didn’t have to reach far to access Cleo’s hunger and drive. “Cleo is a woman who dreamed big, but life has a real way of sticking it to you sometimes, you know?”It’s tricky to compare an actress to the character she plays on-screen. It’s performance, not autobiography. But the Cleo whom Ingram brings to life benefits from a natural force that the actress’s fans in the industry say sets her apart.“She runs really deep and there’s so much going on, even when she’s still,” says Scott Frank, creator of “The Queen’s Gambit,” for which Ingram received her first Emmy nomination.Playwright Dominique Morisseau witnessed how Ingram draws from a near-bottomless well of emotion earlier this year when the actress starred in the off-Broadway production of Morisseau’s “Sunset Baby.”“I think she has a very old soul. There’s something that’s been put in her from her family that she is carrying,” the writer says. She has “immediate access to something that’s deeper than the realm that we’re all playing on.”Nearly everyone who works with Ingram sees it. What worried Ingram — what still lingers in her mind — was even making it into the room.It wasn’t supposed to be Moses Ingram in “Lady in the Lake.” Lupita Nyong’o originally had the role but had to bow out because of logistical concerns. Ingram auditioned while on another Apple TV Plus production filming in Toronto. Behind the scenes, the creative team could not agree on Nyong’o’s replacement — until they got Ingram’s tape. Shooting had already started, and she barely had time to prepare before she was needed on set.“She knew Cleo. She didn’t need anybody to tell her who she was,” says Har’el, the show’s creator. “Anybody else would have been terrified, and I’m sure she was too. It’s hard to come in and take on such a complex character knowing who was supposed to play that. You feel like you have to prove yourself in a way, but there was none of that with her. From the first take, I knew we had a show.”Reviews of the seven-episode miniseries, which premiered July 19, have been split. Har’el’s adaptation is heavy on mood, bold choices and symbolism, with a plot that bobs and weaves in a way that can feel frustrating. But what critics do agree on is that Ingram’s performance stands out.The Hollywood Reporter called Ingram “fierce and compelling.” Time wrote that the actress’s “layered performance captures the character’s vulnerability as well as her intelligence and grit.” The Washington Post praised her “grounded brilliance and restraint.”When we spoke the day after the New York premiere, Ingram was in a prereview zone. All the actress knew was that this was a moment to be grateful for.“Really all anyone needs,” she says, “is for someone to say yes to them one time. I know so many ultra-talented actors that never get to show the full depth and range of what they have.” Now that she has more than a few yeses under her belt, Ingram is settling into another feeling: pressure. Would people like it? Would they like her in it?Sure, Ingram can possess J. Cole levels of self-satisfaction with the work. Since receiving her first rejection for “not having enough … whatever,” Ingram has worked hard to squash any creeping notions of inadequacy, separating her self-worth from whether she books a job. But this is acting. Ultimately, “you want someone to agree,” she says. “But I hate that. I hate that so bad. I hate that I gotta prove to somebody that I’m X or Y or Z.”Does she, at this point? This is the young actress who booked “The Queen’s Gambit” before graduating from Yale University’s storied master’s program in drama. Before that show became a sensation, Ingram was cast in Denzel Washington’s “The Tragedy of Macbeth.” She even got a crack at the Star Wars universe as a complex villain in Disney Plus’s “Obi-Wan Kenobi.” And she managed to deal with the online harassment and ugly racism that followed without breaking.Does the pressure to prove yourself ever go away? Or do you need that “I’ll show you” fire to keep going? Ingram is figuring it out.Frank, the “Queen’s Gambit” creator, describes Ingram as one of the greats, someone who can make him sit up and pay attention to words he’s read a thousand times. But he gets that impostor syndrome is real.“I would tell Moses to strap in,” he says. “When we’re in our heads a lot, we catastrophize and it’s hard to get comfortable,” Even the best question why they were chosen. Why they get to do this thing so many want to do. Why they got that one yes.The trick, Frank says, is to let the doubt “be the radio in the next room” — you can hear it but it doesn’t order your steps — because it’s inevitable. “That’s what’s going to happen being so good at what you do,” added Frank.So what kind of doubt are we talking about? For Ingram, she had faith in her talent. But she wasn’t sure she’d ever get the chance to put it on display.As a senior at Baltimore School for the Arts, Ingram felt adrift. She’d dreamed of attending Howard University, but even with financial assistance, she still couldn’t afford it. So instead she got an associate’s degree from Baltimore City Community College. The goal was to break into regional theater. “But it’s like a club,” she says, a very exclusive club. For years she worked odd jobs and kept auditioning. It wasn’t until she got into Yale’s drama school in 2016 that TV and film work seemed like a real possibility.As we chat, I suggest that much like Cleo, Ingram herself was a talented dreamer whose life could’ve easily gone left instead of right. Cleo dreamed of being a singer and couldn’t make it happen. Ingram dreamed of being an actor and did.“I never thought about that until just now. But yeah. I think it’s so sad,” says Ingram, who takes a beat before saying more. She wants to explain this place she’s in right now. On the precipice … of something. To break it all down, she turns to music again — this time, a show tune. There’s a song from 1977’s “Working,” based on Studs Terkel’s oral history of everyday Americans describing how they do their jobs — and, often, the dreams they carry with them. It’s called “If I Could’ve Been.”If they had just let me go/ where I was rarin’ to go/ when I was rarin’ to go back then/ God only knows what I woulda been.“And I know so, so many people who identify with that, and I think that is the thing, um … I’m sorry,” Ingram says before closing her eyes briefly. She takes a calming breath as she pinches the bridge of her nose, willing the tears gathering there not to fall. She wants to get this out.“On hard days in this business, I remember that this is the thing that I asked for and the thing that I went after,” Ingram says. “Like I remember wanting it so bad it hurt, you know?”So on days — not today — when the business of acting subsumes the art of acting, Ingram finds a way to suck “that s--- up and keep it pushing.” She laughs to herself and asks me to forgive her language.“But,” I offer, “that doesn’t make it any less hard.”“No,” Ingram says.What she loves is the work. Acting is Ingram’s church. Where she feels most attuned to God. “Lady in the Lake,” she says, was a divine experience. That may sound woo-woo, but it’s clear to Ingram that something bigger than her was at work.She thinks back to her high school graduation. Knowing that her friends would leave town in a few months was excruciating. “I remember sitting in the audience and being like, ‘I don’t know what I’m about to do,’” she says. When she walked out of the historic George Peabody Library after the ceremony, the sky was dark with rain. “‘God, what are you doing to me?’ I just remember being really sad, like, I don’t know what I’m going to do with my life.”Flash-forward 10 years. One of the on-location shoots for “Lady in the Lake” was at the Peabody. “I remember crossing that hall being like, ‘Hold up, this is crazy!’”“We were shooting scenes in places where I would wait for the bus. I think that’s how life works, right? You can’t see it in the moment, but somewhere it’s already written,” she says.“I thought forever that if I was going to be anything — do anything — I had to get out,” Ingram says. “Just for the most beautiful thing I’ve done to bring me right back.” She speaks with awe. And without a hint of doubt."
WaPo_59,"The world has changed, and Trump needs a mulligan",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/26/kamala-harris-donald-trump-race-reset-gop-reaction/,2024-07-26 19:45:05.191342,,"There are just over 100 days until the election, and Donald Trump is in a bad place.The former president is getting mad at his television and firing off random, late-night rage posts from his social media account.“Lyin’ Kamala Harris,” the 78-year-old Republican nominee posted about his 59-year-old opponent a few minutes before midnight on Monday, “has absolutely terrible pole numbers against a fine and brilliant young man named DONALD J. TRUMP!”Were those North Pole numbers or South Pole numbers? The brilliant young man didn’t say.Two hours earlier, Trump reposted back-to-back messages from supporters invoking the QAnon slogan for when members of the “deep state” will be rounded up in mass arrests: “Nothing can stop what is coming.”He pined for his former opponent. “It’s not over! Tomorrow Crooked Joe Biden’s going to wake up and forget that he dropped out of the race,” he posted, and then, the next day, “It’s a new day and Joe Biden doesn’t remember quitting the race.”He fumed about the turncoats at Fox News making him “fight battles that I shouldn’t have to fight” by allowing on its airwaves Democrats Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor, and “total sleazebag” Rep. Eric Swalwell (Calif.).From the Very Stable Genius’s jumbled mind tumbled conspiratorial thoughts (“Biden never had Covid”), vengeful thoughts (he will sue the Justice Department!), bizarre thoughts (it was his “GREAT HONOR” to “take a bullet for Democracy”) and aggrieved thoughts (Democrats caused the GOP “to waste a great deal of time and money” campaigning against Biden). Maybe he should sue them, too.A week earlier, after the failed assassination attempt, Trump was supposedly a “changed” man, uniting the country. But now, he poured on the insults: Rep. Jim Clyburn (S.C.), a long-tenured Black Democrat, is “not the brightest bulb”; ABC News, host of the next debate, is “such a joke” and “the home of George Slopadopolus”; Biden is crooked and sleepy; Harris is “Dumb as a Rock.”And he promoted a lengthy video of himself playing a round with golf pro Bryson DeChambeau. Trump could be heard breathing heavily after hitting his drives, even though he was using a golf cart. “You think Biden can do that?” he asked after landing his ball on the green.You think we care?The world has changed overnight, and Trump is going to need a mulligan.As Trump has been swinging, his new running mate has been swigging — with similarly awkward results. “Democrats,” Sen. JD Vance said at a rally in his Ohio hometown, “say it’s racist to do anything. I had a Diet Mountain Dew yesterday, and one today. I’m sure they’re going to call that racist, too.”The room was quiet, with some weak laughter.“It’s good,” Vance said. More weak laughter.In the quiet, Vance himself laughed, then said: “I love you guys.”It’s unclear why Vance anticipated that his opponents would find racism in his choice of soft drink. What they do tend to find racist is stuff that is racist. Such as:“The media propped up this president, lied to the American people for three years, and then dumped him for our DEI vice president,” Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) tweeted. He elaborated to CNN’s Manu Raju. Biden “said he’s going to hire a Black female for vice president,” Burchett falsely claimed. “When you go down that route, you take mediocrity. And that’s what they have right now as vice president.”“You’re suggesting she was a DEI hire?” Raju asked.“One hundred percent she was a DEI hire,” Burchett confirmed.Right. Vance, who has served 19 months in the Senate after writing a book and briefly dabbling as a venture capitalist, was picked by Trump on the merits. But Harris, who spent decades as a prosecutor, district attorney, attorney general and senator, became vice president because of diversity, equity and inclusion.It sure didn’t take Republicans long to go low. Rep. Harriet Hageman (Wyo.) told an interviewer that Harris is “intellectually, just really kind of bottom of the barrel. ... I think she was a DEI hire.”Rep. Burgess Owens (Utah), who is Black, joined in, telling Punchbowl News that Harris is “the greatest example of DEI.”Republican leaders have urged colleagues to resist their base instincts. But they don’t run the party. Fox News does. On Fox Business Network, host Larry Kudlow declared that Harris’s “whole history is DEI: diversity, uh, exclusion and, uh, equity, I mean, inclusion and equity.”And on Fox News, host Jesse Watters added the fiction that “the only reason Kamala is in The White House is because of the DEI deal Biden cut.”Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), talking to HuffPost’s Igor Bobic, scolded the offenders. “Are they just going to say if you’re not a White male, it’s a DEI candidate?”Apparently so.When campaigning for the Senate, Vance called Harris one of “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives” who were running the country. “The entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,” Vance said. (Harris has two stepchildren.) “And how does it make any sense that we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?”Other Republicans are testing alternatives to attacking Harris for being a cat woman of color.There’s the option of threatening violence. GOP state Sen. George Lang, a warm-up speaker at Vance’s Ohio rally, told the audience that “if we lose this one, it’s going to take a civil war to save the country.” He later apologized.They could make fun of Harris’s laugh, as the Republican National Committee has been doing, when it isn’t alleging a “coup” (against Biden) or a “coverup” (of his supposed dementia). “Kamala Harris brought her cackle to Milwaukee: ‘Good afternoon, Wisconsin! Ha ha ha ha!’” the party posted on X.They could attack her for being Biden’s “border czar,” even though she holds no such title and was tasked with addressing the root causes of migration, not border security. House Republicans this week used emergency procedures to pass a resolution “strongly condemning the Biden Administration and its Border Czar, Kamala Harris’s, failure to secure the United States border.” At the Rules Committee hearing on the bill, Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) requested that the resolution’s lead defender, Rep. Michael Guest (R-Miss.), tell him when Biden called Harris the “border czar.”“I didn’t draft the resolution,” Guest pleaded, and “I don’t know that I could point to a particular time that he’s used that phrase.”They could just make up other random things. Trump adviser Jason Miller posted on X that he was “hearing from Democrat insiders” — no doubt many of them speak candidly with Miller — that Harris will float Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) for defense secretary. Even this was plausible compared with Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) saying Harris “supports Hamas” and with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who speculated about a government “conspiracy to kill President Trump.”They could try to impeach Harris for high crimes and misdemeanors. Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) introduced such a resolution this week. On Fox Business, Ogles suggested that Harris would be weak on Russia and China, which “want to displace us as the world’s dominant predator.” (Trump, by contrast, would never be displaced as dominant predator.)They could echo Chinese government propaganda. “Chinese state media is reportedly slamming Vice President Kamala Harris’s performance in the White House as mediocre, saying she lacks the achievements and experience to serve as president,” Fox Business’s Maria Bartiromo told Rep. Mark Green (R-Tenn.) on air.“For once, I guess, I’m agreeing with China,” Green replied.Or they could just keep campaigning against Biden, as the RNC has been doing (“Biden shuffles out of his motorcade, mumbles incoherently...”). “Why haven’t the American people seen or heard from the president?” demanded Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.). “Where’s Biden?”Here he is: Addressing the nation from the Oval Office. “Nothing — nothing — can come in the way of saving our democracy,” the president said in his brief address. “That includes personal ambition.”It was a somber moment of patriotic sacrifice. And Trump shouted at the TV some more. “Crooked Joe Biden’s Oval Office speech was barely understandable, and sooo bad!” he posted.Vance is new at this. In his rallies, he laughs awkwardly at remarks from the crowd that can’t be heard by most in the room, or any on TV. “These people were telling jokes up in the front row,” he explained after his Diet Mountain Dew embarrassment. “You guys might not be able to hear it, but I’m getting caught up in it.”He’s very skilled at the most important part of the job, which is worshiping the boss. That’s how he got picked in the first place. “He probably does have an IQ of 210, but don’t tell him that,” Vance told a crowd this week. He even attested that Trump is “a good husband.”But Vance hasn’t quite found his voice when it comes to Harris. He tried suggesting that she’s been on the dole: “I don’t know, Kamala. I served in the United States Marine Corps and I built a business. What the hell have you done other than to collect a government check for the past 20 years?”Thus did Vance insult not just Harris but all public school teachers, cops and members of the military, who also “collect a government check.”He did better with his joke about Harris rising to the top of the ticket. “To the Democrats who are watching, please find some way to make Kamala vice president,” he said. “I was promised a debate with Kamala Harris, and that’s what I plan to get.”There’s probably more truth in that lament than Vance would like to admit. For months, Trump had gotten a pass because Biden, never a gifted orator, struggled to make a forceful case against Trump. But now, Trump faces a Democratic nominee who can make that case powerfully and succinctly.Harris did it twice this week, at Biden headquarters in Delaware and at a rally in Milwaukee. A 12-minute riff in her stump speech contains everything that needs to be said about Trump.Describing her years as a prosecutor, Harris says she “took on perpetrators of all kinds: Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump's type.”She goes on: “As attorney general of California, I took on one of our country’s largest for-profit colleges that was scamming students. Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students. As a prosecutor, I specialized in cases involving sexual abuse. Well, Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse. As attorney general of California, I took on the big Wall Street banks and held them accountable for fraud. Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud on 34 counts.”She lays out the Democratic agenda, then contrasts it with Trump advisers’ Project 2025 agenda — “I can’t believe they put that thing in writing” — which, she charges, includes cuts to Social Security and Medicare, tax breaks for billionaires and ending the Affordable Care Act. “We who believe that every person in our nation should have the freedom to live safe from the terror of gun violence, we’ll finally pass red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban,” she says. “And we who believe in reproductive freedom, we’ll stop Donald Trump’s extreme abortion bans because we trust women to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do.”As Harris delivers this speech, the crowd responds with something not seen in a long time at Democratic events: jubilation.Trump must recognize trouble, for he is backpedaling ever more furiously from Project 2025. “I have nothing to do with, and know nothing about, Project 25,” he protested of the effort by dozens of top Trump lieutenants to craft an agenda for his return to the White House.At a rally in Charlotte on Wednesday — his first since Biden bowed out — Trump responded to Harris’s tight indictment with a desultory sampling of potential attacks, as though he hadn’t yet found one that would stick. “So now we have a new victim to defeat, Lyin’ Kamala Harris,” he said, mispronouncing her name. “She is a radical left lunatic,” Trump proposed, also calling her a “a dopey stiff, the worst,” a “Marxist” and incompetent. He declared that Harris, who is married to a Jew, is “totally against the Jewish people.” He said she supports “the execution of a baby.” He proposed that, under Harris, “every week will bring a never-ending stream of illegal alien rapists, bloodthirsty killers, and child predators to go after our sons and our daughters.” What’s more, he said, she “couldn’t pass her bar exams.”The scattershot attack on Harris was interspersed with even stranger musings. He recalled that “I was supposed to be nice” after the assassination attempt, but “if you don’t mind, I’m not going to be nice.” He announced his intention to “form a massive dragnet to scour the nation for the monsters who are murdering and raping children all over the world.”He revisited the story of the shooting and claimed “record” ratings for the GOP convention. (They were actually low.) He repeated his tired nonsense about the 2020 election being rigged and called the FBI director, whom he appointed, “sick” for testifying that Biden does not seem cognitively impaired. (The director said also that it wasn’t clear whether Trump’s ear was struck by a bullet or shrapnel.)Trump again garbled words and at one point said he needed to be “getting back to a subject called Kamala” — but then went on for several more minutes about Biden. One moment he was talking about the Islamic State, the next he was claiming Democrats are trying to change the name of the Washington Monument.When he eventually did arrive back at his intended “victim,” he was no more coherent. “She’s got a new line,” Trump told the crowd — then repeated it. “Their campaign says, ‘I’m the prosecutor and he is the convicted felon.’ That’s their campaign. I don’t think people are going to buy it.”Because of Harris’s record on the border, “she shouldn’t even be allowed to run for president, what she’s done. She’s committing crimes,” said Trump.And we certainly can’t elect a president who commits crimes. Trump is due to be sentenced in New York on Sept. 18.Trump left the arena — and returned to his rage posting.He assailed the FBI chief some more and insisted that it was “a bullet that hit my ear, and hit it hard.” He complained about the polls Fox News was using (apparently they were favorable for “RADICAL LEFT MARXIST” Harris) and protested that the media was treating Biden like “the Late, Great Winston Churchill.” His campaign sent out a statement withdrawing his commitment to debate Harris.In need of a friend, he called in to “Fox & Friends” to inform them that, with Harris, “I’m dealing against real garbage,” and that he’s doing so well “we don’t need the votes, I have so many votes.”Yet there appeared to be some doubt, even among friends. Host Steve Doocy asked Trump “whether or not you feel you made the right pick” with Vance.  Brian Kilmeade asked if Harris calling him a convicted felon “gets under your skin.”Trump kept on raging. “Disgusting!” “Weaponized!” “Third World country!” “Banana republic!”Evidently, he can’t come up with anything else."
WaPo_60,NFL players want to modify media’s locker room access for privacy reasons,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/26/nfl-media-rules-locker-room-access/,2024-07-26 20:53:02.763765,,"Two seasons after the NFL reopened teams’ locker rooms to reporters following the coronavirus pandemic, player leaders would like to modify the locker-room access given to media members for privacy reasons.NFL Players Association officials say they are attempting to have the NFL’s media access policies adjusted to have reporters interview players in a different setting following games and during practice weeks.“What I was hoping to achieve on behalf of the membership is … to accurately articulate how they feel,” Lloyd Howell, the NFLPA’s executive director, said during a meeting this week with Washington Post reporters and editors. “And they do not want to be interviewed when they’re naked. [And] to open the door for doing some solutioning of what could be more effective.”The union has had discussions on the issue with the league and with the Pro Football Writers of America. Howell said the NFLPA is not attempting to keep reporters from doing their jobs or to reduce the amount of time during which players would be available to media members.“I’ve heard and I’ve seen all the reasons why the media is hesitant or resistant to changing it: [Players] duck out of the back. They don’t want to do the interview. The list goes on and on,” Howell said. “But there are other ways to kind of address those challenges, too. … The desire isn’t in any way to prevent [reporters from having access to players]. The desire is, ‘Let me be decent.’ ”It’s not clear whether the NFLPA will succeed in its attempt or, if it does, what the timing for the implementation of any prospective changes would be. A modification for the upcoming season seems unlikely, given that the NFL’s 2024 media policy already has been set and distributed. The league controls the sport’s media policies and, while it has expressed a willingness to listen to the players’ privacy concerns, it has not signaled an intention to make a change. The NFL declined to comment.The NFL continued to operate during the pandemic but, like other professional sports leagues, closed its locker rooms to reporters as part of its strict health protocols. Those protocols were formulated jointly by the NFL and the NFLPA for the 2020 and 2021 seasons, giving the union a say in media access during that period. Reporters conducted interviews virtually or, later, in news conferences or group settings outside the locker room. The league did allow some team-affiliated reporters into locker rooms during the 2021 season.The NFL dropped its coronavirus protocols entirely and reopened teams’ locker rooms to accredited media members in advance of the 2022 season. For the past two seasons, reporters have had access to players in locker rooms at stadiums following games and at teams’ practice facilities during the week leading up to games.But the NFLPA has raised privacy concerns in its attempt to have players interviewed in settings other than dressing areas.“We want to respect the players’ privacy to get dressed,” Calvin Watkins, a reporter for the Dallas Morning News who is the PFWA’s president, said by phone Thursday. “I don’t think any reporter wants to talk to a butt-naked player. However, there are already rules in place for the player to have privacy before doing the interview. We have reiterated that to the union.”The current NFL media policy says that player privacy in the locker room “is of paramount importance.” It calls for the locker-room shower area to be “screened from view” and says that teams must supply players with “wrap-around towels” or robes. The policy says that teams are “urged to take other measures” such as placing a pair of shorts in each player’s locker or building individual locker curtains. A team communications staffer is to inform players and coaches when the locker room is about to be opened to the media.The policy calls for players to be available to reporters after games and four times during a normal practice week, with open locker rooms for at least 45 minutes on each Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.Reporters say that being allowed into locker rooms is necessary for media members who cover teams regularly to be able to ask questions in non-group settings while developing relationships with players and building sourcing to produce more insightful, exclusive and groundbreaking reporting.“We have a tremendous amount of respect for the players and we want to make sure they are comfortable doing interviews,” Watkins said. “However, we have a job to do and that’s to be in the locker room. I really like Lloyd. I really believe he wants what’s in the best interests of everyone involved. And hopefully down the line, this issue will not be an issue.”The PFWA informed its members recently that the union had suggested having players and media members interact in a designated mixed zone outside the locker room, similar to the system utilized in international soccer and at the Olympics. There also were discussions about potentially extending the waiting period after games (currently 10 to 15 minutes) before locker rooms are opened to the media.Howell said this week that the differing views are “to be expected” because of the current guidelines.“It’s a challenge to the model where the model is, ‘I want to be in the dressing room with individuals that are in varying degrees of undress with a microphone and a camera because I’m going to be able to do my job most effectively,' ” Howell said. “And where the players are is, ‘I definitely want to engage with the media. But I’d like to have the opportunity to be decent. I’d like to be dressed. I’d like to, you know, get my thoughts together and then conduct the interview.’ ”Howell said that he “could potentially give [reporters] more access” with a revised model, adding: “But we’re holding on to artifacts of what happened a long time ago and trying to carry it forward.”The NFLPA raised its privacy concerns to the NFL in January, according to a person familiar with the discussions. NFL representatives rejected the union’s request then to close teams’ locker rooms to media members, according to that person. The two sides left open the possibility of that dialogue resuming at some point but there have been no further discussions between them on the topic, the person said.It’s not clear whether the issue could be raised again during a broader set of deliberations between the league and union involving other topics. The two sides have begun discussions, Howell said, about the latest effort by the league and the NFL’s team owners to get the NFLPA to agree to an 18-game regular season, perhaps before the current collective bargaining agreement expires after the 2030 season. The NFLPA, meanwhile, plans to deliver a proposal to the league to reconfigure the offseason calendar by eliminating teams’ voluntary on-field workouts in the spring in favor of a longer ramp-up period for players leading into training camps in the summer.The NFL long has granted regular access to reporters as a means of promoting the league. But the need for such promotion perhaps has decreased as traditional media outlets have struggled to retain their audience and influence. The NFL and teams, meanwhile, sold their broadcasting rights in 2021 for more than $110 billion over 11 years. In addition to its broadcast partners, the league has its own television channel, NFL Network, and teams have in-house reporters who post content online and on social media.Howell said the existing media policy allows for reporters’ interviews with players to be conducted outside the locker room and “that could be an outcome.” But the NFLPA will continue to seek a broader solution, he said.“Beyond saying, ‘Hey, this is an issue to us,' [the players] want to be part of some solutioning that, you know, is a win-win, where they will do the interview, where [reporters] will have access,” Howell said. “But at the same time, ‘Respect my space.’… That’s really it. And I’m hopeful that we’ll make progress.”"
WaPo_61,Biden administration declines to defend affirmative action programs,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/26/affirmative-action-sba-mbda-biden-court/,2024-07-26 20:16:02.763765,,"On his first day in office, President Biden ordered federal agencies to adopt a broad “racial equity agenda,” one that would increase investment in communities of color, enable agencies to hold diversity trainings and expand opportunities for minorities to tap billions in government contracts.But in the past year, the administration has backed down from defending two affirmative action programs that had been at the core of its efforts to “deliver racial justice,” as Biden put it in his 2021 inaugural speech. Both programs, instituted nearly a half century ago or more, had been upended by court decisions.The legal retreat marks a major turn in the nation’s years-long debate over racial preferences. Both initiatives had been intended to expand economic opportunities for racial minorities: The Minority Business Development Agency helps participating companies access capital and other resources, while the other, run by Small Business Administration, opens pathways to billions in federal contracting dollars.But in each case, after judges ruled that racial preferences were unconstitutional, the Justice Department opted not to appeal the rulings, choosing instead to quietly undo fundamental aspects of the programs’ missions.“It’s pretty simple — they aren’t appealing because they will lose,” Dan Lennington, a lawyer with the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, which represented the plaintiffs in the case against the Minority Business Development Agency case in Texas, said in an email. “And losing at a higher court is worse because it would create important precedent and accelerate challenges to other programs. … Their litigation strategy appears to be containment — they want to prevent the wholesale dismantling of Biden’s racial equity agenda before he leaves office.”Asked about the court cases, a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because some of the litigation is ongoing, said that “we review every decision carefully to decide on the right path to achieving our core goal of achieving a level playing field for everyone.” The official said the judges in those adverse decisions “ignore the reality that the playing field for many entrepreneurs still is not equal.”The administration’s decision to forgo appeals disappointed some representatives of minority-owned businesses.“Once we capitulate to some basic tenets of equity, I think we become complicit to the goal of those who are trying to dismantle and decimate [diversity and inclusion] initiatives and programs,” said Lenwood V. Long Sr., chief executive of the African American Alliance of CDFI (community development financial institutions) CEOs, a coalition of leaders intent on building “power in Black communities by challenging and influencing financial sectors to operate more equitably.”The court retreats come amid a multi-front legal battle between the Biden administration, which has promoted racial equity efforts, and a phalanx of conservative legal groups which have been motivated, in large part, by a Supreme Court more inclined to uproot racial preferences in academia and government.During Biden’s first three years in office, the White House sought to create more programs tailored to minorities. Federal contracts for “small disadvantaged companies” — a category largely composed of minority-owned businesses — climbed nearly 30 percent, from $59 billion to $76 billion, government figures show.Biden also signed major pieces of legislation that allotted benefits based on racial preferences. Provisions in the American Rescue Plan, for example, prioritized racial minorities in the distribution of $28.6 billion for restaurants, $4 billion to help farmers repay their loans, and as much as $4 billion in assistance for homeowners. Almost immediately, those programs came under legal attack from conservative public interest law firms. During the Biden administration, conservative legal groups have filed more than a dozen lawsuits challenging racial preferences in federal programs.Many of the challenges from conservatives have succeeded, while the outcome of others are pending. Meanwhile, scores of state programs that carve out preferences for minorities also are at risk. There is no comprehensive list of the programs, but they permeate the federal government and range from the very small, like internships, to multibillion-dollar initiatives tethered to government contracts. Most federal agencies — including Commerce, Transportation, Agriculture and Energy — have civil rights offices or disadvantaged business programs that oversee diversity programs.Legal scholars agreed with Lennington’s assessment that the Justice Department risked losing on appeal, which runs the risk of a loss in a higher court that would set precedents disqualifying other diversity programs.By far the largest program that uses racial preferences is the so-called “8(a) program,” which is run by the SBA but affects almost every aspect of the bureaucracy. It is one of the key programs now under legal attack.It enables designated small companies to win set-asides and sole-source contracts that can be worth millions. To be eligible, a company must be majority-owned by people who are both socially and economically disadvantaged. People who are Black, Hispanic, Asian or Native American qualify as socially disadvantaged.In making the case for its expansion, the White House noted that less than 10 percent of federal agencies’ contracting dollars typically go to small disadvantaged businesses.The program is “one of the most effective economic instruments … to achieve this commitment to underserved communities,” the SBA reported to Congress.Across the government, contracts with small disadvantaged businesses have risen nearly 30 percent during the Biden administration, though some demographics saw bigger increases than others. Federal contracts for Black-owned companies rose 9 percent, from $9.4 billion to $10.2 billion. Among companies owned by Asian Americans, they rose 31 percent to $20.5 billion. Native American firms recorded a 54 percent jump, to $23.3 billion.After a White entrepreneur challenged the 8(a) program, a federal judge in Tennessee ruled that the government could not give preferential treatment to people based on race, despite what the government has identified as long-standing barriers to wealth faced by minorities. The judge found that the programs’ use of broad racial categories to direct benefits to minorities violated the Constitution’s equal protection clause, which echoed the Supreme Court’s decision in overturning affirmative action in college admissions.The Justice Department declined to appeal the SBA ruling when it was rendered last July. Instead, the SBA scrambled to come into compliance with the court order that it could no longer presume certain minorities were disadvantaged. It’s now having applicants prove their disadvantage through essays.Though the government could still appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, the agency appears to have adapted to the July injunction, having formalized the essay-writing process and training new staff to read the narratives.“This does seem to be functioning,” SBA Administrator Isabel Casillas Guzman told The Washington Post. “And we’re moving forward with this process and still able to really onboard people who have faced disadvantage in this country.”The plaintiff, a White female contractor who alleges she lost out on contracts because of 8(a) preferences, is challenging the SBA’s implementation of the essay-writing process, arguing the program did not fully comply with the injunction. She questions whether the process is less rigorous for participants that previously benefited from the presumption.The government argues that is not the case. While it has so far opted not to appeal the injunction, it continues to oppose the plaintiff’s request that the court further restrict the program.The other court case, brought by three White entrepreneurs in Texas, concerns the Minority Business Development Agency — a 55-year-old program established to help minority-owned businesses access capital and government contracts.A Texas judge ordered the agency to open its doors to all races, including White people, in March.The Justice Department is not appealing. In a June 28 letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar wrote that, while the Justice Department is committed to defending the programs, “it would not be in the best interests of the United States to seek further review of the district court’s judgment in this particular case.”Prelogar did not provide further explanation, other than characterizing the decision as narrow in scope with minimal impact on the agency’s mission — though that mission has been broadly expanded to include everyone, not just minorities.“The injunction does not currently prevent MBDA from continuing to fulfill its mission, which is our fundamental priority,” Commerce Department Secretary Gina Raimondo and Deputy Secretary Don Graves said in a joint statement acknowledging the Justice Department’s decision not to appeal.If the administration had chosen to appeal, the case would have been heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which is composed of a majority of Republican-appointed judges and is fast gaining a reputation as one of the most conservative appeals courts in the nation.Legal experts characterized the Justice Department’s backing down on both cases as a sort of cost-benefit analysis that found long odds of winning in conservative-leaning appeals courts.“They might well want to avoid a holding that goes far in undermining or even striking down other programs that serve historically discriminated-against minorities,” said Noah Feldman, a constitutional law professor at Harvard University. “Or they could fear that an appeals court would go further than the district court and find there was insufficient evidence of prior discrimination here, with implications for other programs.”Biden administration programs for minorities faced setbacks when conservative groups challenged elements of the American Rescue Plan in 2021. One of them was a $29 billion SBA grant program for restaurants struggling during the pandemic, which prioritized businesses owned by women, veterans and minorities.In May 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit found the program violated the Constitution’s equal protection clause, forcing the SBA to drop its race- and sex-based preferences.Since then, a number of cases challenging race-based government programs have cited the case against restaurant aid in the American Rescue Plan — Vitolo v. Guzman — as a precedent for the unconstitutionality of race-based preferences.In June 2021, a federal judge in Florida temporarily blocked the $4 billion debt relief program for minority-owned farms, also authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act — one of several preliminary injunctions blocking the program after it saw a flood of challenges. The Justice Department did not appeal any of the temporary orders. Before the cases could advance to a stage where courts could decide on permanent remedies, Congress repealed the debt relief program when it passed the Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022. The new debt relief program focused on economic need, rather than race. The cases were dismissed.More recently, in June, a federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked an Agriculture Department disaster relief program from giving preferences to minority and female farmers.As with the others, the government has not appealed."
WaPo_62,Lost dog survived in deep woods nearly two months: ‘She defied the odds’,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2024/07/26/lost-dog-rescue-woods-wyoming/,2024-07-26 20:06:02.763765,,"Tim Paul was making an early-morning work stop near his home in Park County, Wyo., and he had his dog Jade with him. When Paul opened his car door, Jade unexpectedly bolted out — fast and far into the wilderness. She got spooked by loud machinery and trucks driving by.Paul gave chase.“He chased her for about three-quarters of a mile, and she was gone,” said Paul’s wife, Laura Wilderman.The two live with their four rescue dogs about a half-an-hour drive from where Jade ran off in Little Buffalo Basin.“This area in Wyoming is just deep, deep woods. There isn’t anything around,” Wilderman said, explaining that she began to panic thinking about Jade on the run in the area, which has roaming grizzly bears, mountain lions, coyotes and other wild animals.Jade was having a bad reaction to an allergy medication — she had a facial swelling and a loss of appetite — and Paul was planning to bring her to the vet as soon as it opened that day, June 4. After Jade sprinted off, Paul searched the woods for hours, then slept in his truck overnight.When he turned up empty, the couple decided to put their lives on hold to search for Jade, a Boxer they rescued in 2022. They went looking for her in the woods every day, and Wilderman took a leave from her job as a flight attendant.They took out radio ads, posted all over social media and put posters up around town offering a $1,500 reward. They hired a scent-tracking dog to help sniff her out.The couple was especially concerned given how timid their pup is. Even if someone was able to find her, they said, she probably would not go close enough to a person to be caught.“She always was a little skittish,” said Wilderman, noting that Jade was a breeding dog and when they first got her, she wasn’t well socialized. “If you were eating a meal and dropped a fork on the table, she’d run.”“We spent every single waking moment trying to find her,” said Wilderman, whose phone began to ring with strangers volunteering to help. People in the community joined the rescue effort.Ryan Lawler, a local sheriff’s deputy, read about the missing dog on Facebook and offered to use his personal drone to help search for her. He spent three of his days off trying to track down Jade.“I’m an animal lover, and when something like that happens, I feel bad for the owners,” said Lawler, 49, adding that he has used his drone to help find missing animals a few times in the past. “It’s just something I like to do.”Wilderman and Paul were stunned by the outpouring of support.“Those people were rockstars,” she said.Still, after several weeks, there was no sign of Jade.“We didn’t think we would get her back,” said Wilderman.But they finally got a sliver of hope last week, when Tobias Cortner, 31, who works at a local ranch, spotted Jade on a trail camera he was monitoring. She was gnawing on an animal carcass.A few days later, he got about 20 feet away from Jade, and as soon as she saw him, she bolted once again.“It’s pretty open out here; there’s not much of any kind of civilization. … It’s random that she happened to show up,” said Tobias, who called Wilderman and Paul to let them know their dog was alive and in the area.He had seen posters of Jade in town and recognized her.Knowing exactly where Jade had been, the couple hatched a plan. They put out a large humane trap they borrowed, as well as food — including cat food, since it has a stronger smell than dog food, and treats — to lure Jade in.“That’s the only way we were going to get her,” Wilderman said, adding that they also put out some of their clothes so Jade could smell them and perhaps be comforted.Their plan was temporarily hindered when ranchers dumped a dead cow in the forest. Since the dead animal would attract grizzly bears, posing a major threat to Jade, Wilderman frantically phoned a nearby ranch and they agreed to move the dead animal.On the Tuesday morning — exactly seven weeks after she first ran off — Jade wandered into the trap, as they had hoped, and it closed on her. They had her.“I can’t believe it’s actually her and she survived,” Wilderman said between tears. “She defied the odds.”Despite being disheveled and slightly frail, Jade was quickly back to her usual self.“She just ran upstairs, filthy dirty, jumped in bed, snuggled and had a great meal,” said Wilderman. “She has not skipped a beat. She’s got a pep in her step.”Jade also seemed elated to be reunited with her animal siblings.“Our other dogs were so excited to see her,” Wilderman said.Jade had worms, but other than that, she got a clean bill of health from her vet.Considering what she has been through, “she is doing amazing,” Wilderman said. “She is resilient, that’s for sure.”Jade’s safe return was a relief for the whole community — especially those who took the time to help find her.“I was very excited,” said Lawler. “It’s a miracle.”Although losing their dog for months was awful, Wilderman said, they are filled with gratitude for their community.“I feel like I have a lot of new friends through this whole process,” she said.It also served as a reminder that — even when it seems impossible — happy endings can happen.“It’s such an incredible, long-shot story,” Wilderman said."
WaPo_63,"164,000-acre Park Fire was started by flaming car, Calif. officials say",https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/26/park-fire-california-chico-arrest/,2024-07-26 20:19:02.763765,,"Northern California’s massive Park Fire continued to grow overnight, fueled by wind and dry, hot weather. The wildfire, which authorities believe was an act of arson, reached more than 164,282 acres by early Friday and was only 3 percent contained. It is California’s largest this year.Butte County fire chief Garrett Sjolund told a news conference Thursday that the fire “quickly began to outpace our resources because of the dry fuels, the hot weather, the low humidity, and the wind.” Gusty winds and dry conditions were predicted for the region until at least late Friday, with a National Weather Service Red Flag warning for critical fire weather conditions in effect.The fire started about 3 p.m. Wednesday and “exploded from a 400-acre fire to a more than 71,000-acre inferno consuming everything in its path” overnight into Thursday, Cal Fire said on social media. By late Thursday it was burning across more than 145,000 acres in Butte and Tahoma counties and had produced several fire tornadoes.About 4,400 residents were under evacuation orders, including the communities of Cohasset and Forest Ranch and areas in northeast Chico, authorities said. There had been two minor injuries, and photos showed multiple homes damaged or destroyed.District Attorney Michael L. Ramsey said Chico resident Ronnie Stout, 42, would be arraigned Monday on to-be-determined charges related to arson. Investigators allege a witness saw him pushing a flaming car off an embankment in upper Bidwell Park, starting the blaze.“She saw him get into the vehicle, do something in the vehicle, get out of the vehicle, and then push the flaming vehicle down the embankment,” Ramsey told reporters. “ We are here today because of that.” He said the vehicle was Stout’s mother’s car.Stout was arrested early Thursday on a no-bail warrant, Ramsey said.Butte County has repeatedly been ravaged by deadly and destructive wildfires. The Camp Fire nearly incinerated the town of Paradise in 2018, killing 85 people. On Friday, residents of Paradise were on edge after authorities told them to prepare to evacuate, because of the nearby Park Fire.In 2021, the Dixie Fire, which was sparked by PG&E power lines, devastated the town of Greenville and ended up burning nearly 1 million acres, the second-largest fire in state history. Earlier this month, the Thompson Fire near Oroville destroyed or damaged dozens of structures, and burned more than 3,700 acres before fire crews contained it.So far this year, 4,367 fires have erupted in California, burning 343,253 acres. These ignitions have come from a mix of causes — including lightning and arson. Scientists say that climate change is a driving force in making wildfires more explosive in California, and around the world."
WaPo_64,Video of police kicking man on ground at U.K. airport sparks protests,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/26/manchester-airport-police-video-brutality/,2024-07-26 21:33:02.823388,,"LONDON — A video clip showing a British police officer kicking a man in the head as he lies face down at an airport has sparked protests and accusations of police brutality and racism.Video footage of the Tuesday incident at Manchester Airport shows a White male officer pointing a Taser at a man lying on the floor. The officer kicks the man, who appears to be of South Asian heritage, in the face and stomps on his head, before kneeling on him.The officer then approaches another man, who is sitting on a chair and has his hands behind his head, appearing to tell him to get on the ground. The man kneels on the ground, and the officer then stomps on his thigh and hits him in the head.The incident has led to shock and outrage in England, where police officers are not routinely armed, and are expected to use force only when necessary. Various police forces have faced accusations of racism — and previous allegations of police brutality have sparked protests or riots that have swept the country.The unnamed male officer has been suspended and removed from all duties, and the incident has been referred to an independent police complaints watchdog, according to the Greater Manchester Police.“We know that a film of an incident at Manchester Airport that is circulating widely shows an event that is truly shocking,” Assistant Chief Constable Wasim Chaudhry  said in a statement.“The use of such force in an arrest is an unusual occurrence and one that we understand creates alarm.”Chaudhry said police had been responding to “reports of an assault” at the airport before the footage shown. “During our response, three officers were assaulted. One female officer suffered a broken nose and the other officers … suffered injuries which required hospital treatment,” he said, adding that four men had been arrested on suspicion of assault, or obstructing police.Hundreds of protesters joined demonstrations in the area this week, some calling for the police force to be dismantled, or holding anti-racism banners, according to local media reports.The lawmaker for Rochdale, Paul Waugh, said in a statementthat he had spoken to the family involved in the incident, who were his constituents, “and it is clear they are deeply traumatised by what happened.” He said the family, which he did not name, had asked for privacy.Waugh called for accountability and said police officers were not “above the law,” while stressing that the family had told him to “appeal for calm” and had underscored that they had “no political agenda … and do not want to take part in any protests.”“While there is clearly deep concern about this incident, there is also a vital need not to let extremists of any kind hijack these events for their own ends,” Waugh added, noting that the family had members working in the police force. He also expressed concern for the injured female police officer.A lawyer for the family, Akhmed Yakoob, labeled the incident “police brutality” and called for “justice.” He told reporters that the family is “traumatized” and that a scan revealed one of the men had a cyst on his brain.The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, described the video footage as “disturbing,” and said it was right the officer involved had been suspended. However, he cautioned that the event was not “clear cut,” saying he had seen evidence of “the full situation as it escalates” and that “there are issues on both sides,” as he called for calm.Incidents of police use of force have been a flash point in the past — most notably in 2011, when the shooting of a Black man, Mark Duggan, in London sparked riots that were described as the United Kingdom’s worst civil unrest in a generation. The clashes began in London, but also spread to several other cities, including Manchester.Protests also erupted in 2020 in the United Kingdom in solidarity with U.S. protests following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.The Greater Manchester Police Force has been the subject of reports and allegations of racism.A 2021 report found that Black people were more likely to be arrested, Tasered and searched by Manchester police than White people, while an equality adviser said in 2023 the force was still “perpetuating racial discrimination.”Elsewhere in the country, an official review last year found evidence of racism, misogyny and homophobia in London’s Metropolitan Police force, recommending that the force undergo a dramatic overhaul to address deep-seated issues. The Met police force commissioned the review after an officer admitted to kidnapping, raping and murdering a woman walking home, Sarah Everard, in 2021."

WaPo_66,How to grill vegetables and bring out their best flavors,https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2024/07/26/how-to-grill-vegetables-tips-equipment/,2024-07-26 21:00:02.823388,,"If you have ever tasted grilled shiitake mushrooms in an izakaya in Japan or enjoyed blistered padrón peppers in one of Spain’s tapas bars, you know there are many joys to grilling vegetables. As an Aussie, barbecue is ingrained into my culture, but it’s my world travels that have helped me step up my skills when it comes to grilling vegetables.Sure, anyone can throw a shrimp or steak on the barbie, but what about vegetables? My friend chef Johan Eriksson of Centrum Krog in Piteå, Sweden, tells me the keys to grilling vegetables are practice and timing: “Get to know your grill … and you will find that your vegetables are sweeter, juicier and even richer in taste than boiling and steaming them.”With summer produce season in full swing, here are my top tips for grilling vegetables.The options for grilling vegetables are endless, so be brave and don’t limit yourself to just large chunks of zucchini, onion and peppers this season. Mushrooms are a favorite of mine, but Brussels sprouts and snow peas are just as delightful with their natural juices that are released when kissed by a flame. Chef Ross Lusted of Woodcut in Sydney recommends vegetables that are naturally high in sugar, such as sunchokes, which caramelize beautifully on the grill.Cruciferous vegetables and salad greens do well when blistered as large wedges over high heat. I love charring large kale leaves on the grill before tossing them in a Caesar-style dressing, and Eriksson tells me that even cabbage and Little Gem and iceberg lettuces make for great warm salads when served with a zingy yogurt dressing, roasted garlic and a generous shower of grated hard cheese. Harder root vegetables, such as beets, parsnips and pumpkin, can also go on the grill, but your best bet is to wrap them in foil and slow-roast over an indirect flame so that they are tender in the middle when tested with a skewer or knife.Long tongs are a must for me when grilling vegetables so that I don’t get my forearms singed when reaching to the back of the grill, but one of my favorite tools is a cast-iron pan, which I preheat on the grill before putting in lightly greased vegetables. It reduces the risk of losing vegetables through the grates and minimizes cleanup without losing that charred flavor. For similar reasons, try using a perforated frying pan or wire rack, chef Axell Torres of Osborn House in Bundanoon, Australia, says. “The pan allows the smoke to circulate and give you that smoky flavor, yet you have greater control over smaller vegetables and do not lose them through the grill grates,” he says. A grill basket is another similar option.Skewers, as in Grilled Antipasto on a Stick, are also handy. Just remember to soak your wooden skewers in water for 20 to 30 minutes so they don’t burn, and make sure you cut all your vegetables into similar size chunks so they cook evenly.To keep them from sticking to the grates, I lightly toss vegetables in a neutral oil and prefer to avoid anything with a lower smoke point, such as extra-virgin olive oil, which can burn and make vegetables taste bitter. Don’t mask the flavor of the vegetables with too much fat, but that doesn’t mean you can’t baste your vegetables while they are on the grill. Eriksson, for example, uses brown butter on his charred cabbage.Cooking is about using your senses, and the same goes for grilling veggies. “When the vegetables start to give off a nice aroma, it’s a good sign that they’re ready to eat,” says chef Yuki Kugota of Megu in Gstaad, Switzerland. Use your finger to gently press the vegetables, or even run a paring knife through the center of roasted beets and other root vegetables to check for doneness. If the vegetables offer no resistance and release juices, they are most likely done.Be sure to take into account residual cooking. Since most vegetables are full of water, they will steam from the inside and continue to cook when removed from the heat, so consider pulling them off the grates slightly before you think they’re done.Here’s something I learned from Korean barbecue: Create a tiered cooking system. Rather than throwing vegetables and thinly sliced cuts of beef on the grill and letting them either burn there or in my mouth, I use indirect and direct heat, which helps control the speed at which vegetables cook. Just like with steak, I always start my vegetables on the hottest part of the flame and flip before moving them to a lower heat to either continue cooking or keep warm until I’m ready to serve them.To take your vegetables to the next level, try creating smoke. Chef Jon Oskar Arnason of Bryggargatan in Skellefteå, Sweden, suggests intensifying the flavor without the use of wood chips. “The trick is to capture smoke — not the black smoke from your marinade but those from the natural juices that drip out of your vegetables,” Arnason says. If you have a lid on your grill, keep it closed while slow-roasting harder vegetables, but if you don’t, invert a large metal bowl over them.For the simplest grilled vegetables, I drizzle a generous amount of cold-pressed Italian olive oil, add a splash of red wine vinegar and season with salt and pepper while they’re still warm. In Japan, grilled vegetables, such as baby leeks, are eaten directly off the grill and dipped in salt or soy sauce.Put grilled vegetables to use in a wide variety of dishes. Toss in salads or grain bowls. Use as pizza toppings. Add to quiche, frittata or a Spanish tortilla. I look to Italy and stuff grilled vegetables with buffalo mozzarella in crusty rolls. For heartier meals, I throw mixed grilled vegetables, including eggplant and peppers, in a spicy fish head Singapore curry sauce. The possibilities are so numerous and delicious that I grill more vegetables than I need just to have an excuse to use up the leftovers."

WaPo_68,Arson attacks target France’s high speed trains hours before Olympics,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/26/france-rail-disruptions-scnf-olympics/,2024-07-26 21:00:02.823388,,"PARIS — High-speed train lines in France were targeted by arson attacks early Friday, French officials said, causing massive travel disruptions hours before the Opening Ceremonies of the Paris Olympic Games.Gabriel Attal, the French caretaker prime minister, said that “acts of sabotage” were carried out in a “prepared and coordinated manner” and “nerve centers were targeted which shows a certain knowledge of the network to know where to strike.”It was not immediately clear who was behind the suspected attacks and authorities did not announce any arrests. The public prosecutor’s office opened an investigation within its organized crime framework rather than a counterterrorism inquiry, indicating that range of individuals or groups — including political activists — could be responsible.Nobody was reported to have been injured, but French officials said the impact for travelers and the country’s reputation ahead of the Olympic Games are severe.“The consequences on the rail network are massive and serious,” Attal said in a post on X, adding that “our intelligence services and law enforcement are mobilized to find and punish the perpetrators of these criminal acts.”Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, however, asserted that the attacks would have “no impact” on the Opening Ceremonies set for Friday evening because the transportation networks inside the city were unaffected.By early Friday afternoon local time, traffic on some impacted train lines had started to resume, state-owned railway company SNCF said, with a third of trains running on the Atlantic line and delays of an hour elsewhere.France’s railway network was an obvious target ahead of the Opening Ceremonies. For weeks ahead of the Olympics, tickets into and out of Paris were unavailable for purchase for this Friday, with SNCF citing a lack of clarity about security measures.SNCF said Friday’s “malicious acts” targeted three of its high-speed train lines, just as about 250,000 people were expected to travel Friday and 800,000 during the weekend.“Arson attacks were started to damage our facilities,” SNCF said. Its Atlantic, Northern and Eastern high-speed lines were affected, it said, and advised customers to postpone travel. SNCF said it also prevented another “malicious act” targeting the Southeast line. It noted that some disruptions are expected to last until Monday.The last weekend of July is usually one of France’s busiest travel periods, as Parisians head off for vacation. Unlike in normal years, many travelers were also expected to head  into the capital city, as well, to attend the Opening Ceremonies or Olympic competitions in the coming days.“We have damage and intentional fires in pipes where a lot of cables pass, cables that are used for signaling,” Jean-Pierre Farandou, the head of SNCF, told reporters. “They must be repaired, cable by cable. It’s very delicate work.”Before railway traffic can resume, Farandou said, all repaired signals will also need to be tested. “It takes time,” he said.The Paris public prosecutor’s office said Friday that authorities are investigating “intentional damage caused to SNCF sites during the night of July 25 to 26.” The prosecutor’s office is looking into charges including  “damage to property affecting the fundamental interests of the nation” and “attacks on an automated data processing system.” Each of these potential charges could carry a long prison sentence.Jean Castex, the head of the Paris transport system and a former French prime minister, has ordered an “increased level of vigilance” across the capital region’s network. “We are deploying on all terrains,” he said, according to the French public broadcaster, with a particular focus “on the sensitive sites of our networks.”The Eurostar train, one of the principal transport lines from the United Kingdom to the European continent, also announced delays “due to coordinated acts of vandalism in France, affecting the high speed line between Paris and Lille” and listed trains arriving in France an hour and a half later than scheduled. It advised travelers to postpone their trips and said several trains have been canceled.Officials said they were assessing the impact on travelers and athletes set to compete.Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete strongly condemned what he called the “coordinated” acts. He told BFM TV that an investigation is underway but said the coordinated timing of the incidents suggested the fires were “criminal” in nature.“At this stage, it is probably one or several acts of vandalism, a kind of coordinated sabotage,” French Sports Minister Amélie Oudéa-Castéra told Le Parisien. “We will evaluate the impact for today, for travelers, the impact for the athletes and for this weekend.”The SNCF said its teams were on-site  to ascertain the problem and begin repairs. “Some trains are diverted, a large number of trains are canceled,” it said.Attal thanked “firefighters who intervened on the affected sites” and “the SNCF agents who will carry out the necessary work to restore the network” — as well as impacted travelers for “their patience, their understanding and the civic-mindedness they demonstrate.”Valérie Pécresse, president of the regional council of the Île-de-France region, called the incidents “coordinated sabotage” and “an attempt to destabilize just as we launch the Olympic Games.”Speaking to BFM TV, Pécresse said the incidents are “not a coincidence” but rather a “massive and coordinated attack.”France and other European countries have seen suspected arson attacks on their railway systems before, usually attributed to criminals and at times to political activists, although the scale of this incident and timing with the Olympic Games put these latest incidents in a new light.Security has been a major priority in the run-up to the Paris Games, with most preparations kept under wraps but plans announced for the deployment of 15,000 soldiers, 35,000 police and 22,000 private contractors working in and around the stadiums and sports facilities across the country.The main security concern was expected to be a terrorist attack, as happened in Paris in 2015 or Nice in 2016, but there are also fears of cyberattacks. France’s cybersecurity agency was quick to issue a statement Friday that the train disruptions did not have a cyber element.There has been added worry over reports that Russia has been paying amateur saboteurs to carry out operations throughout Europe. On Tuesday, French police detained a Russian national in connection with a suspected plot to cause “destabilization” during the Games, prosecutors said.The tensions in the Middle East have been a major factor for security considerations at the Games as well, with armed guards escorting the Israeli athletes into their first soccer match against Mali on Wednesday amid protests over the war in the Gaza Strip. There have also been online threats against the Israeli team, evoking memories of the terrorist attack that killed Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Games.There have also been bomb scares and false alarms.Friday’s  alleged attacks so far seem to have had a lesser effect on the Olympic Games than on the Parisians seeking to escape their city  to begin the much hallowed national tradition of August holidays.Eloise Lecat sat on the floor of Gare Montparnasse, the Paris train station most affected by the disruptions, with her giant suitcase and her 3-year-old daughter, Léonie, on the floor in front of her.They were heading to Pays Basque to visit Lecat’s mother for August vacation — which coincides with the Olympic Games this year. But their 10:15 a.m. train was canceled due to the overnight disruptions, so Lecat was frantically searching for other transport options — bus, car or anything to get them out of Paris. Léonie was eager to see her cousins, Lecat said. “We will look for a good solution and see what happens,” Lecat said.Bisset reported from London.

WaPo_69,The USWNT insists the goals will come at the Paris Games. Everyone’s waiting.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/26/uswnt-not-scoring-paris-olympics/,2024-07-26 22:59:02.772610,,"MARSEILLE, France — The U.S. women’s national soccer team returned to its Olympic base of operations by bus in the wee hours Friday following a satisfactory exercise on the French Riviera.The match in Nice for Thursday’s 3-0 victory over Zambia — the lowest-ranked team in the 12-nation tournament — was decided midway through the first half. The performance put to rest questions about readiness for the first major competition under new coach Emma Hayes but also heightened concerns about the squad’s ability to score.Although the Americans netted three early goals, superior talent at almost every position and a one-player advantage for 57 minutes did not yield a bounty. It’s an issue that has haunted the team since Olympic camp opened several weeks ago.In two tuneups and Thursday’s match, all against weak opponents, the U.S. team had massive advantages in shots (70-13), shots on goal (26-4) and corner kicks (24-5) but a measly margin in scoring (4-0).Hayes and the players say they would be worried if they were not creating those opportunities. The popular refrain has been “the goals will come.”Aside from the opening 25 minutes Thursday, everyone is still waiting.“I’m happy we’re getting those quality chances,” captain Lindsey Horan said. “We know we have to be better. We know we need to put more of those in the back of the net.”Alex Morgan’s slip in production the past two years was the primary reason the veteran forward was left off the Olympic roster. Her replacement at striker, Sophia Smith, scored against Mexico on June 13. Three days later, the United States dominated Costa Rica but failed to score.Wingers Mallory Swanson (two goals) and Trinity Rodman were responsible for the goals Thursday — all classy finishes after terrific buildups assisted twice by Horan and once by Smith.But opportunities surely will not be as plentiful Sunday in Marseille against Germany, which opened with a 3-0 victory over Australia. The inability by the United States to beat Zambia by a larger margin could prove costly. Should the Americans and Germans play to a draw, Germany would sit in prime position to win the group on goal differential by thumping Zambia on Wednesday while the United States faces a stiffer test in Australia.By finishing first, a team would face a third-place side from Group A or C in the quarterfinals in Paris. By finishing second, the opponent would be Group A’s runner-up (probably Colombia or Canada) in Marseille.Hayes attributed some of her team’s scoring problems Thursday to Zambia playing shorthanded after Pauline Zulu’s red card. Though that seems counterintuitive, Hayes explained that: “Sometimes when you play an opponent that goes down to 10 [players] and then they drop lower [in the formation], they start doing different things. You start doing different things. So this is just really a mindfulness piece for us.”The other issue is what the U.S. team has done with ample opportunities in the penalty area. While goalkeepers, crossbars, posts and goal-line clearances have foiled several efforts, the Americans have not been clinical enough. Many shots have been at bellybutton level or not requiring fast reaction by the keeper. Others simply have missed the frame entirely.Thursday’s performance was eerily similar to the team’s 2023 World Cup opener against Vietnam: two first-half goals and a 28-0 advantage on shots but just a 3-0 victory. The Americans went on to score once in the final three matches and were bounced in the round of 16, the earliest elimination at a major tournament in program history.Hayes might not have all her attacking pieces Sunday. Smith, who left late in the first half with an ankle injury, will continue to be evaluated this weekend, a team spokesman said. Jaedyn Shaw (leg injury) was not in uniform Thursday.Regardless who is on the field, the U.S. team appreciates the urgency to become ruthless.“We’re not just an athletic team with fast forwards,” Rodman said. “We are so much more than that. And I think we need to believe deep down we can break down teams. If that’s passing it up and laying it off and moving off each other, there’s so much more depth we can bring. Living that and breathing that on the field is going to help us improve.”"
WaPo_70,"U.K. ending challenge to ICC arrest warrants for Israeli, Hamas leaders",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/26/icc-uk-israel-warrants-objections-starmer/,2024-07-26 22:42:02.772610,,"LONDON — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his new Labour government will not continue with his predecessor’s objection to the International Criminal Court’s right to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the conduct of the war in Gaza.A spokeswoman for 10 Downing Street said Friday that the new prime minister’s team would not be pursuing the previous government’s intent to object to such a warrant because it was up to the international court in The Hague in the Netherlands to decide how to proceed.The withdrawal of its opposition to the arrest warrants puts the new British government at odds with the Biden administration, which opposes the arrest warrant against the Israeli leader.The move, first reported by the Guardian, makes it more likely that the ICC will grant Khan’s request, in what would be a stunning international rebuke for Israel over the way it has conducted the war in Gaza and put Netanyahu at risk of arrest if he travels abroad.Israeli online news outlet Ynet quoted an unnamed senior Israeli official as saying: “Israel is deeply disappointed. This is a fundamentally wrong decision, it is contrary to justice and truth and violates the right of all democracies to fight terrorism.”Starmer, a former human rights attorney, has condemned Hamas and backed Israel’s right to defend itself, but has also called for a cease-fire and more humanitarian aid for the besieged enclave.In another move, Britain last week announced that it was resuming funding to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, following reports by Israel that some of its staffers were involved in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack.Britain’s new foreign minister, David Lammy, said UNRWA had taken action to guarantee the “highest standards of neutrality” among its thousands of employees.On Friday, the official Downing Street spokeswoman, who traditionally is not named, said the new government’s decision not to oppose the arrest warrants should not be considered an endorsement or objection to any ICC case.“On the ICC submission, I can confirm the government will not be pursuing [the proposal] in line with our long-standing position that this is a matter for the court to decide on,” the spokesperson told reporters.The ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan, who is British, announced in May that he was seeking arrest warrants for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Hamas on their Oct. 7 attacks and by Israel in the ensuing war in Gaza.Some 1,200 Israelis, including soldiers, civilians, women and children, were killed in the October attack. Since Israel’s war began, about 39,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed, most of them women and children, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health.In seeking arrest warrants, ICC prosecutor named Yehiya Sinwar, Hamas’s top leader in Gaza; Mohammed Deif, commander of the movement’s military wing; and Ismail Haniyeh, chief of the Hamas political bureau, based in Qatar. Both the United States and Britain have earlier branded Hamas a terrorist organization.The prosecutor said the Hamas leaders were wanted for murder, hostage-taking, rape, sexual assault and torture.Alongside Hamas, the ICC prosecutor also asked the court to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for starvation of civilians, causing great suffering, and intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population.Netanyahu in May said the threat of arrest warrants “will not stop us from waging our just war against Hamas.” He called the action a “travesty of justice.”President Biden at the time called the possible warrants “outrageous,” and added that “there is no equivalence — none — between Israel and Hamas.”The ICC prosecutor is requesting warrants before a pretrial panel of three judges, who have not yet determined if the proceedings can move forward.The three judges had earlier given Britain until the middle of July to submit its formal opposition to the warrants.Within days of his election on July 4, Starmer reached out to Netanyahu, calling for “further deepening the close relationship between the two countries,” according to a British readout. “He added that it was also important to ensure the long-term conditions for a two-state solution were in place, including ensuring the Palestinian Authority had the financial means to operate effectively.”"
WaPo_71,Simone Biles submits new skill on bars for Paris Olympics,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/26/simone-biles-new-bars-skill/,2024-07-26 22:21:02.772610,,"PARIS — Simone Biles soon might have a gymnastics skill named for her on all four apparatuses. Ahead of competition at the Paris Olympics, Biles has submitted a proposed element on bars to the technical committee of the sport’s international governing body, a prerequisite for a gymnast to introduce an original skill in a competition.It would be a surprising breakthrough; Biles hadn’t indicated she planned to attempt a new element here. Biles’s mastery of innovative elements on each apparatus would strengthen her legacy as the world’s best gymnast. Having an eponymous skill on bars is one of the few achievements Biles lacks. Submitting the element for evaluation does not guarantee a gymnast will attempt it.If Biles successfully performs the skill during any phase of competition in Paris, it will become the sixth element that bears her name. Biles already has skills named for her on each apparatus except bars — her weakest event and the lone apparatus on which she isn’t expected to vie for a gold medal.The skill is a forward clear hip circle with a 1½ pirouette. Biles casts to a handstand with her hands in a reverse grip, then drops so her hips are at the bar. She circles the bar and pushes her body back to a handstand position, finishing with a 1½ pirouette. Biles long has performed a variation of the element that includes just a half turn after what is known as a Weiler-kip — a forward clear hip circle.👀⁉️ pic.twitter.com/wmz12X5jmBEach skill in the Code of Points, the international rule book, has a letter rating, with A being the easiest. What soon could be known as the Biles on bars has been awarded an E rating, meaning it would add a half-point to Biles’s difficulty score, slightly more than the version she has performed for years that is worth 0.4 points. During Thursday’s training session at Bercy Arena, Biles did not practice this new skill.Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade, Biles’s top challenger, also has submitted a skill to be named for herself. She could unveil a triple-twisting Yurchenko on vault. Some top gymnasts, included Biles and Andrade, have performed this vault with a 2½ twist, but no woman has mastered a triple twist. Andrade’s new vault would earn a difficulty score of 6.0 — not far off Biles’s Yurchenko double pike, the hardest vault in women’s gymnastics that earns a 6.4.Andrade did not attempt the triple-twisting vault during Thursday’s practice, but if she does so in the competition, it will boost her ability to rival Biles on vault and in the all-around."
WaPo_72,"What to know about how wildfires form, intensify and spread",https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/26/wildfire-causes-spread-weather-explained/,2024-07-26 22:12:02.772610,,"It’s wildfire season in North America, and dozens of blazes have erupted across parts of the western United States and Canada. In the United States, some 89 large fires have torched more than 1.6 million acres so far, while in Canada, 3.7 million acres have burned.In Oregon, the Durkee Fire has claimed 268,492 acres — about 10 times the size of Disney World. More concerning is the Park Fire burning just north of Chico, Calif., which was ignited Wednesday and already ballooned to over 164,000 acres. It’s only 3 percent contained and is exhibiting behavior that firefighters classified as “extreme.”In Canada, a fast-moving wildfire badly damaged the resort town of Jasper, Alberta, and forced the evacuation of 25,000 people. The Jasper fire grew so ferocious that its plume began spitting out lightning strikes. So did the plume of the Fort McMurray fire, which is burning over mainly forested regions.Wildfires are a staple of the summer climate in the West. While the number of fires, and area burned, hasn’t been terribly anomalous in 2024, it’s likely the season will become markedly worse in the next month or two. That’s when the sunbaked landscape, largely dried out by a summer’s worth of heat and drought, overlaps with strengthening autumnal winds. The result? A breeding ground for rapidly growing and swiftly spreading wildfires that can threaten entire communities.About 85 percent of wildland fire in the United States are caused by humans. Some start as the result of carelessness — discarded cigarettes or unattended campfires. Others are sparked by less obvious negligence: Driving off-road, for example, might allow sparks from your vehicle to ignite vegetation. In 2018, the Carr Fire near Redding, Calif — which burned nearly 230,000 acres — was ignited by a spark caused by a trailer with a flat tire.A downed power line can do it too. Or a house fire can get out of control, with embers that spawn new fires. Sometimes the cause is arson, as suspected with the Park Fire.The remainder of wildfires is usually caused by lightning.Lightning is roughly five times as hot as the surface of the sun. It only lasts a fraction of a second and is usually less than an inch thick, but it’s often enough to spark a fire.“Hot lightning,” also known as continuous current lightning, is particularly efficient at generating fires. Why? Ordinarily lightning bolts “flicker,” with a rapid succession of brief pulses of current. Hot lightning features a longer-lasting channel with one solid flow of current. Since the electric channel lasts longer, it causes more heating and is more likely to start a fire.There’s also “dry lightning.” There’s nothing special about the lightning itself, but it forms in thunderstorms that produce very little rain. Even though rain is falling, it mostly evaporates before reaching the ground because of dry air in place. That means thunderstorms can spark new fires without delivering rains that would extinguish a fledgling fire.The same overarching setup also can yield erratic “outflow,” or exhaust, winds that exit thunderstorms and fan flames.On June 22, 2022, a barrage of more than 66,000 lightning strikes took aim at central California. That yielded numerous additional spot fires, several of which grew.A wildfire is a combustion reaction. That means the input has to be air. The more air entering a wildfire, the more it can grow. Strong winds are notorious for fanning fires and causing their footprint to expand. In the autumn, offshore winds in the West — from the east or northeast — heat up and dry out as they cascade down mountain slopes, often bringing about the biggest wildfire outbreaks.Dry weather is a simple requirement for wildfires. When the air is dry, it helps cure, or dry out, vegetation. High temperatures do the same thing. The hotter the air, the more moisture it can evaporate from the ground. That desiccates the landscape, and plants, leaving it ripe to burn.The hot, dry conditions conducive to fast-spreading fires are expected to increase because of human-caused climate change.When conditions support extreme fire behavior and rapid fire spread, the National Weather Service can issue alerts notifying the public of the hazard.A fire weather watch is issued up to 72 hours before the arrival of potential fire weather. A red flag warning is issued when fire weather appears imminent and will occur within the next 24 hours.That’s not to be confused with the fire warning, which can only be issued at the request of emergency management in most cases.Once a wildfire grows large enough, it begins behaving much like a thunderstorm. Inflow air, or air that fuels the fire, enters from the bottom. Smoke and heat ascend to 40,000 feet or higher, much like the towering plume of a severe thunderstorm. Sometimes the plumes even emit lightning strikes. At this point, the entire system becomes a pyrocumulonimbus cloud, or a wildfire-induced thunderstorm.Those lightning strikes spark new fires. The thunderstorm can also yield changing winds that complicate fighting the fire. Sometimes, in an environment where ambient winds change speed and direction with altitude, the plume can rotate. On rare occasions, actual fire tornadoes can form.During the Carr Fire in 2018, a tornado of fire descended from a pyrocumulonimbus cloud. It toppled transformers, destroyed homes, uprooted trees and killed four people. Winds were estimated at 143 mph.On Aug. 15, 2020, the National Weather Service in Reno, Nev., issued a first-of-its-kind tornado warning for a smoke plume associated with the Loyalton Fire in Lassen County in California. Multiple legitimate tornadoes touched down."

In addition to the fatal gunshot wound, Massey also had minor blunt force injuries on her right leg, the autopsy found. The results were made public Friday morning, three weeks after Massey’s July 6 killing.The White sheriff’s deputy who shot her in the face, Sean Grayson, 30, was charged with first-degree murder last week. A use-of-force expert with the Illinois State Police, which investigated the shooting, determined that it was not justified, prosecutor Mary Rodgers said in court documents.Massey, 36, was the mother of two teenagers, a son and a daughter. She loved cooking, doing hair and being with her children, according to a GoFundMe page created by her family. She was a slight 112 pounds and was in her nightgown and pajama pants when she was killed, the autopsy report showed.The killing has drawn widespread condemnation, including a large protest Thursday in Manhattan, and grief among Black Americans. More than 1,170 people have been killed by police in the past 12 months, according to a Washington Post database, and Black Americans are killed at more than twice the rate of White Americans.This week, President Biden called on Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a set of reforms named after the 46-year-old Black man killed by Minneapolis police in 2020. It was approved by the Democratic-controlled House in March 2021, but negotiations fizzled out in the Senate. A renewed push to pass it in 2023, after Memphis police killed Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, also failed because of opposition from Republicans.“Sonya’s death at the hands of a responding officer reminds us that all too often Black Americans face fears for their safety in ways many of the rest of us do not,” Biden said in a statement.Massey called 911 from her Springfield, Ill., home on July 6 to report a prowler. When Grayson and another deputy showed up around 12:50 a.m., they inspected the property and interacted with her for nearly 20 minutes.Then, when Grayson saw a pot on the stove, he told her to take it off the burner, body-camera footage released Monday showed. Massey did, taking it to the sink. When Grayson said he was moving into the living room to get away from “hot, steaming water,” she said, “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.”Grayson then drew his gun and pointed it at Massey, threatening to shoot her in the face. She ducked and said “Okay, I’m sorry.” Grayson came toward her, allegedly firing three times.This developing story will be updated."
WaPo_74,"Trump, Netanyahu set to meet amid political and personal tension",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/26/trump-netanyahu-set-meet-amid-political-personal-tension/,2024-07-26 23:48:03.034833,,"Former president Donald Trump was set to meet Friday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a time of political tension between their two countries and personal tension between two men who were once close allies.The pair worked closely when Trump was president, but he was incensed when Netanyahu called to congratulate Joe Biden on his victory and, since then, has been openly critical of Netanyahu’s management of the war in Gaza.The meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., is the latest stop on a whirlwind trip for the Israeli leader, who on Thursday addressed a joint session of Congress and met with President Biden and Vice President Harris, the likely Democratic nominee. The day was thick with tension, including raucous protests of his congressional address.In her meeting with Netanyahu, Harris implored him to accept a cease-fire deal that would pause the fighting in Gaza and release hostages. U.S. leaders say they are closer than ever to an agreement but finalizing it has remained elusive.“Let’s get the deal done so we can get a cease-fire to end the war,” Harris told reporters after the White House meeting. She also called for the hostages being held by Hamas to be released and for “much-needed relief to the Palestinian people.”The Biden administration has been a steadfast supporter of Israel since the conflict began with a deadly terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel on Oct. 7. But tensions have increased during the ensuing war as Palestinian casualties mounted and the U.S. has pressed for a deal that has yet to close. Harris’s remarks appeared aimed at adding pressure on Israel and Hamas to close the remaining gaps.Trump, too, seems eager for the war to end and has focused his public criticism on the Israeli leader’s public relations management of the conflict.On “Fox & Friends” on Thursday, Trump said Israel is getting “decimated” by bad publicity over its war with Gaza and said he wants Netanyahu “to finish up and get it done quickly.”“You got to get it done quickly, because they are getting decimated with this publicity,” Trump said. “And you know, Israel is not very good at public relations.”Trump marveled that some “Jewish people out there wearing yarmulkes” are pro-Palestinian.“Israel has to handle their public relations. Their public relations are not good,” Trump said. “And they have got to get this done fast, because the world — the world is not taking lightly to it.”On this trip, Netanyahu has been forced to walk a delicate political balancing act, having landed just as Biden dropped out of the race, Harris secured the support needed to win the nomination and the general election began in earnest.Israeli officials note that he needs strong relations with the Biden administration — who no matter what will remain in office for the next six months. But he also wants to smooth things over with Trump, both for his own politics back home and in case Trump returns to the White House.The prime minister’s conservative base and his most extremist coalition partners openly pine for a Trump victory. They recall his time in office as a golden era for Israel’s right wing: Trump brushed aside many of Washington’s neutral positions, moving the American Embassy to Jerusalem, okay’ing the annexation of the Golan Heights and declaring that West Bank settlements should not be considered illegal as a matter of policy.Trump also helped usher in the 2020 Abraham Accords, a set of treaties that normalized relations between Israel and four Arab states: the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco.Trump would also be more likely to allow Israel a freer hand with the Gaza war and whatever political and security arrangements follow it, say members of Netanyahu’s conservative base.Public Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir explicitly endorsed Trump Wednesday, saying he would not hamper Israel’s war fighting, as Biden has. Earlier this month, Ben Gvir beseeched his colleagues to scuttle the U.S.-backed cease-fire deal now being negotiated in Cairo because it would be a “victory” for Biden and a “slap” for Trump.The prime minister is far more diplomatic, asserting repeatedly that Israel will work closely with whomever becomes president. But Netanyahu has increasingly tied himself to the Republican Party, and he ran multiple election campaigns touting his closeness to Trump. In 2019, his party draped photos of the two of them on Tel Aviv skyscrapers.Their relationship fractured, though, at the end of Trump’s term. Trump slammed Netanyahu as disloyal when the prime minister called Biden to congratulate him after the 2020 election.Trump has also told reporters that he blames Netanyahu for pulling Israel out of a 2020 raid in Iran that killed top commander Qasem Soleimani, and said that he never thought the prime minister seemed genuinely interested in seeking peace and heaped praise on Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. “F--- him,” Trump said in a 2021 interview, referring to Netanyahu.His anger hadn’t faded by April, when he told Time he thought Netanyahu deserved blame for allowing the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7 to occur. “I had a very bad experience with Bibi,” he said.In other campaign news Friday, Harris won the endorsements of Barack and Michelle Obama, the former president and first lady, the last remaining leaders in the Democratic Party to embrace the likely nominee.“We called to say Michelle and I couldn’t be prouder to endorse you and to do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office,” the former president told Harris in a phone call that was recorded and posted to social media.As the Harris campaign ramps up, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), a possible vice-presidential candidate, made plans for an event Saturday in his battleground state. Her campaign said he will “kick off a weekend of action in Pennsylvania to mark 100 days until the election.” The event is set for Carlisle in central Pennsylvania."

Most of us would want a little more than that. For example, Dr. Faustus — best known from dramatic masterpieces by Christopher Marlowe and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe — acquired immense power, wealth and knowledge. But in “Devil’s Contract: The History of the Faustian Bargain,” Ed Simon contends that we all “occasionally betray our principles for personal gain” and, in effect, “sign on the dotted line of a diabolical compact.” Insofar as possible, though, he argues that we should all “try and ameliorate some of the suffering that is the by-product of our appetites and consumptions and privileges.”The idea of the archfiend’s standard agreement — relinquishing your soul for something you desperately desire — energizes works as various as the musical “Damn Yankees,” Max Beerbohm’s fantasy “Enoch Soames,” John Collier’s humorous story “The Devil, George and Rosie,” Mary MacLane’s fiery confession “I Await the Devil’s Coming” and James Hogg’s deeply unsettling Victorian-era novel “The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner.” So rich is this theme in literature that Simon, a cultural essayist and editor of the literary journal Belt Magazine, is able to write an entire book without discussing any of these. Still, he has more than enough to work with.Following a preliminary chapter reflecting on the ancient magician Simon Magus and the doctrines of Gnosticism, which posits that this world was created by an evil demiurge, Simon turns to Jesus Christ’s three temptations in the desert. These culminate in Satan offering Jesus all of Earth’s kingdoms if he will just bow down and worship him. Jesus disdains this effort to enact what is, in effect, a Faustian bargain. Yet Satan’s very attempt raises the question of whether the Christian messiah, in his human aspect, might have succumbed.From there, Simon meanders among a wide variety of stories and legends about human interaction with devils or demons. These include the medieval tale of St. Theophilus, who was saved from damnation after selling his soul by the intercession of the Virgin Mary; the folk belief in succubi and incubi; persistent rumors of diabolism associated with the learned 10th-century Pope Sylvester II; and novels such as Fyodor Dostoevsky’s “The Brothers Karamazov,” in which Ivan Karamazov imagines Christ’s sudden appearance in Seville during the Spanish Inquisition and sentencing to be burned at the stake.Simon frequently opens his chapters with some striking or macabre anecdote. For instance, he recounts the likely political assassination in 1991 of dissident Romanian scholar Ioan Petru Culianu, a leading authority on Renaissance occultism, in a University of Chicago restroom. This leads Simon to consider several figures in the history of astrology and alchemy, such as the hermetic philosophers Roger Bacon, Agrippa and Trithemius, before proceeding to an extended discussion of the historical Dr. Faustus and Marlowe’s play about him. Later chapters segue from the European witch craze in early modern Europe to the Salem witch trials in colonial America to Anton LaVey’s satanic church in 1960s San Francisco. In another chapter, he introduces an analysis of certain German expressionist films by revealing that unknown individuals in 2015 pried opened the tomb of F.W. Murnau, director of “Nosferatu” (1922) and “Faust” (1926), performed some kind of necromantic ceremony and then carried off the filmmaker’s head.Simon obviously casts a wide net. One chapter focuses entirely on musicians, particularly the violinists Tartini and Paganini and the blues guitarist Robert Johnson, who supposedly acquired their preternatural virtuosity by unholy means. He notes that Johnson reputedly cut his deal with the Devil late one night at the crossroads of U.S. Highways 61 and 41 in Mississippi, and was later the first in that line of pop-music superstars who died at age 27.By the time Simon comes to analyze Thomas Mann’s “Doctor Faustus,” the political dimension of the bargain is clearly uppermost in his thought. Mann’s masterpiece — Simon calls it the greatest German-language novel of the 20th century — semi-allegorizes German Kultur and the diabolical appeal of Hitlerism. Mikhail Bulgakov’s satirical “The Master and Margarita” provides an analogous critique of Stalinist Russia. More generally, Simon proposes that our modern belief in rationality and empirical science hampers us from grasping the insidious appeal of the irrational and authoritarian.In fact, he says, Mephistopheles — the shape-shifting demon who executes all Faust’s wishes — should be regarded as “the animating spirit of modernity,” the supreme exponent of that heartless utilitarian principle that “sees both nature and other people as tools in the furthering of the individual’s own desires.” Yet because of our arrogant rapaciousness, we ultimately end up trading our souls — however you define souls — for a mess of pottage.Further extrapolating the Faustian bargain from the personal to the global, Simon points to our foolhardy “reduction of the earth’s resources to something that provides mere convenience for us and unimaginable wealth for a corrupt few.” As our environment deteriorates, we are losing “something of infinite value for the transient and illusory pleasures offered by Mephistopheles.” Simon consequently labels our own era the “Faustocene,” now increasingly “manifested in the growing international movement toward authoritarianism and fascism just as the biome collapses. Not just our souls, but indeed our entire planet traded for comfort and capital, a contract signed by you and me.”These highly charged and politicized arguments about the evils of late capitalism transform “Devil’s Contract” from a work of cultural history into something close to a polemic, one with which you may or may not agree. Simon’s style, moreover, can sometimes veer into the over-emphatic — “His was a bargain, a wager, a bet, a contract,” and in the next sentence a “covenant” — or indulge in purple extravagance: Speaking of the Brothers Grimm, he writes: “Across the canon of folktales the Devil’s hoofprints make a clear path, and blood from the contracts he signed can be found smeared on the sundry pages of their anthologies.” He’s also overly fond of certain words, sometimes slightly misused, such as “infamous,” “immaculate” and “conjuration,” while occasionally resorting to nouns and verbs that older dictionaries would highlight as offensive and that still seem out of place in a work of popular scholarship. That scholarship itself displays some puzzling lacunae: In discussing the “possessed” nuns of the 17th-century convent at Loudun, Simon never mentions Aldous Huxley’s classic account, “The Devils of Loudun.” Neither does he refer to E.M. Butler’s relevant studies, “The Fortunes of Faust” and “The Myth of the Magus,” or to the many (admittedly somewhat dubious) works of Montague Summers that deal with black magic and witchcraft.Still, these cavils aside, “Devil’s Contract” reminds us of how often we deludedly exchange something of inestimable value — our souls, our freedom, our honor, our beautiful Earth — for what is ultimately glittery trash. In Ira Levin’s “Rosemary’s Baby,” the pathetic husband allows Satan to rape his wife in return for success … as an actor. Today, political demagogues try to dupe us with golden visions and glowing promises. Don’t be misled. Those golden visions are illusions, mere smoke and mirrors, and the promises nothing but self-serving lies and deceitful trickery. Behind all their honeyed words, you can almost hear the smug and infernal laughter.The History of the Faustian BargainBy Ed SimonMelville House. 303 pp. $28.99"
WaPo_76,California’s Park Fire probably spawned freak fire tornadoes. Here’s how.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/26/park-fire-tornado-california-explained/,2024-07-26 23:24:03.034833,,"One or more suspected fire tornadoes occurred northeast of Chico, Calif., late Thursday in association with the rapidly-growing Park Fire. The blaze began Wednesday afternoon after a 42-year-old Chico man allegedly pushed a burning vehicle into a ditch. In barely 36 hours, it swelled to 164,000 acres in size — nearly six times the area of Disney World — and continues to exhibit extreme fire behavior.On Thursday, weakly changing winds with height helped sculpt the fire’s entire smoke plume into a pillar of rotation. Doppler radar indicates that, from that column of spinning smoke, one or more tornado-like vortexes formed within the massive plume. The radar showed low-level winds blowing in different directions at the location of the plume, which is often an indicator of a tornado.Only after the fire — which is only 3 percent contained — is extinguished can the area be surveyed for possible wind damage to determine whether tornadoes actually occurred.For now, a red flag warning remains in effect for portions of the northern Sacramento Valley, including Chico, Redding and Paradise. Relative humidity levels of 10 to 20 percent, along with high heat and winds gusting 20 to 30 mph, will promote the spread of fires and encourage the formation of new ones.That could mean more fire tornadoes with the Park Fire on Friday afternoon, particularly as the sun bakes the lower atmosphere and temperatures top 100 degrees. Into the weekend, the heat will ease with cooler highs in the upper 80s to lower 90s. By the middle of next week, heat is forecast to return, with temperatures warming above 100 degrees again.Thursday’s smoke plume reached at least 25,000 feet, and probably higher, behaving in essence as its own miniature thunderstorm and “feeling” the changing winds at different levels of the atmosphere. On rare occasions, exceptionally tall smoke plumes morph into thunderstorms of their own, becoming so-called pyrocumulonimbus clouds and spitting out their own lightning strikes. Sometimes those strikes start new fires.Time-lapse videos from fire cameras operated by the University of California at San Diego captured Thursday’s rotating smoke plume whirling ominously against the backdrop of an orange and brown sky.Fire tornadoes have happened before. The first recorded instance was near Canberra, Australia, during a wildfire on Jan. 18, 2003. Damage surveys were conducted and it was estimated that the vortex contained 160 mph winds. That was thought to be a freak event — until fire tornadoes became increasingly well-documented in the United States.On July 26, 2018, the Carr Fire spawned a fire tornado with winds up to 143 mph, near Redding, Calif. The fire tornado uprooted trees, scoured the ground, toppled high-tension power lines and even collapsed a home, killing three occupants. A firefighter was also killed.On Aug. 15, 2020, meteorologists at the National Weather Service office in Reno, Nev., detected strong rotation within a smoke plume, and opted to issue a fire tornado warning around the Loyalton Fire. It was burning in the Klamath National Forest in Lassen County, Calif. Multiple intense fire tornadoes touched down and were captured on video.For now, firefighters combating the Park Fire should remain vigilant for additional fire-induced tornadoes, which could loft and spread embers, sparking new fires."

President Andrés Manuel López Obrador wasn’t informed until 4:14 p.m.“We are awaiting official communication on whether what happened yesterday was a capture or surrender,” Rodríguez said during López Obrador’s daily news conference. “This is part of what the U.S. government must tell us.”Zambada, a co-founder of the Sinaloa cartel, was fooled into boarding the U.S.-bound private plane with Guzmán, a son of imprisoned cartel co-founder Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera, according to a Department of Homeland Security official. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive operation.Zambada and the elder Guzmán, who is serving a sentence of life plus 30 years in the federal supermax prison in Florence, Colo., led one of the world’s most prolific drug cartels, exporting tons of heroin, cocaine, fentanyl and other drugs. The Biden administration has targeted the cartel as it tries to combat the most deadly drug epidemic in history.Rodríguez was peppered by reporters Friday on why Mexico wasn’t told in advance about such a critical operation. Zambada also faces arrest warrants in Mexico.Rodríguez insisted that cooperation with Washington against the illegal drug trade is strong.“We are going to continue cooperating with the U.S. government, as we have done up until this event,” she said.Miroff reported from Washington.

WaPo_78,Another major heat wave will build across the United States next week,https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/26/heat-wave-forecast-united-states/,2024-07-27 01:26:02.779274,,"Friday is a rare day this summer without widespread record-breaking heat in the United States. But this hiatus won’t last long, as the next round of excessive heat is already on the horizon and will probably extend deep into August. The heat will cause drought to expand while also increasing the fire risk in the western states, where numerous large and dangerous blazes are active.A sprawling heat dome — or zone of intense high pressure — is forecast to become reestablished over the southern United States this weekend, affecting many of the same regions that have already endured punishing temperatures this summer.The National Weather Service says the upcoming weather pattern supports above-normal temperatures over “almost all” of the Lower 48 states.The heat will first spread over the central and southern Plains, with highs soaring well past 100 on Sunday and Monday. By the start of August, high temperatures in the 90s or greater will extend from coast to coast.The Weather Service’s  0 to 4 HeatRisk scale shows large parts of the nation reaching at least Level 2 and 3 — moderate and major — by the middle of the next week. A number of locations in the central states, including Amarillo, Tex., Wichita and Kansas City, Mo., are forecast to reach Level 4, or extreme.The heat is expected to return to portions of the central and southern United States by late this weekend and early next weekThe central Plains should brace for the “most persistent and extreme” heat, according to the Weather Service. High temperatures there, well into the triple digits, will be 10 to 15 degrees above normal.Multiple days of record-challenging highs from 105 to 110 are expected in the Texas Panhandle, parts of Oklahoma and Kansas; highs could even surpass 110 in parts of Kansas by the middle of the week.Some of the heat will expand into eastern Colorado and New Mexico. Denver could also see highs approaching 100 early next week.And the heat wave is projected to be prolonged. There is potential for at least five days with highs of at least 100 to 105 in the southern and central Plains.By the second half of next week, when August begins, the Weather Service projects much of the country will be hotter than normal, except perhaps parts of the Southeast, Gulf Coast and parts of the West Coast, where temperatures will be near average.The southern and central Plains are predicted to remain at the epicenter of the heat wave.The heat’s intensity may be most prolonged in the western states. By the second week of August, computer models project a powerful heat dome anchored over the region. Underneath it, drought will intensify and expand, and the fire risk may escalate. In Oregon, where many of the largest U.S. fires are burning, the ongoing drought will probably worsen, with little rain in sight.The Weather Service favors above-average temperatures for much of the nation during August, with the highest odds in the Mountain West and Appalachians. The projected heat in August will almost certainly propel many locations to their hottest summer on record.The potentially steamy August follows a brutally hot July in which hundreds of heat records have been set.In recent days, record highs have been numerous from the northern Rockies to the northern Plains. Locations in Montana and the Dakotas just witnessed their hottest temperatures of the year.Wednesday saw highs near 110 as far north as the Canadian border. Records included 107 in Havre, Mont., and Williston, N.D. Temperatures in Salt Lake City reached 105, and Boise, Idaho, hit 107.Thursday’s record high footprint was somewhat smaller as a cold front pushed east, but Williston soared to 109, Rapid City, S.D., reached 105, and Casper, Wyo., hit 100.The cold front that fanned massive blazes from Alberta, Canada, to Northern California is briefly pushing the heat away.But, as the Earth is experiencing its hottest days on record, the heat — intensified by human-caused climate change — is poised to reload."
WaPo_79,What to know about the Sinaloa cartel after the arrest of ‘El Mayo’,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/26/sinaloa-cartel-ismael-zambada-fentanyl/,2024-07-27 01:00:02.779274,,"Two top-ranking figures within Mexico’s powerful Sinaloa cartel were arrested by U.S. authorities in Texas on Thursday, swinging a blow to the criminal gang responsible for supplying more fentanyl into the United States than any other.Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada was an elusive Sinaloa kingpin who evaded capture for decades. Joaquín Guzmán López is a son of famed drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, with whom he shares a name, and is accused of overseeing a network of methamphetamine labs across Mexico’s northwestern Sinaloa state. Both men were sought by U.S. authorities for drug trafficking.Mexican authorities said they were not informed about the operation to capture either man until after they were flown to the United States on a private plane that took off from Mexico’s Sonora state.Here’s what to know."
WaPo_80,Not everything Big Tech touches turns to gold,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/26/apple-google-amazon-unpopular-unprofitable-products/,2024-07-27 01:00:02.779274,,"In a few weeks, Google will release new versions of its eight-year-old smartphone that probably few people will buy.Apple is reportedly fretting about the money it’s spending on Apple TV Plus, the company’s online video service that has lower viewership on TVs in the United States than PBS, Xumo and Vudu, the media analysis company Comscore says. If you’re wondering what Xumo or Vudu are, you get the point.Amazon executives have tried to justify to their bosses the popular but money-losing home devices with Alexa and will soon offer a paid artificial intelligence version of the voice assistant to try to generate more cash, according to the Wall Street Journal and Washington Post reporting.(Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Post.)It’s comforting, in a way, that America’s powerful Big Tech companies can flail around for years with products that are unpopular or unprofitable — and sometimes both.The companies have other wildly successful products, so a few stinkers won’t hurt them. But the struggles of a few high-profile products are emblematic of how these companies don’t always heed what you want.One explanation is tech geniuses aren’t always as genius as we (or they) might believe. That context may help explain why Big Tech products can sometimes feel frustrating, such as unhelpful Google search results or scuzzy Instagram accounts.If you had a lemonade stand with puny sales, you probably wouldn't keep it going for eight years.But Google has.Only 5.5 million of its Pixel smartphones were sold last year in the United States. That was about 4 percent of total smartphone sales in the country, research firm IDC estimates. Apple sold 12 times that number of iPhones.On the bright side, IDC senior research director Nabila Popal said, Pixel sales are better if you look only at the category of higher-priced phones. Pixel is popular in Japan. And Pixel gives Google a canvas to show its newest features, like AI-powered photo editing, that may spread later to other kinds of phones.It’s also healthy if America’s dominant smartphone sellers, Apple and Samsung, had more competition for your business. I own a Pixel phone and like it.But it seems people are sending a strong message that they don't want the Pixel by not buying it, and Google isn't listening.Google declined to comment.You might say the same about Apple TV streaming devices and Apple TV Plus.Viewership is so low for the five-year-old video service that it doesn’t register in Nielsen’s rankings of Americans’ TV streaming habits. Among the ways that Americans connect to streaming services on TV sets, the Apple TV devices are quite far down the rankings with Google’s Chromecast devices, according to estimates from research firm eMarketer.Apple didn’t reply to a request for comment.There’s not much direct harm to you if relatively few people use Apple’s entertainment products or buy a Pixel phone.One question, though, is what you might be missing when companies’ cash and attention is stolen by their little-used products. (A possibly terrible idea: What if instead of Apple TV, the company made a printer that people didn’t hate?)Technology executives are eager to point out examples of their products and ideas that flopped for years, until they became spectacular winners.There were predictions decades ago that Amazon would die because it was such a bad business. Meta’s history is littered with features, including Stories for Instagram and Facebook, that people mocked until they caught fire.Big Tech companies’ patience to keep trying until you both love a product and it’s financially sustainable can be useful for you.Amazon has poured money for a decade into Alexa and the company’s line of voice-activated home devices like Echo speakers. Many people love those products, using them to play music, set timers, check the weather or amuse their children.Little of that enthusiasm, though, has translated into shopping on Amazon or other profitable activities for the company. Amazon’s gadgets division has lost lots of money, the Journal reported.That’s one reason Amazon plans to start selling a remodeled version of Alexa based on a new form of AI. Some Amazon employees who worked on the project worry that few people will pay, Reuters, the Journal and Business Insider have said.In a statement, Amazon said it believes the remodeled Alexa is an opportunity to “provide even more proactive, personal, and trusted assistance in the over half a billion Alexa-enabled devices already in homes around the world.”The struggles of Apple in entertainment, Google in smartphones and Amazon’s Alexa show why some products from Big Tech companies can limp along for years.Many successful companies and people are confident that popularity and profits will eventually come for their currently unloved products. Maybe they’re right — or maybe it’s a failure to listen to what their customers are telling them."
WaPo_81,"Trump, Netanyahu meet amid political and personal tension",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/26/trump-netanyahu-set-meet-amid-political-personal-tension/,2024-07-27 01:00:02.779274,,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived in Florida on Friday for a meeting with former president Donald Trump at a time of political tension between their countries and personal tension between the two men, who were once close allies.The pair worked closely when Trump was president, but he was incensed when Netanyahu called to congratulate Joe Biden on his 2020 presidential election victory and, since then, has been openly critical of Netanyahu’s management of the war in Gaza.“Now I’m honored, come on in,” Trump said to Netanyahu upon the prime minister’s arrival at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., according to video that a Trump aide posted on social media. They posed for photos before going inside.The meeting is the latest stop on a whirlwind trip for the Israeli leader, who on Thursday addressed a joint meeting of Congress and met with President Biden and Vice President Harris, the likely Democratic nominee. The day was thick with tension, including raucous protests of his congressional address.In her meeting with Netanyahu, Harris implored him to accept a cease-fire deal that would pause the fighting in Gaza and release hostages. U.S. leaders say they are closer than ever to an agreement but finalizing it has remained elusive.“Let’s get the deal done so we can get a cease-fire to end the war,” Harris told reporters after the White House meeting. She also called for the hostages being held by Hamas to be released and for “much-needed relief to the Palestinian people.”The Biden administration has been a steadfast supporter of Israel since the conflict began with a deadly terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel on Oct. 7. But tensions have increased during the ensuing war as Palestinian casualties mounted and as the United States pressed for a deal that has yet to be finalized. Harris’s remarks appeared aimed at adding pressure on Israel and Hamas to close the remaining gaps.Trump, too, seems eager for the war to end and has focused his public criticism on the Israeli leader’s public relations management of the conflict.On “Fox & Friends” on Thursday, Trump said Israel is getting “decimated” by bad publicity over its war with Gaza and said he wants Netanyahu “to finish up and get it done quickly.”“You got to get it done quickly, because they are getting decimated with this publicity,” Trump said. “And you know, Israel is not very good at public relations.”Trump marveled that some “Jewish people out there wearing yarmulkes” are pro-Palestinian.“Israel has to handle their public relations. Their public relations are not good,” Trump said. “And they have got to get this done fast, because the world — the world is not taking lightly to it.”On this trip, Netanyahu has been forced to walk a delicate political balancing act, having landed just as Biden dropped out of the race, Harris secured the support needed to win the nomination and the general election began in earnest.Israeli officials note that he needs strong relations with the Biden administration — who no matter what will remain in office for the next six months. But he also wants to smooth things over with Trump, both for his own politics back home and in case Trump returns to the White House.The prime minister’s conservative base and his most extremist coalition partners openly pine for a Trump victory. They recall his time in office as a golden era for Israel’s right wing: Trump brushed aside many of Washington’s neutral positions, moving the American Embassy to Jerusalem, okaying the annexation of the Golan Heights and declaring that West Bank settlements should not be considered illegal as a matter of policy.Trump also helped usher in the 2020 Abraham Accords, a set of treaties that normalized relations between Israel and four Arab states: the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco.Trump would also be more likely to allow Israel a freer hand with the Gaza war and whatever political and security arrangements follow it, say members of Netanyahu’s conservative base.Public Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir explicitly endorsed Trump Wednesday, saying he would not hamper Israel’s war fighting, as Biden has. Earlier this month, Ben Gvir beseeched his colleagues to scuttle the U.S.-backed cease-fire deal now being negotiated in Cairo because it would be a “victory” for Biden and a “slap” for Trump.The prime minister is far more diplomatic, asserting repeatedly that Israel will work closely with whomever becomes president. But Netanyahu has increasingly tied himself to the Republican Party, and he ran multiple election campaigns touting his closeness to Trump. In 2019, his party draped photos of the two of them on Tel Aviv skyscrapers.Their relationship fractured, though, at the end of Trump’s term. Trump slammed Netanyahu as disloyal when the prime minister called Biden to congratulate him after the 2020 election.Trump has also told reporters that he blames Netanyahu for pulling Israel out of a 2020 raid in Iran that killed top commander Qasem Soleimani. Trump said that he never thought the prime minister seemed genuinely interested in seeking peace and heaped praise on Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. “F--- him,” Trump said in a 2021 interview, referring to Netanyahu.His anger hadn’t faded by April, when he told Time he thought Netanyahu deserved blame for allowing the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7 to occur. “I had a very bad experience with Bibi,” he said.In other campaign news Friday, Harris won the endorsements of Barack and Michelle Obama, the former president and first lady, the last remaining leaders in the Democratic Party to embrace the likely nominee.“We called to say Michelle and I couldn’t be prouder to endorse you and to do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office,” the former president told Harris in a phone call that was recorded and posted to social media.As the Harris campaign ramps up, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), a possible vice-presidential candidate, made plans for an event Saturday in his battleground state.  Harris’s campaign said Shapiro will “kick off a weekend of action in Pennsylvania to mark 100 days until the election.” The event is set for Carlisle in central Pennsylvania."

He was listed in migration records as a visitor to the country, and wasn’t registered as a U.S. Embassy employee or U.S. government agent.Zambada was scheduled to appear in federal court in El Paso at 8 a.m. Friday, represented by Dallas attorney Frank Perez. His case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Kathleen Cardone, according to court records. His attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Zambada and the elder Guzmán were indicted in El Paso with 22 other high-ranking Sinaloa Cartel members in 2012. Zambada was charged with being part of a conspiracy to traffic cocaine and marijuana into the United States, launder money and murder perceived enemies.The younger Guzmán was set to make his first court appearance in Chicago on Saturday, U.S. officials said. He is to be represented by one of the attorneys who defended his father, at El Chapo’s narcotics trial in Brooklyn in 2019. “I’ve got no comment other than to confirm I represent Joaquin and will be in court for him at his initial appearance,” attorney Jeffrey Lichtman said.Rodríguez was peppered by reporters Friday on why Mexico wasn’t told in advance about such a critical operation.

This is a fundamentally wrong decision; it is contrary to justice and truth and violates the right of all democracies to fight terrorism.”Starmer, a former human rights attorney, has condemned Hamas and backed Israel’s right to defend itself, but has also called for a cease-fire and more humanitarian aid for the besieged enclave.In another move, Britain last week announced that it was resuming funding to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, despite reports by Israel that some of the agency’s staffers were involved in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack.Britain’s new foreign minister, David Lammy, said UNRWA had taken action to guarantee the “highest standards of neutrality” among its thousands of employees.On Friday, the official Downing Street spokeswoman, who traditionally is not named, said the new government’s decision not to oppose the arrest warrants should not be considered an endorsement or objection to any ICC case.“On the ICC submission, I can confirm the government will not be pursuing [the proposal] in line with our long-standing position that this is a matter for the court to decide on,” the spokesperson told reporters.Khan, who is British, announced in May that he was also seeking arrest warrants for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Hamas in its Oct. 7 attack and by Israel in the ensuing war in Gaza.Some 1,200 Israelis, including soldiers and civilians, women and children, were killed in the October attack. Since Israel’s war began, more than 39,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed, most of them women and children, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health.In seeking arrest warrants, the ICC prosecutor named Yehiya Sinwar, Hamas’s top leader in Gaza; Mohammed Deif, commander of the movement’s military wing; and Ismail Haniyeh, chief of the Hamas political bureau, based in Qatar. Both the United States and Britain had earlier branded Hamas a terrorist organization.The prosecutor said the Hamas leaders were wanted on accusations of murder, hostage-taking, rape, sexual assault and torture.The ICC prosecutor also asked the court to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant on accusations of starvation of civilians, causing great suffering, and intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population.Netanyahu in May said the threat of arrest warrants “will not stop us from waging our just war against Hamas.” He called the action a “travesty of justice.”President Biden at the time called the possible warrants “outrageous,” and added that “there is no equivalence — none — between Israel and Hamas.”The ICC prosecutor is requesting warrants before a pretrial panel of three judges, who have not yet determined if the proceedings can move forward.The three judges had earlier given Britain until the middle of July to submit its formal opposition to the warrants.Within days of his election on July 4, Starmer reached out to Netanyahu, calling for “further deepening the close relationship between the two countries,” according to a British readout. “He added that it was also important to ensure the long-term conditions for a two-state solution were in place, including ensuring the Palestinian Authority had the financial means to operate effectively.”"

WaPo_87,"Massive Park Fire continues spread after start from flaming car, officials say",https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/26/park-fire-california-chico-arrest/,2024-07-27 01:00:02.779274,,"The massive Park Fire in Northern California has continued its spread, fueled by strong winds and hot, dry weather. The wildfire, which authorities believe was an act of arson, was 0 percent contained and grew to more than 239,000 acres on Friday, making it the state’s largest this year.California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday declared a state of emergency in Butte and Tehama counties in response to the Park Fire, as well as in Plumas County in response to the separate Gold Complex Fire, which has burned about 3,000 acres.“We are using every available tool to protect lives and property as our fire and emergency response teams work around the clock to combat these challenging fires,” he said in a statement, urging people to stay safe and remain alert.Two minor injuries were reported in a Friday morning update on the Park Fire, and Cal Fire said 134 structures have been destroyed and more than 4,000 structures remain threatened.In a Friday afternoon update, Cal Fire officials said fire crews had witnessed dramatic growth to the north of the flames and were looking for ways to curb the spread in that direction. Billy See, an incident commander with Cal Fire, said that while red-flag conditions were anticipated to remain in place until Friday evening, crews were hopeful that cooler temperatures and increased humidity into the weekend would better allow firefighters to tackle the flames.See said about 1,700 personnel were on the ground, with more crews on the way to help fight the fire, which he said had been growing by about 4,000 to 5,000 acres per hour.The fire started Wednesday afternoon and “exploded from a 400-acre fire to a more than 71,000-acre inferno consuming everything in its path” overnight into Thursday, Cal Fire said. By late Thursday, it was burning across more than 145,000 acres in Butte and Tehama counties and had produced several fire tornadoes.The small mountain community of Cohasset is fully within the fire perimeter, said Zeke Lunder, a geographer who maps and reports on wildfires via the website the Lookout, in a Friday briefing. That does not mean that all structures in the community are impacted, however.Further south, firefighters have so far been able to hold the fire at the highway, which he called a “huge win” for communities like Forest Ranch, Paradise and Magalia. Still, these places are not yet out of the woods.Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea emphasized that residents in impacted areas should pay close attention to evacuation orders that are shifting as fire dangers develop.“The fire doubled back and went through Cohasset,” Honea said in the Friday briefing. “We initially ordered the evacuation of Cohasset on Wednesday, so that area had about three days worth of [evacuation] warning and orders before the fire came through and caused a great deal of destruction.”Winds of 10 to 20 mph with gusts up to 30 mph were expected on Friday, but those should begin to ease by Saturday, followed by a cooling trend this weekend.In a briefing Thursday afternoon, UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain said the Park Fire is “really the first fire in the past several years in California where I would call its behavior ‘extraordinary,’ and that’s not a good thing.”Winds have been contributing to the fire’s extreme behavior and spread.“The heat [of the fire] drives embers high into the atmosphere and they get blown downwind long distances. … So it can spread pretty fast that way,” said Craig Clements, a professor of meteorology and climate science at San José State University.But the real culprit in the fire’s explosive spread is ultradry vegetation from weeks of extreme heat, which has dramatically escalated the fire season across much of the West.Authorities said the fire was sparked by a man pushing a flaming car down a gully.Butte County District Attorney Michael L. Ramsey said Ronnie Stout, 42, of Chico would be arraigned Monday on charges related to arson that have yet to be determined. Investigators say a witness saw him pushing a flaming car off an embankment in upper Bidwell Park.“She saw him get into the vehicle, do something in the vehicle, get out of the vehicle, and then push the flaming vehicle down the embankment,” Ramsey told reporters. “We are here today because of that.” He said the vehicle was Stout’s mother’s car.Stout was arrested early Thursday on a no-bail warrant, Ramsey said.Butte County has repeatedly been ravaged by deadly and destructive wildfires. The Camp Fire nearly incinerated the town of Paradise in 2018, killing 85 people. On Friday, residents of Paradise were on edge after authorities told them to prepare for the chance they’ll need to evacuate as Park Fire flames spread.The Park Fire has been compared to the Camp Fire, though the 2018 fire was driven by an extreme autumn windstorm. This fire is spreading with fairly typical summertime winds that happen in California’s Central Valley, Clements said.In 2021, the Dixie Fire, which was sparked by PG&E power lines, devastated the town of Greenville, Calif., and burned nearly 1 million acres, the second-largest fire in state history. Earlier this month, the Thompson Fire near Oroville destroyed or damaged dozens of structures and burned more than 3,700 acres before fire crews contained it.So far this year, 4,367 fires have erupted in California, burning at least 343,253 acres. These ignitions have come from a mix of causes, including lightning and arson. Scientists say that climate change is a driving force in making wildfires more explosive in California, and around the world.Brianna Sacks and Kelsey Ables contributed to this report."
WaPo_88,‘Hot Dog Money’ recounts a wide-ranging NCAA scandal,https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/07/26/hot-dog-money-guy-lawson-marty-blazer-ncaa-scandal-review/,2024-07-27 02:59:02.904497,,"For NBA junkies who go back to the 1980s, the name Chuck Person probably evokes two things. One is his fantastic nickname, “The Rifleman,” which he got for being a three-point sniper (of a whole other era: He only made more than 150 in a season twice). The second is a number of trash-talking shootouts he had with Larry Bird, including in a memorable 1991 playoff series between Boston and Indiana, the Game Five finale of which saw each man drop 32 points. The Celtics prevailed, 124-121, and the legend goes that the Rifleman had to pay up and mow Bird’s lawn.Person, who won Rookie of the Year in 1987 and remains Auburn University’s all-time leading scorer, was a fun player to watch, but I hadn’t thought about him in a while. Then he popped up in “Hot Dog Money: Inside the Biggest Scandal in the History of College Sports,” a new book by Guy Lawson. (Little A, the book’s publisher, is a subsidiary of Amazon. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) In one scene, set at an Applebee’s in 2016, the deeply indebted Person takes a $5,000 envelope from Marty Blazer, a crooked financial adviser turned undercover FBI informant. Person, then an assistant coach at his alma mater, pocketed the bankroll with a promissory note to deliver top NBA prospects to Blazer, who would then become their business manager. The conversation was captured on a tiny hidden recording device.Lawson, a dogged investigative journalist, vividly tells the story of the three years Blazer spent working undercover to prove the NCAA plot was a “multibillion-dollar scam,” at least in the cash-cow sports of football and basketball. Blazer started telling Lawson his tale in 2020 after he’d done his FBI bit and been sentenced on federal fraud charges — a year’s probation and $1.56 million in restitution to clients — and he is certainly forthcoming in laying out the flaws, foibles and absurdities during his peak corruption days. (Emergency medical care for a client’s date, who had a breast implant blowout? Done.)Lawson had full editorial control and there is no reason to doubt this version of events, but “Hot Dog Money” is, by nature, somewhat friendly to Blazer, who died in January at 53. Given that at this point (or for the past several decades), only Dockers Dads who use the term “student-athlete” non-ironically would be scandalized by this “scandal,” it’s hardly earth-shattering. But in the proper state of mind, the book snaps like a dirty water dog — not as a stunning expose, but as a black comedy.Lawson includes countless sordid descriptions of grifters, groupies and (supposedly) grown-ups milking the collegiate teat with dubious hopes of everyone getting rich from guaranteed NBA contracts down the line. At its heart, it was a wide-ranging but typical pay-to-play scheme, medium bucks loosely passed around to get certain kids to play ball at certain schools and sign with various dealmakers. Person stands out as a recognizable NBA vet; most of the others who got caught in the FBI’s web weren’t headliners. Ultimately, there were 10 convictions, mainly of low-level assistant coaches and backroom shoe brokers.Blazer was the proverbial old guy at the club, feting college studs and everyone in their orbit with C-notes, lap dances, luxury watches, starter cars and gallons of “single malt Scotch,” a spirit sold exclusively in every half-decent bar in America. He built his clientele in football, taking care of NFL prospects and, after they signed contracts, becoming their financial adviser.“Hot Dog Money” — a phrase for cash peeled off on the spot, more week-altering than life-changing — really comes to life when it recounts the felonious jackpot that Blazer accrued and that forced his hand to become an FBI informant. As an investment strategist, he Ponzi-schemed the college football clients of his who became NFL studs, transferring more than $2 million without their knowledge to produce movies like “Mafia,” a Ving Rhames-led vehicle from 2012 that even Rhames might wish scrubbed from his IMDb page.By all accounts, Blazer did everything the FBI asked of him in Operation Ballerz — yes, its real name — but he wasn’t exactly turning on the crew from “Goodfellas.” Blazer compares the NCAA to the mob, but no trucks get hijacked and nobody is pistol-whipped. Without a threat of actual violence, “Hot Dog Money” isn’t compelling in a murderous way, but the ridiculousness of the scammers throughout makes for an entertaining summer diversion, a solid book to accompany a couple of beers in a hammock.The parade of cartoon characters who got a taste include: one of Blazer’s FBI handlers, who drunkenly took $13,500 of federal cash out of a hotel suite safe during a casino sting, and then lost it all on blackjack (as any good G-man knows, what happens in Vegas is most likely caught on camera in Vegas); the mysterious “Rick,” a chain-smoking, well-to-do, red-mulleted wannabe jock; the unrepentant plugged-in Adidas consultant Merl Code (who, inexplicably, wasn’t nicknamed “Cheat”); and of course the Rifleman himself, who submarined a promising and lucrative coaching career for a total of $91,500, less than a third of his salary.While there were short prison sentences for a few of the 10 men convicted in Operation Ballerz, Person walked away with probation and 200 hours of community service, which encapsulates how small-time the biggest scandal in college sports history really was. (The sentencing judge cited Person’s ridiculously charitable ways for most of his life.) “Hot Dog Money” is still a lively read because Lawson is adept at building momentum and has a sharp eye for cinematic detail. The best scenes feel tailor-made for a frisky eight-episode streamer. And indeed, the book’s film rights have already been snatched up by George Clooney’s Smokehouse Pictures and Amazon Studios. I doubt the two-time Oscar winner will solicit my advice, but he would be far better served following the satirical “Burn After Reading” playbook rather than the straight-faced “Michael Clayton” one. First call: Ving Rhames.Patrick Sauer has been a freelance writer for more than 20 years for many publications, some that still exist.

WaPo_89,Investigation of Delta cancellations focuses on possibly misleading texts,https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2024/07/26/delta-canceled-flights-investigation-crowdstrike/,2024-07-27 02:36:02.904497,,"The Department of Transportation’s investigation into Delta’s wave of flight cancellations over five days starting July 19 is examining text messages the airline sent passengers that regulators say did not spell out their rights to a refund, according to a person briefed on the investigation.New airline passenger rights laws require airlines to notify travelers they can receive refunds in cash if their flight is canceled or significantly delayed.But regulators received reports that Delta passengers last week received messages saying that if they chose not to be rebooked, they would receive the cost of the ticket back as a credit, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe an ongoing investigation. Transportation Department officials contacted Delta on Saturday, spelling out the law and demanding that the airline correct its messaging, the person said.Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg then raised the issue directly in a phone conversation Sunday with Ed Bastian, the airline’s chief executive, the person said. Buttigieg told Bastian the airline needed to update its communications to comply with the law.Delta’s problems began July 19 during a global IT outage linked to CrowdStrike security software, but as other airlines quickly recovered, the Atlanta-based carrier struggled with a crew management system throughout the weekend. The airline ultimately canceled more than 5,000 flights before getting its operation running smoothly again on Wednesday, affecting about 500,000 people, according to the Transportation Department.Delta said in a statement that it was cooperating with the investigation and “takes our compliance obligations seriously.”“Next to safety, Delta’s number one priority is to take care of our customers and our people, something we will continue to do as we recover from the unprecedented effects on our operation from the CrowdStrike-caused outage,” the company said.Buttigieg announced Tuesday that the department was opening an investigation after officials received more than 3,000 complaints. Officials have the power to levy fines if they ultimately find that Delta broke the law in its handling of the disruption.“There’s a lot of things I’m very concerned about, including people being on hold for hours and hours, trying to get a new flight, people having to sleep on airport floors, even accounts of unaccompanied minors being stranded in airports, unable to get on a flight,” Buttigieg said at a news conference Tuesday.The department began communicating with airlines about their responsibilities to passengers affected by the disruptions on them morning of July 19, according to a memo officials sent carriers obtained by The Washington Post. The memo said that the department had determined that any disruptions were under the control of the airlines, which triggers refund protections for passengers. The memo reminded airlines of their obligations when passengers seek their money back: “prompt refunds are due.”Delta has said it struggled to get a system for managing crews back up and running smoothly after the outages. Pilots and flight attendants were effectively lost in the airline’s system, spurring a wave of delays that lasted until Tuesday. It is not clear why Delta encountered long-running problems even as other airlines affected by the computer glitch restored their operations quickly.Delta’s problems this week mirrored a meltdown at Southwest Airlines during the Christmas holiday period in 2022. The Transportation Department launched an investigation into those problems and ultimately fined the airline $140 million.That incident also prompted lawmakers to tighten passengers’ rights as part of an update to aviation laws passed this year. That law permits airlines to offer an alternative to a refund like a voucher but only if the offer “includes a clear and conspicuous” notice of the passengers’ right to a refund.But in an example of Delta’s message a customer posted on social media, the airline did not mention refunds, writing: “If you prefer not to rebook your trip, your ticket value will automatically be available as an eCredit that can be used towards a future Delta ticket.”Consumer advocate William McGee, a senior fellow at the American Economic Liberties Project, said his organization also received reports that Delta was sending text messages informing travelers — including the family member of a colleague — their flight had been canceled and offering them an e-credit. There was no mention in the message that the person also could receive a cash refund, which McGee said is misleading, particularly because many travelers may not realize current rules entitle them to a cash refund.When his colleague asked what his family member should do, McGee was clear. Responding in all caps, he said, “Tell her not to accept it. She’s entitled to a cash refund. And now I can’t help but wonder how many other people got this and just hit the button?”Democratic lawmakers involved in writing the passenger rights law sent letters to Bastian this week questioning Delta’s response to the cancellations. Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), the chair of the committee that oversees airlines, wrote Tuesday that Delta did not appear to be providing proper information about refunds on its website. Democratic leaders on the House Transportation Committee pointed to the new law Thursday in a letter asking Bastian how Delta was refunding passengers and reimbursing them for any additional costs.Lori Aratani contributed to this report."
WaPo_90,How much could Kamala Harris’s 2020 positions cost her?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/26/how-much-could-kamala-harriss-2020-positions-cost-her/,2024-07-27 02:04:02.904497,,"Lurking beneath Democrats’ ebullience this week is the reality that their new likely 2024 presidential nominee could be a tough sell to swing voters. Vice President Harris has gotten a bump in her image ratings since she jumped into the race, but polls show she remains unpopular, on balance.What’s more, Republicans have some real fodder for pitching Harris as too far left. Much of it traces to a failed 2020 Democratic presidential primary campaign in which Harris went further to the left than some fellow candidates, including President Biden, in ways that might not play so well in a 2024 general-election setting.The effort to highlight those positions has now kicked off, especially in the GOP’s efforts to win back the Senate. A widely shared ad from Pennsylvania GOP Senate candidate Dave McCormick highlighted a series of Harris’s past positions while tying her to Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.). The National Republican Senatorial Committee put up its own version of the ad Thursday.Given the things in those ads are likely to be fixtures of the Republican messaging ahead, it’s worth asking: What kind of liabilities could they be?Let’s break it down, with the caveat that much of this polling is a few years old, because these issues were more front-and-center back then.“There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking.” (September 2019)Hydraulic fracturing has led to a boom in U.S. oil and natural gas production. But it can have a negative impact on the environment through wastewater contamination and air pollution, and it has been linked to an increase in earthquakes.Harris went further than most Democratic presidential candidates, including President Biden, who merely called for limiting fracking or increasing regulation.While there’s not a ton of good recent polling, Gallup surveys last decade showed Americans turning against fracking, with 53 percent opposing it and 35 percent favoring it in a 2017 survey. A Pew Research Center poll this year showed 44 percent of Americans wanted more fracking — an increase mostly attributable to growing Republican support.This is especially an issue in Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state where fracking is a major and growing industry. But a 2020 YouGov survey showed even that state was evenly split on the practice. And another survey that year showed about half of Pennsylvanians supported a fracking ban — basically the same as Harris at the time.“Yes, I would. Yes.” (September 2019)A 2022 AP-NORC survey showed 35 percent of Americans wanted to expand offshore drilling, while 32 percent wanted to keep it the same, and 31 percent wanted to reduce it.Of course, banning it goes further than just reducing it. And the AP-NORC poll showed just 17 percent wanted to reduce offshore drilling “a lot” — suggesting few Americans would go as far as Harris did.“There’s no question that we’ve got to critically reexamine ICE and its role, and the way that it is being administered, and the work it is doing. And we need to probably think about starting from scratch.” (June 2018)Republicans are pitching this as Harris joining left-wing calls to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. And Harris’s comments on “starting from scratch” certainly suggest an openness to such an idea — if not an embrace of it.A 2018 AP-NORC survey found that just one-quarter of Americans favored abolishing ICE, while 4 in 10 opposed that. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll back then showed about twice as many voters said they’d be less likely to vote for a candidate who supported abolishing ICE (48 percent) as said they’d be more likely (25 percent).“ ‘Defund the Police’ — the issue behind it is that we need to reimagine how we are creating safety. … This whole movement is about rightly saying, we need to take a look at these budgets and figure out whether it reflects the right priorities.” (June 2020)Republicans will pitch Harris as being in favor of defunding the police, even as she left her answer somewhat vague, as she did on abolishing ICE. Harris had been asked about the “Defund the Police” movement and invoked it in her answer, but she had also spoken more broadly about a racial-justice “movement” in the wake of George Floyd’s murder. At other points, she spoke about how we shouldn’t just focus on putting more police on the streets.A September 2020 Public Religion Research Institute poll showed Americans opposed the Defund the Police movement, 62 percent to 37 percent. (The poll didn’t define Defund the Police. But the previous question showed Americans generally understood it to mean redirecting “some police department funding to other social services” rather than eliminating police departments entirely, 70-28.)By June 2021, a USA Today/Ipsos poll showed even stronger opposition, with nearly 8 in 10 Americans opposing the movement, including 54 percent “strongly.”It’s worth noting that these polls weren’t about actually defunding the police, but about the movement that carried that name (Democrats have strained to distinguish between the two). That suggests that Harris’s playing up the movement’s efforts could stick to her, even if she didn’t embrace actually defunding the police.“If [members of Congress] fail to act, as president of the United States I am prepared to get rid of the filibuster to pass a Green New Deal.” (September 2019)Ending the filibuster — which effectively requires the support of 60 senators rather than a majority to pass legislation — has had little support. But opposition hasn’t been that strong, either.A 2022 Fox News poll showed Americans evenly split (26-26) on ending the filibuster, but with nearly half offering no opinion. A Monmouth University poll the same year showed 43 percent wanted to keep the filibuster, while 35 percent wanted to keep it with changes, and just 17 percent wanted to scrap it entirely.The Green New Deal is tougher to poll, but potentially more problematic for Harris. It was a package intended to provide high-quality health care to all, to guarantee well-paying jobs and to have 100 percent clean energy; critics derided it as socialist in nature and exceedingly expensive.A 2019 Washington Post/KFF poll showed 6 in 10 Americans had no opinion of the proposal, with the rest were evenly split. Americans broadly supported nearly all of its goals, but when confronted with the idea that it would cost trillions of dollars, they opposed it 67-30.“I support a mandatory buyback program that will get weapons of war off our streets, with civil penalties imposed for noncompliance.” (October 2019)A 2019 Marist College poll showed 45 percent of Americans favored a mandatory buyback program for semiautomatic assault weapons like the AK-47 and AR-15.A 2022 Monmouth survey showed 42 percent supported banning such guns and instituting a mandatory buyback program, while a clear majority opposed that. And perhaps most notably, 45 percent of Americans strongly opposed that (significantly more than the 32 percent who strongly supported it).This proposal had significantly less support than other gun restrictions, including merely banning such weapons.“I am in favor of saying that we are not going to treat people who are undocumented and cross the border as criminals.” (July 2019)Harris at a debate also joined other Democratic presidential candidates in saying that illegal immigration should be a civil offense rather than a criminal one.While there’s not much good data on this question, a 2018 Quinnipiac University poll found voters in Texas — a red state — were about evenly split on whether those who cross the border illegally should be “immediately charged with a crime.”"

According to Forbes, Gojira will be the first metal band to perform at the Opening Ceremonies.Formed by brothers Joe and Mario Duplantier in the southwestern French commune of Ondres in 1996 under the name Godzilla, the group changed its name to Gojira, the Japanese name for the fictional monster that debuted on the big screen 70 years ago, in 2001 due to copyright concerts. Gojira released its first album, “Terra Incognita,” the same year.Gojira has since received three Grammy Award nominations. In 2017, Rolling Stone magazine named the band’s 2005 album “From Mars to Sirius” the 97th greatest metal album of all time. Two of the songs on the album featured “themes of marine-mammal preservation.”“An immediate hit in their native France, the band soon became spokespeople for environmental causes and Joe became the country’s first bona fide guitar hero in decades,” Rolling Stone reported.Le Parisien reported that Gojira, which holds the record for the loudest concert at Stade de France, would perform with Franco-Swiss opera singer Marina Viotti.1/7"

WaPo_94,Warner Bros. Discovery sues the NBA over deal with Amazon,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/26/warner-bros-discovery-lawsuit-nba-amazon/,2024-07-27 03:47:02.753319,,"Warner Bros. Discovery filed a lawsuit against the NBA, alleging that the league breached its contract by selling a package of broadcast rights to Amazon. The complaint marks a dramatic escalation of tensions between the longtime partners. Warner, which owns TNT Sports, believes it has the ability to match — and essentially take over — the Amazon deal under the terms of its previous rights agreement with the league.“Given the NBA’s unjustified rejection of our matching of a third-party offer, we have taken legal action to enforce our rights,” TNT Sports wrote in a statement after the suit was filed.NBA spokesman Mike Bass responded: “Warner Bros. Discovery’s claims are without merit and our lawyers will address them.”The NBA approved media rights deals with the Disney-owned ESPN and ABC, Comcast-owned NBC and Amazon last week. They are set to take effect for the 2025-26 season and total $76 billion over 11 years. Amazon’s portion of that deal is worth $1.8 billion annually.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos also owns The Washington Post,After the league reached its new deals, Warner told the NBA it was exercising what it believed were its matching rights for Amazon’s portion. The NBA declined the match and announced the new agreements — including with Amazon — on Wednesday. Warner then filed its lawsuit.According to the 108-page complaint, which was filed in state court in New York, “The NBA had no right not to honor [TNT’s] Match.” And while the league has told Warner that there are differences between the deals — Amazon is a streaming only company, for instance, and Turner is a cable network — the lawsuit contends those differences are not relevant to the matching provision.Warner is asking the court for injunctive relief to prohibit the league from entering its deal with Amazon, arguing that the NBA is critical to its business because of the fees it charges cable companies and the “halo effect” of the live games, which allows it to promote its other programming.The suit requests monetary damages if some form of equitable relief cannot be granted to Warner.The NBA has aired on TNT Sports since 1989. The network is home to the popular pre- and postgame show “Inside the NBA,” starring Charles Barkley. Barkley released a statement Friday that was distributed on some Warner-owned social media channels. “I’m not sure TNT ever had a chance,” he wrote. “TNT matched the money, but the league knows Amazon and these tech companies are the only ones willing to pay for the rights when they double in the future.”Barkley also gave an interview Friday to Dan Patrick in which he said he had spoken to the NBA’s three remaining media partners and will listen to possible job offers. He will continue to appear on “Inside the NBA” next season, TNT’s last under the current deal. "

Now that his reelection bid is over — and Vice President Harris is the likely Democratic nominee — Republicans are not entirely moving on.Trump bashed Biden repeatedly during a rally Wednesday in North Carolina, his first rally since Biden’s withdrawal. He took to social media to criticize Biden’s speech later Wednesday about his decision to not seek reelection. And as Republicans everywhere look to tie Harris to Biden, the president’s name is bound to keep coming up.Trump expressed frustration earlier this week about having to suddenly change focus from Biden, days after the Republican National Convention.“So, we are forced to spend time and money on fighting Crooked Joe Biden, he polls badly after having a terrible debate, and quits the race. Now we have to start all over again,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform, asking whether the GOP should be “reimbursed for fraud.”To be sure, Republicans have started recalibrating for Harris. Trump unloaded a fresh barrage of attacks against Harris at the Charlotte rally, and a pro-Trump super PAC is spending millions of dollars on new ads targeting Harris.But the specter of Biden still looms large. He has promised to finish his term and remain president for the next six months, and he has said he will campaign with Harris ahead of the November election.""I’m not going anywhere,” Biden said Monday in a surprise call to campaign staff.Biden’s Wednesday night speech — in which he said he was stepping aside in “defense of democracy” — prompted a new wave of GOP focus on him. Trump’s campaign aides circulated photos of a scowling Trump watching the speech from his plane after the Charlotte rally.“On Trump Force One …Hey Joe …You’re Fired!” top Trump strategist Chris LaCivita said on X.Trump railed against Biden’s speech as “terrible” during a Fox News interview the next morning. And he made multiple Truth Social media posts responding to the speech, calling it “DISMAL” and mocking media outlets for coverage that he said made it seem like Biden ""was the equivalent of the Late, Great Winston Churchill.”Trump followed up one of the missives by posting a large graphic of a ghoul under the heading, “Tales from the Crypt.”Trump and his advisers privately wanted Biden to stay in the race, liking their chances against an unpopular 81-year-old president whose party was in disarray. Biden was also a known entity for their party, with nearly 100 percent name ID among GOP voters in the latest Quinnipiac University poll.In a Wednesday memo, Harris’s campaign argued Harris, with her lower profile, “opens up additional persuadable voters.”“This race is more fluid now – the Vice President is well-known but less well-known than both Trump and President Biden, particularly among Dem-leaning constituencies,” Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon.The candidate swap has touched off a GOP scramble to define her with persuadable voters before she can — and Trump is seeking to do his part.“For three and a half years,” Trump said in Charlotte, “lyin’ Kamala Harris has been the ultra-liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe.""Isaac Arnsdorf contributed to this story."

It has forced thousands of residents to evacuate and has destroyed numerous homes, authorities said.A TikToker named Elizabeth Fox was one of the first to report seeing Stout, dressed in a red shirt and shorts, acting strangely. Then she saw the fire. In tears, she described in her video how she watched “the guy blow up his car, push it down the hill and walk away like nothing happened.” The fire spread so fast that she barely got out, Fox said, and she gave the police the photos she took of the car and the man.Three other young women told CBS that they had been enjoying the swimming hole when a man in his 40s walked up and started making strange remarks, slurring his words. He left them alone once a bystander came up, the group of friends said. Shortly after that is when they saw flames.The Butte County district attorney and other authorities said that around 3 p.m., Stout lit afire a 2007 Toyota Yaris, which allegedly belonged to his mother. He then put it into neutral and pushed it 60 feet into the lush wildland area, the district attorney said. The fire erupted and quickly outmatched the firefighters who were called to respond.Stout has two other felony convictions: He was convicted of child molestation in Butte County in 2001 and robbery with great bodily injury in Kern County in 2002. Stout was in prison for 19 years after the second conviction, records from Kern County show.When officials arrested him this week, Stout was still on probation for a DUI, the district attorney’s office said. While officials said he has not yet been charged, they plan to book him on suspicion of intentional arson once they finish reviewing the evidence. He is now in the Butte County Jail, and the arraignment is set for Monday, according to the district attorney.A resident at the Chico Mobile Home Park told the San Francisco Chronicle that police swarmed the trailer Stout had been living at with his parents for the past 18 months around 1:30 a.m., yelling through a loudspeaker that he come outside with his hands up. Another neighbor described Stout as a quiet person who kept to himself.Amanda Brown, who has lived in the park for about seven years, said she recognized Stout and couldn’t believe that someone, especially one of her neighbors, would “deliberately do this knowing how many lives are at stake.” She said this was especially true after what her community went through in 2018 when the Camp Fire devastated the nearby town of Paradise.Brown is still terrified of fire because of that. Her brother lost everything he owned, including his long-term boyfriend. He did not have fire insurance and has never recovered. She had many friends lose their businesses and others who became homeless.“The trauma of the Paradise Fire, they — we — haven’t gotten over it,” she said. “Losing a whole town, all those people who died.”Anxiously watching the Park Fire grow, she can’t help but think of what could happen to her and her 80-year-old aunt, who just moved in with her, if a similar fire were to roar into their community.“In these mobile home parks, we are packed in like sardines. This thing will go up in 10 minutes,” she said. “Everything we own is in this single-wide mobile home.”"

WaPo_98,New Richmond institute to examine how slavery helped build modern America,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/26/richmond-virginia-shockoe-slavery-memorial/,2024-07-27 04:34:02.869542,,"RICHMOND — This city tried hard to purge its landscape of reminders of slavery. The old slave jail, the auction blocks, even the African burying grounds were paved over long ago and largely forgotten.But an ambitious effort here aims to shed light on artifacts that linger in everyday life: The ways the slave economy and its major hub in Richmond contributed to the development of modern-day America, with all of its promise and problems.The Shockoe Institute, funded partly with an $11 million grant from the Mellon Foundation, unveiled plans this week for a facility that will anchor Richmond’s broader effort to memorialize its history as one of the country’s biggest markets for the buying and selling of enslaved people.The project is an attempt “to really put Richmond … at the center of the national conversation about monuments, memory, the public realm, landscape and the ways in which we use and/or misuse our history for various purposes,” Marland Buckner, president and CEO of the Shockoe Institute, said in an interview with The Washington Post.It comes as institutions across the city take new steps to confront Richmond’s past as the capital of the Confederacy. Earlier this year, the Valentine Museum opened a new gallery examining how its namesake — sculptor Edward Valentine — helped create the myth of the “Lost Cause” through his depictions of noble Confederate generals and hapless Black stereotypes. On the city’s riverfront, the American Civil War Museum launched an exhibit called “The Impending Crisis” that addresses “the ways in which slavery caused the war.”At Shockoe, work begins soon to convert a 10,000-square-foot section of the former train shed at Main Street Station in downtown Richmond into a building for the institute, which will have public exhibition space as well as a “lab” for studying public and personal history. Set to open by the end of next year, the space is being designed by the New York firm Local Projects, which also created the 9/11 memorial in New York and the Greenwood Rising civil rights museum in Tulsa.The train shed site itself is deep with history. In what’s now the parking lot and along a nearby stretch of Interstate 95 stood “Devil’s Half Acre,” where enslaved people were bred, sold and held at the notorious Lumpkin’s Jail. Across Broad Street was the city’s first African burying ground, rediscovered under a parking lot in the 1990s.Those features are set to be commemorated through the massive Shockoe Project, announced earlier this year, which includes archaeological sites and a national slavery museum. The full project could cost an estimated $265 million — most of which has yet to be raised — and take years to bring about; the Shockoe Institute is the first step.While the project has a long way to go, it marks a huge advance for a city that has struggled for years to decide how to commemorate this past, much of which had been deliberately obscured until the last 30 years or so.“This geography has been contested and litigated and been a political football far too long, and I have no truck with that,” Buckner told a gathering of local dignitaries, advocates and history buffs at a preview event Thursday night.Richmond city Councilwoman Cynthia Newbille, who has lived through many of those squabbles, said she was thrilled to finally see actual steps forward. “It’s been a long time,” Newbille said, adding that the pieces of the history have been like the disjointed squares of a quilt. “It has only been when we got to this point that we actually have the quilt, and because we have that quilt now, we can tell the whole story.”The story is woven directly into the development of the nation, said Gregg Kimball, a historian working with the institute who has also written a book about antebellum Richmond called “American City, Southern Place.” By the 1840s and 1850s, Kimball said, Richmond had become the primary hub for the slave trade in the Upper South, exceeded in size only by New Orleans in the Deep South.Tobacco farming had declined in Virginia, but the cotton economy farther south was labor intensive and had an insatiable appetite for enslaved laborers. So human chattel became a big export for Virginia, Kimball said. Part of the reason the state eventually outlawed the international slave trade was that new supplies from overseas would dilute the value of Virginia’s own production of enslaved humans.The slave trade and the cotton it produced built economic connections between the South, England and western Africa, not to mention rapidly industrializing cities in Northern states, Kimball said. “Capital was flowing between Richmond, London and New York. Those large-scale connections are pretty profound,” he said.Kimball is working with Buckner and others at the Shockoe Institute to portray that history in a way that’s interesting and relatable to modern-day issues. Thursday night’s preview suggested some of the elements of telling the human tale.Photos and stories of formerly enslaved Virginians recorded in the 1930s. Reconstruction-era newspaper ads from Black people trying to find their sold-off families. Legal paperwork related to an enslaved girl named “Lizzie” — born in Virginia, sold into Louisiana, changing hands five times before dying of a seizure at the age of 13. Her death sparked litigation when a buyer charged that she was “totally valueless as a slave.”Through individual stories, Kimball said, the aim is “to get at these larger themes: What does freedom mean, and how did Americans develop as a slave society yet talking about these ideals that are embedded in the Constitution and the Declaration?”Buckner, who spent years in D.C. as the government affairs director for Microsoft, said the message of the institute is not political. It’s intended to put today’s issues and events into a fact-based, historical context that helps people think about them in fresh ways.He said he envisions inviting experts and thinkers to a yearly symposium — like Davos or the Aspen Institute — to focus on a question about history and race in America. “I’m not just talking about historians. I’m talking about economists and political demographers and public policy people and legal experts, so that we can begin to do … the hard work of understanding the choices that got us to where we are today.”On Thursday, he offered three words to guide the institute as it tackles a subject of intense emotional impact: maturity, candor and generosity.“We’ve got to be kind and we have to be decent when we have these conversations with one another,” Buckner said. “That’s the only way this shared experience stays shared.”"
WaPo_99,Dow surges 650 points as stock market snaps back,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/26/dow-stock-market-rally/,2024-07-27 04:51:02.869542,,"Wall Street staged a comeback Friday after a bruising week on some optimistic economic signals.The Dow Jones Industrial Average popped 654 points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 40,589, offsetting steep losses from two days before. The broader S&P 500 rose 1.1 percent to close at 5,459, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index gained 1 percent to close at 17,357.Analysts described the gains as a classic bounce-back rally underpinned by continued optimism about the state of the economy. All three indexes suffered Wednesday after several leading tech companies posted disappointing financial results. But LPL Financial chief economist Jeffrey Roach said investors now appear to be taking more risks as the “soft landing” appears more and more likely.“We have an economy with low unemployment with rising wages, decelerating inflation, and a Fed on the cusp of cutting rates,” Roach said.The bounce-back comes on the heels of favorable inflation data, which may increase the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will cut rates in September. Data released Friday show the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge slowing to 2.5 percent for the 12-month period leading up to June, offering further evidence that the central bank’s rate-raising campaign is working. On Thursday, there was a stronger-than-expected gross domestic product reading showing the U.S. economy grew at a robust 2.8 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, capping two years of solid expansion.Leading the positive results Friday was manufacturer 3M, which soared 21 percent after its financial results shattered analysts estimates.Elsewhere, telecommunications company Charter Communications gained around 15 percent after posted sales numbers that exceeded Wall Street’s estimates.The stronger fundamentals have led to a broadening of the market’s 2024 rally, analysts say. Earlier in the year, the stock market’s gains were dominated by a few large tech firms, known as the “Magnificent 7,” which benefited from hype surround artificial intelligence technology.The gains now appear to cut across industries, said Michael Farr of the D.C.-based investment firm Farr, Miller and Washington. The Russell 3000 Index, which measures the more economically fragile small-cap stocks, is up 14 percent since the start of the year, outperforming the Dow.“There’s a shift from that Magnificent 6 or 7 and into some of the blue-chip stocks, as things other than AI are getting a bid,” Farr said."
WaPo_100,Lewis Lapham knew that a great editor was an artful thief,https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/07/26/lewis-lapham-appraisal/,2024-07-27 04:16:02.869542,,"In an age of hyperbole and literal-mindedness, Lewis H. Lapham, who died on Tuesday at 89, was a master of ironic understatement. As the personal computer and the touch screen turned everyone into a prose minimalist, he remained committed to a mandarin style, the majority of his sentences demonstrating the force of periodicity and sinuosity. Rare among intellectuals, he was hardly ever not funny, even on the most serious of subjects. “Funny” is not a word I recall him ever using in print, but wherever he was, laughter followed. Unlike his peers in the era of New Journalism, with whom he was sometimes grouped, he never endeavored to make himself the main character, though his readers could always sense that they were in the presence of a strong and reliable narrator with a singular talent for metaphor. These were his qualities as a newspaperman, magazine feature writer and monthly columnist. He was also one of the great editors of his time, reshaping America’s oldest monthly, Harper’s Magazine, and creating Lapham’s Quarterly from scratch.Lucky for me, I got to work for him. I was an intern at Harper’s in the first half of 2003. One morning Lapham ran out of Parliaments while trying to finish his column, and I bummed him a couple, to be repaid the next week with a pair of Cuban cigars. One afternoon in the office conference room, we watched in disbelief as Secretary of State Colin Powell presented the case for the invasion of Iraq based on satellite photos of aluminum tubes that were said to somehow indicate the preparation of nuclear warheads or at least the vaguer “weapons of mass destruction.” One night a few weeks later, we watched the flashes on the screen as the first bombs were dropped on Baghdad. Lapham was one of the few voices in national publications who strongly opposed the war. Later, he called for the impeachment of George W. Bush. These stances, lonely at the time, have been vindicated in the tumultuous decades that have followed. Lapham, however, was never a pundit. As columnists more and more fashioned themselves as outside electoral strategists for one party or another, he kept up the tradition of the observer as Socratic gadfly. He believed in America as a republic, at its best a democracy, but never as an empire. He was a skeptic of power but never a cynic when it came to human beings.Internships only last a few months, but in 2006 I rejoined the magazine as an associate editor. It was Lapham’s last month as editor. One evening we were out for drinks at the touch Star, his regular watering hole on Lafayette Street, around the corner from the Harper’s office on Broadway, along with a couple of our colleagues and some of his new collaborators on Lapham’s Quarterly, then in the early stages of development. Someone asked him the secret of editing. He said he’d learned it from his editor at the Saturday Evening Post, and it could be summed up in one word: “steel.” We were dumbfounded for a moment — was an editor really like an NFL lineman or Superman? — until we realized we’d heard him wrong: The word was “steal.” And many of Lapham’s innovations at Harper’s and LQ were elegant systems of thievery. (Perhaps borrowing is a better term, and of course copyright holders were always paid for the republication of their poetry or prose in the magazines.) The Harper’s Index and Readings Section and every issue of Lapham’s Quarterly were exercises in the arts of collage and anthology. Sometimes the trick was thematic unity, sometimes impish juxtaposition, of documents, lists, cut-ups, jokes, numbers and images. Lapham and the young editors he surrounded himself with scouted widely and took from everywhere.But for all his artful thievery, his signal achievement as an editor was the discovery and amplification of writers, talents he stole from obscurity, from little magazines, from small presses, from the unrealized and frustrating years of youth, and often from the halls of his own office. Annie Dillard, Barry Lopez, Michael Pollan, David Foster Wallace — some of their earliest works appeared in Harper’s under his editorship, and that’s not to mention the many distinguished contributions of Evan S. Connell, Guy Davenport, Don DeLillo, Barbara Ehrenreich, Christopher Hitchens, John Leonard, John Edgar Wideman and so on. These were names rarely seen, if ever, in the pages of his magazine’s uptown rival, the New Yorker; perhaps their styles were too unruly. Lapham once acknowledged the achievement of the New Yorker’s William Shawn in a review for the New York Times of Ved Mehta’s “Remembering Mr. Shawn’s New Yorker”: “The art of Shawn’s editing was plainly visible on every page of the magazine, which for the 35 years of his term in editorial office governed the republic of American letters.” Whereas the New Yorker had and has a house style from which only a few Barthelmes and Kaels have been allowed to deviate, house style at Harper’s never stretched beyond a few conventions of punctuation. The idea was never to spawn a legion of Lapham clones. The notion would have repulsed him.For my generation, arriving before the floodgates of under-compensated and under-edited online writing were opened wide, Lapham provided young people a stage on which to do major work for a decent paycheck, publishing some of the earliest work of Tom Bissell, Ben Metcalf, Gideon Lewis-Kraus, the late Matthew Power, John Jeremiah Sullivan and Jennifer Szalai. Some of us, like myself and Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah, a onetime Harper’s intern who went on to win the Pulitzer Prize for magazine feature writing, never quite got around to writing for Lapham, but for us and many others his encouragement was the crucial intervention. The mere example of watching him toil for two weeks every month in longhand over each column, cigarette in hand, was inspiring. It was more time than a newspaperman in a city bullpen ever had, and having been one of those he knew it, and earned the privilege of his long days by taking the appropriate pains with each sentence.Under the elegant sentences and the elegant suits and ties was a mischievous man who wore no socks with his loafers. He was a son of, critic of and traitor to the Establishment. His grandfather, Roger Lapham, was a Republican mayor of San Francisco in the 1940s, and his brother Anthony worked for the CIA, an organization that turned down Lewis’s application. That sent him to the newsroom of the San Francisco Examiner and then the New York Herald-Tribune, the source of his favorite stories to tell, many of which were not fit to print. He had tried to be a poet, coming down from Yale on the weekends to seek out W.H. Auden at Manhattan cocktail parties. He had tried to be a scholar, going up to Cambridge to study with C.S. Lewis, but he found he didn’t have the footnotes in him. He had tried to be a pianist, auditioning once for one of his profile subjects, Thelonious Monk, who told him simply: “I heard you.” He was, I think, happiest as a reporter, endlessly amused by the men and women he encountered on the road, something evident from the many barroom scenes in “Alaska,” his first contribution to Harper’s, in 1970. As an editor, he resisted the two forces he thought had ruined magazines in his lifetime — television and celebrity — and he made it his mission to bring his readers great writing or something as close to it as he could get hold of in any given month. He knew the life of a writer was one of frustration, failure and humiliation, relieved only by a sense of constant dedication and occasional delight. That’s why on reading an early published work of one of my colleagues and detecting in it the beginnings of a real writer, all he said was: “I’m sorry.” Then he published it.Christian Lorentzen is a critic and essayist whose work regularly appears in the London Review of Books, Harper’s, Bookforum, Granta and other publications."

There is no separating the two now, despite all the separations: the gates, the fences, the bollards, the closures, the motorcades, the river itself — a metropolis clamping down yet very much breathing, waving the tricolor flag of sport, profit and patriotism. Swimmers in the Seine! Beach volleyball at the foot of the Eiffel Tower! Every curb and cobblestone seems to be guarded by the most attractive police officer you’ve ever seen in your life — until you smell what one of them is smoking: not a cigarette, cinematically, but a grape-flavored vape.There is no peace, despite all the peace. The Metro stations smell of fresh paint. Helicopters and sirens say “emergency,” but Parisians — the ones who haven’t fled — seem très nonchalant. There are 5,300 angelic volunteers, in purple or teal vests, minding every stairwell, every potential chokepoint of confusion, ushering bodies in the right direction. There are also camouflaged squads of “vigipirate,” a malign-sounding term that just means anti-terrorism. And yet the evening before the Opening Ceremonies, the 7th arrondissement felt like a ghost town.The ceremonies, viewed not on TV but from under Pont de Sully, are splendid and tedious. Spines tingle. Knees ache. Spectators are at least 50 bodies deep at points along the riverside gardens on the Left Bank, between Pont d’Austerlitz and Pont de Sully. People perch in trees, scale public art, lounge on grass slopes, balance on steel barricades, lean on stone balustrades. The Olympics are everywhere.It pays to be a small nation: Aruba has all the room in the world on their boat, while the Germans were packed cheek by jowl. From here, you can hear the soaring choruses of “Les Mis” while the tiny Cook Islands team motor by. The mood is good. No one knows, at this moment, about the bomb scare a couple kilometers away, at Place du Châtelet. An abandoned suitcase — maybe that should be the mascot of these “haute sécurité” games.Instead we have the Paris 2024 mascot — a red, smiley, finned blob — that looks anatomical, even clitoral, many have observed, though it’s supposed be modeled on an 18th-century piece of headwear called a Phrygian cap (which also sounds anatomical, like something some people sometimes have to get removed.)Protests sparked and died all week: against Israel, against the clearing of homeless encampments. Taxi drivers are on strike! No, the dancers for the Opening Ceremonies are on strike! In Saint-Étienne, someone from the Canadian women’s soccer team flew a spy drone over the practice session of its first competitor, New Zealand. Is this just the era we’re in?All seems normal in the abnormal world. Remember: There is an ongoing war on this continent. And yet there’s a strange comfort in the family of tourists — American tourists — who decided to dress up for the queue at La Galerie Dior on Rue François.The advertised heat hasn’t popped off yet, but the air was sweating all week, and the skies opened with rain around the time Ireland’s boat passed under Pont de Sully on Friday.Liberté, egalité, humidité.Amid all the rumors this week of Opening Ceremonies appearances from Gaga (true!) and Celine (we will never recover), we settled for Jill, whose heart, it seems will go on. She was in the Oval Office on Wednesday night, just off camera, as President Biden spoke of the torch — not the Olympic one, but the metaphysical one that he’s decided to pass. Ninety minutes later, the first lady boarded Executive One Foxtrot to lead the U.S. delegation to Paris, as if tout est bien.“Biden jette l’éponge” was a headline in Le Figaro (“throws in the towel”).A chyron on France 5: “Kamala Harris, le Cauchemar de Trump?” (That would be “nightmare.”)“Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom,” Harris said Tuesday at a rally outside Milwaukee. “And now, Wisconsin, the baton is in our hands.”Torch/baton symbolism abounds lately. Pass ’em along. Replace the present tense with the present perfect continuous. What is will soon be what was.“President Biden has led our country with that hope always in his heart,” Jill Biden said Thursday in the 8th arrondissement, in the garden of the opulent residence of the U.S. ambassador to France. The couple hundred guests — mostly family members of athletes — began to clap. They heard the tense, maybe felt a release of tension. “Has led.”The first lady looked grateful for the applause, and perhaps wistful, too. “Thank you,” she continued, American flags fluttering behind her from the residence. “I’ll take that home to him. And as he says: There is nothing America can’t do when we do it together. And we see that especially now, at the Olympics.” An hour later, la première dame was at Team USA’s training facility in Eaubonne, passing a literal baton to sprinters, in a stationary relay handoff staged for the cameras, accompanied by game chants of “U-S-A, U-S-A.”But what of the host country, whose snap elections earlier this month have garbled the government? Things in France are as unprecedented as things in the states.“I can tell you that the mood is not for games,” said Vincent Michelot, on the phone from Lyon, where he is a professor of American politics. “I’ve been studying political science and history for the last 45 years, and this is the strangest political moment I’ve ever experienced in France. The institutions seem to be at a dead end. Everybody’s talking about the Sixth Republic, but the Fifth Republic just won’t die.”Pass the torch to a new generation? Or just pass the torch to Snoop Dogg (in French: “Snuup Doug”), who carried the flame Friday morning through the streets of Saint-Denis. He wore white athletic gear and gold-colored sneakers.On a press call this week, a journalist from Billboard asked Snoop how he would field a team to win a gold medal for rapping. (Why not have a gold medal for rapping? NBC needs a new generation of viewers to pay attention. Only 56 percent of Americans are even aware that the games are being held in France, according to a Gallup poll released Thursday; over the past 24 Olympiads, there’s been a 27 percent drop in interest among Americans younger than 50. Maybe the Sixth Republic can’t be built out of TikToks.)Anyway. “So this is rap Olympics you’re talking about?” Snoop replied. “I definitely would take Eminem. … Definitely would take Rakim. Then I would go grab a female … Queen Latifah. And naturally I gotta take Snoop Dogg. … I mean, dream team.”On Friday morning, a “massive” and “malicious” arson attack paralyzed three high-speed rail lines, according to France’s national rail service. Climate activists were planning a disruptive protest for Saturday.Are we in the mood for games? Monday was the hottest day ever recorded on Earth. Two days later, the 2034 Winter Olympics were awarded to Salt Lake City. Bonne chance with that! Just keep passing that torch."
WaPo_105,Celine Dion returns to stage at Opening Ceremonies,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2024/07/26/celine-dion-olympics-opening-ceremonies/,2024-07-27 05:28:02.745564,,"Celine Dion made a triumphant return to performing at the Olympic Games Opening Ceremonies, performing at the hours-long spectacle’s finale on Friday.Wearing a Dior gown adorned with thousands of pearls and embroidered fringing, Dion powerfully sang Edith Piaf’s “L’Hymne à l’amour” at the base of the Eiffel Tower — her first show since she announced she was diagnosed in December 2022 with a rare and incurable neurological condition known as stiff-person syndrome.The highly anticipated performance was also an emotional one. “Everyone will — how do I say?” one cabdriver said earlier in the day in France, before looking up a translation for “s’évanouir.” It translates to “faint.”No fainting was reported, but Dion’s cover was met with roaring applause, and left a few broadcasters, including a speechless Kelly Clarkson, in happy tears.After hitting the stage, Dion said on Instagram that she was “honored” and “so full of joy” to have performed in Paris. “I’m so happy to be celebrating these amazing athletes, with all their stories of sacrifice and determination, pain and perseverance,” she wrote. “All of you have been so focused on your dream, and whether or not you take home a medal, I hope that being here means that it has come true for you! You should all be so proud, we know how hard you have worked to be the best of the best. Stay focused, keep going, my heart is with you!”Dion, who achieved international superstardom with hits such as “My Heart Will Go On” and “It’s All Coming Back to Me Now,” canceled her Courage world tour in May 2023 to receive treatment for her disease.The chronic condition causes muscle stiffness and intense muscle spasms in the trunk and limbs, as The Washington Post previously reported. The disorder can impact one’s posture, balance and muscle use. It does not have any known effect on life longevity, except in rare situations where the muscles used for breathing or swallowing are impacted.The five-time Grammy winner arrived in France earlier this week, greeting fans and fueling not-quite-unreliable rumors that she would perform at the Olympics Opening Ceremonies. Dion herself hinted at a potential comeback in an interview with Vogue France in April: “I’ve chosen to work with all my body and soul, from head to toe, with a medical team. I want to be the best I can be. My goal is to see the Eiffel Tower again!”Since her diagnosis, Dion has made sparing appearances at award shows and red carpets. She received a standing ovation when she showed up at the Grammys earlier this year to present the album of the year award to Taylor Swift. (The moment also caught attention on the internet as many viewers alleged that Swift snubbed Dion when accepting her award. Swift later took a picture hugging Dion backstage.)In June, Dion attended the New York City premiere of her documentary “I Am: Celine Dion,” which chronicled her life and diagnosis. One vulnerable moment includes her experiencing a seizure. The documentary also showed Dion struggling to sing in a recording studio.Friday’s performance was not Dion’s first at the Olympics. She previously performed at the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta, where she sang “The Power of the Dream.”Candace Buckner contributed to this report. This article has been updated."

She immigrated to France with her family as a child and grew up in the Paris suburbs.She is one of France’s most popular artists: an award-winning singer known for mixing Afrobeats and R&B with slang-infused lyrics. She has five No. 1 songs in France, including 2018’s “Djadja,” which brought her international success. Before Coachella 2020 was scrapped, she was confirmed on the lineup, and she became one of the few artists who have performed a virtual concert on Fortnite.In addition to French music awards, she has garnered multiple nominations for best international act at the BET Awards and nearly 4 billion views for her YouTube videos.According to French media reports, some far-right groups in Europe lobbed racist insults at Nakamura in the lead-up to her performance and attacked organizers’ decision to let her represent France at the Olympics.President Emmanuel Macron said the artist “speaks to a good number of our fellow citizens, and I think she is absolutely in her rightful place in an opening or closing ceremony,” according to the Guardian.Nakamura said her stage name was inspired by Hiro Nakamura, a character from the NBC drama series “Heroes.”"
WaPo_107,Elon Musk said his trans child was ‘dead.’ She’s calling him out.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/26/musk-transgender-vivian-grimes/,2024-07-27 05:49:02.745564,,"Tension between billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk and his estranged, transgender daughter Vivian Wilson spilled into public view this week after she spoke out to counter her father’s claims that she was “killed by the woke mind virus.”In an interview with Jordan Peterson, Musk alleged he had been “tricked” into approving gender-affirming care for Wilson at 16 and had subsequently “lost” his son. The experience, he said, made him an ardent opponent of gender-affirming care and fueled his quest to “destroy the woke mind virus.”On X after the interview, Musk said that his child was born “gay and slightly autistic” and claimed these traits “contribute to gender dysphoria.” Wilson shot back soon after on Threads, dismissing her father’s characterization of her childhood as “entirely fake.” She criticized him for peddling harmful stereotypes about trans and queer people in “an attempt to garner sympathy points.”“He doesn’t know what I was like as a child because he quite simply wasn’t there,” the 20-year-old said in one post. And when her father was present, Wilson said, he “relentlessly harassed” her for her “femininity and queerness.”Washington Post reporters called and texted a phone number for Wilson but did not get a response. Musk did not respond to emailed requests for comment from The Post.The dispute marks a rare public spat between Wilson and Musk, whose frustrations over her transition have been central to his well documented rightward political shift. In recent years, Musk has been embraced by prominent conservatives such as Tucker Carlson, spoken out against corporate diversity initiatives and amplified right-wing commentators on social media.That political shift apparently cemented this month, when Musk endorsed former President Donald Trump in the 2024 election.On X, the social media platform he owns, he has decried gender pronouns with statements that have drawn backlash, even from those close to him.“I absolutely support trans, but all these pronouns are an esthetic nightmare,” Musk wrote in late 2020. In response to a tweet earlier that year where he wrote “Pronouns suck,” he was admonished by his then-partner Grimes, who asked him to stop and said she could not “support hate,” news outlets reported.In the Peterson interview, Musk characterized the gender-affirming treatments that Wilson received, including puberty blockers, as “child mutilation and sterilization.”Musk also told Peterson that permitting children to change their gender identity is “incredibly evil” and that those who advocate for gender-affirming care for young people “should go to prison.”Vivian is one of six children that the billionaire has had with Justine Wilson, a writer. He also has three children with the musician Grimes and three children with Shivon Zilis, an executive at Musk’s Neuralink company.Many states have banned gender-affirming care for transgender minors. A majority of Americans oppose puberty-blocking medications and hormonal treatments for trans children, according to a Washington Post-KFF poll, although the American Psychological Association has said the ability to access such treatments improves the overall well-being of those youths.Puberty blockers prevent the release of sex hormones. Once a patient stops taking blockers, their body immediately returns to producing its natal hormones.Although Musk used the term “sterilization,” doctors who treat trans patients say puberty blockers alone do not cause infertility. Puberty blockers have been used for years on children who experience precocious puberty, and they are “reversible no matter what,” said Marci Bowers, one of the nation’s preeminent gender transition surgeons and the president of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health.But a patient’s outcomes will vary based on when they start on the blockers, whether they take cross-sex hormones and how long they remain on the medication.After the Peterson interview, Musk was criticized for “deadnaming” his child — referring to her by her birth name and gender. Others’ refusal to use pronouns that trans- and gender-expansive youths use is a common, devastating problem for them, according to the Human Rights Campaign, which says that half of those youths say their family “never” refers to them with accurate pronouns.Musk was criticized by LGBTQ+ advocates this year after he said that “cis” and “cisgender” would be treated as slurs on X. Last year, he defended a policy that allowed users to misgender people on the platform as a matter of “free speech.”LBGTQ+ youth are being negatively affected by “hostile political rhetoric that often targets them, including from high-profile figures like Elon Musk,” said Jared Todd, senior press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign.“In a world where Musk could use his public status for good, he chooses to use trans youth as a scapegoat,” Todd said Friday in an emailed statement to The Post. “It’s both sad and unsurprising given his history.”In recent years, Todd said, the HRC has called out Musk for policies that have made X “a place where harmful rhetoric and bullying can spread unchecked.” He cited Musk’s recent decision to move the headquarters of SpaceX and X away from California in protest of a new state law barring school districts from requiring parents to be notified of a child’s change in gender identity.“Musk’s ignorant and inflammatory views on the trans community — even his own daughter — are out-of-step with those of a majority of Americans, and a permanent stain on his character and reputation,” Todd said.Wilson and Musk have been distant for some time, Wilson told NBC on Thursday in her first public interview. She formally severed ties with the billionaire more than two years ago.“I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form,” Wilson stated in a petition filed with California Superior Court in April 2022, when she sought to officially change her name.Wilson’s pushback against her father has garnered support online, including from Grimes, the musician who has children with the Tesla CEO.“I love and am forever endlessly proud of Vivian,” Grimes said Thursday in an X post."
WaPo_108,"With NCAA settlement filed, schools move closer to paying athletes",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/26/house-v-ncaa-settlement/,2024-07-27 05:12:02.745564,,"Division I schools are one step closer to directly paying college athletes.Settlement documents for three major antitrust cases — House v. NCAA, Hubbard v. NCAA and Carter v. NCAA — were officially filed in California on Friday, two months after the sides first agreed on an initial framework. As expected, the most important details haven’t changed: The settlement, if ultimately approved by Judge Claudia Wilken, would permit schools to share revenue with their athletes starting in the fall of 2025. There would be a cap, initially set at 22 percent of the average media, ticket and sponsorship revenue generated by power-conference schools (about $20 million), then increased each year.The NCAA and its members would also owe $2.78 billion in damages, which would be paid to hundreds of thousands of eligible athletes over a 10-year period. The NCAA would be responsible for roughly 41 percent of the total damages. Schools would handle the other 59 percent, mostly through the NCAA withholding some of their annual payouts of March Madness revenue. The athletes sued over various compensation restrictions, challenging the amateurism model that has always been the foundation of college sports. But if there are even hints of amateurism left, this settlement would do them in for good.From here, Wilken will review the long-form settlement and decide whether to grant preliminary approval. If she does, current and former athletes would have an opportunity to object to it and argue their case to her. Wilken would then consider those arguments before making a final call. If the process stays on schedule, lawyers expect it to finish sometime this winter.In the model created by the settlement, schools could also pay athletes directly for their name, image and likeness (NIL) rights, which is not allowed under current NCAA rules. If they did so, the NIL payments would count toward the 22 percent revenue-sharing cap. And while athletes could still strike NIL deals with third parties — the way they have made money since an NIL policy was implemented in the summer of 2021 — the NCAA is hoping to use this settlement to neuter the donor-funded collectives that have had a massive influence in football and men’s basketball recruiting.According to a statement from the NCAA, the settlement would establish a “robust and effective enforcement and oversight program to ensure the new NIL model achieves its objectives.” Or in other words: We are cool with an athlete earning $500 to post on social media about a pizza shop near campus. We are cool with a lucrative Nike or New Balance sponsorship. But we are much less cool with an athlete being promised $500,000 by a collective to transfer from one school to another — which NCAA officials often deride as “pay for play.”The documents filed Friday included descriptions of many new rules, some of which could be implemented before the settlement is finalized and others that could come after. The settlement would establish a clearinghouse that reviews any third-party NIL payments above $600. This is part of the NCAA’s effort to eliminate, or at least curb, NIL payments tied to performance or an athlete’s school choice. Of course, those are the exact types of payments that are effectively running major-conference football and men’s basketball. But since the settlement was agreed to in May, NCAA officials have pushed phrases such as “true NIL” and “fair-market value,” feeling they may finally have a shot to regulate the NIL world.Still, how much the NCAA can limit the power and spending of collectives – and whether it can really impose its definition of “true NIL” — remains a massive question. Free-market principles are one obstacle. Varying state laws, plus aggressive attorneys general, are others. The NCAA plans to use the clearinghouse data to inform decisions about whether a deal is for “fair-market value.” Then if an athlete wants to challenge a rule violation, a neutral arbitrator, who would be selected by the plaintiffs’ attorneys, would review the situation and make a ruling. That would be a significant shift in how enforcement and punishments are handled.“This settlement is an important step forward for student-athletes and college sports, but it does not address every challenge,” NCAA President Charlie Baker and the SEC, Big Ten, ACC, Big 12 and Pac-12 commissioners said in a joint statement Friday. “The need for Federal legislation to provide solutions remains. If Congress does not act, the progress reached through the settlement could be significantly mitigated by state laws and continued litigation.”The settlement does not resolve the question of whether any college athletes would become employees of their schools or conferences. It also doesn’t provide guidelines on how Title IX would apply to revenue sharing between schools and athletes. NCAA officials say it would instead be up to each individual institution to ensure gender equity. The settlement does, however, explain how the revenue-sharing cap would incrementally rise.After the first three years of the settlement, the revenue-sharing pool would increase by 4 percent. If, for example, the initial pool were an even $20 million, the first annual bump would put it at $20.8 million. But after the fourth year, the cap would be completely recalculated to account for any major spikes in revenue (such as a new conference TV deal). That would happen after the seventh year, too, though the plaintiffs’ attorneys would also have two chances to ask for a recalculation outside the scheduled updates.Another key piece of the settlement is updated roster rules. While the settlement includes new roster limits, scholarship limits would be eliminated, allowing schools to offer full or partial scholarships to every player on each team. This would certainly lead to a sharp increase in scholarships, because current rules allow 85 for football, 13 for basketball, 12 for softball and volleyball and 11.7 for baseball. The proposed roster limits are 105 for football, 15 for basketball, 34 for baseball, 25 for softball and 18 for volleyball, according to two people familiar with the settlement terms. In theory, that could lead to 20 more full scholarships in football, two more in basketball and so on, with Title IX law requiring equal scholarship opportunities for male and female athletes.An additional change is that all sports would become “equivalency sports,” permitting schools to offer partial scholarships to any athlete. Football and basketball, as of now, are “head count” sports, meaning all scholarship athletes receive a full grant. The settlement, then, would shift the budgets and roster math for many Division I programs. Should a football team offer a full or partial scholarship to the maximum 105 players, it wouldn’t have any walk-ons, long a staple of the industry. Baseball and softball, already equivalency sports, could also see a dramatic increase in scholarship money, especially at the highest levels.Not every school and conference is happy with the settlement. Not every plaintiffs’ attorney is, either. Back in May, in a letter to the NCAA, Big East Commissioner Val Ackerman argued that non-power-conference-football schools — everyone but the SEC, Big Ten, ACC, Big 12 and Pac-12 — would shoulder a disproportionate share of the $2.78 billion in damages to former and current athletes. That was before the NCAA and five power conferences, the six named defendants in the suit, agreed to settle with the plaintiffs. Then, after the agreement, Houston Christian, a small Division I school, attempted to intervene and block the settlement as constructed.On Wednesday, Wilken denied Houston Christian’s motion. And with the broad language in her decision, she made it clear she has a high bar for challenges from schools (and conceivably individual athletes, too). Nevertheless, if Wilken approves the settlement, athletes would have that chance to object to it and/or opt out of the revenue-sharing system.Meanwhile, Fontenot v. NCAA, another antitrust suit, is adding plaintiffs and plowing ahead despite a very possible settlement of House, Hubbard and Carter. The plaintiffs’ attorneys for House believe Fontenot will still eventually be consolidated with the other three cases. If that happened, the NCAA and its members would have clearer antitrust protection for the 10 years the settlement covers. But in an amended complaint, the plaintiffs’ attorneys for Fontenot are pushing hard against the proposed cap on how much money — again, about $20 million at first — schools can share with athletes.The lawyers argue the cap “is artificially low” and “far below the revenue sharing that a competitive market would yield.” Echoing criticism from some labor advocates, they added that “it also simply substitutes one illegal price fix for another.”That, right there, is the sound of more potential lawsuits in the future."

WaPo_110,‘Every teacher’ in Oklahoma must teach the Bible? That’ll keep them from leaving.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/26/oklahoma-public-schools-teachers-bible/,2024-07-27 05:21:02.745564,,"Last month, the Oklahoma Education Department’s state schools superintendent, Ryan Walters, ordered each Oklahoma teacher to teach the Bible in their classroom — with special attention paid to the Ten Commandments. “The Bible is one of the most historically significant books and a cornerstone of Western civilization,” Mr. Walters stated in a memo on June 27. Teachers who fail to comply could lose their license, Mr. Walters said during an NBC interview.I’d like to remind Mr. Walters that the Montgomery County Public School System in Maryland tried a similar mandate in 1973, but it met such a backlash that the multitudes of Bibles that were ordered had to be returned to the book depository.As a high school English teacher in Montgomery County, I personally relished the thought of teaching a unit called “The Bible as Literature.” I remember preparing my unit with poetry, metaphor, irony, proverbs, anthologies, redactors, allegory, hyperbole, parables, letters, satire, symbolism, prophecy, personification, wordplay and puns. The Supreme Court in 1963 ruled in Abington School District v. Schempp that religious texts used in classrooms cannot be used for religious purposes. My unit would have taught the Bible like any other book — as a product of the human mind produced by real people who lived in actual historical times, not that it was written under the direct inspiration of God and given to humans as a guide to their faith and conduct. But all my preparation was to no avail because of outrage, protests and objections from parents and even religious institutions.While the intent of Oklahoma’s initiative might be applauded by some, I think the state’s Education Department should consider the practical implications of Mr. Walters saying “every classroom in the state will have a Bible” and “every teacher” will teach from it. Mr. Walters needs to consider the costs to the state and the schools as well as the usefulness in classes such as physical education, physics and geometry. Will the Bibles sit there unused and eventually be remanded to the warehouse like ours were? Will curriculum writers scratch their heads looking for inoffensive ways to incorporate the Bible in innovative ways? Mr. Walters and his office should consider what we Maryland educators went through so they don’t repeat our past and spend considerable time, money and effort on an initiative that will eventually fall by the wayside.Kathy A. Megyeri, WashingtonRyan Walters made the rounds defending his policy mandating that Oklahoma public schools teach the Bible, including the Ten Commandments, because it is a “necessary historical document” as he said at a State Board of Education meeting last month. In his announcement, he said his team found “major points in history that refer to the Bible.” He referred to the Mayflower compact and the Founding Fathers and then jumped to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement.Mr. Walters shows his hand when he leapfrogs history. He shows it further when he marries his educational policy to his rhetoric, in which he often promotes Judeo-Christian values. For him, the values of America are synonymous with a particular theological understanding of Christianity, and the country’s ethical identity is instantiated in the message of the Bible.But when we look at the record, America’s understanding of the Bible’s message is anything but univocal. In fact, one American’s “Judeo-Christian values” were often pitted against another. Influential Baptist minister Richard Furman was a Bible-believing Christian who used biblical arguments in defense of chattel slavery in 1822. David Walker was no less a Bible-believing Christian when, in 1829, he called for enslaved persons to take up arms and commit violence against their oppressors. In the early 20th century, John D. Rockefeller Sr. reportedly believed “give, and it will be given to you” (Luke 6:38), an attitude which Rockefeller displayed in both his philanthropy and pursuit of unfettered material wealth. Meanwhile, Christian ministers such as Walter Rauschenbusch argued for socialist policies in favor of public ownership and in criticism of the “fictions of capitalism.” King used scripture to expose the “triple evils” of racism, economic greed and militarism, but J. Edgar Hoover was no more averse to using scripture to justify FBI surveillance of King and discriminatory “law and order” politics.It is undeniably true that the Bible holds an important place in American history. As a historian of religion, I, too, am concerned with upholding religion as a genuine agent of historical change. If Mr. Walters’s directive urged teachers to pay close attention to the role that religion played in history, I doubt there would be much pushback. I would vigorously defend such a policy. The issue is that his demands infer particular theological judgments about both the Bible and the United States. It also prioritizes a moral vision of the Bible that, as I pointed out above, is anything but self-evident. To assert that America is good because of the Bible, or that the Bible unambiguously points in a morally unified direction — toward liberty, toward democracy or toward a more just society — is to make a theological declaration, not a historical one.In arguing for the importance of the Bible, Mr. Walters has rightly noted that Thomas Jefferson referenced a “creator” in the Declaration of Independence. Strangely absent was the fact that Jefferson literally took a razor blade to the New Testament, rearranging the teachings of Christ and excising the gospels of miracles and anything supernatural. In doing so, Jefferson kept what he saw as eternal truths by ridding the gospels of their context and contingency, all to make the story of Jesus more palatable to his Enlightenment proclivities. Jefferson liked the Bible — or at least the parts of the Bible that supported his preconceived worldview. It’s a curious thing, history.Jacob Randolph, Oklahoma CityI am confused by the edict issued by Mr. Walters to require lessons on the Bible in public schools. Aren’t supporters of this measure from the same party as those who were so deeply alarmed at the prospect of sharia law in the United States?This measure seems even more hypocritical (and unconstitutional) than the Louisiana requirement that schools post the Ten Commandments. Perhaps, in a show of fairness, these state officials could mandate the teaching of algebra in churches?Larry McClemons, Annandale"
WaPo_111,"Trump, Netanyahu meet amid political and personal tensions",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/26/trump-netanyahu-set-meet-amid-political-personal-tension/,2024-07-27 05:17:02.745564,,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Friday with former president Donald Trump, working to mend their relationship at a time of political tension between their countries and personal tension between the two men.The pair were close allies during Trump’s presidency, but Trump was incensed when Netanyahu called Joe Biden to congratulate him on his 2020 election victory. Since then, the former president has been openly critical of Netanyahu’s management of the war in Gaza.During Friday’s session at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., they downplayed past antagonisms. “It was never bad,” Trump insisted when asked by reporters about the rift. “We’ve always had a very good relationship.” He added: “I was very good to Israel, better than any president’s ever been.”Afterward, Netanyahu posted multiple photos of the pair on his X account. During their meeting, Netanyahu thanked Trump for work on matters important to Israel during his presidential term, and Trump promised to “make every effort” to bring peace to the Middle East and combat antisemitism on American college campuses, according to a brief summary provided by the Trump campaign.Trump also took the opportunity to attack his likely November opponent, Vice President Harris, calling her a “radical left person” who “destroyed San Francisco” in remarks recorded by his campaign and later posted on X. He also called comments she made regarding Israel “disrespectful,” but did not specify which comments.Trump said he didn’t understand why Jewish voters would support Harris. “But that’s up to them,” he added.The meeting was the latest stop on a whirlwind trip for the Israeli leader, who addressed a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday and met with President Biden and Harris on Thursday.In her meeting with Netanyahu, Harris implored him to accept a cease-fire deal that would pause the fighting in Gaza and release hostages. U.S. leaders say they are closer than ever to an agreement, but finalizing it has remained elusive.“Let’s get the deal done so we can get a cease-fire to end the war,” Harris told reporters after the White House meeting. She also called for the hostages being held by Hamas to be released and for “much-needed relief to the Palestinian people.”The Biden administration has been a steadfast supporter of Israel since the conflict began with a deadly terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel on Oct. 7. But tensions have increased during the ensuing war as Palestinian casualties mounted and as the United States pressed for a deal that has yet to be finalized. Harris’s remarks appeared aimed at adding pressure on Israel and Hamas to close the remaining gaps.Trump, too, seems eager for the war to end and has focused his public criticism on the Israeli leader’s public relations management of the conflict.On “Fox & Friends” on Thursday, Trump said that Israel is getting “decimated” by bad publicity over its war with Gaza and that he wants Netanyahu “to finish up and get it done quickly.”“You got to get it done quickly because they are getting decimated with this publicity,” Trump said. “And, you know, Israel is not very good at public relations.”On this trip, Netanyahu has been forced to walk a delicate political balancing act, having landed just as Biden dropped out of the presidential race, Harris secured the support needed to win the nomination and the general election began in earnest.Israeli officials note that he needs strong relations with the Biden administration — which no matter what will remain in office for the next six months. But he also wants to smooth things over with Trump, both for his own politics back home and in case Trump returns to the White House.The prime minister’s conservative base and his most extremist coalition partners openly pine for a Trump victory. They recall his time in office as a golden era for Israel’s right wing: Trump brushed aside many of Washington’s neutral positions, moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, okaying the annexation of the Golan Heights and declaring that West Bank settlements should not be considered illegal as a matter of policy.Trump also helped usher in the 2020 Abraham Accords, a set of treaties that normalized relations between Israel and four Arab states: the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco.Trump would be more likely to allow Israel a freer hand with the Gaza war and whatever political and security arrangements follow it, say members of Netanyahu’s conservative base.Public Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir explicitly endorsed Trump on Wednesday, saying he would not hamper Israel’s war fighting as Biden has. Earlier this month, Ben Gvir beseeched his colleagues to scuttle the U.S.-backed cease-fire deal now being negotiated in Cairo because it would be a “victory” for Biden and a “slap” for Trump.The prime minister is far more diplomatic, asserting repeatedly that Israel will work closely with whoever becomes president. But Netanyahu has increasingly tied himself to the Republican Party, and he ran multiple election campaigns touting his closeness to Trump. Their relationship fractured at the end of Trump’s term, however, and Trump has told reporters that he blames Netanyahu for pulling Israel out of a 2020 raid in Iran that killed top commander Qasem Soleimani. Trump said that he never thought the prime minister seemed genuinely interested in seeking peace and heaped praise on Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. “F--- him,” Trump said in a 2021 interview, referring to Netanyahu.His anger hadn’t faded by April, when he told Time he thought Netanyahu deserved blame for allowing the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7 to occur. “I had a very bad experience with Bibi,” he said."
WaPo_112,Trump ally who denies 2020 election results threatens law enforcement,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/26/patrick-byrne-tina-peters-threats/,2024-07-27 06:56:02.626987,,"Patrick Byrne, who has funded efforts to undermine the results of the 2020 election, said in an online forum Thursday that law enforcement would face “a piano wire and a blowtorch” if they did not drop a case against an ally.Byrne, a former CEO of online retailer Overstock, used the phrase half a dozen times Thursday as he participated in a nearly three-hour-long event on X Spaces. His remarks came amid heightened worries about political violence, and he acknowledged during the event that his references to strangling or blowtorching officials were threatening and could be considered felonies. On Friday, he downplayed his comments, saying he had been speaking metaphorically and is committed to peace.The “Cyber Crisis: Saving Tina Peters” event was aimed at rallying support for the former clerk of Mesa County, Colo., who faces charges accusing her of tampering with election equipment three years ago. Peters has pleaded not guilty, and her case goes to trial next week.Byrne called out law enforcement and prosecutors during the forum, saying they would face violence if they did not drop the case.“If you have any brains at all, which I’m not sure they do, they should be throwing in the towel and just surrendering and dropping this case against Tina because those who don’t are going to end up facing a piano wire and a blowtorch before this is over if I have anything to do with it,” Byrne said. “So I know that’s probably another felony, but f--- it — threatening them like that — but there we are.”Byrne, who said he was participating in the event from Azerbaijan, accused law enforcement of committing treason and claimed he had been hacking Venezuela’s government for two years.“I don’t care how many felonies I’ve committed, and I don’t care that I’m committing felonies by threatening you,” he said of law enforcement. “You folks do your job or when this is over, the folks who are part of this are going to be facing, you know, piano wire and blowtorches before this is over. So you start doing your job and stop worrying about me.”Byrne said Friday that his comments were “obviously a metaphor.”“Please be aware that my turns of phrase like that are metaphoric expressions,” he said by text message. “There’s been no one more committed to peaceful resolution of this than I.”He said his views on peace do not extend to people like former ambassador Manuel Rocha, who pleaded guilty this year to serving as a secret agent for Cuba for decades. “The only exception to peaceful resolution will be for any who turn out of Cuba and Venezuela, such as ambassador Rocha,” Byrne said by text message.Byrne noted it was 4 a.m. in Azerbaijan when he participated in the event on X, and he may not have spoken as carefully as he otherwise would.Spokespeople for the Colorado attorney general’s office and Mesa County district attorney’s office did not immediately comment Friday.Byrne’s comments come three-and-a-half months ahead of the presidential election, as scholars, law enforcement agencies and election administrators raise alarms about the risk of political violence. Election officials have faced an onslaught of threats and harassment since the 2020 election and the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob chanting about Donald Trump’s false election claims.Two weeks ago, Trump was injured during an assassination attempt that left one of his supporters dead at a rally in Butler, Pa. The violence fueled new warnings of the risk to public officials and ordinary Americans, regardless of their political views.Before today’s combustible political environment, the phrases Byrne used might have prompted outreach by authorities to advise against using such language, said Paul Charlton, a former U.S. attorney under President George W. Bush. These days, state and federal officials tend to take such talk more seriously. Byrne’s language, he said, “sounds not only like a threat but a confession and an acknowledgment that it could be a felony to make such a threat.”Words alone can be sufficient to prosecute threats against public officials if authorities can show proof of intent to do harm, he said.“That is an instance in which, in my mind, it is very much worth law enforcement’s attention,” Charlton said.Byrne’s repeated references to the Peters trial — and the prosecutors involved in it — are important aspects of his overall comments, said Carol Lam, a former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of California who was also appointed by Bush.“Because he references a specific trial and he’s talking about the people who are bringing the case, that should be very troubling to law enforcement,” she said. Even if he said he was speaking metaphorically, she added, “What does that matter if someone went out and bought piano wire at his suggestion?”Two hours after The Washington Post contacted Byrne, he posted a statement on X that reiterated what he told a reporter about meaning his comments metaphorically. He said he wanted people to remain peaceful, but added information would come out that would “test our ability to remain peaceful and my ability to contribute to that cause.”Byrne used this week’s online forum to argue for dropping the charges against Peters, who is accused of participating in a scheme to allow a purported data expert to secretly copy files from Dominion Voting Systems equipment in 2021. She faces seven felonies and three misdemeanors in a case that is scheduled to go to trial on Wednesday.He has long championed Peters and others who have questioned the results of the 2020 election. Four days after members of the electoral college voted to give Biden a victory in December 2020, Byrne joined other Trump allies in the Oval Office to argue Trump could use the National Guard to seize voting machines. Also in the meeting were Trump-aligned attorneys Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani and former national security adviser Michael Flynn.In the years since, Byrne has used his fortune and his nonprofit America Project to bankroll efforts meant to uncover problems with how elections are run, including a partisan review of the 2020 election in Arizona. Byrne and the America Project have helped fund groups like We the People Ariz. Alliance, an Arizona-based political action committee whose co-founder in March said she would “lynch” a Republican official who helps oversee elections in the state’s largest county. She later said her comment was a joke.Courts and independent agencies have found no evidence of widespread election fraud.Byrne led Overstock for two decades. He resigned in 2019 after it came to light that he had been romantically involved with Maria Butina, a Russian gun activist who pleaded guilty in 2018 to conspiring with a Russian official to infiltrate conservative politics in the United States. She was deported after serving a 15-month prison sentence. Byrne published a memoir this year that included a preface by Butina.Dominion, the voting machine company, filed a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Byrne in 2021. The case is ongoing. Dominion won settlements of $787.5 million with Fox News and $243 million with Newsmax and is seeking $1 billion or more from Giuliani, Powell and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell.Spencer S. Hsu and Rachel Weiner contributed to this report."
WaPo_113,A grand vision guides unprecedented Opening Ceremonies down the Seine,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/2024/07/26/paris-olympics-2024-opening-ceremony-review/,2024-07-27 06:36:02.626987,,"Take it from someone who’s been shoved into his share of lockers: Sports and the arts aren’t always the best of friends.But every four years, the Opening Ceremonies of the Olympic Games force them to coexist under one roof, and I suddenly become a huge sports fan.I love the Opening Ceremonies for their central ethos of global goodwill. I enjoy them for the massive performance of cooperation they represent. I soften at the little human stories and collective triumphs tucked into the procession. I crave the quadrennial geography lesson.But the main reason I like the Opening Ceremonies so much is simple. I’m an opera fan.Certainly, the Opening Ceremonies aren’t opera — but they’re also not not opera. Pull out the checklist: There’s music (and lots of it). There’s a cast of hundreds (or in this case, thousands) of performers. There’s grand spectacle (courtesy of director Thomas Jolly). There are fabulous costumes. There’s a narrative arc de triumph. There’s the ambient promise of tragedy, comedy, agony and victory. There are fanfares, themes and anthemic leitmotifs. There are divas (Celine Dion, Lady Gaga and Aya Nakamura among them). They take, like, four hours. And, most of the time, they make you feel good.Like opera, the Opening Ceremonies are everything at once — a grand collision of aesthetics and athletics.This year’s Opening Ceremonies — billed as the largest in the history of the Games — are helmed by 42-year-old actor and director Jolly, whom French newspaper Le Monde has referred to as “the Peter Pan of theater” for a career ranging from Shakespearean drama (“Henry VI”) to high-energy musicals (“Starmania”).In interviews, Jolly has described France as “a long story — a story that keeps expanding and rewriting itself and is very much alive,” a reticent reference to the nation’s history of protest, its “constant questioning” of its own identity, and its most recent swerve into political violence. Jolly’s production aims to identify the “bigger us” — an operatic endeavor if ever there was one.This long story demanded a grander venue than the Stade de France, so Jolly opted to send the whole show down the Seine: A procession of nearly 100 boats traveled 3.8 miles from east to west down the river, starting at the Austerlitz Bridge and ending at the Trocadéro (originally constructed for the 1878 World’s Fair).This employment of the Seine as a narrative device twisted together two typically distinct elements of the Opening Ceremonies — the show itself and the Parade of Nations, which boat by boat introduces the over 10,000 waving athletes to the world.As the alphabetized nations floated by, performances broke out along the banks: A black-plumed Lady Gaga made a leggy entrance behind a heart of pink feathers to sing a jaunty take on Zizi Jeanmaire’s “Mon truc en plumes.” On the Pont des Arts, the French-Malian singer Aya Nakamura led the orchestra of the French Republican Guard and 36 choristers from the French Army in a medley of her hits “Pookie” and “Djadja” as well as Charles Aznavour’s “For Me … Formidable.” The Polish countertenor and breakdancer Jakub Józef Orliński appeared for a sizable solo that indulged both of his talents (and inspired dozens of confused tweets).And while Jolly’s musical program was a box-checking jukebox of every genre imaginable, an understated through-line paid tribute to a lineage of French composers.A line of dancers kicked and twirled to a hyped-up version of the cancan from Jacques Offenbach’s “Orpheus in the Underworld.” Heavy metal band Gojira accompanied the mezzo-soprano Marina Viotti in a pyrotechnic “Habanera” from Georges Bizet’s “Carmen.” Camille Saint-Saens’s “Danse Macabre” accompanied a segment trailing a masked torchbearer through the Louvre.Under pouring rain, pianist Alexandre Kantorow performed Maurice Ravel’s “Jeux d’eau.” Paul Dukas’s “L’Apprenti sorcier” scored a fantastical section that winked at Georges Méliès’s “Le Voyage Dans la Lun” (or “A Trip to the Moon”). And mezzo-soprano Axelle Saint-Cirel offered a soaring version of Claude Joseph Rouget De Lisle’s “La Marseillaise” — a.k.a. the French national anthem.By the time the United States appeared — in the penultimate spot in accordance with Los Angeles hosting the 2028 games — the City of Light was plunged into darkness. Once the parade was complete, over lowing trombones, Floriane Issert of the National Gendarmerie rode a robotic silver steed down the surface of the Seine, bearing the Olympic Flags and lighting 37 giant pairs of dove wings fixed to the bridges.It was a striking visual, but also one of several times Jolly’s liberation of the ceremony conveyed more about his own outsize ambitions than his nation’s identity.Several gestures hinted at making larger, possibly poignant statements: Bleary-eyed dancers clubbing indifferently atop an LED volcano. Juliette Armanet singing “Imagine” from a drifting dystopian barge with accompanist Sofiane Pamart playing a flaming piano. The French flag formed from tufts of colored smoke slowly pulling itself apart in the rain.Still, Jolly’s staging was at its best in its final act (“Eternite”): The Radio France Choir and 90 musicians from the French National Orchestra lending heartfelt oomph to Spyridon Samaras’s “Olympic Anthem”; the athletes gathered beneath the Eiffel Tower, which put on a techno-charged light show; and the surprise U-turn taken by the torch back up the Seine (in a speedboat with Carl Lewis, Serena Williams, Rafael Nadal and Nadia Comăneci).His parting vision — removed from the crowds, relying only on the beauty of Paris for spectacle — was simple, sweet and satisfying. Generations of French Olympians passing the torch in quick succession and pouring rain before lighting the strangest cauldron I’ve ever seen at the Games. (I’ll leave it to the French to determine the precise significance of a hot-air balloon on fire.)If Jolly’s production ultimately felt too diffuse and thin on substance to satisfy my operatic appetites, nearly all was forgiven by his big finish: The surprise return of Celine Dion — a steely, defiant take on Édith Piaf’s “L’Hymne à L’Amour,” and her first performance since revealing her diagnosis with stiff person syndrome — made for the grandest of finales, and an icon for the ceremony itself: art as Olympian feat."
WaPo_114,Justice Dept. settles with ex-FBI officials over anti-Trump text leak,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/26/strzok-page-fbi-settlement-trump-text-leak/,2024-07-27 06:18:02.626987,,"The Justice Department has agreed to settle claims by former senior FBI special agent Peter P. Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who had filed lawsuits accusing the government of violating their privacy rights by leaking their politically charged text messages criticizing Donald Trump.Strzok’s attorneys say he will receive a $1.2 million settlement. Terms for Page were not disclosed.Strzok and Page said they were illegally targeted for retribution by the Trump administration after the FBI investigated Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election.Strzok, a former top counterintelligence expert, was fired by the FBI in 2018 after news reports surfaced of his politically charged text messages with Page, in which the pair were criticizing Trump while they were having an affair.“This outcome is a critical step forward in addressing the government’s unfair and highly politicized treatment of Pete,” lead Strzok attorney Aitan D. Goelman said in a statement. Goelman said Strzok will continue to seek reinstatement and back pay in ongoing litigation over claims that removing him from the FBI violated his free speech and due process rights. “We will continue to litigate Pete’s constitutional claims to ensure that, in the future, public servants are protected from adverse employment actions motivated by partisan politics,” Goelman said.In a statement released by her attorneys, Page said, “While I have been vindicated by this result, my fervent hope remains that our institutions of justice will never again play politics with the lives of their employees.”Page’s Arnold & Porter law firm team, led by Amy Jeffress, added, “As Attorney General [Merrick] Garland recently testified in response to questions about this settlement, the Department settles cases based on the litigators’ assessment of the chances of success and the potential costs of losing the case. Here, the evidence was overwhelming that the release of text messages to the press in December 2017 was for partisan political purposes and was against the law. As the Attorney General explained: ‘It’s a question of the government paying for violating the law.’”A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment outside of court filings.This is a developing story and will be updated."
WaPo_115,"Fashion has swallowed the Paris Olympics, but style is winning",https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/fashion/2024/07/26/olympics-uniforms-opening-ceremonies-fashion-paris/,2024-07-27 06:15:02.626987,,"Watching the lead-up to the 2024 Olympics, usually one of the few uncontroversial moments of pride, unity, good-hearted competition and patriotism, it was hard not to think that fashion has swallowed everything.LVMH, the Paris-based conglomerate that owns most of the world’s biggest fashion brands, and which has made its founder and CEO, Bernard Arnault, one of the richest men in the world, is the premium sponsor of the games. The company is synonymous with the host city, and Paris is, after all, the metropolis that invented fashion as we know it today, which is to say a dazzling and at times irrational, fleeting quest for self-reinvention.But the presence of fashion at the games, and more specifically LVMH, quickly turned commercial, harsh; into a celebration not of craftsmanship but of brands.The night before the Opening Ceremonies, Arnault hosted a party at his museum, Fondation Louis Vuitton, where guests such as LeBron James, Jelena Djokovic (the wife of Serbian tennis player Novak Djokovic), Angel Reese, Naomi Osaka and many other athletes wore clothes with visible LVMH logos. Several wore unsplashy clothes with Louis Vuitton bags in their hands. The public temperature on designer goods tends to ebb and flow. At the moment, as global inequality is so intense and the prices of luxury brands rise, it seems as if there couldn’t be anything cornier than a designer bag or label.What excites people about clothes right now is not fashion, but style. What has made NBA and now WNBA tunnel style so compelling is the sense that the players are crafting their own looks. They may use stylists, but you know they have a relationship to what they’re wearing that is not monetary. Several designers worn by WNBA players have told me they had no idea players were wearing their clothes.Louis Vuitton, LVMH’s biggest label, designed the cases for the medals and torches; the LVMH tailoring house Berluti made the French Opening Ceremonies uniforms; jeweler Chaumet designed the medals. Moet would be on hand for victorious moments; Sephora sponsored the torch relays. There is always some branding; Ralph Lauren did the uniforms for the United States, for example, as it has for several Olympic Games now. But this year it feels as though the sponsors have turned every moment into a collaboration.During the Opening Ceremonies, I received dozens of press blasts from brands: Lady Gaga was wearing Dior. Jessica Chastain in Ralph Lauren. Ariana Grande in Thom Browne. Cynthia Erivo in Roberto Coin. LVMH made the uniforms for the volunteer medal bearers! Dior by Maria Grazia Chiuri dressed some choristers!Look, I get it: getting dressed by a fashion brand is lucrative. Most celebrities, a category that includes Olympics, are not wearing clothes simply because they like them. And yes, fashion is a national treasure in France, so the Opening Ceremonies’ whimsical displays of the Moulin Rouge women in pink dancing the cancan, or the exuberant (if aesthetically tacky) runway show were, yes, charming.But the problem wasn’t the combination of celebrity and sports — it was the ubiquity of labels. During the Opening Ceremonies on Friday the masked torchbearer, in a tattered tailcoat, leaped into a room meant to be the Louis Vuitton atelier. The camera skimmed joyfully over workers carefully stitching the coated canvas and leather, stamped with its monogram that graces many of its handbags and accessories. It read like an awkwardly sentimental ad for something that, at least right now, feels slightly distasteful.Each time the camera cut to French president Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, you could see not the French swimmer Laure Manaudou but the belt she was wearing, which read in blaring letters, “ALEXANDER WANG.”Maybe this is the way the world felt when sports stadiums with historic names were torn down and replaced by spaces named things like “Smoothie King Center.”All this creates an aura of crassness where there should be joy, ideally beauty, and even a touch of sentimentality.Which is what made the appearance of athletes in their native dress unusually moving this year. There are always teams that opt to wear clothing that have some traditional tie to their country as a source of national pride.But seeing the Ghanaians in their blue stripes and hats, Indians in their rich pastel prints and Haitians’ textured pants and skirts was a pointed reminder in a city that thinks of clothing as its native language, that often has a sense of superiority about its sartorial creations, that many people around the world have something interesting to say with clothes.Especially meaningful were uniforms that updated traditional clothing — which brought their country’s history into the present. Mongolia’s deep cornflower blue and red tunics, designed by the fashion label Michel & Amazonka, were based on the deel, a wrapped overcoat often worn by herders, and decorated with Olympic and Mongolian imagery.Liberia’s ensembles were made for the second Summer Olympics in a row by Liberian American designer Telfar Clemens, whose tote bag, nicknamed the “Bushwick Birkin,” is the viral and affordable it-bag beloved by Gen Z and millennials. Rather than look to their past, this was a country from which a designer fled to escape civil war, now embracing his off-piste genius as one of their native sons. This is how clothing creates meaning.Because, of course clothing is not only fashion. The joy of those cancan dancers in pink, or Lady Gaga shimmying in ostrich feathers and a Dior feather hat, was a valiant tribute to French tradition.But fashion can also be conservative, closed-off. It can be pointlessly snobby, too attached to tradition and authority figures. Most of all, it has a long history of exclusion, even in the midst of borrowing from cultures it otherwise looks down upon.To see people from around the world in their full expressive flower — even just a hat or scarf with a colorful blazer — showed the best of the Olympics, a celebration of the truth that style and self-expression are often the richest stories."
WaPo_116,"Robert Allen, champion of Black sailors in ’44 mutiny case, dies at 82",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/07/26/robert-allen-dead-navy-mutiny/,2024-07-27 06:06:02.626987,,"On the night of July 17, 1944, blasts rocked the Port Chicago Naval Magazine outside San Francisco, where sailors were loading a cargo ship with more than 4,000 tons of antiaircraft ammunition, bombs and other munitions bound for the Pacific.The ship disintegrated, along with most of the pier and much of the surrounding site. A second cargo ship was blown to pieces. Three hundred and twenty people, including Navy personnel and civilian employees, were killed instantly.Eight decades later, the Port Chicago disaster is often overlooked in the history of World War II. But the munitions explosion — its exact cause was never determined — marked one of America’s worst home-front disasters during the conflict and became a tragic symbol of injustice in a military still cleaved by segregation.Port Chicago was staffed principally by African American sailors and commanded by White officers. Almost two-thirds of the blast victims were Black. Convinced that their lives had been needlessly put at risk, 258 Black sailors refused to return to work after the incident until enhanced safety protocols were put in place.Threatened with court-martial and potential execution, 208 resumed their duties but were still charged with refusal to obey orders. Fifty held firm and were convicted of conspiracy to commit mutiny, in the largest mutiny trial in Navy history.The court-martial attracted the attention of the NAACP and other civil rights groups, and publicity surrounding the trial help spur the desegregation of the Navy in 1946. But the surviving sailors remained pained by their convictions, which stayed on the books until this month, when Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro issued a formally exoneration.Their story was established in large part by Robert L. Allen, a professor and scholar of African American studies and the author of the 1989 book “The Port Chicago Mutiny: The Story of the Largest Mass Mutiny Trial in U.S. Naval History.”Dr. Allen, 82, died July 10 at a care facility in Vallejo, Calif. His son, Casey dos Santos Allen, said the cause was kidney failure and other ailments. The exoneration of the sailors took place exactly one week after Dr. Allen’s death, on the 80th anniversary of the blast.Dr. Allen spent decades as a senior editor at the Black Scholar, one of the country’s oldest Black studies journals; founded a small publishing house in 1984, Wild Trees Press, with novelist Alice Walker, his partner at the time; and taught at a host of California schools, including San José State University, Mills College in Oakland and the University of California at Berkeley.He was working as a journalist in the 1970s when he first learned of the Port Chicago sailors and was compelled to delve deeper into a story that he saw as a matter of racial injustice. His views aligned with those of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, who ran the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund at the time of the case and helped the sailors mount an appeal.“I can’t understand why,” Marshall had said, “whenever more than one Negro disobeys an order, it is mutiny.”Dr. Allen conducted oral histories with survivors of the blast, some of whom had not spoken of their experience even to their families because of the shame of their court-martial convictions.The sailors had received little training as stevedores but were forced to load munitions — a dangerous task — as White officers made bets on which units would move the fastest. One enlisted man told Dr. Allen that he narrowly missed killing or maiming fellow servicemen on a daily basis because of the speed at which he was required to work.The blasts, which left the stench of burning flesh in the air, was deeply traumatic to witnesses. White personnel were given 30 days’ leave to rest, while the Black sailors were tasked with searching for survivors and the remains of the dead. Only 51 bodies were identifiable, according to the Navy.The Black sailors were transferred to another shipyard and commanded to resume their duties loading ships with ammunition. The trial that followed, Dr. Allen said, was a “mockery.” He saw their actions as a wildcat strike, not a mutiny.“I wasn’t trying to shirk work. I don’t think these other men were trying to shirk work,” Joe Small, a winch operator, told him in an interview. “But to go back to work under the same conditions, with no improvements, no changes, the same group of officers that we had, was just — we thought there was a better alternative, that’s all.”The 208 men who continued loading lost three months’ pay. The 50 convicted of conspiracy to commit mutiny received sentences ranging from eight to 15 years in confinement. First lady Eleanor Roosevelt helped civil rights activists secure their release in 1946. But the horror and humiliation they had experienced endured.“It’s an American tragedy,” Mr. Allen told the Los Angeles Times in 1991, referring to the case. “It was the world as it was, and it was pretty grim. These guys were victims of racism and the military legal system.”Through the efforts of Dr. Allen and other advocates, the military and the public began to reevaluate the mutiny case. A Port Chicago national memorial was dedicated in 1994, and five years later President Bill Clinton pardoned Freddie Meeks, one of the last surviving sailors in the Port Chicago case, and the only one to formally seek a pardon.By the time Del Toro issued the exoneration this month, none of the sailors were alive to see the event. The Navy secretary told The Washington Post at the time that the charges were “a tremendous wrong,” adding that setting aside the convictions “clears their names, restores their honor and acknowledges the courage they displayed in the face of immense danger.”Dr. Allen suffered at the end of his life from dementia, but “for however brief a moment,” his son said, he seemed to understand that the exoneration was coming.Several days before he died, Dr. Allen received promising news from Diana McDaniel, a niece of a Port Chicago sailor and a co-founder with Dr. Allen and another activist, David Salniker, of the advocacy and fundraising organization Friends of Port Chicago National Memorial.Word of the exoneration was not yet confirmed, but Del Toro had committed to attending the upcoming 80th anniversary commemoration. “I figured the secretary of the Navy wasn’t going to give us bad news,” McDaniel said.Speaking to Dr. Allen on the phone, she recalled, “you could hear the smile in his voice.”Robert Lee Allen Jr. was born on May 29, 1942, in Atlanta, where his mother was an administrator at Spelman College, a historically Black school for women. His father was a mechanic.Dr. Allen was less than a year younger than Emmett Till, the 14-year-old African American whose lynching in the Mississippi Delta in 1955 helped galvanize the civil rights movement. Dr. Allen was a regular reader of Jet magazine, which published photographs of Till’s mutilated body.“I looked at those pictures, and I just could not believe it. It was horrifying,” he said in an oral history with Berkeley in 2019. “I realized this was done by White people to a Black boy who was accused of whistling at a White girl. … This is when I realized that the White people were not only dangerous, but they were dangerous to all of us, including me, because he was my age.”Dr. Allen received a bachelor’s degree in sociology from Morehouse College in Atlanta in 1963. He moved to New York, where he became one of the first Black journalists at the leftist newspaper the National Guardian, and where he received a master’s degree from the New School for Social Research in 1967.During the Vietnam War, he was a self-described “draft resister,” later writing that he considered the war “illegal and racist.” He moved to the Bay Area and received a PhD in sociology from the University of California at San Francisco in 1983.Besides his volume on the Port Chicago case, Dr. Allen wrote or co-wrote books including “Black Awakening in Capitalist America” (1969) and “The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters: C.L. Dellums and the Fight for Fair Treatment and Civil Rights” (2015).Dr. Allen’s marriages to Pamela Parker and Janet Carter ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife of seven years, Zélia M. Bora of João Pessoa, Brazil; his son, from his first marriage, of San Francisco; three sisters; and three grandchildren.To Dr. Allen, the Port Chicago sailors offered lessons beyond the immediate significance of their case.“They were just ordinary boys, teenagers, who changed the most powerful military institution in the world,” he told the Los Angeles Time. “All of us have that in us, to rise up and face injustices and change history.”"

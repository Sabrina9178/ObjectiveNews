NBC_1,2 dead in listeria outbreak likely linked to sliced deli meats,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/2-dead-listeria-outbreak-likely-linked-sliced-deli-meats-rcna162808,2024-07-20 08:15:02.865520,,"Two people have died in a listeria outbreak across 12 states in the U.S. that is likely linked to sliced deli meats, according to the CDC. 
In total, 28 people have been infected and hospitalized with the disease as of Friday in an outbreak that began in May, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The listeria infections have been reported in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts. 
The two deaths were reported in Illinois and New Jersey, according to the CDC. The agency also noted that one pregnant woman got sick with listeria and remained pregnant after she recovered. 
People who got sick reported to state and local officials that they ate ""a variety of meats sliced at deli counters"" in the month before they got sick. Officials interviewed 18 people, 16 of whom said they ate meats sliced at a deli, and found they most commonly ate turkey, liverwurst and ham. The sliced meats from deli counters came from a variety of supermarket and grocery story delis, according to the CDC. 
The CDC said it is comparing foods people who were infected ate in this outbreak to foods people ate who got sick with listeria but were not part of an outbreak, and found that the people in this outbreak were ""more likely to eat deli-sliced turkey and liverwurst."" 
""This information suggests that meats sliced at the deli are a likely source of this outbreak,"" the CDC said. ""However, at this time CDC doesn’t have enough information to say which deli meats are the source of this outbreak.""
There is no information that shows people are getting listeria from prepackaged deli meats, the CDC said. 
The agency noted that the true number of those infected in this outbreak is likely higher than the reported number and that the outbreak could be occurring in additional states with no known illnesses. 
That's because some people recover from listeria without any medical care and are therefore never tested for the illness, the CDC said, adding that recent illnesses may not have been reported because it takes three-to-four weeks to determine if someone with listeria is part of an outbreak. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service is working to identify the supplier of the deli meats that were then sliced at grocery store deli counters and purchased by people who were sick in this outbreak, the CDC said. 
The CDC recommends avoiding eating deli meats sliced at a deli counter unless they are heated before eating and advises people who or pregnant, aged 65 or older or have a weakened immune system to contact their doctor if they have any listeria symptoms, which can include fever, flu-like symptoms, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and seizures.

NBC_2,Missouri woman who served 43 years in prison freed after murder conviction overturned,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sandra-hemme-case-woman-served-43-years-prison-freed-conviction-overtu-rcna162813,2024-07-20 08:12:02.865520,,"CHILLICOTHE, Mo. —  A woman whose murder conviction was overturned after she served 43 years in prison was released Friday, after Missouri’s attorney general fought for more than a month to keep her behind bars.
Sandra Hemme, 63, left prison Friday in Chillicothe, hours after a judge threatened to hold the attorney general’s office in contempt if they continued to fight against her release. She reunited with her family at a nearby park, where she hugged her daughter and granddaughter. Her sister, Joyce Ann Kays, was all grins.
The judge originally ruled on June 14 that Hemme’s attorneys had established “clear and convincing evidence” of “actual innocence” and overturned the conviction. But Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey fought her release in the courts.
During a court hearing Friday, Judge Ryan Horsman said that if Hemme wasn’t released by a designated time, he wanted Bailey himself to appear in court Tuesday morning, and he threatened to hold the attorney general’s office in contempt.
He also scolded Bailey’s office for calling the warden and telling prison officials not to release Hemme after an appeals court panel said she could be released. “I would suggest you never do that,” Horsman said, adding: “To call someone and tell them to disregard a court order is wrong.”
The Missouri Corrections Department then confirmed Hemme, whose been in prison for 43 years, would be released before 6 p.m. CDT Friday.
Two of Hemme’s relatives were in court Friday but declined to talk after the hearing. The rest of her family members were with Hemme’s father, who was hospitalized with kidney failure and moved to palliative care. “He wants only to see his daughter free in his lifetime, just as Ms. Hemme wants nothing more than to be at her father’s bedside at this time,” Hemme’s attorney, Sean O’Brien, said in a court filing Thursday.
He added that further delay was causing their family “irreparable harm and emotional distress.”
After she is released, “she is going right to her father,” O’Brien said after Friday’s court hearing. “This has been a long time coming.”
Over the last month, a circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court all agreed Hemme should be released, but she was still held behind bars, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.
“I’ve never seen it,” said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor and dean emeritus of Saint Louis University Law School. “Once the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.”
The lone holdup to freedom came from the attorney general, who has filed court actions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases. The warden at the Chillicothe Correctional Center has declined to let Hemme go, based on Bailey’s actions.
Horsman ruled on June 14 that “the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.” A state appeals court ruled on July 8 that Hemme should be set free while it continued to review the case. The Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday declined to undo the lower court rulings that allowed her to be released on her own recognizance and placed with her sister and brother-in-law.
Bailey, a Republican facing opposition in the Aug. 6 primary election, responded with another request late Thursday, asking the Circuit Court to reconsider.
Hemme was serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri.
She’s been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project.
Hemme’s immediate freedom was complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for “offering to commit violence.” Bailey had argued that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and that she should start serving those sentences now.
Her attorneys countered that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a “draconian outcome.”
Some legal experts agreed.
Peter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison was “a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,” since evidence strongly suggests she didn’t commit the crime.
Bailey’s office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday.
Bailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.
Horsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a “malleable mental state” when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as “often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.” Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.
The St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman — a fellow officer, who died in 2015 — and the prosecution wasn’t told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.
Evidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman’s pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke’s apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.
Horsman, in his report, called Hemme “the victim of a manifest injustice.”"
NBC_3,Trump ally Allen Weisselberg released from jail,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-ally-allen-weisselberg-released-jail-rcna162816,2024-07-20 08:28:02.865520,,"Trump ally Allen Weisselberg was released early from Rikers Island on Friday after being convicted of lying under oath during the civil fraud trial of the Trump Organization.
Weisselberg, the former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, was sentenced in April to five months behind bars after he pleaded guilty to two counts of perjury.
His attorney Seth Rosenberg confirmed Weisselberg's release. 
Weisselberg had previously served time at Rikers Island in 2023 for charges related to a tax fraud scheme. He was sentenced to five months in jail but was eligible for release after 100 days with time off for good behavior.
Rosenberg said in an April statement after his sentencing that Weisselberg “accepted responsibility for his conduct and now looks forward to the end of this life-altering experience and to returning to his family and his retirement.”
The Trump ally was accused of lying about when and how he learned that former President Donald Trump’s apartment had been overvalued. He was accused of committing perjury in a deposition and during testimony.
Trump and top executives at the Trump Organization were hit with a $464 million fraud judgment in February. But a New York appeals court ultimately reduced the bond to $175 million and the accused then posted it, which prevented New York Attorney General Letitia James from collecting on the judgment during the appeals process.
Judge Arthur Engoron, who presided over the civil fraud trial, in February said that Trump's and executives' ""complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological.""
""Defendants’ refusal to admit error — indeed, to continue it, according to the Independent Monitor — constrains this Court to conclude that they will engage in it going forward unless judicially restrained,” Engoron added.
The judge also said that ""the examples of Weisselberg’s intent to falsify business records are too numerous to itemize."" Engoron ultimately barred Weisselberg from “from serving in the financial control function of any New York corporation or similar business entity operating in New York State” and ruled that he must pay $1 million he'd already received from his $2 million separation agreement from the company.Adam Reiss is a reporter and producer for NBC and MSNBC.

NBC_4,Trump rally shooter searched online about Michigan school shooter and explosives,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-rally-shooter-searched-online-michigan-school-shooter-explosives-rcna162786,2024-07-20 08:00:02.865520,,"Federal investigators have uncovered thousands of links from the online phone history of the gunman who tried to assassinate former President Donald Trump, including searches involving a teenage mass shooter in Michigan, according to two law enforcement sources.
The sources said Friday that Thomas Matthew Crooks' phone had searches on it regarding the Oxford High School shooting and gunman, who was 15 when he fatally shot four students and wounded several others in suburban Detroit in 2021. He was sentenced to life in prison. 
The attack also led prosecutors to charge his mother and father, Jennifer and James Crumbley, with involuntary manslaughter. This year, they became the first parents in the U.S. to be held partially responsible for their child's school shooting, and were sentenced in April to 10 to 15 years in prison.
That same month, Crooks, 20, performed internet searches about depressive disorder, the law enforcement sources said. In May, he did research on explosive materials and chemical compounds for such a device. At some point, he also looked up an article about improvised explosive devices and the Department of Homeland Security.
There were more than 14,000 links and links to images found on his phone, the sources added.
Among the images investigators said they found on his phone was of Saturday's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, shortly before the shooting began after Trump took the stage at about 6 p.m.
The former president survived the attack, which left a former fire chief dead and two other attendees injured. The gunman, who used an AR-15-style rifle, was killed amid the chaos at the Butler Farm Show, and the aftermath of the shooting has placed scrutiny on law enforcement's failure to secure the scene and other breakdowns in planning.
The gunman's motivation remains elusive, with investigators saying they believe he acted alone and there was no obvious political ideologies that he could be linked to. Public records show that he was a registered Republican but in 2021 donated $15 to a progressive voting effort. Investigators also found the gunman had made searches this month specific to Trump, a rally and the Democratic National Committee, according to a senior law enforcement official.
Some former classmates at Bethel High School in suburban Pittsburgh, where the gunman resided with his parents, have had recollections of him being a quiet student with a small friend group.
An uncle, Mark Crooks, told NBC News on Monday that he hadn't seen his nephew in years and didn't keep in close contact with that side of the family because they were private. He also said he didn't know about his nephew's political leanings or what would have motivated him to try to assassinate Trump.
Authorities said they confiscated more than a dozen guns from the family's Bethel Park home and that they are cooperating with the investigation.
In May, around the time investigators say the gunman was searching online about explosives, he had earned an associate's degree in engineering science from the Community College of Allegheny County. One friend said he talked about becoming a mechanical engineer.Jonathan Dienst is chief justice contributor for NBC News and chief investigative reporter for WNBC-TV in New York.

NBC_5,Graceland questions authenticity of Elvis memorabilia sold by auction house with ties to Priscilla Presley,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/graceland-questions-authenticity-elvis-memorabilia-sold-auction-house-rcna155994,2024-07-20 08:00:02.865520,,"When Graceland boss Joel Weinshanker discovered that an auction house was planning to sell one of Elvis’ old jackets, he was immediately suspicious. 
The black grommet jacket was a one-of-a-kind item worn by Elvis in 1972, Weinshanker, managing partner of Elvis Presley Enterprises, said. But the thing was, that very jacket was hanging up in Graceland’s private collection.
“We know there was only one made, and guess what? We have it in our archives,” Weinshanker said in an interview at Elvis’ former home in Memphis, where NBC News was shown the black jacket and the receipt for its purchase.
GWS Auctions, the California company behind the 2023 auction of the jacket, has made a name for itself by selling Elvis memorabilia. Its owner, Brigitte Kruse, formed a relationship with Elvis' ex-wife, Priscilla Presley, and has even acted as her power of attorney. 
But the jacket was not an anomaly, according to Weinshanker, who oversees the largest collection of Elvis memorabilia. Graceland is raising concerns about other items GWS Auctions has put up for auction — including a private jet and several pieces of jewelry. 
Some of the items were offered with a letter from Priscilla vouching for their authenticity, even though Elvis would have possessed them when they were no longer together. 
Kruse’s relationship with Priscilla, 79, has since imploded. 
Kruse filed a lawsuit last fall accusing Priscilla of cutting her out of lucrative deals after she came to Priscilla’s financial rescue. On Thursday, Priscilla filed a countersuit, accusing Kruse and three associates of conning her out of $1 million in a financial elder abuse scheme. 
In a lengthy interview that took place before Priscilla filed her lawsuit, Kruse declined to go into detail on their falling out. But she defended her auction sales, saying she “100%” stood by her Elvis items, and she questioned why Weinshanker would go to the media rather than raise issues with her directly.
“Graceland has my phone number,” Kruse said at her home in Windermere, Florida. “I’m a phone call away.”
Priscilla’s lawyers did not respond to a request for an interview or an email with detailed questions. Weinshanker said he did speak to Kruse about his concerns and he shared a text message exchange with NBC News that appeared to support the claim. 
The questions over some of Kruse’s Elvis items reflect the murky world of celebrity memorabilia. Fakes and forgeries flood the market, experts say, making it difficult for even the most experienced buyers to know what is genuine and what isn’t. 
In the Elvis world, there are a handful of elite collectors who are sought out by potential buyers looking for assurances that a particular item is authentic. The problem, these collectors say, is that there are dishonest people with Elvis ties providing bogus items to auction houses.
Adding to the sometimes shady nature of the industry, some auction houses have a reputation for driving up bids on their own items and announcing phony sales to attract attention.
“It’s a dirty business,” said Stephen Shutts, an Elvis historian and collector. “Unfortunately, there are a lot of bad guys out there.” 
A fifth-generation auctioneer, Kruse launched GWS Auctions in 2007. Ten years later, the business received a flood of publicity when she auctioned off Elvis’ “lost jet.” 
The red 1962 Lockheed Jetstar was described as “personally owned” by The King and “custom designed” to his specifications. 
“I was kind of deemed the Elvis auctioneer because I sold his private jet,” Kruse said in a 2020  interview, “and it’s kind of just been an upward trajectory since then.” 
The sale was not without controversy, however. 
In the days beforehand, news stories popped up quoting a previous owner of the aircraft, Roy McKay of New Mexico, who said he was the one who redesigned its interior. 
GWS Auctions stood by its account, and the sale went forward. The jet sold for $430,000.
Seven years later, McKay still finds the whole thing amusing. He had no idea the aircraft had a potential Elvis connection when he bought it in 1980. He said he redesigned the all-gray interior with a red and gold color scheme that was “more my style.”
“I did the seats, the couches, the carpet — basically everything,” he told NBC News. 
He said he had no idea where the story of Elvis being behind the redesign came from. 
“The guys that were talking about that then, they can’t really say Elvis did all of that — because I did,” McKay said. 
Kruse and Priscilla met in 2021. In her suit, Priscilla said they were introduced by a mutual connection who said Kruse wanted to discuss her business selling Elvis memorabilia. 
In the summer of 2022, Priscilla Presley did media interviews promoting a GWS auction featuring jewelry from the collection of Elvis’ longtime manager, Colonel Tom Parker. 
Some of the items up for sale were said to be gifted by The King himself, including diamond-encrusted rings, watches and cufflinks. In the days before the auction, Priscilla did media interviews explaining why she was endorsing it.
“I want fans and people who love Elvis to know it is authentic,” Presley told Reuters. “There’s so much product out there that is not authentic at all and that worries me.”
At Graceland, Weinshanker and other staffers grew concerned about Priscilla’s involvement and the fact that the auction house was offering items with letters signed by her.  
Graceland staff raised concerns about the authenticity of several of the items in part because they had no receipts showing the initial purchases. Thanks to Elvis’ aversion to cash and his father Vernon’s meticulous record-keeping, the operators of Graceland say they have an extraordinary window into his purchases and day-to-day activities.  
“Because he had some trouble with the law early on in his adult life, he kept everything, every receipt,” Weinshanker said of Vernon Presley. “You come to us and say what did [Elvis] do on this day in 1962? We pretty much know what he did just by how he spent money.”
Weinshanker and other Elvis experts were especially concerned with Priscilla providing letters for items purchased outside of the years she and Elvis were together, as she might not know whether or not the items were genuine. 
The pair got married in 1967 and divorced in 1972. 
A gold pendant would have come into the legendary rocker’s possession and been gifted to Parker, the manager, before Priscilla entered Elvis' life, according to Graceland, and a pair of gold “Aloha From Hawaii” snowman cufflinks would have been purchased for Parker at a time when he and Priscilla were separated. Graceland said it has no receipts for the items.
“If they hadn’t talked for months and months and months in person, how does she know what Elvis did and didn’t do?” Weinshanker said.
Kruse acknowledged that Graceland has access to extensive records but said it’s ridiculous to think that everything that came into Elvis’ possession would have been documented. 
“We weren’t there. None of us were there,” Kruse said. “So how can they without a doubt, unequivocally say, ‘We have everything?’ It’s an impossibility.”
And on the subject of Priscilla vouching for items like the gold pendant and snowman cufflinks, Kruse said: “If her personal recollections aren’t worth anything, then whose are?”
In early 2023, Elvis’ “lost jet” came up for auction again through another company, Mecum Auctions. The plane was no longer described as having been redesigned by Elvis. But the listing did say it was one of three planes owned by Elvis and the aircraft were “needed to transport the singer” to events around the country. 
“Elvis kept several pilots on retainer that were ready to fly him to adoring fans at a moment’s notice,” read the listing. 
But Elvis never flew on the plane, according to Graceland citing flight logs, and it’s even a stretch to say that he owned it. 
The plane was purchased via power of attorney by Vernon Presley on Dec. 22, 1976. According to documents provided by Graceland and reviewed by NBC News, Elvis gave up all rights to an airline leasing company upon purchase and it was sold just a few months later. 
If Graceland believed the plane was a significant part of Elvis’ past, “we would own it,” Weinshanker said.
Mecum Auctions did not respond to a request for comment.  
Priscilla attended the Mecum auction in Kissimmee, Florida, and gave a brief speech just before bidding got underway. “He loved planes and this was one of them,” she said. 
The winning bidder was YouTube star James Webb, who bought the plane for $260,000. In an interview with NBC News, Webb said that despite Priscilla’s presence at the auction and the way it was advertised online, he did not feel like he was duped. 
Weinshanker said he doesn’t think Priscilla intentionally tried to deceive potential buyers.
“I believe that she lacked the capacity to make those decisions,” he said. 
According to Kruse’s lawsuit, Priscilla was in dire financial straits by August 2022. To help her get out of debt, they created several companies to “exploit new income streams” and “monetize various aspects of Priscilla’s life,” the suit says. 
Kruse was also named a co-trustee of Priscilla’s trust and was granted powers of attorney. But after setting up a company to capitalize on Priscilla’s name and likeness, Kruse found out that Priscilla had already sold the rights to another firm, according to the breach of contract lawsuit. 
The suit, which seeks at least $50,000 in damages, portrayed Priscilla as a fading celebrity facing financial ruin due in part to her diminishing fame. 
“Priscilla has largely relied on her celebrity to meet her ongoing financial obligations, and to maintain her desired cost of living because historically she has lived outside of her means,” the suit said. “By the 2020’s, Priscilla’s celebrity was a mere shadow of what it once was, and her earning potential was only a fraction of what it previously was.”	
Priscilla’s lawyers have asked a judge to dismiss the suit, citing lack of jurisdiction. A decision is pending. 
In the suit she filed this week, Priscilla alleges that Kruse and her associates duped her into believing they would help solve her financial problems “while their real goal was to drain her of every last penny she had.” They directed all of the revenue from Priscilla’s business ventures into accounts they controlled and also withdrew $40,000 from a bank account belonging to Priscilla’s son for “no legitimate reason,” the suit says. 
“The fact that the plaintiff in this case is internationally recognized actress, author, and cultural icon, Priscilla Presley, demonstrates both how effective the Defendants’ plan was (and needed to be), and how anyone can be a victim of elder abuse and fraud,” the suit says. Kruse’s legal team couldn’t comment because they had yet to receive the suit, her publicist said. 
In the interview with NBC News, Kruse downplayed her falling out with Priscilla. 
“I always wish the best for Priscilla and her entire family,” Kruse said. “It’s a business dispute. They happen.”
“What I would love to see, more than anything, is everybody kind of working together,” she added. “I don’t want to do anything to hurt the fans or Elvis’ legacy.”Chloe Melas is an entertainment correspondent for NBC News.

NBC_6,Four photographers shot iconic images when gunfire rang out at Trump rally,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-rally-shooting-photos-capture-assassination-attempt-rcna162338,2024-07-20 08:00:02.865520,,"When gunfire rang out at former President Donald Trump's rally Saturday in Pennsylvania, four photojournalists were there to capture the now-iconic images seared into America's collective memory.
The Associated Press’ Evan Vucci took the photo of a defiant Trump pumping his fist into the air with an American flag flying behind him. 
Anna Moneymaker with Getty Images snapped the tightly framed, sobering image of Trump crunched down on the stage surrounded by Secret Service agents as blood dripped down his face. 
The Washington Post’s Jabin Botsford captured the haunting image of the former president’s shoe left behind on stage after the attack. And Doug Mills with The New York Times took that remarkable photo appearing to show a bullet streaking past the former president's head. 
The four photojournalists said they knew they were dangerously close to the line of fire when they heard the shots Saturday, but their professional instincts kicked in.
Vucci, AP’s chief Washington photographer, said the event began like any of the thousands of political campaign rallies he’s covered in his more than two-decade career.
“Over my left shoulder, I heard several pops, and I knew right away it was gunfire,” Vucci recalled. “I just went into work mode. I was looking through my viewfinder, I saw the Secret Service agents rushing in, covering the president. I ran to the stage, I got my wide angle lens, I started making photographs.”
Mills and Moneymaker had the same reaction,
“I’m there to do a job,” said Moneymaker, who joined Getty Images in 2021. “All of a sudden history is unfolding. You just have to keep making pictures.""
“I was saying to myself under my breathe like, ""Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God,' but I just kind of like said, ‘Anna, just like keep going, keep making pictures. Get your settings correct,’” she said. “I went into like auto-drive and just kept going.”Mills said he never experienced anything like it in his more than 40 years covering U.S. politics. 
“He went down and I thought, 'Oh my gosh, he’s been shot,' because everybody was yelling, 'Down, down, down, active shooter, active shooter!'” he said. “I get chills now saying it because, you know, it’s still very raw.”
In addition to images, Botsford was also able to capture video of the moment by wearing Ran-Ban Meta smart glasses that take short videos, which he told The Washington Post he had “somehow” remembered to turn on. 
“It was super scary,” he told the Post. “Nobody knew what was going on. The president fell to the ground, and I was going to make a picture of it even though the staff was like, ‘You guys need to get down.'”
“I’m still trying to process it all,” he said. 
Mills said the moment he got backstage, he began to frantically transmit photos to his editor in New York when it dawned on him that he may have captured the moment Trump was shot.
He called his editor and asked her to look closely at the images. 
“She called me back about five minutes later and said, ‘You won’t believe this.’ I was like, 'What?’ I thought I’d messed something up,” he said. “And she said, 'No, no you captured the bullet piercing behind his head.'”Mills said he happened to have his finger on the shutter at that moment, with the speed set at 1/8,000th of a second. 
“One forensic guy told me it’s between one in a million and one in 5 million chances to do that, because they’ve tried to do that, simulate that, and it’s very difficult to catch a bullet flying like that,” he said. 
“I couldn’t believe it. I still can’t believe it,” he said. “That that happened was, again, very, very lucky.”
Their images will join others that captured some of the darkest days in U.S. history, such as the famous photo by Bill Eppridge showing a busboy helping Robert F. Kennedy moments after the presidential candidate was assassinated in 1968, and the images by Associated Press photographer Ron Edmonds of President Ronald Reagan being rushed to his motorcade after being shot in 1981. 
Mills credits Edmonds, a former colleague and longtime mentor, with helping him hone his instincts.
“He always went in, not away,” Mills said. “Luckily, I didn’t blink like Ron didn’t blink. None of my colleagues blinked. Everybody ran straight for the news.”Moneymaker said she considers Mills, Vucci and Botsford her mentors and being with them Saturday helped her to keep going. 
“I’m in this great company with people who are all very brave and so I think just in that moment, I just tried to hold my own and tried to make them proud,” she said. 
Vucci said he has not fully processed what happened Saturday or the impact of his photo, but he is proud of their collective work. 
“We have a long line of amazing photojournalism,” he said, “And I’m happy that in the moment that it was my time to hold the standard. I was able to hold the standard.”Liz Kreutz is an NBC News correspondent."
NBC_7,Chappell Roan's success marks the rise of the 'middle class' pop star,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/chappell-roan-sabrina-carpenter-charli-xcx-tinashe-redefining-pop-star-rcna159854,2024-07-20 19:00:02.706168,,"Chappell Roan is no longer just “your favorite artist’s favorite artist.” 
After a string of viral festival performances — videos of which showed massive crowds growing week after week — the once-niche pop singer has ascended to mainstream success.
Roan, who is known for the queer themes in her music and her drag-inspired aesthetic, is among the recent crop of artists who have hit unforeseen career highs in recent months, despite being considered part of pop music’s “middle class.” This designation has typically been associated with artists who have cultivated devout online fan bases, but who are not necessarily household names.
A-list pop stardom has become increasingly difficult to achieve. But some music industry experts say the recent rise of Roan and others — including Sabrina Carpenter, Tinashe and Charli XCX — is a testament to their authenticity and ability to foster such strong fandoms.Pop stardom used to be about creating music for the widest possible audience, said Louis Mandelbaum, better known as DJ Louie XIV and the host of “Pop Pantheon,” a podcast that dissects and ranks pop stars’ legacies.
“There were indie bands that could kind of build local audiences and there were other types of music where you could have more of a niche career,” said Mandelbaum. “But when it came to sort of being a pop star, there was really only this one way to operate.”
As a diverse array of genres have risen in popularity, artists are able to find success — to varying degrees — with niche sounds. Taking a look at the top 10 of Billboard’s Hot 100 songs chart, the genres often span from country to rap to pop — and beyond.
Mandelbaum pointed out that some of the most popular artists today, such as Billie Eilish or SZA, make music that may not be recognizable to the general public.
“That was not true of, you know, ‘Teenage Dream’ [by Katy Perry] or ‘Escapade’ [by Janet Jackson] or ‘Don’t Stop ‘til You Get Enough’ [by Michael Jackson],” Mandelbaum said.
Instead of being “pop” as in popular across the culture, artists like Roan, XCX, Carpenter and Tinashe treat “pop” as a genre to be built upon rather than a trending sound.
Morgan Milardo, managing and artistic director of the Berklee Popular Music Institute, said live performances have also been integral in creating communities around these artists.
Roan’s debut album, “The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess,” which came out in September, did not appear on the Billboard 200 albums chart in its opening week, according to the outlet. It only entered the chart in April 2024, following Roan’s stint as an opener for Olivia Rodrigo.
Her album has slowly climbed to the top 10 of the Billboard 200. She also has multiple songs on the Hot 100. Milardo pointed to the decision to move Roan to a bigger stage at the Bonnaroo music festival following the turnout for her set at the Governors Ball festival as another sign of her ascendance.
“Moving an artist based on a festival that they performed the week before is pretty unheard of,” said Milardo, who has worked on the festival circuit. “And so that growth, the metrics, the streaming data, watching it skyrocket through the roof after each festival, that’s not a coincidence.”
Carpenter, who snagged the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time with her hit “Please Please Please,” also rose in popularity after opening for Taylor Swift and performing midday at the same big festivals as Roan. She was recently chosen to replace Tyler, the Creator as a headliner at Outside Lands, a move Milardo said usually takes a couple years for an artist of Carpenter’s stature to achieve.
“It’s like we’re seeing the direct correlation and the direct connection between what’s happening on the charts and what’s happening on streaming platforms versus what’s happening in touring, and specifically the festival circuit,” said Milardo.
It is also impossible to divorce the success of these stars from the current cultural and political climate, according to Milardo.
The authenticity of these artists, who are known for being brash and unapologetically themselves, is refreshing at a time when the rights of women and LGBTQ people are being threatened.
“Part of why they attract such a loyal fan base is because they’re allowing their fans to be authentic too, and they’re developing community and creating camaraderie for their fans,” said Milardo.
Charli XCX, the British pop star considered a cult favorite among music fans, snagged her highest-charting album to date with her club record “Brat,” which dropped on June 7. The album has inspired people to aspire to a “brat summer,” which encourages them to be messy, candid and unapologetic.
Mandelbaum said pop music fans crave “idiosyncratic” musicians today.
With Roan in particular, Mandelbaum said, “​​her identity and her music is speaking to something deep inside of youth culture right now, particularly as it pertains to the representation of queer people in mainstream pop.”
This synergy has made Roan “the right person for the right time” and allowed her to break through in a way pop musicians have not done in a while, said Mandelbaum.
Even with the recent wave of success these artists have achieved, the standard rules of pop stardom have not been imperative to their overall career. Hit singles are “almost incidental,” said Mandelbaum. 
“It’s about speaking to this cult fan base directly,” Mandelbaum said, “and making idiosyncratic music that pleases them.”Daysia Tolentino is a culture and internet reporter for NBC News."
NBC_8,"In courtrooms and capitols, battles heat up over ‘abortion pill reversal’",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/abortion-pill-reversal-controversy-legal-battles-medical-debate-rcna159515,2024-07-20 20:00:02.705390,,"“IT MAY NOT BE TOO LATE TO SAVE YOUR PREGNANCY.” That message blares from a website awash in pink.
The site, run by the anti-abortion group Heartbeat International, describes what it calls “abortion pill reversal,” based on the disputed idea that it’s possible to undo the first step of a medication abortion by taking the hormone progesterone within 24-72 hours.
Started as an experimental treatment more than a decade ago, abortion reversal is now widely promoted in anti-abortion circles — and deeply contentious outside of them. Major medical organizations and researchers say it’s inadequately studied and potentially dangerous.
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is one of them, calling the process “unproven and unethical.”
The debate has simmered for years, but now, two years after the fall of Roe v. Wade and with the use of medication abortion at an all-time high, legislative efforts and courtroom battles over the treatment have sprung up in at least nine states.
Attorneys general in New York and California have sued to block proponents of abortion reversal from peddling claims they say are false advertising.
“Abortions cannot be reversed. Any treatments that claim to do so are made without scientific evidence and could be unsafe,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.
But several states have moved in the opposite direction, considering legislation that would require abortion clinics to tell patients, among other guidance, that abortions can be reversed. In Kansas, a law passed last year but now on hold requires such counseling, similar to earlier laws passed in 14 other states. 
In Colorado, the first state to ban providers from offering the procedure, anti-abortion advocates have thus far blocked the law from taking effect.
This fall, the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists plans to roll out a course on abortion reversal to hospitals and doctors. The Heritage Foundation, the conservative organization behind Project 2025, which advocates for restricting medication abortion, awarded the association a $100,000 grant toward the effort.
Mary Ziegler, a historian and law professor who has studied the anti-abortion movement, sees the increasingly fraught debate over abortion reversal as part of conservatives’ broader war against medication abortion. This year, anti-abortion groups unsuccessfully attempted to limit access to mifepristone in a case before the Supreme Court, leaving the drug widely available.
“As long as abortion is legal in some parts of the country, there is at least a perceived need in the anti-abortion movement for a way of discouraging people from using abortion pills — or thinking that they can change their minds,” Ziegler said.
Approved in 2000 for use in the U.S., medication abortions require a two-step process: First, a patient takes mifepristone. Then, within 48 hours, they take misoprostol, which causes contractions that empty the uterus, a regimen that the FDA and a large body of studies have found to be safe.
Roughly 15 years ago, Dr. George Delgado, medical director of Culture of Life Family Services, began to explore the idea of abortion reversal. He reasoned that since mifepristone blocks progesterone receptors, providing a high dose of progesterone might counteract its effects. Progesterone was already being used to treat patients at risk of miscarriage and to bolster IVF.
“I thought people would welcome a second chance at choice,” he said.
Cynthia, who asked to use only her first name to protect sensitive medical information, was the first patient to whom Delgado administered the treatment.
She was a 19-year-old freshman in college when she said she learned she was pregnant. She took the first dose of mifepristone but said she started having “second thoughts” and was referred by her family’s priest to Delgado.
When she saw an ultrasound of her fetus at Delgado’s office, Cynthia said, she cried.
“At that point, I was willing to do anything,” she said. She traveled to his clinic several times a week to receive progesterone, and later gave birth to her son, who is now 13 years old.
But researchers say that very few people who have abortions come to regret them. The Turnaway Study, led by researchers from the University of California, San Francisco, followed more than 1,000 participants who had abortions or were unable to have one. Researchers found that 95% of respondents contacted five years after ending their pregnancies said it was the right decision for them.
“People seeking abortion care do so after making thoughtful decisions that align with their values, priorities, and their family’s unique needs,” the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement to NBC News. “Questioning those thoughtful decisions and promoting myths about regret associated with abortion only perpetuate abortion stigma.”
Initially, advice on abortion pill reversal spread by word of mouth, Delgado said. Then he launched a hotline to share the information and connect callers to the nearest doctor offering the treatment. Heartbeat International took over that operation in 2018 and says it now receives 170 calls per month.
It says its network consists of an estimated 1,400 doctors, hospitals and what it calls “pregnancy help organizations.” At least 1,875 women received a prescription through the network last year, a 43% increase since 2020, according to its most recent report.
Heartbeat International hopes to reach even more people by backing laws that require abortion providers to tell patients about the regimen, which has not been approved by federal regulators. Lawmakers in seven states introduced such legislation this year, though none of the bills have passed.
“When somebody comes to us saying, ‘I made a mistake. I took the abortion pill’ — whatever kind of pressure or fear or frustration that was going on, they regret it, and so we have an obligation to try to help them at their request,” said Dr. William Lile, an OB-GYN based in Florida who is on the network’s medical advisory board.
But many doctors and researchers disagree. A significant portion of patients who discontinue a medication abortion by not taking misoprostol, the second step after mifepristone, remain pregnant, even without the addition of progesterone, critics of abortion reversal say. The question is whether the progesterone increases that likelihood and by how much. A study that looks at the outcome of taking mifepristone alone versus taking mifepristone plus progesterone, critics argue, is needed to isolate progesterone’s role.
A study like that was started by researchers at the University of California, Davis, in 2019, but it had to be halted early after three of the study’s 12 participants — their goal was to enroll 40 —  experienced dangerous bleeding and required hospital visits.
For Dr. Mitchell Creinin, who led the study, those results were disturbing. They were “a safety signal,” he said in an interview, “meaning it’s not safe to evaluate this or use this as a treatment until we figure this out.”
Delgado sees it differently, noting as other proponents have, that two of the three patients who experienced excessive bleeding had only taken mifepristone, rather than mifepristone followed by progesterone, and those were the ones who required more care. Delgado was one of the plaintiffs in the Supreme Court case challenging access to mifepristone.
To back up his support of abortion reversal, Delgado cites his own research, including a “case series” involving hundreds of patients, as proof that abortion reversal works. Published in 2018, he reported that roughly half of the patients treated with progesterone went on to give birth.
But critics say that study failed to meet key research standards, such as having a control group and including safety data. In response, Delgado noted that he did track birth defects, which he described as a major aspect of safety. Although Delgado has said he plans to conduct more research, he’s resisted carrying out a placebo-controlled study because he doesn’t believe there’s an ethical way to do one if a patient actually wants to continue their pregnancy.
“Have there been any double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials on CPR? No,” he said. “Why do we do CPR? Because it’s the best that we have.”
Creinin said that the protocol hasn’t been studied enough to properly inform patients about possible side effects or complications. The fact that progesterone has been approved for other uses, he said, doesn’t mean that it’s safe or effective for use in this application.
“Is there a possibility this works? I will say until I’m blue in the face, ‘Yes, there is a possibility it works,’” Creinin said. “Is there any evidence that it works? None.”
The future of “abortion pill reversal” will likely depend on legal skirmishes being fought in courthouses and statehouses.
In their suits against Heartbeat International and anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers that promote abortion pill reversal, Democratic attorneys general in New York and California have argued that the practice is medically unsound and potential clients are receiving misleading information. Heartbeat International said in response that it stands by its claims and statistics.
In a countersuit, Heartbeat International contested James’ allegations, casting the lawsuit as political persecution.
“It’s up to the women to decide, not the court or not the attorneys general who are just trying to silence us,” said Andrea Trudden, a spokesperson for Heartbeat International.
The law firm Thomas More Society is also representing Heartbeat International in California, where Attorney General Rob Bonta sued the organization and another on similar grounds. In June, a judge declined to dismiss the state’s case, which will proceed in the coming months.
Abortion reversal is also being fought over in Colorado, which last year became the first state to outlaw its use. A Catholic clinic sued, and the ban was put on pause.
Soon after, the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian law firm that was a key player in overturning Roe v. Wade, joined the case on behalf of Chelsea Mynyk, a nurse midwife who said she was subject to an investigation by the Colorado State Board of Nursing for offering the treatment at her home-based clinic. In an interview, she said she was “disheartened” by the complaint against her, explaining it seemed designed to “make it difficult for providers like myself to help save lives.”
In Kansas, Planned Parenthood sued to block a law requiring abortion providers to tell patients about abortion pill reversal. Kansas’ mandate is part of a sweep of anti-abortion measures introduced in the state Legislature after residents voted to protect abortion rights in 2022.
Elisabeth Smith, director of state policy and advocacy at the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing Planned Parenthood and other providers in Kansas, says because the voters protected abortion, conservative lawmakers have turned toward alternative tactics.
They’re “perpetuating stigma,” Smith said, by “making people think that maybe this treatment isn’t effective, maybe their provider isn’t trustworthy, and that maybe abortion is something that should be regretted.” Lawmakers “just push, push, push stigma,” she added, “because they know they can’t pass a total ban and see it be enforced.”
In New York, both sides are waiting for a ruling from an appeals court to determine where the case will be heard. The Thomas More Society said it’s preparing to file a challenge in federal court.Bracey Harris is a national reporter for NBC News, based in Jackson, Mississippi. "
NBC_9,"CrowdStrike update that caused global outage likely skipped checks, experts say",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/crowdstrike-update-caused-global-outage-likely-skipped-checks-experts-rcna162839,2024-07-21 00:00:02.666477,,"SAN FRANCISCO — Security experts said CrowdStrike’s routine update of its widely used cybersecurity software, which caused clients’ computer systems to crash globally on Friday, apparently did not undergo adequate quality checks before it was deployed.
The latest version of its Falcon Sensor software was meant make CrowdStrike clients’ systems more secure against hacking by updating the threats it defends against. But faulty code in the update files resulted in one of the most widespread tech outages in recent years for companies using Microsoft’s Windows operating system.
Global banks, airlines, hospitals and government offices were disrupted. CrowdStrike released information to fix affected systems, but experts said getting them back online would take time as it required manually weeding out the flawed code.
“What it looks like is, potentially, the vetting or the sandboxing they do when they look at code, maybe somehow this file was not included in that or slipped through,” said Steve Cobb, chief security officer at Security Scorecard, which also had some systems impacted by the issue.
Problems came to light quickly after the update was rolled out on Friday, and users posted pictures on social media of computers with blue screens displaying error messages. These are known in the industry as “blue screens of death.”
Patrick Wardle, a security researcher who specializes in studying threats against operating systems, said his analysis identified the code responsible for the outage.
The update’s problem was “in a file that contains either configuration information or signatures,” he said. Such signatures are code that detects specific types of malicious code or malware.
“It’s very common that security products update their signatures, like once a day... because they’re continually monitoring for new malware and because they want to make sure that their customers are protected from the latest threats,” he said.
The frequency of updates “is probably the reason why (CrowdStrike) didn’t test it as much,” he said.
It’s unclear how that faulty code got into the update and why it wasn’t detected before being released to customers.
“Ideally, this would have been rolled out to a limited pool first,” said John Hammond, principal security researcher at Huntress Labs. “That is a safer approach to avoid a big mess like this.”
Other security companies have had similar episodes in the past. McAfee’s buggy antivirus update in 2010 stalled hundreds of thousands of computers.
But the global impact of this outage reflects CrowdStrike’s dominance. Over half of Fortune 500 companies and many government bodies such as the top U.S. cybersecurity agency itself, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, use the company’s software.Reuters"
NBC_10,Adidas apologizes for Bella Hadid shoe ad following criticism from Israeli government,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/adidas-apologizes-bella-hadid-shoe-ad-criticism-israeli-government-rcna162832,2024-07-21 00:00:02.666477,,"Adidas apologized for featuring model Bella Hadid in campaign ads for its SL72 shoes, which were first released for the 1972 Munich Olympics, an event marred by the Palestinian group Black September breaking into the Olympic Village and killing 11 Israeli athletes.
After the German-based sportswear company posted images of Hadid promoting its SL72 shoe, the state of Israel criticized the move on X. ""Guess who the face of their campaign is? Bella Hadid, a model who has a history of spreading antisemitism and calling for violence against Israelis and Jews,"" it wrote on Thursday.
Hadid's father is Palestinian and she has been a vocal supporter of Palestinians during the Israel-Hamas war.
On Friday, Adidas pulled Hadid's ads and told NBC News it was ""revising the remainder of the campaign.""
""We are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events — though these are completely unintentional — and we apologize for any upset or distress caused,"" Adidas said.
At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, eight Palestinians affiliated with the militant group Black September took Israeli Olympic athletes hostage and demanded the release of Palestinians held in Israeli and German prisons. In the ensuing gun battle with the German police, the Palestinian militants killed 11 Israeli athletes and one German policeman. 
Other social media users defended Hadid and called for a boycott of Adidas in response. Hadid was not immediately available for comment. 
When Hadid appeared on the cover of Vogue magazine in 2021, she said on Instagram: ""I won't stop talking about the systematic oppression, pain and humility that Palestinians face on a regular basis."" She has since continued to vocally support Palestinians and criticize the Israeli government.

The Israeli strikes appeared to be the first on Yemeni soil since the Israel-Hamas war began in October.
“A short while ago, IDF fighter jets struck military targets of the Houthi terrorist regime in the area of the Al Hudaydah Port in Yemen in response to the hundreds of attacks carried out against the State of Israel in recent months,"" the IDF said in a statement that NBC News obtained. 
Israel’s airstrikes injured at least 80 people, most of them with severe burns, according to Houthi-run news agency SABA. 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strikes were a ""direct response"" to Friday's attack on Israel.
""The port we attacked is not an innocent port,"" he said in a news briefing. ""It was used for military purposes, it was used as an entry point for deadly weapons supplied to the Houthis by Iran."" 
Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam wrote on social media platform X that Yemen was subjected to a “blatant Israeli aggression” that targeted fuel storage facilities and the province’s power station. He said the attacks aim “to increase the suffering of the people and to pressure Yemen to stop supporting Gaza.”
Abdulsalam said the attacks will only make the people of Yemen and its armed forces more determined to support Gaza. Mohamed Ali al-Houthi of the Supreme Political Council in Yemen wrote on X that “there will be impactful strikes.”
A media outlet controlled by Houthi rebels in Yemen, Al-Masirah TV, said the strikes on storage facilities for oil and diesel at the port and on the local electricity company caused deaths and injuries, and several people suffered severe burns. It said there was a large fire at the port and power cuts were widespread.
Pictures and videos showed a significant amount of smoke rising from the fiery blast.
In a statement, Hamas condemned the airstrikes that they called a ""massacre and a dangerous escalation."" 
The Houthis claimed responsibility for a drone strike near a U.S. Embassy branch office in Tel Aviv Friday that killed at least one person and injured several others.

NBC_12,'Agency in crisis': Secret Service has decade-old staffing shortfall,https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/agency-crisis-secret-service-decade-old-staffing-shortfall-rcna162698,2024-07-21 04:00:02.799908,,"The arm of the Secret Service that protects presidents, vice presidents and their families is nearly 10% smaller than it was a decade ago despite warnings from Congress and a government watchdog that it needed to add agents or risk compromising its mission.
The latest congressional budget figures show that the employee head count assigned to protect the president and other senior officials and investigate threats against them dropped by roughly 350 staffers — down from 4,027 in fiscal 2014 to 3,671 in the current fiscal year.
At the same time, the number of people that Protective Operations had to protect grew and the potential threats it faced became more diverse. Today, the U.S. Secret Service faces chronic understaffing for its most high-profile roles and competition from the private sector, which routinely poaches agents for much higher-paying and less punishing jobs.
As the agency is being roundly criticized for failing to adequately protect former President Donald Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, local and federal law enforcement officials say it’s widely known within policing circles that the organization whose agents would “take a bullet for the president” is overwhelmed.
The Secret Service did not respond to a list of questions from NBC News regarding the state of the agency in recent years. Earlier this week, a Secret Service spokesperson said they could not discuss resources for security reasons but praised the agency’s performance.
“Out of concern for operational security, the U.S. Secret Service does not discuss the means and methods used for our protective operations,” the spokesperson said. “Ensuring the safety and security of national leaders and presidential ​candidates is the core mission of the U.S. Secret Service, the finest protective service ​team in the world.”The agency’s staffing problems do not appear to be caused by a lack of funding. The budget of the Secret Service nearly doubled over the last decade. It jumped from around $1.8 billion in fiscal 2014 to more than $3 billion, according to government filings. During the same period, agencywide staffing rose by nearly 25%, with over 8,100 personnel. That includes roughly 3,200 special agents and 1,300 uniformed officers, according to the agency’s website.
Adding to the strain, both presidents Joe Biden and Trump, who are older presidents with grandchildren, have had Secret Service protection for their large, multigenerational families. Legally, the Secret Service is required to protect presidents, vice presidents and their immediate families, which include grandchildren under federal rules.
Secret Service agents must also guard former presidents and vice presidents plus their spouses and children under 16, as well as visiting heads of state. In election years, they must also protect leading presidential and vice presidential candidates and their spouses.
“Now they’re protecting this person, now they’re doing this event, now it starts to just add more and more responsibilities without necessarily adding more and more agents,” said Jason Russell, a former agent who owns a private security company.
Budget documents reviewed by NBC News show that the agency requested more than $25 million in fiscal year 2018 to pay agents to work in New York to protect Trump Tower along with Trump’s children and grandchildren. Three years later, the agency requested funding for extra vehicles to protect Trump after he left office.
In 2020, the Government Accountability Office interviewed current and former agents to see if the agency was overburdened. Agents told the GAO that working protection details leads to psychological stress.
Instead of simply accompanying presidents on trips and returning to Washington, agents in protection details can spend weeks in other cities, inspecting and securing sites the president will visit. Some agents spend 100 or 200 nights a year away from home, and it’s not sustainable for agents to work protection assignments for years at a time.
The Secret Service also had the National Academy of Public Administration dig into its staffing challenges. In a 2021 report, NAPA found that agents are tasked with “more than ever within tight resources.”
“Threats against the President and other protectees have grown in intensity and scale with the emergence of new technologies and the heightened level of violence in the country,” the report said.
Frank Loveridge, who spent 22 years with the agency including as a supervisor in the Presidential Protection Division during President Barack Obama’s second term, said agents were stretched thin.
“You’re being pushed so hard all the time. You’re on the road for three straight weeks with no days off, working 16-hour days traveling,” said Loveridge, now a director of corporate security.
Throughout the 2010s, the Secret Service was buffeted by one scandal after another. A scathing 2015 congressional report called the Secret Service an “agency in crisis” and detailed a series of alarming failings, including: In 2011, a gunman fired at least seven rounds into Obama’s primary residence at the White House; in 2012, agents admitted engaging in misconduct with prostitutes in Colombia, which led to several resignations and removals; in 2014, a man armed with a knife jumped over a White House fence, making it inside the East Room.
“Several incidents have made it abundantly clear that USSS is in crisis,” states the beginning of the 438-page congressional report, using an acronym for the organization. “The agency’s weaknesses have been exposed by a series of security failures.”
In the wake of the scandals, the Secret Service lost roughly 500 personnel in protective operations, according to budget documents covering fiscal 2014 and 2015. The agency also convened an independent panel to assess its challenges and released a list of recommended reforms. Suggested agencywide changes included increases to training and improving the hiring process to make it more efficient.
Between 2019 and 2022, the GAO released a series of reviews of the reforms’ implementation. They found that the Secret Service still had a particularly slow-moving hiring process. GAO officials say the background-check process for an agent is intensive and can take years because applicants could guard the president one day.
Once hired, young agents must work on other assignments, such as investigating financial crimes, in field offices around the country. They then participate in presidential protection details when the president visits their region to gain training.
After the police murder of George Floyd, the Secret Service and federal and local law enforcement agencies struggled with recruitment. Working for the Secret Service is also known as both grueling and tedious, with agents standing on their feet and waiting for hours while officials meet.
The GAO found that agents were not always paid for all the extra hours worked. Congress stepped in and passed legislation that provides overtime for staffers who work in protection, but the measure expires in 2028.
“We give up nights, weekends, holidays,” Robert McDonald, a retired Secret Service agent and now a lecturer at the University of New Haven, said. “That’s how we serve the public. So it’s very difficult to get people interested in this type of situation of protecting the community or going into the Secret Service.”
The GAO also found that the agency was overscheduling agents in the presidential and vice presidential protective divisions and not giving them enough time to train on the job, said Jason Bair, the managing director of the GAO’s homeland security and justice team.
“You inevitably have to make difficult decisions about what people are going to focus their time and effort,” Bair told NBC News.
In addition to agents who serve on protective details, uniformed officers within the agency stand post at the White House, the Treasury Department and foreign diplomatic missions in Washington, D.C. Uniformed officers also screen the public as they enter high-profile events when presidents speak.
Christopher McClenic, a retired 23-year veteran of the Secret Service who worked on President Bill Clinton’s detail, said the responsibilities particularly of the uniformed division were “never-ending.”
“You will be working 12-hour shifts pretty much every day into perpetuity,” McClenic said. “I don’t think the uniform division has ever been fully staffed.”
Although federal officials declined to share the exact number of threats to the president and other top political leaders, FBI Director Christopher Wray recently testified to Congress that threats against the United States are growing in breadth and complexity. And experts warn that political violence could intensify during the year’s heated U.S election cycle.
In January, the U.S. Capitol Police announced they had investigated 8,008 threats against members of Congress in 2023. That was slightly lower than the 9,625 threats the agency investigated in 2021 after the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. Between 2018 and 2021, the number of threats against senators and representatives nearly doubled.
In 2023, the husband of Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California and two staff members of Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia were attacked. In 2017, then-Republican House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and three other people were wounded when a gunman opened fire on members of the Republican congressional baseball team.
The tensions are exacerbated by the fact that this year’s presidential campaign now includes an assassination attempt against Trump. The Biden administration also recently disclosed intelligence that Iran had plotted to kill Trump.
At the same time, as in past presidential campaign seasons, more individuals are now under Secret Service protection — including vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and his family, along with independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the son of a man assassinated while on the campaign trail.
A final challenge is retention. Former Secret Service officials say it can be difficult to get experienced agents to remain on the job. Some leave to work for other government agencies with less intense schedules, while others join security firms and other private businesses, where the pay can be far higher.
Former Secret Service agents are top hires for Derrick Parker, who runs security for celebrities after his career in the New York Police Department investigating rappers.
“They are the best-trained law enforcement personnel in the country and among the best in the world,” Parker said. “That makes them very attractive to hire in the private sector, especially VIP protection.”
Protecting celebrities, versus government officials, often translates into less stressful lifestyles, Parker added.
McClenic, the 23-year Secret Service veteran who retired from the agency two years ago to work full time as an attorney, said his life is “better, easier, more fulfilled” than when he was an agent.
“Now, instead of wondering whether or not I will be home to enjoy [my wife’s] company, have dinner with her, maybe even a glass of wine, and sleep in the same bed,” he said, “I don’t have to wonder that anymore.”Simone Weichselbaum is a national investigative reporter for NBC News, focusing on local and federal law enforcement issues.

""The question is, if he's not going to be their nominee because he's not up to it, how can he be our president for the next six months?"" Rubio said, according to Politico. ""If there's something wrong with you that doesn't allow you to run for president, how can you still be there as president? If they're going to remove him as nominee, they’ve got to remove him as president, and that's really bad for our country.""

Polling guru and FiveThirtyEight founder Nate Silver earlier this month wrote on X he also believes Biden should ""transition the presidency to [Vice President Kamala] Harris within 30-60 days, but I’m there now. Something is clearly wrong here.""

Increasing numbers of Democrats have called on Biden to exit the White House race after his disastrous debate performance late last month, fearing he would lose to Trump. 
Historian Alexis Coe wrote in a Rolling Stone op-ed Friday that Biden should resign to ""preserve his legacy.""

Presidential historian Allan Lichtman, who has accurately predicted nine of the last 10 elections, has also said that if Biden were to drop out of the race, handing over the presidency to Harris as she replaces him on the ticket would be the Democrats' best chance of keeping the White House in November.

Former New Jersey Republican governor and longtime Trump critic Chris Christie faced backlash from co-hosts of ""The View"" after declaring that he would not vote for either former President Donald Trump or President Joe Biden. 
In the wake of Trump’s choice of JD Vance as his running mate and his RNC acceptance speech on Thursday night, Christie argued on Friday that the former Republican president had failed his ""chance to be unifying,"" arguing he could have picked someone like Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin as his vice president.
""I know you’re not voting for Trump, would you vote for a Democratic ticket?"" show co-host Ana Navarro asked shortly afterward.
""Right now, I’m not voting for either. I’m just not. I can’t. One guy is completely mentally incompetent to do the job —"" Christie replied as the co-hosts erupted.

""But you have to vote!"" co-host Joy Behar argued.
""No, I’m gonna vote down ticket. I don’t have to vote [for president], no!"" Christie said, standing his ground, as one co-host could be heard telling him, ""Yes, you do.""
""You cannot throw away your vote! I asked you the last time you were on, Chris, and you’re gonna sit this one out?"" co-host Sunny Hostin said, speaking over him.
Navarro grilled Christie, arguing that it was ironic he was telling Democrats to ditch their current presidential nominee when he planned to vote for neither. The former governor said he will maintain this position as long as Biden remains the Democratic nominee, but may change his mind if a better leading candidate is offered.
""I’m willing to consider anybody who presents themself as someone who will make the country better. Now, I’m not encouraged by Kamala Harris’ performance thus far,"" he said. 
When asked by Hostin why he was not a Harris fan, he said, ""’Why not?’ We only have like a minute-thirty. I don’t have enough time.""
When badgered about not yet committing to vote for Biden, Christie joked he would vote write in Joy Behar as his candidate of choice. 
FIVE BIGGEST MOMENTS OF TRUMP’S SPEECH TO RNC
Hostin has been one of Harris’ most staunch defenders over the years, arguing that she is criticized because of her Black racial background or for being a woman, and claiming her widely-parodied word salads are actually a product of her legal background rather than gaffes. 
After Christie declared that the Biden-Harris ticket would not win in November, Behar asked if he would be willing to vote for a Harris-Joe Shapiro ticket, featuring the more moderate governor of Pennsylvania as the vice president.
""Don’t know. Let me see what they have to say,"" he said. 
When multiple hosts objected to this answer, he declared, ""I’m sorry that I care for what people stand for. I apologize. I’m not gonna pre-commit to it! Let them perform and earn my vote! People should have their vote earned!""

Biden-Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon cautioned staff to avoid watching cable news in order to prevent further demoralization among her team.
As the daily calls, both publicly and privately, for President Biden to drop out of the presidential race continue apace more than three weeks after the debate, campaign staff are reportedly suffering from a lack of morale. In that vein, O’Malley Dillon convened an all-staff call on Friday, telling them to ignore the news reports, and instead listen to Biden’s hardcore supporters for a reality check.
""Don't watch cable news all the time,"" O'Malley Dillon told her staff, according to Axios, ""That is not the real world. The real world is the voters that are standing with us, the delegates that are with us, and we're going to weather this because of this organization.""

""When you give me polls, I'm going to give you direct voter contact,"" O'Malley Dillon said, sources told Fox News. ""The people that the president is hearing from are saying, ‘Stay in this race and keep going and keep fighting, and we need you.’""
""Those voices will never be as loud as the people on TV, but remember that the people in our country are not watching cable news,"" she added. 
FOX NEWS CHANNEL VIEWERSHIP CRUSHES MSNBC, CNN DURING SECOND QUARTER
Just hours before the call, the campaign chair made a rare media appearance on cable news, assuring the audience and hosts of MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe"" that Biden is staying in the race and is ""more committed than ever to beat Donald Trump.""
""The president's in this race,"" O'Malley Dillon told the program. ""You've heard him say that time and time again, and I think we saw on display last night exactly why, because Donald Trump is not going to offer anything new to the American people. He's the same person he was in 2020. He's the same person he was at the debate stage.""
The cable news channel reportedly has an outsize influence on the White House.

Axios has previously reported that both Biden and his staff keep a close watch on MSNBC's morning program, to the point that ""Because Biden watches ‘Morning Joe’ so often, most of his top aides watch or track the show to anticipate potential questions from him.""
The outlet also reported that Biden ""often calls co-host Joe Scarborough — a former Republican congressman who's now a harsh critic of Donald Trump — to get Scarborough's take on issues and sometimes vent about media coverage, according to people familiar with the relationship.""
Biden himself called into ""Morning Joe"" earlier this month to try to shore up support.
""The bottom line here is that we’re not going anywhere. I am not going anywhere,"" Biden told the hosts, both avid supporters who had started to go wobbly after the debate. 
""I wouldn’t be running if I didn’t absolutely believe that I am the best candidate to beat Donald Trump in 2024,"" Biden added. ""We had a democratic nominating process where the voters spoke clearly. I won 14 million of those votes.""

There is an increasing sense of division in the Republican Party when it comes to the U.S. posture abroad, particularly when it comes to countering Russia, as Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, joins Donald Trump as his running mate in the race for the White House.
The calls to stop military aid to Ukraine reflect a fundamental break in the party and a reversal to the long-held GOP neoconservative approach to foreign policy, which previously leaned heavily on an interventionist strategy.
Ronald Reagan famously held a ""peace through strength"" approach, which relies on military power to preserve global stability, a policy that both the Bush administrations adhered to.
But the policies practiced by Republican Party leaders from the 1980s through the early 2000s have prompted a rise to a different approach in the GOP, a strategy not largely held since before World War II — isolationism.

TRUMP DEMANDS EUROPE COUGH UP MORE CASH FOR UKRAINE, SAYS WAR WITH RUSSIA WOULDN’T HAVE HAPPENED ON HIS WATCH
""I do think that is a repudiation,"" Victoria Coates, a former deputy national security adviser to Trump, told Fox News Digital, pointing to the decades-long wars in the Middle East. ""A rejection of the traditional establishment neoconservative stance, which favors military intervention to promote democracy.
""I just don't think that that's been a winning formula,"" she said, noting many Republicans today agree, including Vance.
In a speech at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft in May, Vance made clear there are stark divisions in the GOP when it comes to foreign policy. 
""We really have to get past the tired old slogans,"" Vance said. ""The way that American foreign policy has proceeded for the last 40 years — think about the wreckage and think about the actual results.
""People are terrified of confronting new arguments, I believe, because they're terrified of confronting their own failure over the last 40 years.""
In his speech, Vance specifically pointed to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has been an ardent supporter of Ukraine and who became a senator the year Vance was born in 1984. 
""Nearly every foreign policy position he's held has actually been wrong,"" Vance claimed. 
The push by some in the Republican Party to back off aid to Ukraine stalled military supplies to the war-torn nation for six months and revealed the true extent to which Kyiv relies on the U.S. in its fight against Russia.

TRUMP SHOOTING PLAYS INTO RUSSIA, CHINA PLANS TO DIVIDE US AHEAD OF ELECTIONS
While many in the GOP see Ukraine's victory over Moscow as a vital security interest to the U.S., Vance and Trump believe it should also be Europe's burden to shoulder. 
Unease among NATO allies over the threat of discontinued aid to Ukraine under a Trump presidency has prompted speculation that the security of Europe, and even the alliance, could be in jeopardy. 
Headlines this week reported ""concern,"" ""anxiety"" and a ""nightmare"" scenario for Ukraine as Vance has unequivocally opposed continued aid to Kyiv and has instead pushed for a stronger stance when it comes to countering China. 
""I think we should stop supporting the Ukrainian conflict,"" Vance said in May. ""I do not think that it is in America's interest to continue to fund an effectively never-ending war in Ukraine.
""The second-biggest criticism I make about the war in Ukraine and our approach to it is that we are subsidizing the Europeans to do nothing.""

Trump first led the push in getting more NATO nations to meet their 2006 defense spending pledges, and the war in Ukraine has ensured that now 23 of the 32 nations are hitting the 2% GDP threshold. 
Some nations have not only hit their goals but have begun contributing well beyond their original pledge, including Poland, which contributes 4.12%. Estonia, the U.S., Latvia and Greece all give more than 3% and Lithuania contributes 2.85%.
Despite advances in international defense efforts, there is a fundamental divide in the GOP when it comes to the U.S. and its relationship with NATO. 
""They've done a great job, and that's terrific,"" Coates, vice president of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy at The Heritage Foundation, said. ""Unfortunately, their scale is not enough to really move the needle. 
""We need the big economies,"" she added, pointing to Canada, which still only contributes 1.37% of its GDP to defense spending despite being the world’s 10th largest economy. ""That just can't go on.""

Experts agree it is unlikely Trump would fully pull out of the NATO alliance. Though there is concern he could weaken the alliance by cutting aid to Ukraine or by pulling U.S. troops out of Europe.
But while Vance has argued ""America can’t do everything"" and therefore should focus on the threat China poses, Hal Brands, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C., argued it is not that simple.
""U.S.-China competition is not simply a regional competition. It’s a global competition,"" he said. ""It involves things like control of advanced technologies, as well as things like the military balance of power.""
Brand, who is also the Henry A. Kissinger Distinguished Professor of Global Affairs at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, argued that the U.S. needs to maintain its European relations to leverage its influence ""to choke off China's access to advanced semiconductor manufacturing.""
""Even if you think that China is the overriding priority in U.S. policy, you won’t be effective in dealing with China unless you have some degree of influence that the transatlantic relationship provides,"" he added.
There is growing concern among Republicans that adhere to a broad U.S. international presence that isolationism is on the rise, and there are security threats that that could pose.

""It has become all too easy to just assume that Europe would be fine after a U.S. departure. When history actually provides very little support for that idea,"" Brands said. ""There’s long been this tendency to try to remain aloof from problems in other regions, and we saw that before World War II.""

It has long been argued that U.S. reluctance to involve itself in European affairs in the lead-up to World War II emboldened Adolf Hitler to execute his ambitions largely unchecked by the U.S. or its British and French allies, ultimately costing the Allies greatly. 
""President Trump has said that the U.S. should not be involved in Ukraine because there’s an ocean between the U.S. and Europe. And that’s very reminiscent of American involvement you heard from the anti-interventionists in the 1930s.""
Vance has rejected the ""isolationist"" label and said during his address at the Quincy Institute, ""The fact that I oppose sending money that we don't have to another country, or that borrowing money to send it is somehow, to me, that's not isolationism.
""That's just fiscal conservatism.""

In our current political climate, it is rare for someone, especially an elected official, to publicly admit they misjudged an issue, took the wrong position, or supported the wrong candidate.
Since being announced as the Republican vice presidential nominee, JD Vance has endured an onslaught of attacks – primarily centered around previous comments he made about Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election. 
Much like then-Sen. Kamala Harris taking digs at Vice President Joe Biden during the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, where she essentially labeled Biden a racist, Senator Vance’s remarks regarding former President Trump were pointed and admittedly, a bit harsh.
JD VANCE BY THE NUMBERS: FIRST SPEECH SIGNALS HEAVY CAMPAIGN PRESENCE IN BATTLEGROUND RUST BELT
However, just as Harris reassessed Biden’s record and her support for the former vice president, JD Vance also reassessed his position on President Trump. This led him to openly admit he got it wrong and then to him becoming a close confidant to the former president Trump and this week, to becoming President Trump’s vice presidential running mate.
Much like JD Vance and many other everyday Americans, I understand the gravity of reassessing one’s stance and admitting when I get it wrong– especially in the aftermath of the assassination attempt on President Trump’s life.
In late 2022, I published an op-ed declaring my opposition to Trump’s 2024 re-election bid. My op-ed and the subsequent words I shared were harsh, wrong, unfair, and far too pointed – but, fortunately, my experience running for and winning local office in South Carolina, and engaging daily with everyday Americans, has profoundly reshaped my perspective, and led me to, once again, support President Trump.
Interacting with citizens from all walks of life—those working multiple jobs yet struggling to make ends meet -- has illuminated the failures of President Joe Biden’s policies. It’s become more apparent to me than ever that we must, as was on full display at this week’s Republican National Convention, unite in our efforts to save our nation.
TRUMP VP PICK JD VANCE PLEDGES TO ‘COMMIT TO THE WORKING MAN’ AS POPULISM TAKES CENTER STAGE AT RNC
And although critics may decry Trump’s often blunt rhetoric or point to past criticism from those like Senator Vance and me, the reality is this: the Biden administration’s failures have had far more severe consequences for American families than admitting to a few harsh or pointed words ever will.
Let’s face it: under President Biden, the economy is faltering. Inflation rates hit a 40-year-high in 2022 and still remain elevated. Gas prices have soared, with some states seeing averages as high as $5 per gallon. Interest rates are at a near 20-year high, and grocery prices have skyrocketed, with essentials like meat, poultry, and eggs increasing by over 12% in the past year alone.
Concurrently, the ongoing crisis at our southern border has reached unprecedented levels. Record numbers of illegal crossings and a surge in drug trafficking have strained resources and exacerbated the opioid crisis. In 2022, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported over 2.3 million migrant encounters, the highest number ever recorded. The influx of illicit drugs, including fentanyl, has contributed to the overdose epidemic, claiming more than 100,000 American lives annually.
Internationally, our standing has diminished following Biden’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, which resulted in the deaths of 13 American service members and left many citizens and allies stranded. This debacle epitomizes weak and indecisive leadership, emboldening our adversaries and contributing to global instability.
The conflicts in Ukraine and Israel, alongside increased tensions in the Middle East, reflect a perceived lack of American resolve. And while Biden may not have directly caused these crises, his failure to address them effectively has exacerbated the situation. The ongoing war in Ukraine and the violence in Gaza, coupled with a disturbing rise in antisemitism, underscore the need for strong, decisive leadership.
CHUCK SCHUMER PUSHED TO DELAY DNC AS CONCERNS PERSIST OVER BIDEN'S CANDIDACY
Simply put, everyday Americans are struggling to thrive under Biden’s policies. His administration’s economic and foreign policy failures have left families grappling with financial insecurity and heightened anxiety about national and global stability.
However, in stark contrast, under former President Trump’s leadership, the U.S. experienced significant economic growth. The unemployment rate pre-pandemic fell to a 50-year low of 3.5% in 2019, and the country achieved energy independence, leading to lower gas prices averaging around $2.40 per gallon.

Trump’s firm stance on border security resulted in a 78% decrease in illegal crossings between 2019 and 2020, with drug seizures at the border increasing by 50%. This alleviated the strain on border communities and demonstrated Trump’s commitment to protecting American sovereignty and everyday Americans.
Globally, Trump’s administration prioritized diplomacy, culminating in the historic Abraham Accords, which brought peace agreements between Israel and several Arab nations. Support for Ukraine in its conflict with Russia also yielded promising results, showcasing a commitment to resolving conflicts through diplomacy and emphasizing peace through strength.

Facts are facts and the case is clear: while Democrats continue to debate Biden’s viability after his disastrous debate performance, and as more and more Democrats continue to come forward in opposition to President Biden remaining at the top of the Democratic ticket, everyday Americans continue to suffer under his administration.
Rather, as we begin the race towards the November general election, and while Biden and the Democratic establishment attempt to shift American's focus to comments from the past as they try to sort out their ever-divided party, Republicans, with the selection of JD Vance, are more united than ever to save our nation and deliver the much-needed help everyday Americans so desperately want and need.

Despite calls on the left and right for the temperature to be dialed down following the assassination attempt against former President Trump, MSNBC hosts continued making inflammatory remarks during their coverage of the Republican National Convention this week.
Primetime hosts at the liberal network accused candidates of being secret racists and even gave a platform to conspiracy theories questioning if Trump was actually shot.
Here are five of the most eyebrow-raising remarks by MSNBC primetime hosts covering the RNC this past week.

LIVE UPDATES: REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION
MSNBC host Alex Wagner attracted headlines after she claimed that Trump's pick for vice president, JD Vance, dropped ""Easter eggs of White nationalism"" by saying during his RNC speech that he wanted to be buried in his family's plot in Kentucky.
""I just think the construction of this notion reveals a lot about someone who fundamentally believes in the supremacy of whiteness and masculinity, and it’s couched in a sort of halcyon, you know, revisitation of his roots, but it is actually really revealing about what he thinks matters and who America is, and that America is a place for people with his shared Western background,"" Wagner said. 
MSNBC's Joy Reid, who questioned whether Trump was actually shot with a bullet at his rally on Saturday, argued on Wednesday that President Biden getting COVID-19 and recovering was ""exactly the same thing"" as Trump surviving an assassination attempt.
""This current President of the United States is 81 years old and has COVID, should he be fine in a couple of days, doesn't that convey exactly the same thing? That he’s strong enough – older than Trump – to have gotten something that used to really be fatal to people his age. So, if he does fine out of it and comes back and is able to do rallies, isn't that exactly the same?"" Reid asked.

Reid also seemed to entertain far-left theories casting doubt on the former president's injuries.
""These two men are both elderly. Donald Trump is an elderly man who, for whatever reason, was given nine seconds to take an iconic photo op during an active shooter situation. Weird situation, we'll figure that out one day,"" Reid said. 
The liberal host also suggested Trump was facing the ""consequences"" of his own ""dangerous"" rhetoric.
""The idea of political violence that we've been nursing really since then, is so dangerous,"" she said. ""It's so dangerous that you cannot avoid the consequences of it, even if you're one of the people promoting it.""

MSNBC host Michael Steele was similarly accused of pushing ""conspiracy theories"" this week in questioning whether Trump's ear was hit by a bullet.
""A person lost their life, two have been severely injured, and yet we’ve not received a medical report from the hospital, nor have we received a medical report from the campaign, or from the Trump organization about the extent of the damage to his ear,"" Steele said.
""If he was shot by a high-caliber bullet, there should probably be very little ear there,"" he continued. ""And so, we’d like to know that. Is there cosmetic surgery involved? What is the prognosis for recovery? Were there stitches? What is the extent and nature of the damage to his ear? Was it caused by a bullet, as opposed to, as some reports … saying it was actually shards of glass from the teleprompter?""
Like her colleague Alex Wagner, MSNBC host Rachel Maddow had her own unusual take on JD Vance. Maddow drew a connection between the senator's interest in ""The Lord of the Rings"" to the ""far-right.""
""‘Lord of the Rings’ is a sort of favorite cosmos for naming things and cultural references for a lot of far-right and alt-right figures, both in Europe and the United States. Peter Thiel names all these things after Tolkien figures in places like his company Palantir, for example,"" Maddow said.

""Like his mentor, like Peter Thiel, who had given him all his jobs in the world, Mr. Vance also when he founded his own venture capital firm with help from Peter Thiel, named it after a Lord of the Rings thing,"" Maddow said. ""He called it Narya, N-A-R-Y-A, which you can remember because it’s Aryan, but you move the n to the front,"" she continued.

""Apparently, that word has something to do with elves and rings from the Lord of the Rings series, I don’t know.""
At another point this week, MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace became visibly frustrated over the way Biden had answered a question from NBC's Lester Holt about ""bullseye"" rhetoric directed at Trump.
""There was one way to answer that question, and it was, ‘Lester, should I use the word bullseye or crosshair? No, but the FBI director that Donald Trump selected, his name is Christopher Wray, and he testified under oath before Congress that the greatest threat to this country is no longer foreign terrorism. It's domestic violent extremism,'"" Wallace said, growing angry as she spoke.
""Inside that threat, the biggest bucket by far is right-wing domestic violent extremism, so go talk to them,"" she snapped while pointing her finger.

The eyebrow-raising comments came as the liberal network found itself at the center of other controversies this week.
A New York Times report revealed MSNBC was projecting a live feed of the GOP convention as a background for several of its primetime shows, rather than reporting live from the event. MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, Nicolle Wallace, Jen Psaki, Joy Reid and other MSNBC anchors were not inside the convention hall or even in the same city, according to the report.
An MSNBC spokesman told the Times that at ""the top of every broadcast, hosts identify themselves as being in New York or at MSNBC headquarters."" But critics say the live video feed of a bustling convention behind them sends a different impression to viewers tuning in throughout the night.
Still, the move drew mockery from CNN anchor Jake Tapper and others this week.
""We are here live, as opposed to some other networks that just have a big LED, who shall remain nameless,"" Tapper said during an interview with Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio.
The network also drew backlash from its own anchors after it pulled ""Morning Joe"" off the air on Monday in the aftermath of the assassination attempt against Trump two days prior.

FOX_8,This is how we get fentanyl off our streets,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/how-we-get-fentanyl-off-our-streets,2024-07-20 20:01:02.705390,opinion,"Fox News' Bryan Llenas on families gathering in New York to bring greater awareness to fentanyl poisoning
America is facing a crisis that is forcing families to grapple with the heartbreaking effects of addiction. Cartels are smuggling fentanyl – a synthetic opioid – into our country and flooding communities from coast to coast with the deadly drug. 
Last year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents stopped 27,023 pounds of fentanyl from entering our country. That same year, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) seized more than 77 million fentanyl pills and nearly 12,000 pounds of fentanyl powder.
To put that into perspective, that is enough fentanyl to kill every single American.

A deadly dose of fentanyl is considered to be two milligrams, roughly equal to 10-15 grains of table salt or the amount that would fit on the point of a sharpened pencil. According to the DEA, fentanyl is 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine.
DRUG OVERDOSES SURGE IN SOME STATES: 5 TAKEAWAYS ON NUMBERS THAT 'ARE PEOPLE'S LIVES,' EXPERT SAYS
Tennessee is now ranked fourth in the nation for the highest number of overdose deaths caused by synthetic opioids, and nearly 80% of drug overdose deaths in Virginia involve fentanyl. Fentanyl is killing Americans at record-high rates. This is a crisis that has touched every corner of our country. 
Before coming to Congress, one of us served as a U.S. attorney, the other as a federal law enforcement officer and CIA case officer. Our combined experience gives us critical insight into investigating and prosecuting drug dealers, as well as working narcotics trafficking cases and tracking cartels. 
We know well the harm that the criminal manufacturing of these drugs on a mass scale can bring to our communities, to our neighbors, and to their families. We also know that Congress must do more to prevent illicit substances – like fentanyl – from being sold on our streets.
VIRGINIA FIRST LADY, AG TEAM WITH RECOVERING ADDICT TO LAUNCH INITIATIVES TARGETING STATE'S FENTANYL CRISIS
That is why we are working together to crack down on narcotics traffickers who use illicit pill presses to manufacture counterfeit drugs. 
DEA laboratory testing indicates that 7 out of 10 counterfeit pills contain a potentially lethal dose of fentanyl. Counterfeits made in the United States typically use pill press machines that can easily be purchased online and – depending on size and capacity – can manufacture anywhere from 1,800 pills to more than one million pills per hour.
Many of the pill presses shipped to the United States come from China. The U.S. Treasury Department has imposed sanctions on numerous Chinese entities for allegedly distributing pill presses and other equipment used to manufacture illicit fentanyl in the United States. Recently, under ""Operation Artemis,"" CBP officers at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York seized 14 pill press machines in five separate shipments that arrived from China.
NY FAMILY LOSES DAUGHTER TO FENTANYL OVERDOSE AFTER TAKING 1 PILL
In the United States, pill press laws at the federal level are limited, and state laws are generally weak or nonexistent. Federal law currently prohibits the sale, possession, and use of unregistered pill presses. However, the registration process relies heavily on self-reporting, usually during the sale and transfer of machines. 
For instance, thousands of pill press machines have been sold through eBay, contributing to the current crisis. Current law also states that any person who possesses a pill press machine with the intent to sell shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not more than four years, a fine or both. We believe that the criminals who manufacture and traffic these deadly drugs should face clearer, harsher penalties.
CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER
For more than four years, we have led bipartisan legislation to make possession of a pill press mold with the intent to counterfeit schedule I or II substances a federal crime. Specifically, our Criminalizing Abused Substance Templates (CAST) Act would allow for criminals who possess a pill press and are planning to manufacture counterfeit pills – whether they have yet to do so or not – to be imprisoned for up to 20 years. 
By enacting this change, we would empower our law enforcement officers to crack down on these criminals and help save the lives of countless Americans.
While we may represent vastly different districts, we hear common stories – of Americans struggling with addiction, getting on the road to recovery, and of unimaginable grief. We’ve heard from too many heartbroken parents who have lost their children to an overdose.

In 2022, officials warned against ""rainbow fentanyl"" – fentanyl pills and powder that come in a variety of bright colors, shapes and sizes. The influx of these pills was an intentional effort by drug dealers and cartels to get American children and young adults hooked on opioids by making them look like candy. 
By punishing the criminals who use pill presses to make counterfeit drugs, we can take a momentous step forward in our effort to get fentanyl and other deadly drugs off our streets and out of our children’s hands. One death is one too many.

The Democrats seeking to remove President Joe Biden from the 2024 White House race promise that this is not a coup attempt by elites to thwart the will of their party’s primary voters, but boy, it sure looks like one.
It would be one thing if Democratic leadership en masse decided that Biden was no longer fit to serve, and with a single voice, called upon him to step down. But that is not what is happening here. The truth is, they are just worried he is going to lose the election to Donald Trump.
To avoid the metaphorical label ""coup,"" there would have to be near unanimity and a clear and obvious emergency. This looks more like a factional battle for power. And that sounds like a coup.
DEMOCRAT GODFATHERS MAKE BIDEN OFFER THEY HOPE HE CAN'T REFUSE
Biden has a right to be furious at his old boss, Barack Obama, and the sly, Machiavellian former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as they stab him in the back with the help of Hollywood celebrities like George Clooney, and seemingly every major liberal news outlet.

The president rightly insists that he has racked up 18 million votes and won every primary. Even though the people have spoken with a clarion voice, the elites are trying to take him down.
Where is the lie? 
The latest maneuver, if you are keeping track, is for major donors to withhold money not just from Biden’s campaign, but from down-ballot races too, should the old man in the White House refuse to step aside.
Let’s think about what this really means: The powerful Democrats who seem to approve this move are all but admitting that left-wing billionaires can simply buy the Democratic nomination, the will of the people be damned. 
Maybe I missed the memo, but I thought the Democrats were trying to save democracy from Donald Trump. Apparently, one must destroy democracy to save it. Quite a novel concept, indeed.
But not everybody is on board, which is why, at least thus far, the coup is failing, and making the party look utterly disunified and rudderless.
House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries gave a cryptic answer when asked if President Biden was the best nominee for the White House (Getty Images)
On Friday, current Speaker Hakeem Jeffries threw Biden a lifeline, assuring that he supports the president. So Biden has the head of ""The Squad,"" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, and the Congressional Black Caucus. Those are powerful, coup-blocking chess pieces.
By ridin' with Biden, these Democrats are taking the chance that he can still win. And while it may be a longshot, it is far from impossible. An overwhelming ground game in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin could still work, especially if states like Virginia turn out to be fools gold for the GOP.
It’s worth thinking about what would happen then, if a successful Biden owed his entire second term, or as much of it as he can endure, to the most far-left and radical wing of his party. It is not much of a stretch to say that one of our two major parties could wind up flat-out socialist.

The funny thing about coups is that when they fail they often leave the target more powerful than he was to begin with. Should Biden’s candidacy survive, he will be bathed in the light of defiant power.
There is less than a month to go before Democrats virtually, but permanently, are due to nominate Biden ahead of their convention. If he can hang on until then, he is in like Flynn.
It will take more than leaked conversations and a handful of moderate Democrat lawmakers calling on Biden to drop out for a new nominee to be anointed. Frankly, the insurrectionists's quiver is running on arrows.

Democratic voters, for better or worse, have chosen Joe Biden, and this effort by top party officials and billionaire donors to replace their choice may be running out of steam.
That is good news for Biden, and Republicans hope it is good news for Donald Trump. But if this election has shown us anything, it is that surprising twists and turns are to be expected. So buckle up, this thing is far from over.

Vice President Kamala Harris held a brief conference with the Democratic Party's top donors yesterday in a show of support for her running mate.
Harris spoke with approximately 300 major Democratic Party donors on Friday, telling them there was nothing to worry about within President Biden's campaign, despite the media kerfuffle.
""I will start by sharing something with all of you, something I believe in my heart of hearts. It is something I feel strongly you should all hear and should take with you when you leave, and tell your friends too,"" Harris told the donors, according to multiple reports.

""We know which candidate in this election puts the American people first: our President, Joe Biden,"" Harris said in support of her running mate.
Harris spoke to donors via video for approximately five minutes, championing the Biden administration and sharply criticizing former President Donald Trump's rhetoric at the Republican National Convention.
""Let me be clear: Trump’s convention this week was one big attempt to distract people,"" Harris reportedly told donors. ""He wants to distract attention away from his record and his Project 2025 plan. Can you believe they put it in writing? It is further empirical evidence that the stakes of this election couldn’t be higher.""

The call was intended to quell fears among party donors that backlash against Biden from within his party could prove disastrous for his campaign.
However, Harris did not take questions from the donors following her short address, causing some to wonder what the point of the communication was.
Additionally, the call came on the same day that nearly a dozen Democratic lawmakers voiced preference for Biden to drop out of the race.

FOX_11,Iran 'one to two weeks away' from weapons-grade nuclear material as US continues sanctions relief,https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-1-2-weeks-weapons-grade-nuclear-material-us-continues-sanctions-relief,2024-07-20 22:23:02.760435,politics,"Fox News correspondent David Spunt has the details from the Justice Department on 'The Story.'
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned on Friday that Iran could produce fissile nuclear material in ""one or two weeks"" as the State Department renews a sanctions waiver for Iraq to buy Iranian energy.
Critics were quick to blame the Biden administration for enabling Iran to pursue nuclear weapons by allowing the rogue nation to sell its oil. Biden reversed many of former President Trump's tough sanctions against Tehran.
""What's breathtaking is the complete lack of self-awareness that it was his own maximum deference policy that brought us to this moment, and worse, that his solution is to double down on the failed appeasement strategy,"" Rich Goldberg, senior advisor at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies and former Trump administration NSC official, told Fox News Digital.
""Rather than snapping back the U.N. sanctions and testing maximum pressure, the administration just extended a sanctions waiver and is conducting indirect negotiations via Oman,"" Goldberg lamented. 
Blinken spoke this week at the annual Aspen Security Forum in Colorado, addressing Iran's march toward a nuclear weapon and admitting that ""instead of being at least a year away from having the breakout capacity of producing fissile material for a nuclear weapon, (Iran) is now probably one or two weeks away from doing that."" 
IRAN'S ASSASSINATION PLOT AGAINST TRUMP LATEST ATTEMPT TO KILL AMERICANS ON US SOIL
Blinken blamed the collapse of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – commonly known as the Iran Nuclear Deal – for Iran’s accelerated development. He stressed that the U.S. has not seen any evidence to suggest Iran already has a nuclear weapon, Barrons reported. 
Iran’s acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri claimed that his country remained committed to the JCPOA, insisting that ""America has not yet been able to return"" to the deal and that Iran seeks a return to the 2015 deal.

""We are not looking for a new agreement,"" Bagheri told CNN earlier this week. ""Neither I nor anyone else in Iran has not talked and will not talk about a new agreement. We have an agreement (signed) in 2015.""
Iran continues to receive sanctions relief through waivers that the U.S. has issued since the Trump administration in 2018, allowing Iraq to import energy from Iran for 120 days at a stretch. The latest renewal occurred on July 11 as Iraq suffered widespread power outages due to the unbearable heat overloading power grids across the country, MEHR News Agency reported.

‘’We have renewed this waiver for the 22nd time, and it is about the department permitting Iraq to purchase Iranian electricity while Iraq continues to develop its domestic generation capacity,’’ US State Department Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel said at a press briefing.
‘’It is a waiver authority that allows the purchase of electricity over a certain period of time, in this case, 120 days, so it's permission for an activity over a period of time,’’ Patel told Iraqi news outlet Rudaw.

‘’We have, over the past decade, seen some measurable steps of Iraq weaning off Iranian electricity,’’ Patel added. ""Currently, we anticipate that they are relying on Iran for about 25% of their electricity. A number of years ago, that number was 40%.""
Blinken reiterated this point, saying that Iraq has doubled its domestic output, but many American politicians remain concerned that Iran benefits from these waivers and have used the funds to help continue developing their nuclear weapons program. 
BIDEN LEANS ON FOREIGN POLICY TO JUSTIFY REMAINING DEMOCRAT NOMINEE: HERE'S WHAT HE'S DONE
The Biden administration insists that the funds remain out of reach for the Iranian government, instead funneling through third-party ""restricted accounts"" that can only purchase food, medicine, medical devices, agricultural product and other non-sanctionable transactions.
Critics, however, argue that it displaces funding requirements for Iran and frees up the country’s spending so that money it would have otherwise put towards those purchase now goes toward funding its proxy groups and developing nuclear weapons.

""Let's be honest with the American people and understand that Hamas knows, and Iran knows they're moving money around as we speak, because they know $6 billion is going to be released. That's the reality,"" Nikki Haley said last year when news broke that the State Department had agreed to release funds in exchange for U.S. prisoners in September. 
Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies with a focus on Iranian security and political issues, told Fox News Digital that the Biden administration has remained on ""auto-pilot"" and pursued ""short-sighted"" policies when it comes to Iran, at their own peril.

""With stories about Iran-backed plots to kill the former president and reports of weaponization related work in Tehran, the last thing Washington should be green-lighting is yet another waiver extension that permits the Islamic Republic to free up revenues to continue to underwrite more global terror and domestic nuclear expansion,"" Taleblu said. ""It’s one thing to see the need to help wean Baghdad off of Tehran and Iranian electricity and energy, but it’s another to continue to use this as a crutch for a better policy towards both Iraq and Iran.""

And while some adults love to speak contemptuously of ""those kids and their phones,"" put any group of people in a large room for a meeting and you'll have the same result.
STATE LAWMAKERS PUSH FOR BAN ON PHONES IN SCHOOLS
Banning phones is the idea of the moment among politicians, educators and education advocates. For example, California Gov. Gavin Newsom pledges he will sign a smartphone ban into law this summer. The Los Angeles Unified School District Board just voted to ban phones starting in January. 
LAUSD will prohibit students from using their phones during school hours, including nutrition and lunch. Each school will decide how to implement the phone ban. 
The reasons for the ban are obvious: phones are absolutely a distraction in the classroom, and social media cause conflict between students.
VIRGINIA GOV. YOUNGKIN RESTRICTS CELLPHONE USE IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS
Recently, one of the deans at our school, after breaking up another fight, shook his head and said, ""Most of these damn things are caused by posts on social media."" Two girls get into a social media war, their boyfriends each defend their girl out of a combustible mix of chivalry and stupidity, and they end up in a fight. 
Other conflicts are born of traditional bullying, but now broadcast to a much wider audience. 
However, most school districts’ internet already blocks social media sites such as Instagram and TikTok, as well as various websites. And, ban or no, social media wars can and will go on outside of school hours. 
SURGEON GENERAL’S ADVISORY ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH COMES AMID 'REAL-TIME EXPERIMENT'
Parents are already speaking out against the phone ban – phones allow them to coordinate pickups and scheduling and to communicate with their kids in an emergency. 
Parents are accustomed to being able to get messages to their kids whenever they want – if phones are taken away, schools will have to deal with an influx of calls from parents, at least until parents become accustomed to the ban. Teachers will have to live with students being yanked out of class to take calls and classes being interrupted with hand-delivered messages from the school office. 
The larger problem is how to enforce a ban. For some students, taking away their phone is a grievous act they tenaciously resist. It's not uncommon for students to walk into a class sixth period buzzing about a big blowup that happened in fifth when a teacher tried to take away a student's phone. Nor is it not unheard of for a teacher to have a physical altercation with a student over a phone.

Moreover, students’ phone-based activities and distractions have already been migrating to their Apple Watches to evade our class rules limiting phones, a trend a ban will accelerate. From a teacher's perspective, the watches are much more difficult to police than the phones.
Removing phones is winding back the clock on technological progress, and such attempts usually fail, particularly when it concerns a convenience all of us, including teachers, appreciate.
In looking for solutions to problems in our schools, there's an unfortunate tendency to look for specific villains to blame – video games, smartphones, social media, and whatever else we lament about ""kids today"" – and to see addressing these as a silver bullet.

If enforcing the ban is not a continual battle, an endless cat-and-mouse game, or a lot of extra work for already overworked teachers, I certainly wouldn't miss having to deal with phones in class. But even if we could get them to disappear, it’s not going to change things that much.
I hope I'm wrong, but my guess is that phone bans will prove to be more trouble than they're worth.

In the face of mounting numbers of Democrats calling on him to step down for fear he'll lose to Trump, Biden has repeatedly insisted he is staying in the race. Yet Warren, sounding like reportedly skeptical former Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier this month, appeared to give Biden yet another off-ramp.

MSNBC played a clip of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., the far-left lawmaker who's remained publicly loyal to Biden, saying there was no ""consensus"" around Harris being Biden's replacement if the movement to dump the president from the ticket is successful. 
Warren repeated herself when asked if she'd heard the same as Ocasio-Cortez.
""Joe Biden is our nominee. As I said before, he has a really big decision to make,"" she said. ""But what gives me a lot of hope right now is that if President Biden decides to step back, we have Vice President Kamala Harris who is ready to step up, to unite the party, to take on Donald Trump, and to win in November.

Warren pointed to Harris' prosecutor background as proof she would be a great candidate against ""a convicted felon,"" referring to Trump's 34 criminal convictions for falsifying business records last month.

FOX_16,Jewish groups call for action against radical anti-Israel organization: 'openly embraces Hamas',https://www.foxnews.com/world/jewish-groups-call-for-action-against-radical-anti-israel-organization-openly-embraces-hamas,2024-07-21 00:00:02.666477,world,"Anti-Israel protesters were heard chanting, ""Long live intifada"" at a demonstration in New York outside the Nova Music Festival Exhibition. (via FNTV)
Within Our Lifetime (WOL), a radical anti-Israel group based in New York City, is among numerous organizations making headlines for open support of terrorist groups in the aftermath of Hamas’ Oct. 7 terror attacks. 
WOL’s online messaging outlines the radical beliefs uniting its members since the group’s founding in 2015. ""We are anti-zionists (sic),"" WOL states, elaborating that the ""liberation of Palestine requires the abolition of zionism (sic).""  WOL also supports resistance to ""the violence of the U.S. empire at home and abroad,"" advocates for ""Palestinians’ right to return to their homeland in all of historic Palestine from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea,"" and believes Palestinians have the right to ""resist the zionist (sic) occupation by any means necessary."" 
While WOL stridently believes that it is anti-Zionist and not antisemitic, experts say that the group’s actions have harmed and endangered Jews.
""WOL Palestine has, for years, engaged in what amounts to a conspiracy to deprive Jewish people of their civil rights through acts of violence and intimidation,"" with numerous WOL members and supporters being ""convicted of hate crime attacks against Jewish New Yorkers,"" Brooke Goldstein, a human rights attorney and founder and executive director of The Lawfare Project, told Fox News Digital.
ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS ARRESTED TRYING TO DISRUPT BIDEN’S MEGABUCKS FUNDRAISER 
""Long Live Oct 7th"" banner (FNTV)
Despite ""a significant escalation of aggression towards Jews by WOL Palestine and its adherents"" in the aftermath of Oct. 7, Goldstein lamented that ""we see no action by law enforcement or prosecutors. Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg treats WOL Palestine’s criminal acts as misdemeanor property crimes not worthy of pursuing, instead of the terroristic activity it is."" 
In an April interview with Fox News Digital, former White House Middle East Envoy Jason Greenblatt discussed misinformation and hate emanating from two protests promoted by WOL at synagogues in Teaneck, New Jersey.
On Mar. 10, WOL urged followers to assemble in protest of an alleged auction of ""occupied Palestinian land"" at Teaneck’s Keter Torah Congregation. ""They lied,"" Greenblatt said, ""and they’re claiming that ‘us rich Jews’ are buying stolen Palestinian land."" As media outlets like the Jerusalem Post reported, the synagogue was hosting an information session about purchasing Israeli real estate. Several pro-Palestinian groups attended the protest, during which two protesters were arrested for spray-painting passing cars.
On April 1, WOL called for followers to join their protest against Israeli organization ZAKA at Teaneck’s Bnai Yeshurun synagogue. Greenblatt explained that Israeli emergency response organization ZAKA provides a ""kindness that you can’t even repay"" by trying ""to bury the little pieces of the Jewish bodies that were the targets of this Hamas terrorism."" WOL alleged that ZAKA has put forward ""false claims and fabricated evidence"" that have ""fueled the Gaza genocide."" 
While protesting against ZAKA, ADL’s Center on Extremism team told Fox News Digital that WOL founder Nerdeen Kiswani wore a pin bearing the face of Abu Obaida, Hamas’ spokesman.
Oren Segal, Vice President of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, told Fox News Digital that WOL has demonstrated ""very explicit support for violence against Israeli civilians in support of terrorist organizations like Hamas, Hezbollah, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), and the Houthis at some of the nearly 100 anti-Israel rallies they have sponsored around New York City since Oct. 7."" Hamas, Hezbollah and PFLP are listed by the U.S. as foreign terrorist organizations.

The group is ""really in your face, really blatant,"" Segal said. He added that ""groups that tend to legitimize terror organizations, glorify violence, and otherwise create an atmosphere where antisemitism is normalized . . . those are the characteristics of a movement that leads to violence.""

Following synagogue protests, WOL was among the outside agitators participating in and encouraging university encampment protests throughout New York City. In a treatise about their role in the encampments, WOL urged escalation. ""We have a choice in what we prioritize and a responsibility to adapt to meet the moment,"" WOL told followers. ""We can choose to prioritize de-escalation trainings, or we can choose to prioritize escalation trainings. We can choose to learn how to build effective barricades, how to link arms most effectively to resist police attacks, or what type of expanding foam works best on the kind of doorknobs present in our universities. This is not rhetoric — this is an urgent need."" 
The escalation WOL called for was on display at the Brooklyn Museum on May 31. After the museum refused to comply with WOL’s demands that it disclose and divest from any financial ties to Israel, protesters swarmed outside the museum. Some protesters entered the lobby. NBC News reported that protesters ""physically and verbally assaulted and harassed"" museum staff and damaged art installations. Ultimately, Kiswani and 33 other protesters were arrested by the NYPD. 
Taylor Maatman, the Brooklyn Museum’s Director of Public Relations and Communications, did not answer questions about the harm caused during protests but told Fox News Digital that the museum was ""dismayed by any violence that occurred.""

On June 7, WOL Tweeted a warning to the Brooklyn Museum: ""If you take peace from the people, we take peace from you."" The Tweet was marked with the inverted red triangle Hamas uses to identify military targets. 
On June 12, four leaders of the Brooklyn Museum awoke to red paint sprayed across their homes, including large inverted red triangles. Vandals left a sign at the home of the museum’s Jewish director, calling her a ""White Supremacist Zionist."" In response to inquiries about the vandalism, Maatman stated that ""for two centuries, the Brooklyn Museum has worked to foster mutual understanding through art and culture,"" and ""violence and vandalism have no place in that discourse.""
New York City Mayor Eric Adams said of the vandalism that it was ""not peaceful protest or free speech,"" adding that the crime was ""overt, unacceptable antisemitism.""
WOL has not taken explicit responsibility for the vandalism. Kiswani has Tweeted about it, explaining that ""execs were targeted for unleashing police violence on Palestine protests"" and calling the vandalism ""pretty peaceful, compared to what the Brooklyn museum did to peaceful protesters."" 
WOL has not responded to questions from Fox News Digital about responsibility for the aforementioned incident, its support for terror groups, or the misinformation it espouses. It also did not answer questions about the antisemitism inherent in many of its protests, including a June 5 protest against Hillel, an institution that provides Jewish students with religious resources on campus. On X, WOL said that Hillel ""stands with genocide.""
ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS LIGHT FLARES BY NYC EXHIBIT FOR OCT 7 MUSIC FESTIVAL VICTIMS: ‘LONG LIVE THE INTIFADA’
Escalation in WOL’s protests continued on June 10, when the organization hosted a ""Day of Rage"" at a New York City exhibit about the Nova Music Festival, where 370 innocents were killed and 44 were taken hostage on Oct. 7. WOL protesters explained on X that they had ""flooded the streets, took over the trains, and shut down [the] Zionist propaganda exhibit."" 
Rabbi Moshe Hauer, Executive Vice President of the Orthodox Union, told Fox News Digital that the ""horrific"" Nova protest occurred within walking distance of his office. ""We have to tell our employees when stuff like that is happening that they can’t come in, that we advise them not to come."" Hauer elaborated, ""that protest was dangerous. It was dangerous for Jews to be there."" 
NYPD SEEKING ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTER WHO THREATENED ZIONISTS ON NYC SUBWAY: 'THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO GET OUT!'
En route to the exhibit, protesters in the 14th Street-Union Square subway station issued a call-and-response chant, telling riders, ""Raise your hand if you’re a Zionist . . . this is your chance to get out."" At the event itself, protesters shouted ""long live the intifada,"" and ""Israel go to hell."" One protester waved a Hezbollah flag while another carried a banner reading ""Long Live Oct. 7."" WOL Tweeted video from the Nova protest showing a sign stating that ""Zionists are not Jews & not humans.""
Segal said that the event and signage were troubling. ""When you start dehumanizing people, whether you’re calling them Zionists or whether you’re more explicitly calling them Jews, that’s not just antisemitic, that’s dangerous."" Citing ADL studies, Segal said that ""most American Jews identify with the State of Israel and believe it has the right to exist. When you start talking about Zionists as your enemies, that includes a whole bunch of Jews.""

WOL’s Nova protest garnered condemnation from White House spokesperson Andrew Bates. The Times of Israel reported that Bates called protesters’ conduct ""outrageous and heartbreaking,"" adding that ""profane banners of terrorist organizations should not be flown anywhere, especially not on American streets.""
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Tweeted on June 11 that the ""callousness, dehumanization, and targeting of Jews on display at last night’s protest outside the Nova Festival exhibit was atrocious antisemitism,"" and ""has no place in our city nor any broader movement.""
WOL subsequently issued a statement defending their protest of the Nova exhibit. It contains the claim, debunked in the media, that Israel itself was ""burning down cars with the missile strikes"" at the Nova festival. Calling the music festival a ""rave next to a concentration camp,"" WOL implied that Israel keeps Palestinians in Gaza as a form of ethnic cleansing. In closing, WOL stated that it will ""not condemn October 7th"" or the ""people’s resistance forces,"" and urged supporters to ""escalate – both in words and in action.""
WOL protests continue apace. A June 29 protest of a Biden fundraiser, in which WOL urged followers to ""confront genocide Joe,"" resulted in 38 arrests. The New York Post reported that a July 4 WOL protest throughout New York City led the NYPD to handcuff 37 individuals. In Washington Square Park, where WOL members including Kiswani led protesters in chants, two protesters burned the American flag.
Fox News Digital reached out to Bates and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer for comment about efforts to protect the institutions and people endangered by WOL protests. Fox News Digital received no response.
Westchester People’s Action Coalition (WESPAC) Foundation, which fundraises for WOL according to the Jerusalem Post, did not respond to inquiries from Fox News Digital about whether it will continue funding WOL, given its support of terrorism and harmful protests.

Fox News Digital also reached out to Donorbox, which WOL claims to use to raise funds. A Donorbox employee responded that ""Within Our Lifetime does not have an active fundraising account with Donorbox."" 
WOL also purports to use GPay to fundraise. A Google spokesperson told Fox News Digital that ""merchants using the Google Pay API must follow the Google Pay API Terms of Services, including the acceptable use policy. When we discover violations, we take action against them, which may include removing Google Pay as a payment option."" 
Neither the FBI nor the Department of Justice answered specific questions about efforts to monitor or sanction WOL’s activities. In response to questions about the limits of peaceful protest and endangerment of targeted individuals, the NYPD told Fox News Digital that it will ""never tolerate violence or property damage"" and is ""ready and available to respond to protests and will ensure everyone is able to peacefully exercise their first amendment rights.""

Leaders protecting Jewish Americans against an onslaught of antisemitism that has followed in the wake of Oct. 7 expressed ongoing concern about WOL. According to Hauer, ""the movement which we are seeing is not attacking just Jews in Jewish communities. They have a stated intent to impact the country, to change the country, even sometimes expressed as to destroy the country.""
As Goldstein added, ""there is no doubt that WOL Palestine promotes — and commits acts of — violence and extremism, and openly embraces Hamas, a government-designated foreign terrorist organization. But without a thorough investigation by federal authorities into the connections between WOL, Hamas, and other terror groups, we cannot know for certainty whether WOL is a domestic terrorist organization or the cell of a foreign one,"" Goldstein added ""Sanctioning WOL as a terrorist organization would be an important action for the government to take, but even more crucial is prosecuting the group for its conspiracy to commit antisemitic hate crimes and to deprive Jewish citizens of their civil rights.""

FOX_17,Israel strikes Iran-backed Houthis after Tehran proxy attacked Jewish state: 'Significance is clear',https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-strikes-iran-backed-houthis-after-tehran-proxy-attacked-jewish-state-significance-clear,2024-07-21 02:00:02.886445,world,"At least one person and several others were reportedly killed in the Houthi drone attack. Fox News' Trey Yingst reports the latest on the damage and casualties.
JERUSALEM - Israel’s air force on Saturday launched surgical strikes against the Islamic Republic of Iran-sponsored Houthi terrorist regime in Yemen.
According to an Israel Defense Forces statement, ""A short while ago, IDF fighter jets struck military targets of the Houthi terrorist regime in the area of the Al Hudaydah Port in Yemen in response to the hundreds of attacks carried out against the State of Israel in recent months.""
The IDF added, ""There are no changes in the Home Front Command defensive guidelines. In the case of a change to the guidelines, we will update the public accordingly.""
On Friday, the Houthi movement fired a lethal drone into Tel Aviv, resulting in the death of an Israeli and at least 10 injured and severe damage to buildings. The strike took place near the U.S. consulate building in Tel Aviv.

(Photo by -/Ansarullah Media Center/AFP via Getty Images) 
Israel's Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said after the strikes in Yemen: ""The fire that is currently burning in Yemen, is seen across the Middle East. The first time that the Houthis harmed an Israeli citizen, we struck them. And we will do this in any place where it may be required.""
He added, ""I have just left the IAF [Israeli Air Force] Command Center where I met with the Prime Minister, IDF Chief of the General Staff and the Air Force Commander and closely monitored the strike conducted by IAF aircraft on the Hodeidah Port [in Yemen], 2,000 kilometers from the State of Israel."" Gallant said ""the significance is clear"" of the fire in Yemen is important to show Israel’s enemies what they can face.
Gallant continued ""The Houthis attacked us over 200 times. The first time that they harmed an Israeli citizen, we struck them. And we will do this in any place where it may be required. The blood of Israeli citizens has a price. This has been made clear in Lebanon, in Gaza, in Yemen, and in other places. If they will dare to attack us, the result will be identical.""

The reference to Lebanon is directed at the Hezbollah terrorist regime that is the de facto ruler over Lebanon.
A Houthi spokesperson said via a public Telegram board message that Israeli airstrikes targeted civilian facilities, oil tanks and a power station in al-Hudaydah.
Houthi-linked media reported that several people were killed, according to Iran International. A Houthi official told the pro-Hezbollah news outlet in Lebanon, Al Mayadeen, that the Houthi regime will retaliate against Israel for the IDF strikes in Lebanon. The U.S.-designated terrorist entity, Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthi regime and the Islamic Republic of Iran form the anti-American and anti-Israel ""axis of resistance.""
Iran International noted the IDF strikes on Saturday hit oil refining facilities in the Hodeidah port, according to sources cited by Al-Masirah TV, the main television news outlet run by the Houthi movement.

The Saudi Arabia-owned Al Arabiya reported that 12 Israeli aircraft, including an F35, attacked the port of Hodeidah.
The Friday drone attack unsettled the Israeli public because the country’s aerial defense failed to intercept the lethal projectile, possibly because of human error. Tel Aviv is the second-largest city in the Jewish state. Israel’s aerial assault in Yemen appears to be the first-ever IDF attack on the Arab country that has been ravaged by the Houthi movement.
Earlier on Saturday, Israel’s Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant held a meeting to approve operational plans together with the IDF Chief of the General Staff, Director General of the Ministry of Defense, IAF Commander, Head of the Operations Directorate, Head of the Intelligence Directorate, Head of the Strategic Affairs Directorate, Military Secretary to the Minister of Defense, and Head of the Policy and POL-MIL Bureau.

Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said in a statement: ""I held an operational situation assessment this morning to review the steps required to strengthen our defense arrays in light of events overnight, as well as the intelligence and operational activities required against those responsible for the attack,"" 
He added, ""The year 2024 is marked by war. We must be prepared for every scenario and every arena.""

Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces, said an ""error"" had occurred on Friday. ""We are investigating the entire chain,"" he said.
""We will continue to do everything we can to protect Israel’s people and borders,"" Hagari said. ""Iran is funding, arming and directing its terror proxies in their attacks on Israel and the wider world. We will not allow Iran and its proxies to terrorize our civilians."" 
A National Security Council spokesperson told Fox News that the U.S. was not involved in the strikes. ""We’ve been in regular and ongoing contact with the Israelis following the strike in Tel Aviv that killed an Israeli civilian on Friday morning. We fully recognize and acknowledge Israel’s right to self-defense. The United States was not involved in today’s strikes in Yemen, and we did not coordinate or assist Israel with the strikes.  We refer you to the Israelis for more information.""
The slogan of the Houthis is: ""Allah is great, death to America, death to Israel, curse the Jews, victory to Islam.""

The paper's National Security reporter John Hudson authored a piece detailing how Sen.

The piece seemed to galvanize conservative support for Vance, at least on X.

Hudson’s article described how, as a senator, Vance became ""known in the most powerful offices of the State Department as the single biggest obstacle to confirming career ambassadors in the Senate.""
The reporter explained how Vance would go about holding up these diplomats in their appointments, stating that he would ask them to fill out a ""a questionnaire on hot-button social issues about gay and lesbian rights, gender transition care and hiring practices related to diversity, equity and inclusion."" 
Many of those who revealed their left-wing bent in their answers to this questionnaire were held up for ""more than a year"" in attaining their positions at the State Department. 
Hudson stated that his outlet obtained a copy of this questionnaire, and shared some of the specific questions that were featured on it. 
He wrote that it ""asked would-be ambassadors if they would increase the number of ‘gender-neutral bathrooms’ in U.S. embassies, boost resources for ‘gender dysphoria and gender transition care’ and raise the ‘Progress flag’ during ‘regional Pride celebrations.’""
The reporter noted that Vance’s office did not respond to their request for comment, though the vice-presidential nominee did provide a sarcastic remark on social media. 
""They got me,"" Vance wrote on X Saturday afternoon.

Social media users were surprised by a new column from ""The Hill"" floating former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton as the replacement for President Biden’s 2024 candidacy.
The outlet’s opinion contributor, Pablo O’Hana authored a piece on Saturday titled, ""Ready for Round 2: Why we Need Hillary more than ever."" It argued that the former U.S. Secretary of State, who already lost the presidency to former President Trump in 2016, is the most suitable person to replace Biden as calls for him to suspend his re-election camp grow.
The piece turned heads on social media, with people like senior Trump advisor Jason Miller theorizing that there must be some weight behind this claim. ""SHE’S RUNNING!!!"" he declared.

In the column, O’Hana wrote, ""The strongest argument against replacing President Joe Biden as the 2024 Democratic nominee is the notion that no suitable successor exists. But there is, and not just a good one but one of the most qualified people ever to run for the office: Hillary Rodham Clinton.""
He even asserted that Clinton is ""perhaps the mightiest of all"" alternatives to Biden, arguing that she is ""younger than both Biden and Trump,"" has ""an unparalleled resume and an unmatched depth of experience,"" and is a strong advocate ""for children’s rights and health care.""
The author even went so far as to say that there are ""millions"" of voters who regret not voting for her in 2016 and want a do-over. 
""These swing-back voters are crucial to winning; Clinton can turn past regrets into proactive support by being a powerful reminder of the stakes of straying in 2024.""
O’Hana concluded his piece, declaring, ""The Democrats have a seasoned, savvy and adaptable candidate in Hillary Clinton. Without the burden of incumbency, she can run on a platform of stability, restoration and progress, with the credibility of her lifetime in public service and proven leadership. In her candidacy, we might just find our best chance to retain the White House and transcend the gladiatorial spectacle of politics.""

The piece got some attention on X. In his post, Miller added, ""These opinion pieces don’t happen organically - Crooked is on the move!!!""
Conservative commentator Alex Sheppard remarked on the piece, stating, ""If so, this is great news for Trump. She is the least likable politician of all time.""
Former cop and law enforcement consultant Deon Joseph replied to Miller’s post, stating, ""Oh hell no. Definitely voting for Trump Now.""

Chinese authorities say at least 11 people have died and 30 are missing in the partial collapse of a highway bridge in the northwest of the country following heavy storms and flooding. A similar number are missing in the southwest after dozens of houses were destroyed by storms.
The official Xinhua News Agency said five vehicles that fell off the bridge have been recovered after the structure in Shaanxi province crumbled at around 8:40 p.m. Friday. A photo released by Xinhua showed a section of the bridge snapped and folded down at almost a 90-degree angle into the rushing brown water below.

It said rescue operations were still underway Saturday in the province's Zhashui county, with some 20 cars and 30 people still missing.
In Sichuan province to the southwest, an estimated 30 people were missing and around 40 houses wrecked in flooding and storms, Xinhua reported. It said roads, bridges and communication networks in hardest hit Hanyuan county had been damaged or knocked out and that rescue teams had been working since before dawn to restore communications and transport connections.

As its economy boomed over recent decades, China built a huge network of highways, high-speed railways and airports, most of which have helped fuel further growth.
However, a dramatic decline in that economic expansion, the poor-quality infrastructure, poor safety supervision and a desire to cut corners by industries looking to save money have led to a steady stream of deadly accidents.

China's western and southwestern provinces are particularly prone to flooding and landslides due to their mountainous landscapes and the powerful rivers that run through them. Mining, tourism and rising urbanization have also disturbed a precarious balance with the natural environment that had been sustained over thousands of years.
Shaanxi is best known as one of the fulcrums of Chinese civilization, from which emerged the first emperor, Qinshi Huangdi, who left the famed terracotta army as his legacy outside the capital Xi'an as part of a vast tomb complex that attracts massive numbers of visitors each year."
FOX_22,1 in 3 Democrats believe Trump faked assassination attempt. I talked to one of them,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/1-3-democrats-believe-trump-faked-assassination-attempt-i-talked-one-them,2024-07-21 07:58:02.852153,opinion,"MSNBC's Michael Steele was accused of pushing ""conspiracy theories"" when he was questioned if former President Trump’s ear was actually hit by a high-caliber bullet.
According to some polls, one in three Democrats believe that Donald Trump faked his own assassination attempt. When I read that, I thought, could this possibly be true? But this weekend on my drive home to West Virginia from the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, I got the theory first hand. And it's a fascinating doozy.
Station Square Ristorante, just off of I-80 in Liberty, Ohio, is an absolute gem. Ottavio and Bridget Musumeci have somehow managed to create a legitimate fine-dining experience attached to the Super 8 motel. And no, I’m not kidding. In the wood-paneled bar, as I ordered oysters and antipasto for a late lunch, I met Mark, originally from northern New Jersey, which his accent revealed before he did. And Mark, well, he had some very interesting things to say.
MSNBC BRINGS THE CRAZY TO COVERAGE OF TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT
As is my way, I turned the conversation to politics and the assassination came up.
""That whole thing was a setup,"" Mark told me.
Station Square Ristorante in Liberty, Ohio, serves up delicious Italian food no matter what you think of Donald Trump. 
Before I could even respond, John, the bartender, who I would learn doesn’t like Trump or Biden, said, ""Nah, two people are dead. No way."" 
Mark’s response was, ""this is Donald Trump, he’s capable of anything.""
So I dug in a bit. How did they get the kid to do it? Mark was ready with answers. They paid off the family, or maybe told him he’d get off with just a few years in jail, he suggested.

""And the death of Corey Comperatore?"" I asked, referring to the retired fire chief who died shielding his family from the assassin's bullets.
""Donald Trump doesn’t care if his supporters die,"" Mark shot back, quite certain of himself.
You should know that Mark did not come off as some kind of lunatic. A bit prone to conspiracy theories maybe, but by no means crazy. So how could he believe all this with no evidence whatsoever?
He also had a good appetite, and as he wolfed down his caesar salad and veal piccante topped with mussels, he made it clear that it all came down to one simple precept: Trump is capable of anything.
I couldn’t help but think that the fact that Mark shares this kind of weird, irrational thinking with a third of his party faithful is because it is exactly what Democrats and their media allies have been feeding them. 
Why wouldn’t Mark, if he has a steady diet of liberal media, think that Trump is capable of killing innocent people? After all, they say he will deny women their rights, he won’t let black people vote, he will destroy democracy, and on and on and on. Mark is conditioned to believe that Trump is a unique evil and nothing should be put past him.

I said to Mark that if I thought one party, one side, or call it what you will, was willing to kill innocent Americans in this way, then it might be time to buy some guns. Then he said something that surprised me.
""It’s not the other side, it’s just Trump.""
It made little sense, but in a strange way, I was glad to hear him say it. At least Mark doesn’t blame his fellow citizens who support Trump. Not yet, anyway. Mark finished and left before I did, and we had a wholesome and sincere goodbye. After the door closed, I asked to John, ""What do you make of that?"" ""It’s crazy,"" he shrugged.
Yes it is, but here we are.

CNN_1,Prosecutors ask judge for trial date for man charged with attempting to kill Justice Kavanaugh in 2022,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/prosecutors-trial-date-man-attempt-kill-kavanaugh/index.html,2024-07-20 08:57:00,politics,"
            After two years, prosecutors and defense attorneys have not been able to reach a plea deal in the case against the man charged with attempting to kill Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and have asked the judge to set a trial date.
    

            Nicholas Roske, who allegedly flew to the Washington, DC, area and traveled to Kavanaugh’s home with a gun and burglary tools, has been behind bars since he was arrested in June 2022.
    

            He has pleaded not guilty in the case.
    

            Prosecutors wrote in a filing Friday that “as of this date, the parties have not been able to agree upon the terms for a pretrial resolution of this case” and requested a scheduling conference with the judge to set a trial date.
    

            CNN has reached out to an attorney for Roske for comment.
    

According to authorities, US deputy marshals posted outside of Kavanaugh’s house saw Roske exit a taxi outside the justice’s home. Law enforcement officials said Roske was arrested near the justice’s home after calling 911 at the behest of his sister. During that 14-minute call, Roske told the operator he needed “psychiatric help” and that he had a gun and other weapons.
    

            Roske confirmed to the 911 operator that he was planning to kill Kavanaugh and then kill himself because he “didn’t think I could get away with it.”

CNN_2,Blinken says Iran’s nuclear weapon breakout time is probably down to 1-2 weeks,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/blinken-nuclear-weapon-breakout-time/index.html,2024-07-20 08:21:00,politics,"
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday said that Iran’s breakout time – the amount of time needed to produce enough weapons grade material for a nuclear weapon – “is now probably one or two weeks” as Tehran has continued to develop its nuclear program.
    

            The assessment marks the shortest breakout time that US officials have ever referenced and comes as Iran has taken steps in recent months to boost its production of fissile material.
    

            “Where we are now is not in a good place,” the top US diplomat said at the Aspen Security Forum Friday.
    

            “Iran, because the nuclear agreement was thrown out, instead of being at least a year away from having the breakout capacity of producing fissile material for a nuclear weapon, is now probably one or two weeks away from doing that,” he said.
    

            “They haven’t produced a weapon itself, but that’s something of course that we track very, very carefully,” Blinken added.
    

            Blinken said the policy of the US is to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and that the administration would prefer to stop that from happening through diplomacy.
    

            Over a year ago a top US Defense Department official said that Iran could now produce “one bomb’s worth of fissile material” in “about 12 days.”
    

            The Biden administration engaged in more than a year of indirect negotiations with Iran aimed at reviving the Iran nuclear deal, from which the US withdrew in 2018 under the Trump administration.
    

            Those efforts collapsed in late 2022, as the US accused Iran of making “unreasonable” demands related to a probe by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a UN nuclear watchdog, into unexplained traces of uranium found at undisclosed Iranian sites. In the months that followed, the administration maintained that the Iran nuclear deal was “not on the agenda.”
    

            Iran’s new president has suggested they are open to engagement with the West. However, a senior State Department official told CNN that they no longer believe that there can be a return to the nuclear deal because Iran has engaged in too many escalatory acts in the years since talks broke down.
    

            “We’re in a very different world, a lot of time has elapsed, Iran has done a lot of things that make a return to JCPOA non-viable,” the official said.
    

            The State Department also said that there is no anticipation that the recent election in Iran will change the country’s behavior.
    

            “We have no expectations that this election will lead to a fundamental change in Iran’s direction or its policies,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said earlier this month. “At the end of the day, it’s not the president that has the ultimate say over the future of Iran’s policy; it is the supreme leader, and of course we have seen the direction that he has chosen to take Iran in.  Obviously, if the new president had the authority to make steps to curtail Iran’s nuclear program, to stop funding terrorism, to stop destabilizing activities in the region, those would be steps that we would welcome. But needless to say, we don’t have any expectations that that’s what’s likely to ensue.”

CNN_3,"Trump says he had ‘a very good phone call’ with Zelensky, discussed Russia-Ukraine war",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/donald-trump-zelensky-phone-call-2024/index.html,2024-07-20 08:03:00,politics,"
            Former President Donald Trump said he “had a very good phone call” with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday. 


            The call between the two leaders, who have had a complicated relationship, marks their first conversation since Trump left the White House and comes the day after he formally accepted the Republican Party’s nomination for president. It also comes amid concerns in Europe about what Trump’s policy toward the Russia-Ukraine war would be if he were to win the presidential election in November.
    

            “President Zelenskyy of Ukraine and I had a very good phone call earlier today. He congratulated me on a very successful Republican National Convention and becoming the Republican nominee for President of the United States,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “He condemned the heinous assassination attempt last Saturday and remarked about the American people coming together in the spirit of Unity during these times.”
    

            Trump continued, “I appreciate President Zelenskyy for reaching out because I, as your next President of the United States, will bring peace to the world and end the war that has cost so many lives and devastated countless innocent families. Both sides will be able to come together and negotiate a deal that ends the violence and paves a path forward to prosperity.”
    

            In a post on X describing the call, Zelensky said he congratulated Trump on his nomination and condemned the “shocking assassination attempt in Pennsylvania.”
    

            “I wished him strength and absolute safety in the future,” he said. “I noted the vital bipartisan and bicameral American support for protecting our nation’s freedom and independence.”
    

            Zelensky concluded, “We agreed with President Trump to discuss at a personal meeting what steps can make peace fair and truly lasting.”
    

            Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Trump has repeatedly said he could settle the Ukraine war in a day, but it remains unclear how he would pursue peace.
    

            In last month’s CNN presidential debate, Trump said that Putin’s terms for an agreement – which would include Ukraine ceding the four territories currently occupied by Russia – are “not acceptable.” But the former president and his allies have also criticized sending US military aid to Kyiv.
    

            But the former president and his allies have also criticized US military aid to Kyiv.
    

            Trump has long been critical of NATO defense spending. In February, the former president said he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to any NATO member country that doesn’t meet spending guidelines on defense, alarming many leaders in Washington and Europe.
    

            Trump and Zelensky also have their own history. Nearly five years ago, Trump repeatedly pushed for Zelensky to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, on a call ahead of the 2020 election. That “perfect phone call,” in Trump’s words, led to his first impeachment.
    

European diplomats have been preparing for Trump’s potential return to the White House, CNN previously reported, working to set up guard rails for NATO and trying to ensure lasting support for Ukraine in its war with Russia.
    

            Last week, when Zelensky was in the US, he said that “everyone is waiting for November,” including Putin. He also said that Biden and Trump are “very different” but both support democracy, which is why he claimed: “I think Putin will hate both of them.”

CNN_4,Nearly 2 dozen families claim owner of Houston surrogacy escrow company stole millions to fund lavish lifestyle,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/us/houston-surrogacy-escrow-company-fraud-scheme-lawsuit/index.html,2024-07-20 08:50:00,us,"
            Arielle Mitton’s world turned upside down when she learned the $50,000 she borrowed to pay for surrogacy had disappeared from her escrow account.
    

            “That was the hardest day for me,” she told CNN in a video chat. “I couldn’t eat. I couldn’t sleep.”
    

            Her surrogate was 12 weeks pregnant, and in a cloud of emotional confusion, she remembers reporting the alleged fraud to at least 10 federal and state law enforcement agencies and calling her bank asking for loan forgiveness. But she says the answer was the same. No one could help her.
    

            “I just felt alone. I felt abandoned,” she said.
    

            The lawsuit claims Surrogacy Escrow Account Management LLC, or SEAM, and its owner, Dominique Side, systemically misappropriated millions of escrow dollars, allegedly using the funds to enrich herself and fund side businesses – including a clothing line and a career as a rap and R&B singer and producer.
    

            Mitton is one of nearly two dozen families listed in a lawsuit accusing the owner of a Houston-based surrogacy escrow company of stealing millions of dollars from their accounts, intended to pay their surrogates and cover medical expenses, to fund her lavish lifestyle.
    

            The escrow funds also paid for Side’s “lavish trips all over the world,” designer clothing, luxury vehicles, real estate, and membership at the “Soho House,” a chain of private clubs, the filing alleges.
    

            The lawsuit was initially filed by one family last month, but 22 additional families across the country – as well as prospective parents in France and Italy – asked to join the lawsuit, the plaintiffs’ attorney announced Tuesday, claiming there are “hundreds more families” victimized by SEAM’s conduct.
    

            The lawsuit alleges Side and the other defendants “have lured families and their surrogates into entering into a fiduciary relationship with SEAM so they could steal their escrow funds” for their benefit.
    

            SEAM provides surrogacy escrow account management services to couples and women who have agreed to act as their surrogates. The company has an obligation as the intended parents’ escrow agent to hold escrow funds, review the expenses incurred by their surrogates and distribute payments to the surrogate, the lawsuit states.
    

            During a court hearing on Wednesday, a judge issued a temporary injunction, ordering funds and assets of the defendants be frozen for the duration of the lawsuit. A trial in the case has been scheduled to begin in January 2025, according to the judge’s order.
    

            Last month, the FBI said in a news release it was “seeking to identify potential victims” of SEAM and asked any other potential victims to fill out an online form.
    

            The lawsuit, filed in June in the district court of Harris County in Texas, names Side as a defendant, along with one of her business partners, Anthony Hall and Life Escrow, LLC, an escrow company created by Hall.
    

            The judge’s order says in March, Hall formed a new escrow company called Life Escrow, LLC, which is located at the same business address as SEAM.
    

            Dominique and SEAM “may have transferred any escrow funds remaining in SEAM’s accounts” as of June 14 to bank accounts in the name of Life Escrow, according to the judge’s order.
    

            CNN has reached out to Hall for comment on the lawsuit and did not receive a response. But in a statement posted on his Facebook page, Hall said he defended himself from the accusations in court and has agreed “to turn over specific assets I control that can be traced to the alleged mismanagement by Ms. Side.
    

            “I also presented a sworn affidavit from Ms. Side that states I have no insight or access to any of the funds or, processes of SEAM. Also, it states that no monies have been transferred to me fraudulently,” Hall said.
    

            Hall added Life Escrow was a passion project he started in 2023, “has no financial accounts, or clients,” and was “not a front for illegal activity.”
    

            In an automatic reply to an email sent by CNN, Side said she and her company “have been notified that we are subject to an active investigation by federal authorities.”
    

            “Under advice of counsel, I am not permitted to respond to any inquiries regarding the investigation,” her reply continued.
    

            In a statement on behalf of the families, attorney Marianne Robak said: “This is an important step for our legal team as we fight to help those affected by this scheme receive the recovery and answers they deserve.”
    

            “We will continue to investigate where the money went and the best course of action to hold the defendants accountable for their deceitful actions,” the statement continued.
    

            The lawsuit describes the defendants’ actions as “nothing short of evil,” and says more than 800 families who belong to a private Facebook group for victims of the alleged scheme have been defrauded by SEAM and its owner for over $16 million.
    

            Mindy and Aaron Herstein, who are not part of the lawsuit but who are members of the Facebook group, told CNN they are down $50,000 after using SEAM’s escrow services to pay a surrogate who is now 24 weeks pregnant. They say after a devastating stillbirth and health problems, they chose surrogacy as it was still their dream to have a child.
    

            “We are heartbroken and devastated about losing the money that was supposed to be safely managed in a trusted escrow account for our surrogate, as that is how she was paid. Now we are down 50K, and I do not see this money ever being returned. I feel for everyone going through this at this time,” Mindy told CNN.
    

            The families each deposited between $31,000 and $100,000 into a SEAM escrow account, only some of which was used to pay surrogates, the lawsuit said.
    

            “Troubles with SEAM came to light in June when expectant parents who had each deposited tens of thousands of dollars to pay women carrying their children learned instead that their money was apparently lost,” the plaintiffs’ attorney said in a Tuesday news release. “Initially, it looked as though millions had vanished.”
    

            The families were notified by SEAM on June 4 their accounts had been put “on hold” by Capital One Bank due to “fraudulent charges,” the judge’s order states.
    

            Ten days later, Side informed all the company’s clients in an email: “Due to legal action all operations have been placed on hold. At this time, I am unable to provide further details regarding the matter,” according to the order.
    

            Arielle Mitton says she and her husband Andrew have three children and after struggling for three years with infertility, found a road to surrogacy to complete her family.
    

            They connected with their surrogate in November 2023 and established their escrow account with SEAM in March by depositing $50,000. One month later, the embryo was successfully transferred to the surrogate and the pregnancy was confirmed in May.
    

            “I was elated. I was so happy,” Arielle told CNN.
    

            But her joy would soon turn to deep worry when the monthly payments from SEAM stopped in June.
    

            Since then, Arielle says she started picking up extra shifts at work, is in talks with her surrogate about an alternative payment plan, and has set up a GoFundMe page. But the page has only raised about $5,000 of her $38,000 goal.
    

            The judge cited evidence showing SEAM’s escrow accounts do not have enough funds to pay the families’ escrow fees, and the 23 families incurred damages ranging from roughly $12,400 to $90,400 – totaling over $1 million, not including attorney fees.
    

            “The evidence shows that it is likely – and probable – that SEAM misappropriated millions of its clients’ escrow funds,” the judge wrote.
    

            The judge determined the intended parents have a probable right to recovering their claims because it appears likely the defendants transferred SEAM’s assets “in order to hinder, delay or defraud SEAM’s creditors.”
    

            The families’ forensic accountant reviewed bank records showing SEAM transferred the escrow funds into an operating account, most of which was then transferred to other bank accounts, the order says.
    

            Bank records show Side transferred more than $2.2 million to launch her career as “Dom,” a “racy rap and R&B singer and music producer,” according to the filing. She allegedly used some of the funds to create music videos and social media content.

            The records also show SEAM transferred nearly $5 million to pay for a credit card, which “appears to be related” to a music studio owned by Side and Hall, along with $275,000 to Side’s clothing line.
    

            In October 2023, a designer clothing company named Nikki Green, LLC – partially owned by Side and Hall – showcased its clothing line at Fashion Week in Las Vegas, which was funded with the parents’ escrow funds, the lawsuit says.
    

            The lawsuit alleges the defendants committed fraud by failing to disclose the whereabouts and the status of their client’s funds, as part of a larger scheme to defraud the families of their escrow funds.
    

            Arielle says her heart aches for all the families in the Facebook group for victims, especially one family who had two failed embryo transfers and now may never have a baby.
    

            “Every story is terrible, but that one just really got to my heart. You know, I feel lucky that my surrogate is pregnant,” Arielle said. She wants to take a break from it all, she says, but can’t stop thinking about the owner of the company who allegedly stole her money.
    

            “If she’s out there listening, I would just ask her, ‘how do you sleep at night doing this to people who have already gone through so much pain in their lives?’” Arielle said.
    

            But Arielle said what Side can’t take away is her “joy,” which is of being the mother to a new baby girl who will one day call her mom.

            On November 19, 2021, Chronis attempted to take a shower but was “almost immediately bombarded with scalding hot water which knocked him to the floor of the shower tub where the water continued to scald him,” the complaint states.
    

            Two associates of Chronis rushed to his aid after hearing his fall and screams, according to the complaint.
    

            The shower delivered water at an “extremely excessive temperature,” the complaint stated. The temperature was more than 150 degrees, according to Chronis’ family attorney, N. Jeffrey Blankenship. Most adults will suffer third-degree burns if exposed to 150-degree water for two seconds, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
    

            Chronis, a food vendor visiting the Cincinnati region for work, initially used nonprescription medicine for his burns before working at a local festival, according to Blankenship. He went to a nearby hospital but left to return to work, Blankenship added.
    

            Two days later, Chronis returned to the hospital for skin graft surgery and remained hospitalized for nearly five months, according to the complaint.
    

            In April 2022, Chronis was transferred to a rehabilitation facility in his hometown of Knoxville, Tennessee, Blankenship said. He spent months in the hospital after the incident, underwent numerous medical procedures, and endured “substantial conscious pain and suffering” before ultimately dying from his injuries on June 19, 2022, according to the complaint.
    

            The jury found the motel owner, Sanjay Patel, “failed to exercise ordinary care in inspecting and maintaining their hotel rooms in a reasonably safe condition for the use of their guests,” according to the trial order and judgment.
    

            According to the Kentucky Secretary of State’s website, Patel owns Aspyn, LLC, which operates the Econo Lodge in Erlanger, which was also named as a defendant in the suit.
    

            The judgment, filed on July 3, awarded Chronis’ estate nearly $1.3 million to cover medical expenses, $250,000 for pain and suffering, more than $16,000 for funeral costs, and $500,000 in punitive damages.
    

            CNN has reached out to Patel’s attorney, Lindsay Rump, for comment.

CNN_6,Brittney Griner and wife Cherelle welcome a son: ‘That’s my man’,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/us/brittney-griner-cherelle-son/index.html,2024-07-20 08:15:00,us,"
            Brittney Griner will have one more fan cheering her on this Olympic season.
    

            The WNBA star and her wife, Cherelle, welcomed their first child on July 8, the 33-year-old Griner revealed Friday on the “She Knows Sports” podcast.
    

            “That’s my man,” Griner revealed when asked about her son. “He is amazing. They say as soon as you see him, everything you thought mattered just goes out the window. And that’s literally what happens.”
    

            The two-time gold medalist will be heading to the 2024 Paris Olympics in the coming week.
    

            “Kind of sucks, I got to leave,” Griner added, referring to herself as “Pops.” “But at the same time, he will understand. … My whole phone has turned into him now.”

            The couple had initially posted a pregnancy announcement on Instagram in April.
    

            Griner will play for Team USA in Saturday’s WNBA All-Star Game ahead of the Olympics. She has averaged 18.6 points, 6.4 rebounds and 1.4 blocks in 15 games for the Phoenix Mercury this season.
    

            The new bliss and successful basketball season follow Griner’s almost yearlong detainment in Russia after being unjustly sentenced to nine years for drug smuggling in 2022.
    

            Griner, who had played in the offseason for a Russian women’s basketball team for years, was arrested at a Moscow airport in February 2022 after authorities found cannabis oil in her luggage.
    

            She later apologized repeatedly and said she had inadvertently packed the less than one gram of the substance. Her lawyers said the cannabis oil had been prescribed to Griner for “severe chronic pain.”
    

            The 10-time All Star was released in December 2022 in a prisoner swap with Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, who was serving 25 years in the US. She had previously been moved to a penal colony in Mordovia.


            Months of “difficult” negotiations with the Russians culminated in the swap, senior US administration officials said, with it becoming clear only in the weeks leading up to Griner’s release an opening existed to secure the American basketball player’s return.
    

            In December, alongside President Joe Biden, Cherelle Griner thanked the administration for helping secure her wife’s release and said she was “overwhelmed with emotions.”

CNN_7,WSJ reporter Evan Gershkovich sentenced to 16 years for espionage by Russian court in case denounced by US as a sham,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/media/evan-gershkovich-espionage-trial-verdict-intl/index.html,2024-07-20 08:12:00,us,"
Evan Gershkovich, the first American journalist to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since the Cold War, has been found guilty of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison by a Russian court, in a case that the US government, his newspaper and supporters have denounced as a sham.
    

            The court in Yekaterinburg announced the guilty verdict and sentencing on Friday shortly after 3 p.m. local time (8 a.m. ET).
    

            The court heard closing arguments and 32-year-old Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter, delivered his closing remarks behind closed doors on Friday morning.
    

            The case’s rapid conclusion comes just weeks after Gershkovich first appeared in a glass cage with his head recently shaved at the start of his trial on June 26. On that day, Gershkovich stood cross-armed, occasionally smiling and waving to the crowd of reporters.
    

            The speed of the trial has raised questions over whether the Kremlin is intending to use him as part of a prisoner swap deal with the United States, suggestions which spokesman Dmitry Peskov left without comment when asked about them on a Friday conference call ahead of the verdict announcement.
    

            In June, Moscow confirmed again that contacts are ongoing regarding a potential prisoner exchange deal for Gershkovich, but Peskov repeatedly insisted that those conversations were to be carried out in “absolute silence” to prevent complications.
    

            Gershkovich was arrested while reporting for the WSJ, during a trip to Yekaterinburg in March 2023, and later accused of spying for the CIA. Russian authorities have never offered any public evidence to support their claims.
    

            Within two weeks of his arrest in March 2023, the US State Department designated him as wrongfully detained and called for his immediate release.

            In a statement following Friday’s sentencing, Gershkovich’s employer said: “This disgraceful, sham conviction comes after Evan has spent 478 days in prison, wrongfully detained, away from his family and friends, prevented from reporting, all for doing his job as a journalist.
    

            “We will continue to do everything possible to press for Evan’s release and to support his family,” the statement from Dow Jones CEO and Wall Street Journal Publisher Almar Latour and Wall Street Journal Editor in Chief Emma Tucker continued.
    

            “Journalism is not a crime, and we will not rest until he’s released. This must end now,” it added.
    

            At the United Nations Security Council on Friday, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield Ambassador also raised Gershkovich’s case. “Let me begin with the news coming out of Russia this morning. Evan Gershkovich was sentenced to 16 years. He has committed no crime. He is being punished because he is a journalist, and he is an American. Simple as that,” she said.
    

            Journalist advocacy group, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), joined the chorus of criticism, pointing out Russia’s current record as the world’s fourth-worst jailer of journalists, with at least 22 currently behind bars.
    

            “Journalists are not pawns in geopolitical games. It’s time to stop hostage diplomacy and free him immediately,” CPJ Director Carlos Martinez de la Serna said in a statement.
    

            The verdict has yet to enter into force, and the defense can appeal the conviction within 15 days, judge Andrey Mineyev said while delivering his verdict. The court also ordered Gershkovich to pay procedural costs of 6,708 rubles ($77), and for some of his personal items, including an iPhone and a notepad, to be destroyed.
    

            According to the judge, the time Gershkovich has already spent in detention since last March will count towards his sentence.
    

            Following his arrest, Gershkovich was held in Moscow’s notorious Lefortovo prison, spending almost every hour of the day in a small cell, before being transferred to the city of Yekaterinburg in the Urals more than 1,100 miles east of the capital. He passed the time by writing letters to his friends and family, his parents said in an interview with the WSJ, adding that he was allowed just one hour of walking per day.
    

            Gershkovich, the US government, and the WSJ have vehemently denied the charges against him.
    

            US and Western officials have accused Russia of using Gershkovich and other jailed foreigners as bargaining chips for possible prisoner exchanges.
    

A high-profile swap in 2022 saw US basketball star Brittney Griner exchanged for arms dealer Viktor Bout. But Russia refused to release another jailed US citizen, Paul Whelan, as it was seeking a former colonel from Russia’s domestic spy organization in return.
    

            Whelan told CNN on Friday that he feels “sympathy and empathy” for Gershkovich, but expressed hope that the latest developments could open the door for a deal to secure both of their release.
    

            Whelan, who called CNN from his remote prison camp in Mordovia Friday, said he was able to watch a news broadcast about the sentencing.
    

            “The only thing I could think about was, when I was standing in court, listening to the judge read the false tale of my conviction and hearing that I would have to serve 16 years in prison. And there’s surreal experience of knowing that you were 100% innocent, and that this, this, stage show, this drama was going on around you,” Whelan said.
    

            Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously suggested “an agreement can be reached” with the United States to release Gershkovich and alluded to the case of a Russian national convicted of carrying out an assassination in Berlin in 2019, in an interview with right-wing US media personality Tucker Carlson in February.
    

            The trial of Gershkovich, the American-born son of Soviet-era emigres to the US, has highlighted the extent to which Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has harmed relations between Moscow and Washington.
    

            In their indictment, Russian prosecutors said that “under instructions from the CIA” and “using painstaking conspiratorial methods,” Gershkovich “was collecting secret information” about a Russian tank factory.

CNN_8,Biden faces fresh wave of Democratic defections as campaign tries to press forward,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/democratic-defections-joe-biden/index.html,2024-07-20 09:08:00,politics,"
            President Joe Biden faced a new round of defections Friday from Democratic lawmakers publicly calling on him to leave the presidential race, even as his campaign sought to project a message that he isn’t going anywhere.
    

            One day after the Republican National Convention, new public calls for Biden to drop out from a dozen lawmakers – including Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and California Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a close ally to former Speaker Nancy Pelosi – grew the list of congressional Democrats to more than 30.
    

            Two House Democrats close to Pelosi, speaking on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity and rawness in the party right now, attributed Friday’s new statements – especially Lofgren’s letter to Biden – to the former speaker and her belief that it is critical for the president and his allies to understand the effort to push him aside is not going away after the Republican convention, despite the campaign’s efforts to quash it.
    

            The president is described by a source with direct knowledge as “seething” at Pelosi. This source said the sentiment only grew Friday when Lofgren, Pelosi’s longtime close lieutenant, released her letter urging Biden to step aside. CNN has reached out to Pelosi’s camp and the Biden campaign for comment on this reporting.
    

            It is a remarkable break between two powerful party elders and longtime allies in enacting key elements of the Biden agenda.
    

Aides to Vice President Kamala Harris inside and outside the campaign have also expressed unhappiness with Pelosi and her talk of a quick process to find a new candidate should Biden step aside.
    

            To them, “process” means trying to bypass the vice president in the event the president stepped aside. Harris, who has staunchly defended Biden publicly and tried to show unity, spoke with donors on a call Friday afternoon, which she was asked to do by the West Wing, according to campaign officials.
    

            Biden’s campaign hoped to force party unity Friday, releasing a statement from Biden saying he was looking forward to hitting the campaign trail next week after being sidelined with Covid-19.
    

            And Biden campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon went on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” Friday morning to say Biden was “absolutely” in the race.
    

            “Absolutely the president’s in this race. You heard him say that time and time again, and I think we saw on display last night exactly why,” she said. “Joe Biden is more committed than ever to beat Donald Trump.”
    

            Instead, there was a stream of new statements from House Democrats.
    

            The dynamic has played out repeatedly this week, as more and more Democrats have made public their desire for Biden to leave the race – in addition to reports of congressional Democratic leaders pushing Biden about his chances – even as the president repeatedly says he has no intention to drop out.
    

            A Democratic lawmaker told CNN that House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his team are not discouraging members from continuing to speak out against Biden’s candidacy.
    

            The source said it was their impression that members were privately being encouraged to make such statements if they felt that way.
    

            For some of those who want Biden to step down, this source said that there is a fear that the public pile-on, which is expected to grow, is overkill and making Biden mad and potentially even more dug in.
    

            This source, who is in touch with the White House, said that while Biden is now more open to the conversation about potentially stepping aside, he “could go either way” and that the people he is listening to aren’t talking publicly.
    

            That concern didn’t stop more calls for Biden to leave the race on Friday.
    

            Lofgren, who served on the House January 6 committee, released a letter she sent to Biden urging him to step aside. “Simply put, your candidacy is on a trajectory to lose the White House and potentially impact crucial House and Senate races down ballot,” she wrote.
    

            Heinrich was the third senator to publicly call for Biden to leave the race, saying he believed it was “in the best interests of our country” for Biden to step aside.
    

            “By passing the torch, he would secure his legacy as one of our nation’s greatest leaders and allow us to unite behind a candidate who can best defeat Donald Trump and safeguard the future of our democracy,” Heinrich said in a statement.
    

            Rep. Greg Landsman, an Ohio Democrat, told Dana Bash on CNN’s “Inside Politics” Friday that it was time for Biden to drop out.
    

            “Passing the torch is the right thing to do,” Landsman said. “That is the way to ensure that Donald Trump doesn’t win the presidency.”
    

            And four other House Democrats – Reps. Jared Huffman and Mark Pocan; a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Chuy Garcia; and a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, Marc Veasey – released a joint statement Friday, using the same “pass the torch” rhetoric.
    

            “Passing the torch would fundamentally change the trajectory of the campaign,” they said. “It would reinvigorate the race and infuse Democrats with enthusiasm and momentum heading into our convention next month.”
    

            Lawmakers urging Biden to stay in the race have warned about the unchartered waters that the party would enter if Biden were to drop out. Biden’s campaign released a new memo Friday saying that there “is no plan for an alternative nominee.”
    

            DNC officials met by phone Friday for a convention rules committee meeting, where they shared few details on when a virtual roll call to renominate Biden.
    

            During the meeting, party leaders reiterated that voting wouldn’t start before August 1, but didn’t set a specific date. Instead, under the proposed plan, it will be up to party leadership to pick a date at a later time.
    

            The rules committee didn’t take any steps to approve the plan Friday but will meet again next week.

            Thousands of US flights were grounded Friday as a technical disaster plagued government agencies and businesses worldwide – leading to countless stranded passengers, canceled medical procedures and disrupted 911 services.
    

            A cybersecurity company said the debacle is “not a security incident or cyberattack.” But the technical fiasco has paralyzed airlines, banks, state agencies and even emergency services around the world.

What is CrowdStrike, the company responsible for the global outage?


            As of Friday evening, more than 3,000 flights into, out of or within the United States had been canceled and more than 11,000 delayed, according to FlightAware.com.
    

            Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina told passengers not to come to the airport unless they had confirmed their flights. Bewildered travelers at the world’s busiest airport in Atlanta were stranded as they tried to get to urgent events.
    

            “Tomorrow, I have a funeral in the afternoon,” said Ty Kelley, who was stuck at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport – which had the most cancellations Friday morning.
    

            “And then on Sunday, I have my sister’s 50th birthday party,” Kelley said. But it’s not clear when or if she’ll make it to those events: “It’s really chaotic. It’s frustrating. And I’ve never experienced anything like this.”
    

Live updates: Global tech outages hit airlines, banks and businesses


            The Federal Aviation Administration “is closely monitoring a technical issue impacting IT systems at U.S. airlines,” the agency posted on social media. “Several airlines have requested FAA assistance with ground stops until the issue is resolved.”
    

            CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that has Microsoft among its clients, “is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts,” CEO George Kurtz posted on X. “This is not a security incident or cyberattack.”
    

            Kurtz promised customers “full transparency” on how the outage occurred. He said CrowdStrike would take steps “to prevent anything like this from happening again,” according to a statement on CrowdStrike’s website.
    

            “We have mobilized all of CrowdStrike to help you and your teams” to recover from the outage, the CEO told customers.
    

            But that could be easier said than done: Manual restarts of individual systems take time and expertise that some customers don’t have, which is why companies are slow to recover from the outage.
    

            Former McAfee CEO Dave DeWalt told CNN that a group of private sector and government agencies worked overnight to “ascertain the threat” and find a solution to the global outage. He said he was on the call, which included the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and other private and government organizations.
    

            Microsoft released a statement midday explaining the situation.
    

            “Yesterday, CrowdStrike released an update that began impacting IT systems globally,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella posted on X. “We are aware of this issue and are working closely with CrowdStrike and across the industry to provide customers technical guidance and support to safely bring their systems back online.”
    

            – Delta Air Lines “paused its global flight schedule this morning due to a vendor technology issue that is impacting several airlines and businesses around the world,” it said in a statement Friday morning. Delta later said it was resuming some flights. The airline apologized to impacted customers and said a travel waiver would be issued.
    

            – JetBlue operations “remain normal and we are not experiencing any system-wide delays or cancelations,” the airline said in an email to CNN. However, “Customers should monitor their flight status and build in extra time in the event that this outage has impacted specific airports due to outages at other airlines, airport operators, or government agencies.”
    

            – American Airlines said it has resolved the issue affecting its operations. “Earlier this morning, a technical issue with a vendor impacted multiple carriers, including American. As of 5 a.m. ET, we have been able to safely re-establish our operation,” American said in a statement. “We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience.”

            – Allegiant Air and Sun Country Airlines said they were having difficulties involving booking, check-in and trip-managing functions online. The FAA announced Friday morning all Allegiant flights would be grounded.
    

            – Numerous international airlines reported technical disruptions, including Virgin Australia and Qantas, along with airports across Europe and Asia-Pacific.
    

            The calamity also struck hospitals and federal agencies, forcing each to scramble for solutions.
    

            “Many of our Microsoft-based computer systems have been affected by the worldwide technology outage,” Cincinnati Children’s hospital posted on X. “Our teams are working hard to minimize disruption to patient care and system operations, and we are bringing systems back up as quickly as possible.”
    

            At Harris Health System in Houston, “elective hospital procedures are being canceled today and will be rescheduled when the information systems issues are resolved.”

Recovering from the global tech outage could be a long, arduous process


            At Mass General Brigham in Boston, “all previously scheduled non-urgent surgeries, procedures, and medical visits are cancelled today,” the health care system told CNN in a statement.
    

            “Mass General Brigham remains open to provide care to patients with urgent health concerns in our clinics and emergency departments, and we continue to care for all patients currently receiving care in our hospitals.”
    

            And in Canada’s British Columbia, the Provincial Health Services Authority announced the health system was affected by the IT outage. “We have implemented contingency plans to ensure that our health care services remain operational, and that patient care is not disrupted to the best of our ability,” said the organization.
    

            In addition to hospitals, blood donation centers have experienced challenges due to flight cancellations and delays. One center, Blood Assurance, told CNN that a planned shipment was postponed due to flight delays and cancellations.
    

            “We are asking community members to help through donation,” Blood Assurance said in an email. “We have a fantastic community of donors that always shows up when we need them.”
    

            Elsewhere, New York Blood Center, a supplier of blood to approximately 200 hospitals in the Northeast, has put in place an emergency driving operation to distribute collected blood, said Andrea Cefarelli, the senior vice president of New York Blood Center Enterprises.
    

            Test tubes of blood sent to be tested before they’re distributed “are not making it onto planes from yesterday and today, requiring for us to drive them,” Cefarelli told CNN in a phone call. “There is going to be a 12-24 hour delay in getting the test results.”
    

            The American Red Cross has reassured patients and donors that they are not impacted by the global IT outage as they do not use CrowdStrike software.
    

            The US Department of Justice was searching for workarounds Friday, according to an internal memo viewed by CNN. The memo said the CrowdStrike issue “is significant and there is currently no estimated restoration time.”
    

            And due to the Microsoft and CrowdStrike debacle, “local Social Security offices are closed to the public today,” the Social Security Administration’s website said.
    

            The technical disaster affected some 911 operations in the United States; mass transit in New York and Washington, DC; banking in Australia, South Africa and the United Kingdom; Hong Kong’s Disneyland; and the Israeli health service.
    

            In Oregon, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler issued an emergency declaration.
    

            “City services that rely on Microsoft Operating Systems using Crowdstrike Endpoint Protection, including certain essential City service providers, are impacted by the problem including emergency communications,” the mayor’s office said, though 911 operations were not impacted.
    

            But in Alaska, many 911 and non-emergency call centers weren’t working properly, Alaska State Troopers said. Hours later, the agency said 911 services had been restored.
    

            In New Hampshire, some 911 services were down across the state overnight but have since been restored, New Hampshire 911 said in a post.
    

            Phoenix police said the technical problems impacted the department’s computerized 911 dispatch center. “Our 911 center remains operational. If you need to call 911, stay on the line if you are put on a brief hold,” Phoenix police posted on X Friday morning. Later in the morning, the department said its “systems have been restored.”
    

            In New York City, 911 services are operational, the mayor’s press secretary told CNN.
    

            “FDNY IT and Communication teams implemented our redundancy procedures upon notification of the CrowdStrike outage,” New York fire department spokesperson Jim Long told CNN Friday.
    

            CNN has reached out to the Federal Communications Commission for more information on nationwide 911 outages.
    

            “We’re aware of reports of a systems outage causing disruptions in service, including 911,” the FCC posted late Friday morning on X. “We’re working closely with other federal agencies to provide assistance and determine the extent of these service disruptions.”
    

            In some states, driver services ground to a halt due to the technical problems.
    

            North Carolina’s driver’s license and plate services are “unable to assist customers this morning due to the current global Microsoft and CrowdStrike outage,” the North Carolina Department of Transportation said. The agency said services will resume “once the global outage has been repaired.”
    

            Georgia’s Department of Driver Services said operations were unavailable “Due to the Microsoft/CrowdStrike Global outage.”
    

            And in Tennessee, driver services centers might not be able to process transactions, state officials said Friday morning.
    

            Residents in Texas were not able to get IDs or driver’s licenses on Friday.
    

            “The Department of Safety and Homeland Security will provide updates as information becomes available,” the agency said. “We apologize for the inconvenience the outage has caused.”
    

            In New York City, arrival information for trains and buses went down for hours before being restored Friday afternoon, according to the MTA.
    

            The situation at Philadelphia International Airport is “absolutely insane” as thousands of people cram together, waiting for answers, traveler William Sikora III said.
    

             “It’s getting really hot in here,” Sikora told CNN on Friday morning. He was trying to make the cross-country journey from Philadelphia to Los Angeles, but feared repeated delays would eventually turn into cancellations.

            “I have no idea when we are going to get called.”
    

            Hotels are also feeling the impact of the outages: Marriott International says some of its hotel systems have been impacted by the ongoing outage.
    

            “We are actively working with our vendors to resolve issues that have impacted certain hotel systems,” the company, which has 8,900 properties in 141 countries and territories, said in a statement Friday afternoon. “We apologize for any inconvenience that guests may experience.”

CNN_10,Israel’s invitation to this year’s atomic bomb commemorations in Japan has sparked a controversy over double standards,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/asia/israel-invitation-to-hiroshima-japan-sparked-controversy-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-20 09:08:00,world,"
            Hiroshima, the Japanese city devastated by a US atomic bomb in 1945, is at the center of a growing controversy after local officials dismissed calls to disinvite Israel from its annual ceremony promoting world peace as war rages in Gaza.
    

            Every year on August 6, Hiroshima gathers foreign officials, along with locals, in a minute of silence at 8:15 a.m. to mark the exact moment the bomb dropped, killing tens of thousands of people and leading to the end of World War II.
    

            Some activists and atomic bomb survivors’ groups say the ceremony is no place for Israel, which is pounding Gaza with strikes as it seeks to eradicate Hamas in response to the Palestinian militant group’s devastating attack on October 7 last year.
    

            They say the Hiroshima city government should exclude Israel from this year’s ceremony, as it has Russia and Belarus for the past two years over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
    

            But Hiroshima authorities say they have no intention of excluding Israel.
    

            “It is not a double standard. Our policy is to invite all countries. However, Russia and Belarus are exceptions due to the invasion of Ukraine,” a Hiroshima city government spokesperson told CNN.
    

            “Russia and Belarus are not invited in order to ensure the ceremony goes smoothly.”
    

            Authorities in Nagasaki, the Japanese city hit by an atomic bomb just days after Hiroshima, told CNN they haven’t decided whether to invite Israel to their peace ceremony on August 9.
    

            Israel’s war in Gaza may “prevent the smooth execution of the ceremony,” they said, stressing the move was not a gesture of protest but a practical consideration.
    

            Of the two ceremonies, Hiroshima’s is the largest with representatives from 115 countries and the European Union set to attend this year.
    

            Envoys from Russia and Belarus haven’t attended since Hiroshima excluded them in 2022 following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February that year. Russia used Belarus as one of the launch pads for its assault and later moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons there.
    

            This year’s Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony takes place against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, where Israel’s bombardment has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and displaced nearly the entire enclave’s more than 2 million people, who now face severe shortages of food, shelter, water and medical supplies.
    

            “Why invite Israel if they are committing genocide-like crimes, just like Russia and Belarus?” said Tetsuji Kumada, executive director of Hiroshima’s Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organization, one of the groups opposing Israel’s presence.
    

            “It is very disappointing that our request wasn’t taken into account,” he told CNN, adding that the organization wrote to the Hiroshima government in June to ask for Israel to be disinvited.
    

            Another group, Hiroshima-Palestine Vigil Community, launched an online petition in May, calling for Israel’s representatives to be excluded, saying that “current global protests against Israel clearly outnumber those against Russia in both scale and frequency.”
    

            The petition has since amassed more than 30,000 signatures.
    

            Israel has repeatedly rejected accusations from critics as well as rights groups and experts that it has broken international humanitarian law with the breadth of its response to Hamas’ attacks. It argues its war is against Hamas, not Palestinians, although anger over the extent of the destruction and civilian deaths in Gaza has swelled globally.
    

            CNN has reached out to the Israeli embassy in Japan for comment.
    

            Japan has taken a strong stance in Russia’s war on Ukraine, pledging to stand with Kyiv, offering billions of dollars in humanitarian aid and military vehicles and equipment for mine-clearing operations. It has also imposed sanctions on Russia.
    

            Meanwhile, Tokyo has offered humanitarian aid to Gaza, expressed “deep concern” for the critical situation in the strip and supports a two-state solution to the conflict.


            According to Japanese news agency Kyodo News, the Hiroshima government referred to the war in Gaza in its invitation to Israel, urging the country to cease its offensive.
    

            The invitation said it was “deeply regrettable that the lives and everyday existences of many people are being taken away,” Kyodo reported.
    

            The bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and Nagasaki three days later led to Japan’s unconditional surrender and brought an end to World War II. But it also killed tens of thousands of people, both instantly and in the months and years to come due to radiation sickness.
    

            Every year, diplomats in Japan are invited to Hiroshima to join the commemoration that highlights the importance of peace and cautions against the use of nuclear weapons.
    

            But while some advocacy groups urged Hiroshima to shun Israel, others supported its presence.
    

            “As a city of international peace, Hiroshima city needs to invite all nations, regardless of whether they are at war or not,” said Kunihiko Sakuma, president of Hiroshima Hidankyo, an atomic bomb survivors’ advocacy group.

            However, the Permanent General Mission of Palestine in Tokyo complained on social platform X that it had not been invited to the ceremony. “This decision is a double standard,” it said. Its envoy was never invited to the ceremony, the office told CNN.
    

            Hiroshima authorities said they only send invitations to countries with embassies in Japan and have never invited Palestinian representatives to the ceremony.
    

            At a news conference last week, Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa reiterated Japan’s support for a two-state solution.
    

            “We continue to comprehensively consider the recognition of Palestinian statehood, taking into account how to advance the peace process,” she said.

CNN_12,Missouri woman who served 43 years in prison is free after her murder conviction was overturned,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/us/missouri-sandra-hemme-murder-conviction-overturned/index.html,2024-07-20 11:53:00,us,"
Chillicothe, Missouri (AP) – A woman whose murder conviction was overturned after she served 43 years of a life sentence was released Friday, despite attempts in the last month by Missouri’s attorney general to keep her behind bars.
    

            Sandra Hemme, 64, left a prison in Chillicothe, hours after a judge threatened to hold the attorney general’s office in contempt if they continued to fight against her release. She reunited with her family at a nearby park, where she hugged her sister, daughter and granddaughter.
    

            “You were just a baby when your mom sent me a picture of you,” she said. “You looked just like your mamma when you were little and you still look like her.”
    

            Her granddaughter laughed. “I get that a lot.”

Missouri woman’s murder conviction tossed after 43 years. Her lawyers say a police officer did it


            Hemme had been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project. The judge originally ruled on June 14 that Hemme’s attorneys had established “clear and convincing evidence” of “actual innocence” and he overturned her conviction. But Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey fought her release in the courts.
    

            “It was too easy to convict an innocent person and way harder than it should have been to get her out, even to the point of court orders being ignored,” her attorney Sean O’Brien said. “It shouldn’t be this hard to free an innocent person.”
    

            During a court hearing Friday, Judge Ryan Horsman said that if Hemme wasn’t released within hours, Bailey himself would have to appear in court Tuesday morning. He threatened to hold the attorney general’s office in contempt.
    

            He also scolded Bailey’s office for calling the warden and telling prison officials not to release Hemme after he ordered her to be freed in her own recognizance. “I would suggest you never do that,” Horsman said, adding: “To call someone and tell them to disregard a court order is wrong.”
    

            Hemme declined to address reporters after she was released. O’Brien said she was going straight to the side of her father, who was hospitalized with kidney failure and recently moved to palliative care. ”This has been a long time coming,” he said of her release.
    

            O’Brien said previously that delays had caused their family “irreparable harm and emotional distress.”
    

            There are still struggles ahead.
    

            “She’s going to need help,” he said, noting she won’t be eligible for social security because she has been incarcerated for so long.
    

            Over the last month, a circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court all agreed Hemme should be released, but she was still held behind bars, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.
    

            “I’ve never seen it,” said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor and dean emeritus of Saint Louis University Law School. “Once the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.”
    

            The lone holdup to freedom came from the attorney general, who filed court motions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases. The warden at the Chillicothe Correctional Center initially declined to let Hemme go, based on Bailey’s actions.
    

Horsman ruled on June 14 that “the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.” A state appeals court ruled on July 8 that Hemme should be set free while it continued to review the case. The next day, July 9, Horsman ruled Hemme should be released to go home with her sister. The Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday declined to undo the lower court rulings that allowed her to be released on her own recognizance and placed with her sister and brother-in-law.
    

            Bailey, a Republican facing opposition in the Aug. 6 primary election, responded with another request late Thursday, asking the Circuit Court to reconsider.
    

            Hemme was serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri.
    

            Hemme’s immediate freedom was complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for “offering to commit violence.” Bailey had argued that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and that she should start serving those sentences now.
    

            Her attorneys countered that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a “draconian outcome.”
    

            Some legal experts agreed.
    

            Peter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison was “a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,” since evidence strongly suggests she didn’t commit the crime.
    

            Bailey’s office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday.
    

            Bailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.
    

            Horsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a “malleable mental state” when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as “often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.” Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.
    

            The St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman — a fellow officer, who died in 2015 — and the prosecution wasn’t told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.
    

            Evidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman’s pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke’s apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.
    

            Horsman, in his report, called Hemme “the victim of a manifest injustice.”

CNN_13,Thousands of Disneyland workers vote to authorize a potential strike. It would be the first in 40 years,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/business/disneyland-workers-strike-authorization/index.html,2024-07-20 13:57:00,us,"
            Cyn Carranza buffs, cleans, waxes and scrubs Disneyland floors starting at midnight, so that guests coming the next morning feel as if no one had been there before them.
    

            But after her shifts working near a sparkling Sleeping Beauty Castle, she went “home” to a car, for about four months last year, because her wages, plus earnings at two other jobs, weren’t enough to afford renting a place with a bed.
    

            Now, negotiating better wages and working conditions for Carranza and thousands of other Disneyland employees has gotten messy, to the point where thousands overwhelmingly voted Friday to authorize a potential strike.
    

            Now that the vote has passed, it’s up to union leadership to decide whether to hold one. It would be the first at Disney’s original resort in 40 years.
    

            “Today Disneyland Park cast members made their voices heard by voting to authorize the Disney Workers Rising bargaining committee to call for a strike to protest unfair labor practices by 99%,” UFCW Local 324 said in a statement. “We stood up and showed Disney that we won’t sit by and allow them to intimidate, surveil and unlawfully discipline cast members for exercising their rights.”
    

            CNN has reached out to the Walt Disney Company for comment on the vote.
    

            Disneyland officials previously said that there are plans in place that would allow the parks to continue operating with the same expected level of service, in the event of a strike.
    

            Union leaders said if the strike happens, it would likely be of limited duration, unlike open-ended strikes by actors’ and writers’ unions that halted film and TV productions at Disney and other media and tech companies for much of 2023.
    

            Strike authorization votes are common, and they typically pass by overwhelming margins. But that does not mean a strike will necessarily happen, as was the case with Teamsters at UPS last year.
    

            While this potential strike would officially be about Disney not allowing union buttons to be worn at work, the underlying concern among rank-and-file workers is about the current contract that many say does not provide a livable wage.
    

            Carranza ‘s Disneyland wage is just over $20 per hour, after factoring in a differential for working the overnight shift. Her work is laborious, often dragging 600 feet of PVC hose and working with heavy machinery to buff the floors.
    

            “It’s upsetting that the balloons that we sell in the park are more expensive than [what] I’m making an hour. I have to work an hour and a half if I want to afford one of those Disney balloons,” Carranza said.
    

            As of April 1, California’s minimum wage for fast food workers is $20 per hour, which has affected other industries competing for the same workers. Voters in the city of Anaheim in Orange County, CA, where the Disneyland Resort is located, had previously approved a measure that required the resort’s employees to make a $19.90 minimum wage as of January of 2024.
    

            But in a county where the 2022 median rent was $2,251 a month, and where about 10% of residents live in poverty, workers said a wage of about $20 an hour is still not enough.
    

            After Carranza lived in a car, she moved into a hotel because she could not afford a security deposit or first and last months’ rent for an apartment.
    

            Today, she shares an apartment with a roommate.
    

            Change at the Disneyland Resort – and in affordability in Southern California in general – has been deeply troubling for Coleen Palmer, who has seen been at Disneyland Resort for 37 years.
    

            When she first started, Palmer says she was able to rent a $400 a month two-bedroom apartment by herself on the around $650 per month wages she earned. Today, she rents a one-bedroom apartment for just a little over $2000 a month, and limits the groceries she buys on the $2800 she says she takes home every month. Then there’s utilities, food, a phone bill, medical care, and other fixed costs. She doesn’t travel anywhere besides work in order to save on gas, and buys items like chicken that can be shared with her dog.
    

            “It does feel very defeating at times. It makes me question my self-worth. And there are times when I think to myself, is it worth it? Should I go somewhere else? But I am a few years away from retirement,” Palmer said. She said she wants to stick it out, especially because she loves the job. She loves talking to kids about what they’ve been doing around the park and telling them they’ve been brave to try the thrill rides.
    

            Palmer is happy to see the lowest wage earners get an increase due to the city’s minimum wage laws. But those earning slightly more, with decades of experience, did not get a raise. Palmer said she makes just under $24 an hour after nearly four decades, while an entry-level employee makes $19.90 an hour.
    

            Disneyland officials said wages are up more than 40% in the last five years. But much of that increase has followed changes in the state and local minimum wage.
    

            A strike would involve about 9,500 employees who work at Disneyland Park, currently under a contract that expired in June.
    

            Another 4,500 employees in the same bargaining group work at the Downtown Disney retail and dining district, the Disney hotels, or the resort’s other theme park, Disney California Adventure. Their contract expires in September, and they are not part of the current strike developments.
    

            Together, they represent about 40% of the entire resort’s employees. But only the Disneyland Park employees will vote and participate in a strike for now.
    

            The unions and Disneyland have two more meetings scheduled on Monday and Tuesday.
    

            These groups do not include the character and parade performers who organized in May as part of Actors’ Equity Association and have yet to start their bargaining process.
    

            Officially, this potential strike would be over union buttons depicting a raised Mickey fist.
    

            SEIU-USWW, Teamsters Local 495, UCFW Local 324 and BCTGM Local 83 filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board against Disney in June for what they say are hundreds of instances of unlawful discipline, intimidation and surveillance of union members wearing these buttons at work.
    

            The NLRB is expected to investigate the charges over the next few months, after which a regional NLRB director could decide if the case merits a hearing.
    

            Disneyland officials told CNN the wearing of union buttons goes against the parks’ uniform policy and that only a “handful” of employees have been disciplined.
    

            Disneyland officials said in a statement that the parks strive to give guests “an uninterrupted, immersive experience,” and that “anything that distracts from the show or story, be it a non-approved button, pin or sticker worn by a cast member, would be addressed by a leader.”
    

            The term “cast member” refers to any Disney employee, as the company treats any experience in front of a guest as a performance. Every employee works toward creating a space where guests escape reality and suspend disbelief, to feel as if they are truly on a Star Wars planet, for example. For the same reason, cast members are not allowed to refer to humans underneath character costumes, because this would break the façade.
    

            Disney’s policy is that a leader would ask the employee to remove the union button to maintain the integrity of the “show.” Only repeated violations would warrant any disciplinary action, starting with a verbal warning.

CNN_14,Why your Mediterranean beach vacation might be bad for your health,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/mediterranean-beach-vacation-microplastics-pollution/index.html,2024-07-20 14:00:00,world,"
            The Mediterranean Sea may evoke images of luxurious beach holidays, scrumptious seafood meals and endless sandy beaches, but this body of water is increasingly toxic.
    

            More than 87% of the Mediterranean Sea, which extends from the Atlantic Ocean to Africa, Europe and Asia, is polluted with microplastics and other pollutants including toxic metals and industrial chemicals, according to a July 2024 report by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).
    

            Globally, water pollution is tied to 1.4 million premature deaths, which spells trouble for the 150 million people who live along the Mediterranean coastline, and the 270 million tourists who are drawn to these waters every single year.
    

            The Mediterranean Sea laps up against 46,000 kilometers (nearly 29,000 miles) of coastline in 22 countries, many with different environmental standards and practices.
    

            Egypt, which contributes 0.25 million tons of plastic that ends up in the Mediterranean, is the worst offender, the group says, followed by Turkey, which contributes 0.11 million tons and Italy, which contributes 0.04 million tons of plastic to the polluted sea – all part of the 1.9 million plastic fragments per square meter.
    

            Medical experts consulted for the WWF report say that humans can ingest microplastics from aquatic environments through the consumption of marine organisms and through water (both drinking and bottled).
    

            “Over 840 microplastics can be ingested per year from the consumption of three main commercial fish species (sea bass and two types of mackerel), [and] up to 11 thousand from the high consumption of bivalves (e.g. mussels, clams etc.),” the report states, noting that less contamination comes from eating shrimp.
    

            “If we also count the exposure from air and food not coming from aquatic environments we can ingest over 100 thousand microplastics every day.”
    

            At the seaside town of Ostia near Rome, Pierluigi Capozzi scans the sea from his restaurant, Mediterraneo. “Maybe 50 years ago, people didn’t know what we know now about pollution and plastic,” he tells CNN. “But I see young people without any problems throw plastic bottles into the sea, throw rubbish on the ground, cigarettes, garbage.”
    

            But he does see a bright spot. A decade ago, every morning the sand outside his beachfront restaurant was covered with chemicals from the cargo ships that traverse the shipping lanes visible from the coastline. “Thanks to better regulation, that chemical pollution is gone now,” he says.
    

            The Mediterranean is one of the world’s major reservoirs of marine and coastal diversity, according to the Med Sea Alliance, which works to advocate for the fishing industry through better practices.
    

            They say that the heavy pollution is negatively impacting the sea’s rich flora and fauna. Despite only covering 0.7 percent of the world’s ocean area, the sea has 7.5 percent of the world’s marine fauna, and 18 percent of the world’s marine flora.
    

            Fishing is a €4.6 billion industry in the Mediterranean, and water pollution has greatly impacted the livelihood of the 180,000 people who rely on fishing for their livelihoods, says the WWF.
    

            The UN’s Environmental Program says sea catches in the Mediterranean have fallen by 34% in the last 50 years, due to both over-fishing and plastics in the water.
    

            “Around 730 tonnes of plastic waste end up daily in the Mediterranean Sea,” the group says. “Plastic waste represents 95 to 100% of marine floating waste and 50% of litter on sea beds. In tonnage, plastic could outweigh fish stocks.”

            A 2023 study by the Archipelago Institute of Marine Conservation in Greece examined 25 marine animals including eight dolphins, two monk seals and 15 sea turtles and found microplastic pollutants in all of them. “In particular, among other types of plastic, a total of 10,639 microplastic fibers were detected in the gastrointestinal tract of the dead marine mammals and turtles.”
    

            Raffaele Marfella, a professor of advanced science at the Vanvitelli University in Naples, says plastic pollution is an urgent global problem that goes beyond harm to the environment.
    

            Citing a recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine, he highlights the link between microplastics and nanoplastics known as MNPs and certain cardiovascular diseases. “Current knowledge suggests that MNPs can enter the bloodstream through ingestion or inhalation, triggering inflammation and oxidative stress. Over time, chronic exposure to MNPs can accelerate the progression of atherosclerosis and increase the likelihood of cardiovascular events.”
    

            Plastic pollution is considered a “forever” pollutant, meaning once it becomes invasive, it is there to stay.
    

            Beach-goer Francesco Pacelli told CNN that it breaks his heart when he sees people leaving their garbage and bottles on the water’s edge.
    

            “It is so important to keep a beach clean, the water it is more beautiful,” he says. “In my opinion it is very important, especially for fish, animals with all the plastic that floats around.”
    

            If humans don’t do their part to stop the scourge of water pollution, the dream Mediterranean vacation could soon turn into a nightmare.

CNN_15,"Global tech outage leaves thousands stranded at airports amid disruptions at hospitals, government agencies and 911 systems",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/us/flights-canceled-delayed-global-it-outage/index.html,2024-07-20 15:57:00,us,"
            What could be “the largest IT outage in history” has disrupted sectors across the globe – leaving thousands of passengers stranded at airports, emergency communication services down and blood donation centers without vital shipments.
    

            Airlines, businesses, government agencies, health and emergency services, banks and schools and universities around the world ground to a halt or saw services disrupted due to a flawed software update for Microsoft Windows operating systems issued by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, experts told CNN. CrowdStrike’s CEO said a fix has been deployed, but experts say getting systems back in order will be a lengthy process.
    

            As of early Saturday, hundreds of flights flights into, out of or within the United States were  canceled or delayed. The day before, more than 3,000 flights had been canceled and more than 11,000 delayed, according to FlightAware.com.
    

            All flights were grounded for United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Allegiant Airlines on Friday. Airlines later announced they were resolving issues and resuming flights.
    

            Frustrated passengers lined up at airports backed up with flight cancellations and delays, missing life events like funerals and birthdays.

Global tech outage: What to know if you’re traveling this weekend


            After spending more than 19 hours at Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, one passenger won’t be getting home to Los Angeles anytime soon.
    

            “I couldn’t get another flight rebooked because the system is down, so I couldn’t get any vouchers for food, hotel, nothing,” Kiah Hampton told CNN on Friday afternoon.
    

            Hampton described sleeping on the floor at the airport after a previous flight was canceled last night, adding, “It seems like I am going to have to sleep here tonight.”
    

            New Jersey resident Jennifer Small likewise slept at the airport overnight and had her flight canceled twice.
    

            “I want to get home to my son. I want to get home to Jersey,” Small said, adding she doesn’t believe she will be able to travel home until Saturday.
    

            Thousands of people crammed together in airports across the country, waiting for answers. Passengers Ty Kelley, who was traveling to Philadelphia to attend a funeral, described it as a chaotic scene.
    

            “It’s wild, it’s crazy, it’s crowded — I have anxiety right now,” she said. “I’m going to wait in this long line and try and get to Philadelphia today.”
    

            Another passenger told CNN she had been traveling with her toddler to Boston for a birthday party. “It has been frustrating to say the least,” Spirit Airlines customer Miya Haney said.
    

            The issues didn’t just plague airports. Americans felt the impacts of the outage in various facets of their everyday lives, including while trying to call 911 during emergencies in some areas, getting or renewing their driver’s licenses or shipping or receiving packages.
    

            There have been reports of 911 outages in various states, like Alaska, and cities, like Phoenix, where the system was down for hours but has since been restored. Meanwhile, in New York City, 911 services are working.
    

Driver’s license offices are closed or have limited services in Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina and Georgia because of the ongoing outages.
    

            Shipping companies, namely UPS and FedEx, are warning customers there may be some service delays Friday because of the tech outage.
    

            Meanwhile, thousands of companies around the world are struggling with payment processing after the outage brought down systems across a wide range of businesses. The ongoing is also impacting major hotels, including Marriott International and some Hilton hotels.
    

            Cybercriminals are already capitalizing on the chaos by promoting fake websites filled with malicious software designed to compromise unsuspecting victims, according to warnings from the US government and multiple cybersecurity professionals.
    

            Former McAfee CEO Dave DeWalt told CNN that a group of private sector and government agencies worked overnight to “ascertain the threat” and find a solution to the global outage. The call included the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and other private and government organizations.
    

            CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz apologized to customers Friday for the outage and said the company is working with those affected.
    

            “We understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption,” Kurtz posted on X. “We are working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on.”
    

            But that could be easier said than done: Manual restarts of individual systems take time and expertise that some customers don’t have, which is why companies are slow to recover from the outage.
    

            CrowdStrike promised customers “full transparency” on how the outage occurred and that it will “prevent anything like this from happening again.”
    

            While most hospitals remained open to treat medical emergencies, some said an inability to access electronic medical records and order lab tests and prescriptions had caused them to cancel patient appointments and surgeries.
    

            Hospital workers have scrambled to provide needed care to patients without the technology they rely on.
    

            Kim Brown was near the end of her shift Thursday night as a labor and delivery nurse at Kaiser Permanente in San Jose, California, when the hospital’s computer systems, which it relies on to care for women in labor and their babies, went down.
    

            “All of our babies get little plastic tags that will set off an alarm if they get too close to an exit or an elevator. That went down,” Brown said. “It was unnerving because we had zero information. It was just, ‘Oh, well, everything’s out now.’“
    

            With the outage posing a security risk to newborn babies, the hospital called security guards to sit by the elevators to keep them safe.
    

            At the postpartum care unit in Dignity Health California Hospital Medical Center in Los Angeles, nurse Laura Topete said she ran into a roadblock trying to get analgesic drugs for a woman who was in pain after delivery, but couldn’t access the doctor’s orders to see what kind of medications she could have.
    

            “The patient was in pain longer than she needed to be,” Topete said.
    

            Epic Systems, a company that makes widely used electronic health records systems for hospitals and doctors’ offices, said on Friday that its Nebula cloud-based platform had been impacted by the outage overnight and that some services, including telehealth visits, were not available during the outage. Another electronic medical records company, Veradigm, also said its systems were impacted by the CrowdStrike outage.
    

            A spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services said it is “working to assess the impact of the Crowdstrike outage on patient care and HHS systems, services, and operations,” along with federal, state, local and private sector partners.
    

            In addition to hospitals, blood donation centers have experienced challenges and are altering blood shipment methods due to flight delays. New York Blood Center, which supplies about 200 hospitals in the Northeast, initiated an emergency driving operation to distribute collected blood. And Blood Assurance was concerned for its planned shipment of at least 20 platelets — the disc-shaped fragments that help with clotting — due to flight issues.
    

            The impacts of the global tech outage were felt across the US as countless government agencies waited for services to get back to normal.
    

            The mayor of Portland, Oregon, issued an emergency declaration due to the ongoing outage. It affected the city’s servers in city data centers, employee computers and single sign-on to cloud services, Mayor Ted Wheeler said in a news release.
    

            In Southern California, the disruption is causing connectivity issues at the Los Angeles County Superior Court and it temporarily limited jail bookings in San Diego County, officials said.

            Elsewhere, some voting locations in Arizona experienced outages in Maricopa County as early voting continues in the state’s primary, according to the Maricopa County Elections Department. The county is the fourth-most populous in the US and is home to Phoenix, the county website said.
    

            The governor of New York described impacts of the outage on transportation links and health care facilities as an “unprecedented situation.” The state’s top priority, however, is emergency services.
    

            “We are working with localities to ensure that 911 systems are operational,” Gov. Kathy Hochul said. The 911 system is working in all 62 state counties, according to Hochul.
    

            On a federal level, the United States Customs and Border Protection experienced “processing delays” that may lead to longer wait times at US ports of entry. CBP said it is working to restore its systems to full capacity and mitigate impacts on its operations as well as on international trade and travel, a spokesperson said Friday.
    

            The Social Security Administration closed its local offices to the public on Friday after the outage shut down numerous services. The agency said in a statement that it expects longer wait times for the national 800 phone number, and some online services may be unavailable.
    

            The US Department of Justice said in a memo that it is searching for workarounds but warned staff that the CrowdStrike issue “is significant and there is currently no estimated restoration time.”

CNN_16,"Facing difficult frontline reality and the prospect of Trump in the White House, Zelensky hints at negotiations with Russia",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/europe/ukraine-zelensky-uncertainty-russia-negotiations-intl/index.html,2024-07-20 16:24:00,world,"
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky struck an unusually subdued tone as he addressed his nation this week, hinting at a willingness to negotiate with Russia for the first time since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion more than two years ago.
    

            Zelensky suggested Moscow should send a delegation to the next peace summit that he hopes to hold in November. Russia was not invited to the previous peace conference, held in Switzerland last month, as Zelensky said any talks could only happen after a Russian withdrawal from Ukraine.
    

            Kyiv is currently facing the double whammy of a difficult frontline situation and political uncertainty over the level of future support from Ukraine’s closest allies.
    

            While the progress Russian troops are making in eastern Ukraine has slowed significantly since US weapons started arriving in the country in May, it has not stopped entirely. Russia is still gaining territory, albeit at a much slower pace.

            At the same time, questions are emerging about the willingness of some of Ukraine’s closest and most important allies – notably the United States and Germany – to continue pouring resources into the conflict in support of Kyiv.
    

            Speaking to reporters on Monday, Zelensky said Ukraine was not receiving enough Western assistance to win the war, pointing out that its outcome will be determined way beyond Ukraine’s borders.
    

            “Not everything depends on us. We know what would be a just end to the war, but it doesn’t depend only on us. It depends not only on our people and our desire, but also on finance, on weapons, on political support, on unity in the EU, in NATO, in the world,” the president said.
    

            Former US Ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst said it was plausible Zelensky’s shift in tone was a reaction to the events unfolding in the United States, where former President Donald Trump on Monday announced a staunch critic of sending support to Ukraine, JD Vance, as his running mate.
    

            Speaking to CNN from the Aspen Security Forum, Herbst said that it was possible Zelensky was trying to reach out to the potential future Trump administration by stressing he would be willing to negotiate – as long as the deal on the table is just.
    

            “It has to be (a) reasonable peace, which does not permit Russian occupiers to continue to torture, repress and murder the people of Ukraine who are being occupied,” he said. Russia has repeatedly denied accusations of torture and human rights abuses in Ukraine despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
    

            Trump and Zelensky spoke on Friday in what Trump called a “had a very good phone call”.
    

            The former president said he would “bring peace to the world and end the war that has cost so many lives” while Zelensky said the two discussed “what steps can make peace fair and truly lasting.”
    

            Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeated several times in recent months that he would be willing to negotiate with Ukraine – albeit on terms that remain completely unacceptable to Ukraine and its Western allies.
    

            Putin said Russia would end its war in Ukraine if Kyiv surrendered the entirety of four regions claimed by Moscow: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Large swathes of these regions remain under Ukrainian control, so he is essentially asking Ukraine to give up territory without a fight. Putin also said any peace deal would require Ukraine to abandon its bid to join NATO, prompting Kyiv to call the proposal “offensive to common sense.”
    

            Orysia Lutsevych, deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House, said that considering Putin’s public demands, Zelensky’s words were likely meant as a message to the rest of the world.

            “It’s both a signal to Russia and a signal to the global south that Ukraine is not some kind of obstructive force. It is willing to sit at the negotiating table. But this cannot be totally on Russian terms, and it cannot lead to (the) capitulation of Ukraine to Russia … Putin is demanding the control of regions he can’t conquer militarily,” she told CNN.
    

            Lutsevych believes Putin has stepped up his calls for negotiations because he knows his window of opportunity may be closing.
    

            Despite being considerably bigger and stronger than Ukraine, Russia has not managed to fulfil its territorial goals – even when Kyiv was receiving only limited help from the West. Moscow’s initial attempt to take the capital ended up in a defeat and the front lines have not moved considerably in more than a year.
    

            New US military assistance started reaching the front lines in Ukraine in May, after months of delays caused by political deadlock in the US Congress. At the same time, Ukraine finally received permission from some Western nations to use their weapons to strike targets inside Russia – although only in limited circumstances and in areas near the border with Ukraine.
    

            While this has helped slow Russian progress and averted a possible reoccupation of the Kharkiv region, Ukraine is still defending territory, rather than pushing forward to reclaim areas currently under Russian occupation.
    

            “Ukrainian forces are going to have to accumulate equipment, material and manpower for a future counteroffensive operation, and that’s part of the Russian calculus that we are seeing – the Russian military command very much appears to be pursuing a strategy where they are conducting consistent, grinding offensive operations throughout the entire front line,” said Riley Bailey, a Russia analyst at the US-based Institute for the Study of War.
    

            By making gradual, creeping advances along the more than 600-mile-long (1,000 kilometer) front line, Russia is forcing Ukraine to commit to defensive operations rather than gear up for a counteroffensive, Bailey said.
    

            “They will need to degrade the Russian forces and capabilities that are part of the offensive operations, which would bring some more flexibility and ease some of the pressure,” Bailey said. “Ukraine can then start making some operational choices that it hasn’t been able to make in the past few months.”
    

            But the success of any future Ukrainian counteroffensive will depend primarily on how much support it receives from its Western allies going forward. Zelensky said this week that the current level of support was enough to hold off further Russian advances, but not win the war.
    

            This week brought more uncertainty on that front, as Trump announced that he had picked Vance as his vice-presidential nominee. Vance has previously suggested Ukraine should negotiate with Russia because the US and other allies do not have the capacity to support it. Trump himself has claimed he would “end the war in one day” and said the US shouldn’t be sending money to Ukraine with no strings attached.
    

            At the same time, it emerged that Germany, which is among Ukraine’s biggest supporters, plans to halve its military aid to Ukraine next year – although it suggested Ukraine should be able to meet the bulk of its military needs with the $50 billion in loans from the proceeds of frozen Russian assets approved by the G7 last month.
    

            If the worst-case scenario for Ukraine was to materialize – if the US stopped providing aid, Europe didn’t step up its assistance and Ukraine wasn’t able to access the frozen Russian assets – Russia would likely start to make much bigger gains.
    

            Herbst said that if the Democrats win the US presidential election in November, the current US policy of supporting Ukraine is likely to continue, with more aid flowing in.
    

            “If Trump were to win, we don’t know what he will do. But we know that there are serious people on his national security team who will understand that Putin is a direct threat to American interests and that it is important or critical to the US that Putin lose in Ukraine,” he added.
    

            But Herbst said there is one more factor which could convince a possible Trump administration to keep helping Ukraine.
    

            “If his team cuts off aid, and Ukraine collapses, that will be a major defeat to the United States, caused by the Trump team. And a defeat that would dwarf the embarrassment and the damage done by Biden’s incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan. And there will be people on his team that will understand that,” he said.
    

            Analysts expect the Ukraine aid package – the more than $60 billion approved by the US Congress earlier this year – to last Kyiv about a year to 18 months, which could be enough time for Ukraine to regroup and launch a new counteroffensive.
    

            Lutsevych said that Ukraine desperately needs to make battlefield gains and then see if there is a real desire by Russia to negotiate – which she says doesn’t currently come across as genuine.
    

            “But what evidence do we have that Russians are willing to negotiate? Putin is putting his country on a total war footing,” she said, adding that the war will likely end only if Moscow begins to feel threatened.
    

            “I think this war will end when Putin begins to feel that the Russian control over Crimea is threatened.”

The West finally allowed Ukraine to strike back at Russia. It seems to be working


            Ukraine has already stepped up its attacks against the peninsula, illegally annexed by Russia in 2014 and home to Moscow’s Black Sea fleet. Kyiv claims its military has struck and sunk or severely damaged several Russian warships in the area, disabling at least a third of Russia’s Black Sea fleet.
    

            Ukraine has also managed to hit and temporarily shut down the Kerch Strait bridge that connects Crimea with Russia on several occassions. The southern front – which stretches from the Donbas in eastern Ukraine across the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, with Russian-occupied territory creating a land bridge between Russia and Crimea – will be a key target.
    

            While Zelensky’s tone might have shifted this week, his position on what a peace deal should look like hasn’t, or at least not publicly. The majority of Ukrainians do not want the government to give up any territory at all.
    

            “Right now, it is politically difficult, if not impossible, to state that a peace can be achieved without the full return of all Ukrainian territories. But that doesn’t mean that over time, it couldn’t become possible,” Herbst said.
    

            He believes Kyiv could “speak with some justification of Ukrainian victory in this war,” even if Ukraine doesn’t manage to get back all of its pre-war territory – as long as it reclaims enough to be an economically viable and secure state.
    

            “But for it to be a secure state, especially in those circumstances, it must be a member of NATO. I believe that if this were truly on the table, meaning with the full faith and power of the United States behind it, this in theory could lead to a stable peace,” he said.
    

            “It wouldn’t be a just peace, because you’re still consigning millions of Ukrainians to the tender mercies of a vicious regime of the Kremlin, which has shown it has no love — and that’s a very polite way to phrase it — for Ukrainians who believe they are Ukrainians, and not little Russians.”

CNN_17,Federal class action lawsuit is seeking refunds on behalf of ticketed fans after chaos at Copa América final,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/sport/copa-america-finals-match-lawsuit-ticketed-fans/index.html,2024-07-20 16:06:00,world,"
            A federal class action lawsuit was filed Friday on behalf of ticketed fans who were not allowed into the Copa América finals match at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, on Sunday, after “thousands of unticketed fans” breached security, prompting them to shut the stadium gates.
    

            Listed as defendants in the lawsuit are Hard Rock Stadium, international soccer organizations South American Football Confederation and the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football, and security firm Best Crowd Management.
    

            An estimated 65,300 tickets were sold for the match between Argentina and Colombia on Sunday.
    

            The match had to be delayed for more than an hour after fans without tickets forcibly attempted to enter the stadium, according to a stadium spokesperson. After the security breach, a decision was made to reopen the stadium gates “for a short period of time to all fans to prevent stampedes and serious injury at the perimeter,” a stadium spokesperson said at the time – noting a “serious concern of fans being crushed in an attempt to enter.”

            The lawsuit claims the defendants “failed to implement an adequate and reasonable security and safety plan,” including not hiring enough security personnel, failing to predict the size of “unticketed attendees” and not establishing a perimeter to check for tickets.
    

            “The scene that unfolded was on television and social media was astonishing, bloodied fans, parents protecting children from criminal acts, fans assaulting each other, stadium staff and local police,” the complaint states.
    

            The complaint says the defendants should have foreseen the chaos that erupted, and they ignored their duty to protect ticket holders.
    

            The lead plaintiff, Das Nobel, said he paid nearly $10,000 for four tickets and almost $15,000 for travel and lodging arrangements. He alleges he did not see anyone scanning tickets when he arrived at the stadium. Instead, he saw the Southeast gate was shut and locked, according to the lawsuit.
    

            Noble said he and his family waited for hours to get into the stadium, before they returned to their hotel. During their wait, he said he “witnessed dozens of fans climbing onto a storefront, breaking into the stadium, scaling fences, and throwing backpacks over,” according to the complaint. Noble alleges he was not allowed into the stadium to watch the match.
    

            “Hard Rock Stadium was responsible for implementing the security plans negotiated with CONMEBOL and CONCACAF and implementing protocols designed for fan safety. Hard Rock Stadium hired BEST security for additional assistance,” the complaint states.

            The South American Football Confederation, or CONMEBOL, said in a release Monday that they were “subject to decisions made by the Hard Rock Stadium authorities” and that certain procedures “were not taken into account.”
    

            In response, Hard Rock Stadium said in a statement that it “implemented, and in many cases exceeded CONMEBOL’s security recommendations throughout the tournament and the Final.”
    

            The lawsuit seeks full ticket refunds, interest and reimbursement for travel expenses for people who paid to enter the stadium but were denied entry. The class would consist of people who purchased tickets but were not allowed to watch the match in the stadium.
    

            The complaint does not seek damages related to any personal injuries.
    

            Hard Rock Stadium and CONMEBOL told CNN separately that they cannot comment on litigation.
    

            When asked about refunds for ticketholders who were not allowed into the stadium, a stadium official told CNN on Friday that “fans who purchased tickets on the primary market and were denied entry to the match are encouraged to reach out to Ticketmaster to request a refund. Ticketmaster will take the claim and provide next steps to the customer. Fans who purchased tickets on the secondary market should direct their refund request to the entity from which they purchased.”

            CNN has reached out to Best Crowd Management for comment.
    

            Another lawsuit was filed by ticket holder Jacqueline Martinez on Monday.
    

            Martinez said she bought four tickets for more than $4,000 to attend the match with her family, but they were unable to enter the stadium because of the crowds. Martinez is seeking $50,000 in damages to cover a refund for their expenses and emotional distress, according to the complaint.

CNN_18,"Democratic consensus solidifies around Harris, should Biden step aside",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/politics/democratic-consensus-harris-should-biden-step-aside/index.html,2024-07-20 17:40:00,politics,"
            No one quite knows what the process of picking a new nominee would be if Joe Biden did step aside – but many Democrats say that any process is likelier than ever to quickly end with Vice President Kamala Harris as the nominee.


            The informal conversations about how a fight to replace Biden at the top of the ticket would play out have been raging for weeks behind the scenes. But uncertainty about the process has been so unclear it’s given multiple Democrats – even those with serious concerns about Biden – pause about coming out against the president’s candidacy, given that what comes next could be even messier.
    

            “F**k it, I’m coconut pilled. I just want this to stop,” said one well-known Democratic operative, referring to the online meme that has taken off from an old video of the vice president telling a story of her mother saying, “You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?”
    

            It’s not that everyone has suddenly coalesced – but exhaustion is gelling into consensus.


            Internal polls that show arris would at least be more helpful to boosting Democratic enthusiasm and aiding down ballot races are getting passed around. Arguments that she would be fastest to put together a campaign are landing harder. Daydreams of her making a more active and vigorous case against Donald Trump are taking root.
    

            Many are deliberately holding off talking about hypotheticals as Biden aides say he plans to get back on the campaign trail next week once he recovers from Covid-19. But if that suddenly changes, two dozen leading Democratic politicians and operatives told CNN, they can’t realistically see this ending any other way.
    

            Some are pushing for a fast and closed process, where delegates would bless the swap as part of their planned pre-convention virtual nomination plan.
    

            Some reject the idea of a coronation, either because they prefer others or don’t like the way that would look. But – though there are musings about quickly creating a series of blitz primaries or town halls – no one can agree how that would work with just over 100 days until the election and much less than that before Democrats are scheduled to gather in Chicago. Still, it’s an idea some Harris backers support, doubting that anyone serious would challenge her, as much chest puffing as there is behind the scenes.
    

            Multiple Democratic members of Congress who have called for Biden to go declined on Friday when asked by CNN if they were ready to say they want Harris to be the nominee.
    

            If nothing else, people connected with several of the other possible most serious options and others acknowledge, they would likely feel boxed in by both party loyalty and their own future ambitions. Pressure will be high to unify after the last month of infighting, and anyone who takes her on would be risking torpedoing their reputation with the base in a potential 2028 open primary if she were seen as weakened by that and went on to lose.
    

            Some Democrats believe, even with the threat of early ballot deadlines, it could be settled on the floor of the convention in late August. If this stretches out that long, though, multiple Democrats predicted that the hunger for resolution will only intensify.
    

            That’s become ever more likely, those politicians and operatives say, both by how much closer they are to Election Day and by how impressed they’ve been by how the vice president has handled these weeks of Democratic crisis. They argue the vice president has not been caught scheming, even in private conversations, and instead has showcased being fiery and loyal to Biden at a series of campaign stops, which will continue on Saturday at a fundraiser she’s headlining in Provincetown, Massachusetts.
    

            “I do believe it has to be the vice president. She’s campaigning vigorously under the mantle and she’s the natural successor. It’s going to be important in the scenario that the president isn’t the nominee that we rally around her immediately,” said one Democratic House member who asked not to be named so as not to be seen undercutting the president.
    

            Few can conceive of Biden stepping aside and not tapping his running mate to take over. To do otherwise would be a devastating insult to her of the sort that pained Biden himself so much when Barack Obama turned to Hillary Clinton over him ahead of the 2016 election. He’d also be undercutting his own judgment in picking her four years ago as ready for the job, which he reiterated at his news conference last week.
    

            And it would mean passing over a Black vice president after Black voters and Black leaders— including South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, who has said repeatedly he wants Harris if not Biden — not only sustained him to victory in 2020 but are some of the ones standing most strongly with him through this now.
    

            That kind of support would likely only lead to more, which would be convincing to delegates and voters alike — and make taking her on, even with her history of a failed 2020 campaign and rocky start in the vice presidency, harder and harder.
    

            Eleni Kounalakis, the lieutenant governor of California and a Democratic convention delegate who is part of its rules and bylaws committee – as well as an old friend of Harris – said that it’s important to remember, if the president were to step down, that he won Democratic primaries while talking about “Biden-Harris” accomplishments.
    

            “When people voted for him as the nominee they were voting for this ticket, so it just has to be concluded that the best way to validate the vote of the primary voters is to support the vice president as our nominee,” she said. “There’s so much respect for President Biden that if he asked delegates to support her, even with a public chaotic media swirl, I believe most delegates would honor his wishes as the person who was chosen through the primary process and as our president.”
    

            Thinking like that resonates down-ballot as well.
    

            “I think Democratic frontliners know better than anybody else the power of stability. When there is chaos, they’re the ones who suffer the consequences,” an aide to one Democrat in a frontline district told CNN. “Frontliners are like the stock market.”
    

            Democratic politicians and senior aides across national politics fear that unleashing an open process at the convention would be a mess, prolonging the party’s drama and cratering support from the powerful Congressional Black Caucus, a force for mobilizing grassroots support and driving up enthusiasm in November.
    

            Even some Democratic members up for reelection in swing districts also see little upside in the party engaging in a weekslong sojourn to battle test a new face of the party and that assumes that anyone would even want to go up against Harris, risking their own political future if they were to be unsuccessful now.
    

            “The internal fight is killing us. There is no world in which you can push Kamala to the side,” one Democratic member told CNN on the condition of anonymity to discuss the difficult political moment Democrats find themselves in.
    

            People who have long disliked Harris haven’t suddenly changed their minds. Amnesia hasn’t suddenly set in about her past weaknesses or problems. That’s been part of the calculations Biden is making himself as he deliberates what to do.
    

            Texas Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, who is running for reelection in a tough race, told CNN he was surprised by how quickly the conversation had moved from people saying just a few months ago that Harris would be a drag on the ticket and Biden might consider replacing her.
    

            “I just don’t understand how we go from that to the idea that she should be leading the ticket,” Gonzalez said. “I have nothing against her, but the facts are just the facts. Not everything changed, right? How did how did we go from that to this? I mean, nowhere else in the world but this town, right?”
    

            Republican operatives tell CNN they are salivating – not just at going back through the old attacks and the videos of her word-salad answers but asking her over and over about what she knew and when she knew it about Biden’s health and effects of aging. They’ll push for Biden to resign, to create more chaos and take her off the trail more.
    

            They’ll also question not just the legitimacy of her coming through whatever rushed process is chosen, but of whether she can legally be replaced on the ballot. House Speaker Mike Johnson’s comment in an interview this week that “there’s some preliminary research being done” is making the rounds, with real concerns that ballot access that could be affected if Democrats move ahead with a completely new candidate that comes out of a brokered convention.
    

            And already in 2020 when Biden put Harris on the ticket, some went beyond just deliberately mispronouncing her first name, but threatening lawsuits about whether she is constitutionally eligible to serve, hooking the flawed argument on that neither of her parents were born in America.
    

            They’re not the only ones.
    

            “If you think that’s going to be an easy transition, I’m here to tell you that a huge amount of the donor class, a huge amount of the elites, a huge amount of these folks in these rooms that I see that are pushing for Joe Biden to not be the nominee also are not interested in seeing the vice president be the nominee,” New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on an Instagram live chat on Thursday evening.
    

            Some progressives have said behind the scenes, meanwhile, that they trust Biden to be more aligned with their agenda than they do Harris – and that is part of why so many have stuck with him.
    

            To others, the political conversation is lagging behind the way this is landing to many outside Washington and the people who obsess over internal polls and donor data.
    

            “To some degree she’s auditioning for the presidency right now,” said Ashley Etienne, her former communications director and a longtime Hill aide still in touch with many current members. “She’s well positioned to shore up confidence about Joe Biden while assuring people that she’s ready. She needs to do that in more profound ways. The campaign needs to create opportunities for her to do that.”
    

            To Rep. Jared Golden, a Maine Democrat who has called for Biden to step aside and said he doesn’t think he could vote for the president, thinking of a move toward Harris is just logical.
    

            “I think that many Americans are thinking that there’s a very high likelihood that if the Biden-Harris ticket wins, that Kamala will finish that second term, Golden said. “So, it might beg the question: Why not just settle that matter in this election?”

CNN_19,"Restorations underway after global tech outage strands thousands at airports, disrupts hospitals and agencies",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/us/flights-canceled-delayed-global-it-outage/index.html,2024-07-20 17:39:00,us,"
            Operations are gradually being restored but delays are expected after “the largest IT outage in history” disrupted sectors across the globe, leaving thousands of passengers stranded at airports, emergency communication services down and blood donation centers without vital shipments.
    

            Airlines, businesses, government agencies, health and emergency services, banks and schools and universities around the world ground to a halt or saw services disrupted due to a flawed software update for Microsoft Windows operating systems issued by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, experts told CNN.
    

            CrowdStrike’s CEO said a fix has been deployed, but experts say getting systems back in order will be a lengthy process.
    

            As of early Saturday, hundreds of flights into, out of or within the United States were canceled or delayed. The day before, more than 3,000 flights had been canceled and more than 11,000 delayed, according to FlightAware.com.
    

            All flights were grounded for United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Allegiant Airlines on Friday. Airlines later announced they were resolving issues and resuming flights.
    

            Major airlines have said that services are being restored. A majority of United Airlines systems have recovered from a worldwide software outage, the airline said in a statement.
    

            “While most of our systems have recovered from the worldwide third-party software outage, we may continue to experience some disruption to our operation, including flight delays and cancellations,” United said.
    

            Jetstar Japan, Hong Kong Express and Cebu Pacific airlines said Saturday their operations are gradually being restored too.
    

            Frustrated passengers lined up at airports backed up with flight cancellations and delays, missing life events like funerals and birthdays.

            After spending more than 19 hours at Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, one passenger won’t be getting home to Los Angeles anytime soon.
    

            “I couldn’t get another flight rebooked because the system is down, so I couldn’t get any vouchers for food, hotel, nothing,” Kiah Hampton told CNN on Friday afternoon.
    

            Hampton described sleeping on the floor at the airport after a previous flight was canceled last night, adding, “It seems like I am going to have to sleep here tonight.”
    

            New Jersey resident Jennifer Small likewise slept at the airport overnight and had her flight canceled twice.
    

            “I want to get home to my son. I want to get home to Jersey,” Small said, adding she doesn’t believe she will be able to travel home until Saturday.
    

            Thousands of people crammed together in airports across the country, waiting for answers. Passengers Ty Kelley, who was traveling to Philadelphia to attend a funeral, described it as a chaotic scene.
    

            “It’s wild, it’s crazy, it’s crowded — I have anxiety right now,” she said. “I’m going to wait in this long line and try and get to Philadelphia today.”
    

            Another passenger told CNN she had been traveling with her toddler to Boston for a birthday party. “It has been frustrating to say the least,” Spirit Airlines customer Miya Haney said.
    

            The issues didn’t just plague airports. Americans felt the impacts of the outage in various facets of their everyday lives, including while trying to call 911 during emergencies in some areas, getting or renewing their driver’s licenses or shipping or receiving packages.
    

            There have been reports of 911 outages in various states, like Alaska, and cities, like Phoenix, where the system was down for hours but has since been restored. Meanwhile, in New York City, 911 services are working.
    

Driver’s license offices are closed or have limited services in Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina and Georgia because of the ongoing outages.
    

            Shipping companies, namely UPS and FedEx, are warning customers there may be some service delays Friday because of the tech outage.
    

            Meanwhile, thousands of companies around the world are struggling with payment processing after the outage brought down systems across a wide range of businesses. The ongoing is also impacting major hotels, including Marriott International and some Hilton hotels.
    

            Cybercriminals are already capitalizing on the chaos by promoting fake websites filled with malicious software designed to compromise unsuspecting victims, according to warnings from the US government and multiple cybersecurity professionals.
    

            Former McAfee CEO Dave DeWalt told CNN that a group of private sector and government agencies worked overnight to “ascertain the threat” and find a solution to the global outage. The call included the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and other private and government organizations.
    

            CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz apologized to customers Friday for the outage and said the company is working with those affected.
    

            “We understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption,” Kurtz posted on X. “We are working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on.”
    

            But that could be easier said than done: Manual restarts of individual systems take time and expertise that some customers don’t have, which is why companies are slow to recover from the outage.
    

            CrowdStrike promised customers “full transparency” on how the outage occurred and that it will “prevent anything like this from happening again.”
    

            While most hospitals remained open to treat medical emergencies, some said an inability to access electronic medical records and order lab tests and prescriptions had caused them to cancel patient appointments and surgeries.
    

            Hospital workers have scrambled to provide needed care to patients without the technology they rely on.
    

            Kim Brown was near the end of her shift Thursday night as a labor and delivery nurse at Kaiser Permanente in San Jose, California, when the hospital’s computer systems, which it relies on to care for women in labor and their babies, went down.
    

            “All of our babies get little plastic tags that will set off an alarm if they get too close to an exit or an elevator. That went down,” Brown said. “It was unnerving because we had zero information. It was just, ‘Oh, well, everything’s out now.’“
    

            With the outage posing a security risk to newborn babies, the hospital called security guards to sit by the elevators to keep them safe.
    

            At the postpartum care unit in Dignity Health California Hospital Medical Center in Los Angeles, nurse Laura Topete said she ran into a roadblock trying to get analgesic drugs for a woman who was in pain after delivery, but couldn’t access the doctor’s orders to see what kind of medications she could have.
    

            “The patient was in pain longer than she needed to be,” Topete said.
    

            Epic Systems, a company that makes widely used electronic health records systems for hospitals and doctors’ offices, said on Friday that its Nebula cloud-based platform had been impacted by the outage overnight and that some services, including telehealth visits, were not available during the outage. Another electronic medical records company, Veradigm, also said its systems were impacted by the CrowdStrike outage.
    

            A spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services said it is “working to assess the impact of the Crowdstrike outage on patient care and HHS systems, services, and operations,” along with federal, state, local and private sector partners.
    

            In addition to hospitals, blood donation centers have experienced challenges and are altering blood shipment methods due to flight delays. New York Blood Center, which supplies about 200 hospitals in the Northeast, initiated an emergency driving operation to distribute collected blood. And Blood Assurance was concerned for its planned shipment of at least 20 platelets — the disc-shaped fragments that help with clotting — due to flight issues.
    

            The impacts of the global tech outage were felt across the US as countless government agencies waited for services to get back to normal.
    

            The mayor of Portland, Oregon, issued an emergency declaration due to the ongoing outage. It affected the city’s servers in city data centers, employee computers and single sign-on to cloud services, Mayor Ted Wheeler said in a news release.
    

            In Southern California, the disruption is causing connectivity issues at the Los Angeles County Superior Court and it temporarily limited jail bookings in San Diego County, officials said.

The county is the fourth-most populous in the US and is home to Phoenix, the county website said.
    

            The governor of New York described impacts of the outage on transportation links and health care facilities as an “unprecedented situation.” The state’s top priority, however, is emergency services.
    

            “We are working with localities to ensure that 911 systems are operational,” Gov. Kathy Hochul said. The 911 system is working in all 62 state counties, according to Hochul.
    

            On a federal level, the United States Customs and Border Protection experienced “processing delays” that may lead to longer wait times at US ports of entry. CBP said it is working to restore its systems to full capacity and mitigate impacts on its operations as well as on international trade and travel, a spokesperson said Friday.
    

            The Social Security Administration closed its local offices to the public on Friday after the outage shut down numerous services. The agency said in a statement that it expects longer wait times for the national 800 phone number, and some online services may be unavailable.
    

            The US Department of Justice said in a memo that it is searching for workarounds but warned staff that the CrowdStrike issue “is significant and there is currently no estimated restoration time.”

CNN_20,3 alleged gang members and an associate charged in the fatal shooting of an off-duty LAPD officer,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/14/us/gang-members-charged-arroyo-shooting/index.html,2024-07-20 17:01:00,us,"
Editor’s Note: (7/19/24) Since this story was published in January 2022, Rios, Contreras, and Cisneros pleaded guilty to one count each of conspiracy to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Rios and Cisneros were both sentenced to 50 years in federal prison and Contreras was sentenced to 35 years in federal prison, according to the US Attorney’s Office. Grisham pleaded guilty to violent crime in aid of racketeering and is expected to be sentenced in September.


            Federal prosecutors charged three alleged gang members and one alleged gang associate Thursday in the fatal shooting of off-duty Los Angeles Police Department officer Fernando Arroyos during an attempted robbery.
    

            Luis Alfredo De La Rosa Rios, 29, Ernesto Cisneros, 22, and Jesse Contreras, 34, are allegedly members of the F-13 gang, according to a US Justice Department release. Rio’s alleged girlfriend Haylee Marie Grisham, 18, was also charged.
    

            According to the complaint, Arroyos was house-hunting on Monday with his girlfriend when a black pickup truck drove up. Rios and Cisneros pointed guns at Arroyos and his girlfriend and removed items from both, including chains from Arroyos’ neck. 
    

            There was an exchange of gunfire between Arroyos and the two suspects, after which Arroyos collapsed and the two suspects fled, the release said. Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies responded to the scene and took Arroyos to a hospital where he died.

            The four defendants were in the vehicle and allegedly were at the scene of the robbery and the shooting, the complaint said. They are charged with violent crime in aid of racketeering, which carries a potential death penalty and a minimum sentence of life in federal prison without the possibility of parole. 
    

            CNN has reached out to the Los Angeles County Public Defender’s office in an attempt to contact legal representation for the defendants and is awaiting a response.
    

            Arroyos, 27, “was starting a very promising career,” LAPD Chief Michel Moore said Tuesday. He was with the department for three years and assigned to the Wilshire Division.
    

            “He found himself, after working a series of days in patrol, to have a day off, enjoying it with his girlfriend on a hunt for a house, a place to live, a place to buy and invest in this city and the future of this region,” Moore said.
    

            Arroyos is survived by his mother and stepfather.
    

            “He was the only child, he had a promising future, a bright future that was taken away, viciously, over a street robbery,” the chief said. 
    

            F-13 is a “large, multi-generational street gang that previously has been the subject of federal prosecutions, including two large racketeering cases,” the US Attorney’s office said in a news release. 
    

            The news release did not mention any connection between Arroyos and the suspects.

            At least 12 people have died and 31 others are missing after a bridge partially collapsed in China’s northern province of Shanxi, according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.

            As of 12 p.m. local time (12 a.m. ET) Saturday, search and rescue operations were ongoing after 17 cars and 8 trucks fell into the river, state media reported.
    

            China’s national fire and rescue authority said Saturday it had dispatched a rescue team made up of nearly 900 people, 90 vehicles, 20 boats and 41 drones, according to Reuters.
    

            One person has been rescued, CCTV said.
    

            Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for all-out rescue efforts Saturday and said the country is in a critical period for flood control, urging local government to take action, Reuters reported, citing local media.
    

            Parts of China have been grappling with devastating floods, just weeks after scarce rainfall and sweltering temperatures created drought conditions.
    

            In neighboring Henan province, more than 100,000 people across the province have been evacuated from their homes as a result of flooding, according to state media.
    

            In the southwestern Sichuan province, more than 30 people are also missing after flash floods hit a village in Hanyuan County early Saturday, CCTV reported citing the local emergency management agency.
    

            Authorities said sudden floods struck around 2:30 a.m. local time, while many were sleeping and caused damage to homes, roads and bridges.

CNN_22,How the world’s tech crashed all at once,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/tech/tech-outage-crowdstrike-software/index.html,2024-07-20 19:43:00,us,"
            When computers and tech systems around the world went down Friday, snarling airports, closing Social Security offices and limiting jail operations, many people had one question: How on earth could this happen in 2024?
    

            A software update from a single cybersecurity company, US-based CrowdStrike, was the root cause of the chaos, underlining the fragility of the global economy and its dependence on computer systems to which relatively few people give a passing thought.
    

            “[M]ost people believe that when the end of the world comes, it will be AI taking over some kind of nuclear power plant and shutting down electricity,” Costin Raiu, a longtime cybersecurity researcher, quipped to CNN. “While in reality, it’s more likely to be some kind of a little bit of code in a botched update, causing a cascade reaction in interdependent cloud systems.”
    

            Software updates are a critical function in society to keep computers protected from hackers. But the update process itself is crucial to get right and to safeguard from tampering. An inherent — and some say misplaced — trust in that process was punctured on Friday.
    

            Numerous Fortune 500 companies use CrowdStrike’s cybersecurity software to detect and block hacking threats. Computers running Microsoft Windows — one of the most popular software programs in the world — crashed because of the faulty way a code update issued by CrowdStrike is interacting with Windows.
    

            CrowdStrike, a multibillion-dollar firm, has expanded its footprint around the world in its more than decade of doing business. Many more businesses and governments are now protected from cyberthreats because of this, but the dominance of a handful of firms in the anti-virus and threat-detection marketplace creates its own risks, according to experts.
    

            “We trust cybersecurity providers widely but without diversity; we’ve created fragility in our technology ecosystem,” Munish Walther-Puri, the former director of cyber risk for the city of New York, told CNN.
    

            “‘Winning’ in the marketplace can aggregate risk, and then we all — consumers and companies alike — bear the costs,” Walther-Puri said.
    

            CNN has requested comment from CrowdStrike.
    

            The wide swathe of critical infrastructure providers affected by the outage is also likely to raise fresh questions among US officials and corporate executives about whether new policy tools are needed to avoid catastrophe in the future.
    

            Anne Neuberger, a senior White House tech and cybersecurity official, spoke of the “risks of consolidation” in the tech supply chain when asked about the IT outage on Friday.
    

            “We need to really think about our digital resilience not just in the systems we run but in the globally connected security systems, the risks of consolidation, how we deal with that consolidation and how we ensure that if an incident does occur it can be contained and we can recover quickly,” Neuberger said at the Aspen Security Forum in response to a question about the IT outage.
    

            The chaotic scenario that played out Friday did not involve a malicious actor, but government officials around the world will likely be gaming out what might have been.
    

            The infamous hack of the US government using SolarWinds software in 2020, which US officials blamed on Russia, came through a tampered software update. That hack was not nearly as disruptive but another alleged Russian hack in 2017 caused billions of dollars in damage to the global economy because malicious code spread like wildfire.
    

            The CrowdStrike episode “demonstrates the serious damage that could be inflicted by a malicious adversary if they were so minded,” Tobias Feakin, a former ambassador for cybersecurity and critical technology in the Australian foreign ministry, told CNN.

CNN_23,At least 13 killed in Israeli airstrikes on Nuseirat camp in central Gaza,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/middleeast/israeli-airstrikes-nuseirat-gaza-intl/index.html,2024-07-20 19:49:00,world,"
            At least 13 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes on homes in the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza on Saturday, according to hospital officials and Gaza’s Civil Defense.
    

            The toll came from two separate strikes in the camp, the officials said. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military about the latest strikes.
    

            The Civil Defense also said a residential block was hit south of Nuseirat, with hospital officials saying they received three bodies.
    

            “A short while ago, one tower [block] was bombed,” Mahdi Abdullah, a man from northern Gaza displaced in Nuseirat, told CNN. “The situation is difficult here, and I am waiting for things to calm down so that I can return to my place.”
    

            The Israeli military has launched numerous deadly strikes on Nuseirat, including the targeting of multiple UN-run schools housing displaced people. The Israeli military has said its targets were Hamas compounds operating inside the schools.
    

            Nuseirat residents described living in constant fear of being bombed and a deteriorating humanitarian situation.
    

            “The situation is scary,” said Rahma Abu Hajjaj, a 39-year-old mother of five from Nuserirat. “There are no warnings, there are no alarms when homes are bombed, we are hiding all the time and we do not know why they are targeting these homes.”
    

            The Ministry of Health in Gaza said that 37 people have been killed and 54 injured in the past 24 hours due to ongoing Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip.
    

            The ministry said the total number of deaths since October 7 now stands at 38,919 people, with another 89,622 people injured. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants killed.
    

            Israel launched its ground campaign in Gaza following Hamas’ October 7 attacks, which killed around 1,200 people.

CNN_24,Look of the Week: The surprising — and sticky — material taking over summer,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/style/leather-clothes-summer-trend-lotw/index.html,2024-07-20 19:33:00,world,"
    Editor’s Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, ‘Look of the Week’ is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days.


            As the sun baked down on New York City on Tuesday, warming the concrete jungle to temperatures upwards of 80 degrees, actor and “Longlegs” star Maika Monroe stepped out in a surprising textile: Patent sheep leather.
    

            Similarly, last week, Monroe arrived at the LA premiere of the 1990s-inspired serial killer thriller dressed in a Courrèges leather sarong and matching bra. Both outfits seemed like a bold choice for what is shaping up to be a sweltering summer across many parts of the Northern Hemisphere.
    

            But Monroe isn’t alone in choosing this unseasonal material. Despite it being July, Mia Goth — another veritable scream queen — opted for a leather corseted midi dress from Versace for her appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live earlier this month. And at the premiere of “MaXXXine” in LA, Goth wore an edgy Ludovic de saint Sernin halter-neck dress — the main event being her peek-a-boo leather bralet.
    

            You don’t have to be a horror film starlet to pull off a summer leather look, either. On July 11, Kate Hudson was snapped in Manhattan’s Soho in a sultry pair of lace-up leather pants; while across the pond, British radio and TV presenter Vick Hope arrived at Wimbledon in a full burgundy leather vest, shorts and a collarless leather overcoat (granted, London’s weather has been a little more accommodating to leather this summer). Rita Ora — who has, it seems, committed to exclusively wearing scarlet in promotion of her new film “Descents: The Rise of Red” — wore not one, but two entirely leather outfits around New York.
    

            At what point did we start to see the off-season potential of leather? Once a firm staple of winter wardrobes, the material is seemingly summer’s hottest trend. It began with Bottega Veneta, the Italian fashion house largely credited with pushing the boundary of the textile — symbolically and literally. In September 2022, creative director Matthieu Blazy sent a stream of leather optical illusions down the Fall-Winter runway. Since then, we’ve had blue jeans, plaid shirts and woven beach bags rendered in meticulous detail, redefining what leather could be.
    

            Or could it be a case of a trickle-down effect from our reigning pop stars? Dua Lipa opened her Glastonbury Festival headliner set in a custom Chrome Hearts leather mini-dress; while Rosalía — also known to her fleet of fans as Motomami — wore a pair of high-shine leather pants for her Coachella set in Palm Springs. Charli XCX, creator of the unequivocal album of the summer, “Brat,” has spoken openly about her love for scuffed-up YSL leather coats, and is often spotted off-duty donning a variety of biker jackets.
    

            Wherever the trend has come from, one thing is for certain: A leather jacket is no longer just for Christmas, but all year round.

CNN_25,What would happen if Biden decided to leave the race?,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/election-biden-presidential-race-what-matters/index.html,2024-07-20 21:13:00,politics,"
A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.


            A growing collection of congressional Democrats are calling on Joe Biden to end his reelection bid, following the president’s disastrous debate performance last month and his failure since to convince members of his own party that he can defeat former President Donald Trump in the fall.
    

            It would not be an easy process since Biden is already the Democrats’ presumptive nominee and the overwhelming choice of primary voters. He faced little opposition during the primary season, and the fact that he won nearly all of the party’s delegates means it’s very unlikely he’d be forced out of the race against his will.

Takeaways from CNN’s presidential debate with Biden and Trump


            That current primary system, which empowers primary voters over party bigwigs, essentially sprang from discontent after Democrats selected Vice President Hubert Humphrey as their nominee in 1968. Even after President Lyndon Johnson bowed out of the presidential race that year, recognizing his fading popularity and opposition to the war in Vietnam, Humphrey represented a continuation of Johnson’s Vietnam policy at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Violence broke out when protesters clashed with police as Humphrey accepted the nomination.
    

            Things would be very different in 2024 if Biden decided to leave the race, although Democrats’ convention will return to Chicago in August.
    

            As we first wrote back in February, if the leading candidate was to drop out of the campaign after most primaries or even during the convention, individual delegates would need to select the party’s nominee on the convention floor (or, potentially, during a virtual roll call).
    

            That would shine a spotlight on the normally niche question of who those actual delegates are. The Democratic Party set a deadline of June 22 for states to select the more than 3,900 delegates – almost all of them currently pledged to Biden – allocated as part of the primary process.
    

            These delegates aren’t just pledged to vote for Biden; they’re also approved by his campaign. So while a majority of convention delegates could decide to pick a new nominee, doing so would require massive defections from the president’s own supporters. It also means that if Biden dropped out of the race, it would largely be Biden backers who would be responsible for picking his replacement.
    

            You can assume, for instance, that Vice President Kamala Harris would be a top contender to head the ballot in such a scenario. But there would be other potential candidates who previously argued they could run a more effective campaign against Trump.
    

            Would someone like California Gov. Gavin Newsom – who offered unqualified support for Biden in the wake of Thursday’s debate – challenge Harris at the convention? Settling on a replacement could be divisive and ugly. It would be up to the delegates to decide, in a series of votes after frantic lobbying, who to pick.
    

            On the Democratic side, there is also another group to consider: the “superdelegates,” a group of about 700 senior party leaders and elected officials who are automatically delegates to the convention based on their position. Under normal party rules, they can’t vote on the first ballot if they could swing the nomination, but they’re free to vote on subsequent ballots. However, it isn’t exactly clear how those rules would be applied in the unprecedented event that Biden were to leave the race at this point. The number of superdelegates can also shift if one dies or resigns. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, the longtime Texas congresswoman, died July 19, reducing the number of superdelegates by one.
    

            It would take a drastic event for a candidate to leave the race in the few months between a party’s nominating convention in the summer and the general election in November.
    

            Democrats and Republicans have slightly different methods of dealing with this possibility. You can imagine the end result would probably be that the running mate stepped up to be on the general election ballot, but that is not necessarily guaranteed.
    

Democrats – The Democratic National Committee is empowered to fill a vacancy on the national ticket after the convention under party rules, after the party chair consults with Democratic governors and congressional leadership.
    

Republicans – If a vacancy occurs on the Republican side, the Republican National Committee can either reconvene the national convention or select a new candidate itself.
    

            An in-depth Congressional Research Service memo also notes that if an incumbent president becomes incapacitated after winning the party’s nomination, the 25th Amendment would elevate the vice president to the presidency, but party rules would determine who rises to become the party’s nominee.
    

            Neither party, according to the CRS, requires that the presidential candidate’s running mate be elevated to the top of the ticket, though that would obviously be the most likely scenario.
    

            In modern times, per the CRS, the Democrat running for vice president in 1972, Sen. Thomas Eagleton, was forced to step aside after the convention after it was discovered that he was treated for mental illness. (1972 was a very different time! Today, thankfully, there is not nearly the stigma attached to mental health.)
    

            The DNC actually needed to convene a meeting to affirm Sargent Shriver as Democratic nominee George McGovern’s second-choice running mate.
    

            If a president-elect was to die, timing is again important.
    

            Under the Constitution, it is electors meeting in state capitols who technically cast votes for the presidency. While some states require that they vote for the winner of the election in their state, in others they have leeway.
    

            The CRS memo, which cites several congressional hearings on the subject, suggests it would clearly make sense for a vice president-elect to simply assume the role of president-elect, but the law itself is murky.
    

            Under the 20th Amendment, if a president-elect dies, his or her running mate, the vice president-elect, becomes president.
    

            There could be some question, for instance, about when exactly a person becomes president-elect. Is it after the electors meet in December, or after Congress meets to count Electoral College votes on January 6?

CNN_26,"Greeks grieve, Turks celebrate as Cyprus marks 50 years of division",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/europe/cyprus-50-years-division-intl/index.html,2024-07-20 21:34:00,world,"
            Air raid sirens wailed across Cyprus’s divided capital Nicosia at dawn on Saturday as Greek Cypriots mourned, and Turkish Cypriots celebrated, 50 years since Turkey invaded part of the island in response to a brief Greek-inspired coup.
    

            The ethnically split island is a persistent source of tension between Greece and Turkey, which are both partners in NATO but are at odds over numerous issues.
    

            Their differences were laid bare on Saturday, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attending a celebratory military parade in north Nicosia to mark the day in 1974 when Turkish forces launched an offensive that they call a “peace operation.”
    

            Later in the day, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis was due to attend an event in the south of the city to commemorate what Greeks commonly refer to as the “barbaric Turkish invasion.”
    

            Mitsotakis posted an image of a blood-stained map of Cyprus on his LinkedIn page with the words “Half a century since the national tragedy of Cyprus.”
    

            There was jubilation in the north.
    

            “The Cyprus Peace Operation saved Turkish Cypriots from cruelty and brought them to freedom,” Erdogan said, criticizing the south for having a “spoiled mentality” and seeing itself as the sole ruler of Cyprus.
    

            But Erdogan left open a window to dialogue in deadlocked negotiations. “We are ready for negotiations, to meet, and to establish long-term peace and resolution in Cyprus,” he said.
    

            Peace talks are now stalled at two seemingly irreconcilable concepts - Greek Cypriots want reunification as a federation. Turkish Cypriots want a two-state settlement.
    

            Cyprus gained independence from Britain in 1960, but a shared administration between Greek and Turkish Cypriots quickly fell apart in violence that saw Turkish Cypriots withdraw into enclaves and led to the dispatch of a UN peacekeeping force.
    

            The crisis left Greek Cypriots running the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus, a member of the European Union since 2004 with the potential to derail Turkey’s own decades-long aspirations of joining the bloc.
    

            Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides, whose office represents the Greek Cypriot community in the reunification dialogue, said the anniversary was a somber occasion for reflection and for remembering the dead.
    

            “Our mission is liberation, reunification and solving the Cyprus problem,” he said. “If we really want to send a message on this tragic anniversary … it is to do anything possible to reunite Cyprus.”
    

            Turkey, he said, continued to be responsible for violating human rights and international law over Cyprus.
    

            Across the south, church services were held to remember the more than 3,000 people who died in the Turkish invasion.
    

            “It was a betrayal of Cyprus and so many kids were lost. It wasn’t just my son, it was many,” said Loukas Alexandrou, 90, as he tended the grave of his son at a military cemetery.
    

            In Turkey, state television focused on violence against Turkish Cypriots prior to the invasion, particularly on bloodshed in 1963-64 and in 1967.
    

            Turkey’s invasion took more than a third of the island and expelled more than 160,000 Greek Cypriots to the south.
    

            Reunification talks collapsed in 2017 and have been at a stalemate since. Northern Cyprus is a breakaway state recognized only by Turkey, and its Turkish Cypriot leadership wants international recognition.

            Operations are gradually being restored but delays are expected after “the largest IT outage in history” disrupted sectors across the globe, leaving thousands of passengers stranded at airports, emergency communication services down and blood donation centers without vital shipments.
    

            Airlines, businesses, government agencies, health and emergency services, banks and schools and universities around the world ground to a halt or saw services disrupted due to a flawed software update for Microsoft Windows operating systems issued by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, experts told CNN.
    

            CrowdStrike’s CEO said a fix has been deployed, but experts say getting systems back in order will be a lengthy process.
    

            According to the tracking website FlightAware, over 1,000 flights into, out of, or within the US have been cancelled and over 2,000 delayed, as of Saturday morning.
    

            On Friday, more than 3,000 flights were canceled and more than 11,000 delayed, according to FlightAware.com.
    

            Worldwide, major airlines have said that services are being restored.

            A majority of United Airlines systems have recovered from Friday’s outage, the airline said in a statement.
    

            “While most of our systems have recovered from the worldwide third-party software outage, we may continue to experience some disruption to our operation, including flight delays and cancellations,” United said.
    

            Delta Airlines is “continuing its operational recovery” after the outage prompted the airline to pause flying on Friday, according to a Saturday morning update. Still, over 600 Delta flights have been cancelled Saturday.
    

            “Additional cancelations are expected as some of Delta’s technology continues to recover from Friday morning’s vendor-caused issue,” the update said.
    

            Jetstar Japan, Hong Kong Express and Cebu Pacific airlines said Saturday their operations are gradually being restored too.
    

            Frustrated passengers lined up at airports backed up with flight cancellations and delays, some missing life events like funerals and birthdays.
    

            After spending more than 19 hours at Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, one passenger won’t be getting home to Los Angeles anytime soon.
    

            “I couldn’t get another flight rebooked because the system is down, so I couldn’t get any vouchers for food, hotel, nothing,” Kiah Hampton told CNN on Friday afternoon.
    

            Hampton described sleeping on the floor at the airport after a previous flight was canceled Thursday night, adding, “It seems like I am going to have to sleep here tonight.”
    

            New Jersey resident Jennifer Small likewise slept at the airport overnight and had her flight canceled twice.

            “I want to get home to my son. I want to get home to Jersey,” Small said, adding she didn’t believe she would be able to travel home until Saturday.
    

            Thousands of people crammed together in airports across the country, waiting for answers. Passengers Ty Kelley, who was traveling to Philadelphia to attend a funeral, described it as a chaotic scene.
    

            “It’s wild, it’s crazy, it’s crowded — I have anxiety right now,” she said. “I’m going to wait in this long line and try and get to Philadelphia today.”
    

            Another passenger told CNN she had been traveling with her toddler to Boston for a birthday party. “It has been frustrating to say the least,” Spirit Airlines customer Miya Haney said.
    

            The issues didn’t just plague airports. Americans felt the impacts of the outage in various facets of their everyday lives, including while trying to call 911 during emergencies in some areas, getting or renewing their driver’s licenses or shipping or receiving packages.
    

            There were reports of 911 outages in various states, like Alaska, and cities, like Phoenix, where the system was down for hours but has since been restored.
    

Driver’s license offices were closed or had limited services in Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina and Georgia.
    

            Meanwhile, thousands of companies around the world struggled with payment processing after the outage brought down systems across a wide range of businesses. Major hotels, including Marriott International and some Hiltons, were impacted.
    

            Cybercriminals capitalized on the chaos by promoting fake websites filled with malicious software designed to compromise unsuspecting victims, according to warnings from the US government and multiple cybersecurity professionals.
    

            Former McAfee CEO Dave DeWalt told CNN that a group of private sector and government agencies worked overnight to “ascertain the threat” and find a solution to the global outage. The call included the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and other private and government organizations.
    

            CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz apologized to customers Friday for the outage and said the company is working with those affected.
    

            “We understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption,” Kurtz posted on X. “We are working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on.”
    

            But that could be easier said than done: Manual restarts of individual systems take time and expertise that some customers don’t have, which is why companies were slow to recover from the outage.
    

            CrowdStrike promised customers “full transparency” on how the outage occurred and that it will “prevent anything like this from happening again.”
    

            While most hospitals remained open to treat medical emergencies, some said an inability to access electronic medical records and order lab tests and prescriptions had caused them to cancel patient appointments and surgeries.
    

            Hospital workers scrambled to provide needed care to patients without the technology they rely on.
    

            Kim Brown was near the end of her shift Thursday night as a labor and delivery nurse at Kaiser Permanente in San Jose, California, when the hospital’s computer systems, which it relies on to care for women in labor and their babies, went down.
    

            “All of our babies get little plastic tags that will set off an alarm if they get too close to an exit or an elevator. That went down,” Brown said. “It was unnerving because we had zero information. It was just, ‘Oh, well, everything’s out now.’“
    

            With the outage posing a security risk to newborn babies, the hospital called security guards to sit by the elevators to keep them safe.

            At the postpartum care unit in Dignity Health California Hospital Medical Center in Los Angeles, nurse Laura Topete said she ran into a roadblock trying to get analgesic drugs for a woman who was in pain after delivery, but couldn’t access the doctor’s orders to see what kind of medications she could have.
    

            “The patient was in pain longer than she needed to be,” Topete said.
    

            Epic Systems, a company that makes widely used electronic health records systems for hospitals and doctors’ offices, said on Friday that its Nebula cloud-based platform had been impacted by the outage overnight and that some services, including telehealth visits, were not available during the outage. Another electronic medical records company, Veradigm, also said its systems were impacted by the CrowdStrike outage.
    

            A spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services said it was “working to assess the impact of the Crowdstrike outage on patient care and HHS systems, services, and operations,” along with federal, state, local and private sector partners.
    

            In addition to hospitals, blood donation centers experienced challenges and altered blood shipment methods due to flight delays. New York Blood Center, which supplies about 200 hospitals in the Northeast, initiated an emergency driving operation to distribute collected blood. And Blood Assurance was concerned for its planned shipment of at least 20 platelets — the disc-shaped fragments that help with clotting — due to flight issues.
    

            The impacts of the global tech outage were felt across the US as countless government agencies waited for services to get back to normal.
    

            The mayor of Portland, Oregon, issued an emergency declaration due to the ongoing outage. It affected the city’s servers in city data centers, employee computers and single sign-on to cloud services, Mayor Ted Wheeler said in a news release.
    

            In Southern California, the disruption caused connectivity issues at the Los Angeles County Superior Court and it temporarily limited jail bookings in San Diego County, officials said.
    

            Elsewhere, some voting locations in Arizona experienced outages in Maricopa County as early voting continued in the state’s primary, according to the Maricopa County Elections Department. The county is the fourth-most populous in the US and is home to Phoenix, the county website said.
    

            The Social Security Administration closed its local offices to the public on Friday after the outage shut down numerous services. The agency said in a statement that it expected longer wait times for the national 800 phone number, and some online services may be unavailable.

CNN_28,Timeline: How the CrowdStrike outage unfolded,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/tech/timeline-crowdstrike-system-outage/index.html,2024-07-20 22:07:00,us,"
            A global software outage Friday brought many computer systems across business, healthcare, technology and government sectors to a screeching halt in under 12 hours.
    

            How did the crash unfold? Which systems have recovered, and which ones are still affected? We break it down. (All times Eastern Time.)
    

            Overnight on Thursday and into Friday, several states, including Alaska and Arizona, experience 911 service outages. Some hospitals also begin experiencing technology issues overnight, according to nurses on shift.
    

            Between 2 and 3 a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration announces that all Delta and American Airlines flights are grounded. Several minutes later, the FAA says flights from United and Allegiant Airlines have been grounded regardless of their destination.
    

            Spirit Airlines says its flight reservation system has also been affected by the outage.
    

            A few hours later, between 5 and 6 a.m., public transit systems in the Northeast begin announcing that they have been impacted. Washington, DC, public transportation services — including trains and buses — begin experiencing delays, according to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.
    

            In New York City, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, North America’s largest transportation network, says customer information systems have gone temporarily offline, but train and bus services remain unaffected.
    

            At 5:30 a.m., US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike tells customers that it was “aware of reports of crashes” of its software on Microsoft Windows operating systems, according to a company advisory viewed by CNN. CrowdStrike’s cybersecurity software — used by numerous Fortune 500 companies — detects and blocks hacking threats.
    

Between 6 and 7 a.m.: A White House National Security Council spokesperson tells CNN they are “aware of the incident and are looking into the issue and impacts.” A White House source familiar with the matter tells CNN there are no indications at this time of malicious activity, though the administration is still investigating.
    

            Global banks start reporting some service disruptions, including Australia’s Commonwealth Bank, South Africa’s Capitec, and the Bank of Israel. Australian lenders ANZ and Westpac were also impacted, according to Downdetector, a website that tracks cyber outages. Downdetector has also reported issues for New Zealand’s ASB Bank.
    

            Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler issues an emergency declaration in response to the outage that affected Bureau of Emergency Communication’s Computer Aided Dispatch system that is used for fielding emergency calls. The bureau begins taking calls manually, according to the mayor’s office.
    

            Meanwhile, United Airlines announces that it is resuming “some flights.”
    

            Delta Air Lines resumes some flight departures and issues travel waivers to affected customers.
    

            A spokesperson for Atlanta’s Hartsfield Jackson International Airport said that systems were operational and the airport put in place additional customer service personnel to address the challenges they’re facing.
    

            The spokesperson urged customers to “have patience. We’re trying to have grace and patience with all of the passengers. We’re asking the same.”
    

            Later Friday morning, Charlotte Douglas International Airport, an American Airlines hub, advises passengers to not go to the airport “unless they have confirmed their flight information with the airline.” Officials at Miami International Airport, another American Airlines hub, likewise warn travelers that US Customs and Border Protection operations have been affected nationwide, “so international passenger arrivals are currently being processed manually at a slower pace.”
    

            A little before 9 a.m., Alaska State Troopers and Phoenix Police Department in Arizona say that service at its 911 centers are once again operational after emergency and non-emergency call centers were impacted.
    

            Portland’s Computer Aided Dispatch system also comes back online at 9 a.m.
    

            “At no time was the community’s ability to make 911 calls impacted,” the mayor’s office says in a news release. “The critical, life-saving services of public safety bureaus, including Police and Fire & Rescue, continue.”
    

            The Federal Communications Commission announces it is working with federal agencies to provide assistance and determine the extent of the outage after it was made aware of “reports of a systems outage causing disruptions in service, including 911.”
    

            President Joe Biden is briefed on the CrowdStrike outage and his team is in touch with CrowdStrike and impacted entities, says a White House official. The president’s team is also engaged with agencies “to get sector by sector updates throughout the day and is standing by to provide assistance as needed,” according to the official.
    

            Around this time, an increasing number of federal agencies begin getting involved and reporting service disruptions. The US Department of Homeland Security says in a statement on X they are “working with CrowdStrike, Microsoft and our federal, state, local and critical infrastructure partners to fully assess and address system outages.”
    

            Social Security offices close to the public, as the agency warns the public that “longer wait times on our national 800 number are expected.”
    

            In an internal memo viewed by CNN, the US Department of Justice says it is feeling some impact from the technology outage and, while it’s working on workarounds, notes it does not have an “estimated restoration time.”
    

            Mail carriers UPS and FedEx tell CNN they were also impacted by the outage. UPS says its airline is operational and its drivers are on the roads, but there may be some service delays.
    

            A little after 11 a.m., CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz says in a post on X, the firm “(understands) the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption,” adding that the incident was not a cyber attack, and that customers’ data remains protected.
    

            “The issue has been identified and a fix has been deployed,” he said. “There was an issue with a Falcon content update for Windows Hosts.”
    

            The Massachusetts Department of Transportation announces that some Registry of Motor Vehicle operations are impacted. Other states also report impacts to their driving services, including Georgia, North Carolina, Texas and Tennessee.
    

            Around the same time, several of the nation’s healthcare and hospital systems announce they have been impacted by the global outage, including Mass General Brigham hospital system in Massachusetts, Penn Medicine in Pennsylvania, Northwell Health in New York, and Emory Healthcare in Atlanta.
    

            While some hospitals report delays in services, others cancel some non-urgent surgeries and medical office visits. Several cancer centers, including Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and New York’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center say they have paused certain procedures and scheduled appointments.
    

            In British Columbia, the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) announces its health system has been impacted, and is working on implementing contingency plans in order to ensure care for patients.
    

            Around 4 p.m., New York Blood Center, a supplier of blood to approximately 200 hospitals in the Northeast United States, says it has put in place an emergency driving operation to distribute blood.
    

            “The test tubes are not making it onto planes from yesterday and today, requiring for us to drive them,” New York Blood Center’s senior vice president Andrea Cefarelli told CNN in a phone call. “There is going to be a 12-24 hour delay in getting the test results.”
    

            Blood Centers of America, which rely on shipping companies like FedEx, says it is experiencing delays in reporting test results. Executive Vice President Jenny Ficenec says blood usage may be down due to hospitals canceling elective surgeries, so the delay should not cause any shortages unless the problem persists.
    

            Blood Assurance, which provides blood to hospitals in a number of Southeast states, including Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia, says its planned shipment of at least 20 platelets has been postponed due to flight delays and cancellations caused by the outage.
    

            “We are asking community members to help through donation,” Blood Assurance says in an email to CNN. “We have a fantastic community of donors that always shows up when we need them.”
    

            Meanwhile, CrowdStrike CEO Kurtz takes to social media again and promises customers “full transparency” on how the global IT outage involving the company’s software occurred.
    

            CrowdStrike would take steps “to prevent anything like this from happening again,” according to a statement on the company’s website.

CNN_29,Adidas apologizes for ad campaign linked to 1972 Munich Olympics,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/sport/adidas-apologizes-ad-campaign-bella-hadid-spt-intl-scli/index.html,2024-07-20 22:28:00,world,"
Adidas has apologized for “any upset or distress caused,” after releasing an ad campaign for some retro sneakers based on a model first released during the 1972 Munich Olympics.
    

            The Munich Olympics are infamous as the event in which 11 Israeli athletes were taken hostage and murdered by the Palestinian terror group known as “Black September.”
    

            The controversy centered around the German sportswear company’s choice of model Bella Hadid to front the campaign. Hadid, who was born in 1996, is Palestinian-American and has been a prominent advocate for Palestinian relief efforts. Adidas then seemingly deleted any social media posts featuring her after criticism from Jewish groups and Israel.
    

            Adidas’ decision to remove Hadid from its social media feeds was then, in turn, criticized by pro-Palestinian voices for silencing people of Palestinian heritage, and for appearing to retaliate against Hadid on the basis of her heritage.
    

            CNN cannot independently verify Adidas’ posts but screenshots of them have been widely circulated, including by the state of Israel’s official X account, while a picture of Hadid remains on Adidas’ website promoting the sneakers. Hadid’s representatives have not yet responded to CNN’s request for comment.
    

            Hadid hasn’t publicly commented about the controversy on her social media accounts, though she recently posted a photo of herself – uncaptioned – standing in front of an Adidas billboard, wearing one of the sportswear manufacturer’s tops.
    

            “We are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events – though these are completely unintentional – and we apologize for any upset or distress caused,” a spokesperson for Adidas said in a statement sent to CNN on Friday.

            “As a result we are revising the remainder of the campaign. We believe in sport as a unifying force around the world and will continue our efforts to champion diversity and equality in everything we do,” the company added.
    

            Hadid, whose father is Palestinian-American real-estate developer Mohamed Hadid, has frequently spoken out about violence against Palestinians and the ongoing war in Gaza.
    

            In October last year, Bella Hadid wrote in a statement posted to Instagram: “My heart is bleeding with pain from the trauma I am seeing unfold, as well as the generational trauma of my Palestinian blood,” referencing those killed by Israeli airstrikes and military operations in Gaza – now more than 38,000 people in total, according to the enclave’s Ministry of Health.
    

            “I mourn for the Israeli families that have been dealing with the pain and aftermath of October 7,” she added, referencing the day when Palestinian militants killed about 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 250 people hostage.
    

            For the American Jewish Committee, choosing a “vocal anti-Israel model to recall this dark Olympics is either a massive oversight or intentionally inflammatory.”
    

            “Neither is acceptable,” it added in a post on X. The group did not provide evidence or detail for its allegation that Hadid was “anti-Israel.”

            Meanwhile, Jonathan Greenblatt – the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League – wrote in his own post on the platform that Hadid’s involvement in the campaign is a “serious misjudgement that dishonors the victims” of the 1972 terrorist attack.
    

            However, journalist Mehdi Hasan took issue with this line of criticism against Adidas and Hadid.
    

            “Bella Hadid has absolutely nothing in common with the 1972 terrorists – other than the fact that she is Palestinian,” Hasan posted on X.
    

            “Blaming people for the crimes of others who share their race or ethnicity is pure racism & bigotry,” he added.
    

            When contacted by CNN to respond to this critique, an AJC spokesperson said its “criticism of Adidas making Bella Hadid one of the faces of this campaign has nothing to do with her ethnicity but her history of anti-Israel and antisemitic comments,” without providing evidence for these allegations.
    

            The ADL disagreed with Hasan and reinforced its criticism of Hadid in a statement sent to CNN.
    

            The Adidas controversy comes a week before the opening ceremony for the Paris Olympics.

CNN_30,A Florida woman was killed 24 years ago. DNA evidence just helped police make an arrest in the cold case,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/us/sherry-holtz-murder-arrest-florida/index.html,2024-07-21 00:06:00,us,"
            A Florida woman’s brutal killing nearly 25 years ago may finally be solved after authorities arrested the suspect this week, according to the Sanford Police Department.
    

            Sherry Holtz, who was 50 at the time of her death, was found dead on December 4, 1999, a day after she was last seen at a bar in Sanford, Florida, authorities said at a Friday news conference.
    

            A person collecting cans in the woods discovered Holtz’s body lying on a concrete slab about 20 feet into a wood line in Sanford, according to Sanford Police Department spokesperson Bianca Gillett.
    

            “This was … there’s no other way to describe it but a brutal homicide,” Gillett said.
    

            Holtz’s neck was cut and there were signs of strangulation, blunt force trauma and sexual battery, authorities said.
    

            A lock blade knife was found near her body with blood and other DNA on it, but since the samples were not large enough, it was difficult to perform testing in 2000, according to Gillett.
    

            Investigators preserved the knife and reopened the case in May 2023. Authorities confirmed last month the blood on the knife was Holtz’ and additional DNA on the knife belonged to Gary Durrance, 74.
    

            Durrance, who was Holtz’s longtime boyfriend, was arrested on Thursday and charged with second-degree homicide, Gillett said.
    

            CNN has been unable to determine if Durrance has obtained legal representation at this time.
    

            The couple lived at a home in Sanford with three other people who were interviewed by investigators at the time of the homicide. The roommates said the couple had an argument and on December 2, 1999, Durrance kicked Holtz out of the house.

            Authorities say Durrance had denied being with Holtz on the night of the homicide.
    

            The bar Holtz was last seen at was about half a mile away from where her body was later found, Gillett said.
    

            “Sherry Holtz was brutally murdered and left behind in the woods as if her life had no value. This was someone’s mother, someone’s daughter,” Sanford police chief Cecil Smith said in a statement.
    

            “Durrance will now face justice for the horrible and despicable things that he did,” Smith said. “I hope his arrest brings a little comfort to those that loved Sherry and have waited 24 years for this moment.”
    

            Durrance is being held at Seminole County’s John E. Polk Correctional Facility and has a court appearance scheduled for September 10, according to jail records.

CNN_31,"4 big questions couples who want to live together should ask each other, especially if they’re over 50",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/business/unmarried-couples-living-together-questions-to-ask/index.html,2024-07-21 00:00:00,us,"
            Taking your romantic relationship to the next level — sharing a home — is a big deal in so many ways.
    

            If you opt to live together instead of marrying, you may think you’re saving money (e.g., no wedding!) and keeping your financial and legal independence from each other.
    

            In some ways you may be. But there are a lot of financial and legal considerations that you both should hash out before calling the movers.
    

            That is especially the case for couples over 50 — for whom living together may seem the easier option if they have already had long-term marriages. “My research has shown that following a gray divorce, women and men are more likely to form a cohabitation than a remarriage, signaling that cohabitation is gaining ground among older adults these days,” said sociology professor Susan Brown, director of the National Center for Family & Marriage Research at Bowling Green State University.
    

            An analysis of federal data by the Pew Research Center found that in 2016, couples over 50 represented roughly a quarter of adults living together.
    

            Those in this age group — far more than couples in their 20s and 30s — have already lived complex lives, raised families and saved for and envisioned retirement. They also, much to their chagrin, are more likely to develop health problems during their relationships from hereon out.
    

            But while some concerns may be more urgent for older couples, here are some key questions couples of any age should consider when deciding to live together:
    

            Mari Adam, a certified financial planner and founder of the educational consultancy Mari Talks Money, recommends partners know the financial basics about each other.
    

            This includes your income, assets, debts and credit scores. It also includes what kind of health, disability and long-term care insurance you have. And don’t forget to share with your partner whether and how much you owe in alimony and child support. Surprises and secrets are never welcome in this regard.
    

            If you’re the person receiving alimony or child support, figure out the potential consequences of living together on your eligibility for those payments. Every state has its own rulebook. So check in with a divorce attorney.
    

            “There can be all sorts of gotchas,” Adam said.
    

            In terms of Social Security benefits, if you are divorced or widowed, you may be entitled to benefits based on your former spouse’s earnings records. But the rules may change if you remarry, based on your age.
    

            If, however, you are just cohabitating, that isn’t likely to interfere with your getting those benefits if you’re otherwise eligible, said Steven Rubin, a certified elder care attorney at the firm Drazen Rubin Law.
    

            Figuring out how much each of you will pay for joint living expenses is a conversation worth having, if only to ward off potential resentments in the future.
    

            Adam has counseled people to find “fair and equitable” solutions. For some, that may mean splitting expenses 50/50. But for others that may not make sense.
    

            For example, if you make three times as much as your partner, you might decide to pay on a proportional basis, with each contributing the same percentage of your incomes for common expenses. Here’s what that can look like: 10% of a $75,000 income ($7,500) is three times less than 10% of $225,000 ($22,500).
    

            Beyond dollars and cents, you also might consider what each partner brings to the table in terms of living together — whether it’s cooking, cleaning, home repairs or taking charge of your social life as a couple.
    

            “I’ve seen friends and clients where the woman has money and [her male partner] doesn’t. She pays all the house expenses and he is the handyman,” Adam said.
    

            If your partner owns their home and you move in to that house, consider that the financial benefits of anything that improves the home’s value — such as a new roof or a kitchen renovation — will only accrue to your partner, since you are not a co-owner, even though you will both enjoy the day-to-day benefits of living in an improved space.
    

            “You can solve anything. But you have to be willing to talk about it and be fair-minded about it,” Adam said. “There is no one right answer.”
    

            She also recommends a “yours, mine and ours” approach to bank accounts. “It is important to keep money separate — especially when you have kids. But have a joint account that both parties put money into [for joint living, traveling and entertaining expenses].”
    

            No one wants to contemplate this question. (Even writing about it is unpleasant.)
    

            But discussing it ahead of time can lessen some of the stress, should a situation arise when a partner gets sick and requires chronic care or becomes terminally ill, Rubin said.
    

            Discuss whom each of you wants to legally give a durable power of attorney to — that is the person you designate to manage your finances if you become incapacitated.
    

            Also discuss who you want to be your health care proxies. A medical proxy is the person who will make medical care decisions for you if you become unable to do so for yourself.
    

            And make clear how much and what types of medical intervention you want if you become terminally ill — that is something a proxy will be charged with respecting, even if the person’s family is pushing for something different.
    

            All these wishes should be executed through a durable power of attorney form and what is sometimes called an advance health directive or living will.
    

            And if your partner is not your chosen health care proxy, include a medical release form in your health care directive naming them as someone who you, essentially, want by your side during a health crisis.
    

            “[T]hat will allow doctors and hospitals to communicate with your partner, even if the partner is not the decision maker,” Rubin said. “I also list this in the advance directive that they want the person to have full visitation rights and the decision maker has a fiduciary responsibility to ensure your wishes are met.”
    

            While everyone should have a will spelling out how they want their assets to be distributed, it’s especially important for unmarried couples to do so since the law typically confers a lot of automatic benefits to marital spouses and a person’s children than to one’s live-in partner.
    

            If one or both of you have kids, both partners need to be clear about how the children and the surviving partner will (or won’t) be provided for in the estate.
    

            One concern, for example, may be what happens to the home you share when one of you dies? If you own it jointly, who will inherit the deceased partner’s share? If the person who dies is the sole owner, who will inherit the property? If it’s not the live-in partner, then do you want to have a provision where the partner can stay in the home for a given period of time?
    

            All that can be addressed by setting up a trust for the asset, Rubin said.
    

            One area where things can get tricky with the home, Rubin said, is if the person who owns the house needs expensive long-term care and tries to qualify for Medicaid, which requires them to have very few assets. Even if the home is jointly owned with one’s live-in partner, the state may or may not require that the home be sold before the sick partner can qualify and if it’s sold then their significant other has to move out. If you were married, Rubin said, the property would be treated as exempt for benefit purposes.
    

            That’s why he always counsels couples moving in together to contemplate these kinds of scenarios ahead of time.
    

            “The best thing you can do is plan,” Rubin said.

CNN_32,Israeli airstrikes target Yemen’s Houthis day after deadly drone attack in Tel Aviv,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/middleeast/yemen-israel-strikes-hodeidah-intl/index.html,2024-07-21 00:59:00,world,"
            Israeli airstrikes targeted Houthi rebels in Yemen a day after the Iran-backed group claimed a deadly attack on the Israeli city of Tel Aviv.
    

            “A short while ago, IDF fighter jets struck military targets of the Houthi terrorist regime in the area of the Al Hudaydah [Hodeidah] Port in Yemen in response to the hundreds of attacks carried out against the state of Israel in recent months,” the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said in a statement.
    

            The statement came soon after the Houthi-run Al Masirah TV reported airstrikes targeting oil facilities in the western port of Hodeidah, adding that there had been deaths and injuries.
    

            According to Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam, the Israeli strikes hit oil tanks and a power station.
    

            “A brutal Israeli aggression against Yemen by targeting civilian facilities, oil tanks, and the power station in Hodeidah aims to increase the suffering of the people of Yemen,” he added.
    

            Abdulsalam slammed what he said was pressure on Yemen to stop its support of Gaza.
    

            The strikes on Hodeidah came a day after drone attack in Tel Aviv killed one man and injured at least 10 others.
    

            The Houthis said that attack was a response to Israel’s war in Gaza, with a spokesperson saying the operation was performed by a new drone capable of “bypassing the enemy’s interception systems.”
    

            While the Houthis have carried out numerous strikes targeting shipping in solidarity with Gaza, this is the first time Israel has struck Yemen.
    

            Both the UK and the US have carried out strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen in response to the attacks on shipping.
    

            In May, at least 16 people were killed and a further 35 wounded by US-UK airstrikes in Hodeidah targeting Houthi rebels. They marked the fifth round of coalition strikes against the Houthis.

CNN_33,South African police discover multimillion-dollar meth lab on farm,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/africa/south-african-police-uncover-meth-lab-farm-intl/index.html,2024-07-21 00:28:00,world,"
            Police in South Africa arrested four people including two Mexican nationals after uncovering a multimillion-dollar drug manufacturing lab on a farm in the country’s north.
    

            The South African Police Service (SAPS) and the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, commonly known as Hawks, raided the property in the town of Groblersdal after receiving information suspicious activity was taking place there, SAPS said in a statement.
    

            After searching four structures on the property, police found large quantities of chemicals used to make illicit drugs including acetone and crystal meth, with an estimated street value of 2 billion South African rand ($109.4 million).
    

            The four suspects detained on Friday include the farm owner and two Mexican nationals, the police service said, adding that the Hawks are not ruling out the possibility of further arrests.
    

            “What makes this different from other [seizures] is the involvement of Mexican citizens,” Katlego Mogale, national spokesperson for the Hawks told Reuters, adding: “It means that our task has just become very difficult.”
    

            It is not clear if the drugs seized were intended for South African market or overseas.
    

            The suspects will appear at Groblersdal Magistrate’s court on Monday on charges of manufacturing, dealing and possessing illicit drugs, according to the police service.

CNN_34,‘Perfection’: South Korea’s Kim Si-woo makes historic 238-yard ace on one of the Open’s most menacing holes,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/sport/kim-si-woo-hole-in-one-open-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-20 23:45:00,world,"
            It had been a relatively unremarkable Open Championship for Kim Si-woo as he stepped up to Royal Troon’s notorious penultimate tee on Saturday. One perfect thump of his three-iron later, the South Korean made history.
    

            The four-time PGA Tour winner struck the first hole-in-one ever recorded on the 17th hole during the major at the fabled Scottish course, acing from 238 yards to light up the end of his third round.
    

            Nicknamed “Rabbit”, the par-three has garnered a reputation for being one of the course’s most menacing challenges across the 10 Opens hosted at Royal Troon since 1923.
    

            Playing as the sixth hardest hole during the second round, a sharply sloping green guarded by four deep bunkers makes leaving with par “gold,” according to tournament organizers.
    

            That was more than Si-woo had managed before Saturday, having double bogeyed and bogeyed the 17th hole across his opening two rounds. Imagine his shock then, when the shrieks of the crowds gathered by the green rippled back up the fairway.
    

            “I went back to the bag and there were people yelling at me … I didn’t realize the ball had gone in,” Si-woo later told reporters.
    

            “I’ve had plenty of holes-in-one in my life … but I think this is the most memorable.”
    

            It marked the longest hole-in-one in recorded history at the major (since 1980), according to golf statistician Justin Ray, bettering Frank Lickliter II’s 212-yard ace at Royal Lytham and St Anne’s fifth hole in 2001.
    

            “That is perfection … what a treat,” three-time Open champion Nick Faldo cooed on the Sky Sports broadcast.

CNN_35,Investigators believe Trump’s would-be assassin flew a drone over rally site on the day of the shooting,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/politics/ladder-backpack-trump-rally-shooter-found/index.html,2024-07-21 01:38:00,politics,"
            Investigators believe the gunman who attempted to assassinate former President Donald Trump may have used a drone on a reconnaissance trip to the rally site on the day of the shooting, a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation told CNN.
    

            Investigators searching Thomas Crooks’ belongings found a drone in his car. The working theory investigators are exploring is that the drone would have given Crooks an overview of the rooftops of nearby buildings and how they connect, according to the law enforcement official. That could have helped him choose the spot where he fired the shots toward the podium where Trump was standing.
    

            New evidence shared by multiple law enforcement officials also reveals that a ladder purchased by Crooks several hours before he opened fire and a backpack believed to have belonged to him have been located and are in the possession of federal authorities.
    

            A man driving near the shooter’s home discovered the ladder and backpack on the side of the road, according to law enforcement sources from two separate agencies. The person reportedly saw the ladder in that location for several days before deciding to alert authorities.
    

            The discoveries of the ladder, backpack and drone come as investigators are struggling to find a motive for Crooks’ assault. As more details are released about the failed assassination attempt, the US Secret Service has faced questions and criticism and is scrambling to increase security ahead of the first campaign rally with both Trump and Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance on Saturday.
    

            As the investigation continues, authorities are likely to scrutinize these newly found items for any clues that might help piece together the sequence of events before last Saturday’s shooting.
    

            Investigators have looked into what Crooks was doing in the days and hours leading up to his attempt to assassinate the former president, including combing through his physical and digital trail. After the shooting, multiple law enforcement sources said investigators found a bulletproof vest, three fully loaded magazines and two remote-controlled explosive devices in Crooks’ car.
    

            Additionally, after a search of his residence, investigators discovered another bulletproof vest, another remote-controlled explosive device and a 3D printer, according to multiple law enforcement sources.
    

            The suspect’s cell phone contained images of both Trump and President Joe Biden, and his search history included dates of the Democratic National Convention as well as future Trump events. Along with images of Trump and Biden, the shooter’s phone also contained pictures of congressional leaders, such as House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.
    

            Crooks had searched for information on another recent mass shooter who shot and killed four classmates at a Michigan high school in 2021. The web searches about that shooter, Ethan Crumbley, are consistent with what law enforcement officials have seen in other mass shooters who research people they wish to emulate.
    

            The suspect would have been at work on the day of the attempted assassination, but he told his boss he needed the day off because he had “something to do” and told his co-workers he would be back to work on Sunday.
    

            As the investigation remains in its early stages, federal investigators have pieced together an early portrait of Crooks as an intelligent, unassuming loner who expressed an interest in guns and was far from outspoken about politics.

CNN_36,Why an election for 330 million-plus people may still come down to so few votes,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/politics/electoral-votes-swing-state-margins-dg/index.html,2024-07-21 01:21:00,politics,"
A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.


            Anyone who pays any attention to US politics is bound to hear some version of this claim: The 2024 election, which will pick a president for a nation of more than 330 million people, will be decided by a small number of voters in a few key states.
    

            There are concerns, particularly among Democrats, that President Joe Biden is losing support in these key states and they have pressured him to step aside for a different candidate.
    

            But even an attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump and questions about Biden’s fitness to serve another four years might not interrupt the larger dynamic of the race.
    

            “I still think that this is a race where we are not going to see the polls move outside a pretty narrow window,” Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson said on CNN during coverage of the Republican National Convention.
    

            “If you liked Donald Trump last week, you still like him this week. If you liked Joe Biden last week, you still like him this week,” she said.
    

            With those perceptions set, consider just how small the margins were in the 2020 election, consider that the states Biden turned from red to blue to defeat then-President Trump were won by securing a tiny fraction of voters in those states.
    

            In a 2024 rematch between the two, Trump will try to win those same states back from Biden, the Democrat aiming to win another term in the White House in November. The margins could be just as close.
    

            But to say that a small number of voters “decide” the election is a major oversimplification of the American system and how it has evolved.
    

            Here’s how things work:
    

            There are 538 Electoral College votes split among the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Each state gets at least three votes, depending on the size of their congressional delegation.
    

            The smallest states get three (they have two senators and one member of Congress). Washington, DC, also gets three. The most populous states get a lot more. California gets 54 electoral votes (it has two senators and 52 congressional districts). Texas has 40, Florida has 30, New York has 28 and so on.
    

            The winner is the candidate who gets 270 or more electoral votes. If no candidate gets to 270 electoral votes, the House of Representatives picks the winner from among the candidates who got electoral votes.
    

            A dozen states were decided by 5 percentage points or less in either the 2016 or 2020 presidential election. In CNN’s 2024 race ratings, Maine is the only one of these states rated as solidly in one party’s corner, but one congressional district within Maine is classified as a toss-up. The other 11 states are seen as competitive in the 2024 election. See the ratings here.
    

            Viewed another way, we can expect that those states where the previous elections have been close to be the ones where the 2024 election will again be close. Polling backs up this presumption.
    

            In real numbers, the close margins in those relatively few states equal a very small number of voters in a country of more than 330 million people, but they are necessary for either candidate to reach an Electoral College count of 270. Some of those states came down to tens of thousands of votes. Biden won for Democrats in five states in 2020 – Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin – where Hillary Clinton lost, often by very small margins, in 2016. Florida, on the other hand, which has been a battleground for years, went more toward Trump in 2020.
    

            The campaigns will focus more attention on the fewer than one-third of all electoral votes they consider to be up for grabs or winnable by either party.
    

            Another thing to consider is that the number of electoral votes was reallocated after the 2020 election due to the every-10-years census required by the Constitution. North Carolina, Colorado and Florida, potential battlegrounds, each gained an electoral vote. Texas, which Democrats have long hoped would become a battleground but which continues to tilt Republican despite shifting demographics, also gained two votes. Pennsylvania and Michigan are among the states that lost a vote.
    

            That also means that the populations of these states are changing over time. A battleground in 2024 could look very different in the future. And states that seem safe for either party today could be battlegrounds in the future.
    

            Two states, Maine and Nebraska, apportion some of their electoral votes by congressional district rather than giving all of them to the state winner. In 2020, for instance, Biden won a single vote in Nebraska and Trump won a single vote in Maine. These individual electoral votes could be incredibly important in the event of a tight election this year.
    

            The end result is that, yes, the 2024 election could again come down to relatively few voters in relatively few states.
    

            But questions remain over who those decisive voters are. Are they the voters who make most states reliably red or blue in most elections? Are they suburban women who were turned off by Trump in 2020, or are they people without a college degree who have moved toward the GOP? Are they older voters who have been trending toward Democrats or younger voters expressing an interest in Republicans? Are they more disinterested voters who only take part in the process every now and then, or is it a question of which party successfully motivates its stalwarts to turn out no matter what?
    

            It will take all of the above for either candidate to win. However, because the margins in certain states could be so small, incremental shifts in the preference or turnout of any larger group of voters could be decisive.

CNN_37,"An Illinois woman was killed by a deputy after she called 911, authorities say. The deputy is charged with murder",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/18/us/illinois-deputy-charged-911-caller-killed/index.html,2024-07-21 01:52:00,us,"
            An Illinois woman was fatally shot inside her home this month by a sheriff’s deputy who responded to her 911 call, and the deputy is now charged with murder in the case, a prosecutor said this week.
    

            Sonya Massey, 36, called 911 on July 6 because she thought an intruder was in her home in the Springfield area, according to the law office of Ben Crump, the civil rights attorney representing her family.
    

            Sangamon County sheriff’s Deputy Sean Grayson and another deputy responded to the call around 12:50 a.m., authorities said. Eventually, as the deputies were in Massey’s home to gather information and make sure the residence was safe, a dispute arose over a pot of hot water, and Grayson drew his gun and eventually fired three times toward her, striking her once in the face, according to a court document filed Thursday by Sangamon County prosecutors.
    

            During the dispute before the shooting, Massey at one point apologized with her hands up, and Grayson at another point also yelled at her to put the pot down, prosecutors said in the document. The sheriff’s office said the deputies, who were not injured, reported the shooting around 1:20 a.m. Crump’s office has said Massey was unarmed.
    

            An Illinois State Police investigation of the case did “not support a finding that … Grayson was justified in his use of deadly force,” the state’s attorney for the county, John Milhiser, said in a Wednesday news release.
    

            A Sangamon County grand jury on Wednesday indicted Grayson on three counts of first-degree murder and a count each of aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct, Milhiser said.
    

            At his arraignment Thursday, Grayson entered a not guilty plea and was denied pretrial release, according to court records. A pretrial hearing is scheduled for August 26.
    

            CNN reached out Saturday to Grayson’s attorney, who declined to comment.
    

            The sheriff’s department has fired Grayson, the office said Wednesday.
    

            Crump said in a release last week that it was “extremely hard to imagine how a woman who calls police out of fear of an intruder ends up shot … by the police in her own home.”
    

            On Wednesday, Crump said the charges marked “an important milestone in the pursuit of justice for Sonya Massey’s family.”
    

            “This news is a step toward justice for Sonya’s loved ones, especially her children, who have endured unimaginable pain and suffering since they were notified of this tragedy. We remain committed to uncovering the truth of what happened and identifying the failures that allowed this tragic death to occur,” Crump said in a Wednesday release.
    

            Massey’s funeral will be held Friday morning, according to Crump’s office.
    

            Massey called 911 to report a possible “prowler,” according to the document that prosecutors filed in a court in Springfield on Thursday.
    

            When the two responding deputies encountered Massey, she “appeared to be calm, perhaps unwell, not aggressive,” the court document said.
    

            After entering Massey’s home, Grayson “noticed a pot on the stove, and approved of Massey removing the pot to prevent any accidental fires.” The pot “apparently contained heated water,” the court document says.
    

            What happened next is unclear.
    

            Massey set the pot down on a counter in the kitchen, according to the document.
    

            Grayson, who was in the living room, then “drew his 9mm firearm and threatened to shoot Ms. Massey in the face,” according to the document.
    

            “Seeing the drawn weapon, Ms. Massey put her hands in the air and stated, ‘I’m sorry,’ while ducking for cover behind the counter that separated her and the defendant,” the document says.
    

            “With his firearm still drawn, Grayson went closer to Massey and aggressively yelled at her to put the pot down.”
    

            Then, Grayson shot Massey in the face, according to the court document.
    

            It wasn’t until after Grayson fatally shot Massey that he activated his body camera, the document says. The other deputy, who was checking the house while the dispute over the pot happened, had activated his body camera when he first arrived on scene, according to the court document.
    

            Grayson instructed the other deputy not to retrieve a medical kit “because of the severity of the injury,” according to the court document. The other deputy still rendered aid and stayed with Massey until medics arrived. Grayson “at no time attempted to render aid,” the document said. Massey was taken to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead, the sheriff’s department has said.
    

            The court document does not explain how prosecutors got details of the incident, but it asks the court to refer to the deputies’ body camera recordings, which prosecutors submitted as an exhibit. The document also does not explain where the other deputy was within the house when the dispute and the shooting happened.
    

            Massey’s family saw body camera footage of the incident during a meeting with prosecutors and state police on Wednesday, Milhiser said that day.
    

            After consulting with the family, officials decided the footage will be released publicly on Monday afternoon, the prosecutor said. Nothing has been redacted “except for the blurring of certain images” out of respect, Milhiser said.
    

            Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker expressed gratitude Wednesday to prosecutors for bringing the “appropriate charges” in this case.
    

            “Sonya Massey was concerned for her safety and called law enforcement to her home for protection. Like all Illinoisans, she deserved that protection. Instead, innocent and unarmed, she was gunned down by an officer of the law,” Pritzker said Wednesday in a news release.
    

            “My heart breaks for Sonya’s children, for her family and friends and for all who knew and loved her, and I am enraged that another innocent Black woman had her life taken from her at the hands of a police officer,” the governor said.
    

            The sheriff’s office said Wednesday that Grayson’s actions “do not reflect the values and training of the Sangamon County Sheriff’s Office or law enforcement as a whole,” and that it was “clear that the deputy did not act as trained or in accordance with our standards.”
    

            “Good law enforcement officers stand with our community in condemning actions that undermine the trust and safety we strive to uphold. In times like these, it is crucial for leadership across all sides and spectrums to come together to heal our community,” the office said in an online post.

            A 72-year-old Montana man shot and killed a grizzly bear after it attacked him while he was alone picking huckleberries, according to the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks.
    

            The man was hospitalized after the encounter, which happened Thursday evening near Columbia Falls on Flathead National Forest lands, the agency said in a news release.
    

            FWP’s wardens and bear specialists referred to the incident as a “surprise defensive encounter.”
    

            The man reportedly shot the bear with a handgun after the adult female grizzly charged him, the release stated. FWP responded to the incident and confirmed the bear was killed.
    

            Officials said they were now working to verify if the bear had any cubs with her.

            “Montana is bear country. People should be prepared to encounter grizzly or black bears in Montana. Avoiding conflicts with bears is easier than dealing with conflicts,” the agency said in the release, outlining precautions to take to help avoid “negative bear encounters,” such as carrying bear spray and traveling in groups.
    

            Grizzly bears, which live in the US states of Montana, Alaska, Idaho, Wyoming and Washington, feed on berries as part of their diet, according to the North American Bear Center.
    

Huckleberries in particular – which reach their peak ripeness in mid-July, comprise about half the diet for the hundreds of grizzly bears inhabiting the area of Montana’s Glacier National Park, which is just north of Columbia Falls, according to the University of Washington.
    

            Bear attacks are rare, with most bears usually interested in protecting their space, food or cubs, according to the National Park Service.

CNN_39,‘I’m just sick of it’: More than a week without power leaves some Houston-area residents feeling hopeless and abandoned,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/us/texas-houston-power-outage/index.html,2024-07-21 02:52:00,us,"
            Theodore Doyle, an 81-year-old retired manager with the former US Customs Service, was waking up in his hot and muggy northeast Houston apartment in a bed soaked in sweat.
    

            Doyle ultimately checked into a $98-a-night hotel room late Tuesday, after enduring a compounding crisis of extreme heat and no power for more than a week with about 200 other seniors at an independent living facility in the Kingwood community.
    

            “There’s no air circulating. It’s just stifling and it’s sort of tough to breathe,” he told CNN before returning to his apartment when power was restored Thursday afternoon. “I just couldn’t take it anymore.”
    

            During the outage, a generator powered one elevator and a large, air-conditioned lounge at the complex – a lifeline for many who are dependent on electric wheelchairs and scooters to get around and oxygen machines for pulmonary disease. At times, as many as 40 residents sought refuge in the lounge. Others remained in their stifling apartments. Some stayed with relatives whose power had been restored.
    

            “A friend just turned 95 about a month ago,” Doyle said. “Another friend of mine is over 90 and quite a few of us are all over 80. It’s tough. You’re not as spry as you used to be.”

Anger grows as some senior facilities left without power for days: ‘It’s horrible what the state of Texas is doing’


            By Saturday afternoon, about 2,500 customers of Houston’s main utility, CenterPoint Energy, were without power, according to PowerOutage.us. The number fluctuated throughout the day. It’s unclear if those customers have been without power since Beryl hit the Golf Coast July 8 as a hurricane, leaving more than 2 million customers in the dark, mostly in the Houston area. More than 135,000 CenterPoint customers had no power on Monday night.
    

            The embattled utility said in a statement that customers without power were “predominantly isolated instances,” where homes or equipment sustained severe damage from the storm. CenterPoint, which has 2.8 million customers in the Houston area, said some current outages could be related to thunderstorms Saturday morning. “For safety reasons, our crews pause their work when there is lightning,” the statement said.
    

            At least 14 Houston-area deaths were confirmed to be hurricane-related, including seven people – ranging in age from 50 to 110 – who died from “heat exposure due to power loss,” according to the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences. Overall, more than 20 deaths in Harris and nearby counties were attributed to the storm, according to the Houston Chronicle and other local media outlets. Older people were especially vulnerable and, authorities warned, the number of fatalities could grow.
    

            For more than a week, some residents of the nation’s fourth largest city were left to sleep in their cars, shuffle perilously with canes and walkers across dark rooms and corridors, and watch food and medications spoil and critical medical equipment become inoperable. At times, they cried in desperation after discovering the bodies of neighbors who succumbed to the heat following a comparatively mild Category 1 hurricane.
    

            “It is unimaginable this is happening in 2024,” Denise Furlough, who delivered food, batteries and ice to her 86-year-old father during the more than a week without power in his Alameda Plaza home, told CNN Saturday. “I was just frightened I might go over there and he wouldn’t be alive.”
    

            In Houston’s Museum District on Tuesday, Pat Baker arrived at a condo complex to check on a neighbor with health problems who rented out her daughter’s apartment. The neighbor didn’t answer.
    

            “I unlocked the door and found her,” Baker, fighting back tears, told CNN affiliate KHOU. “You know, it’s just been hot and miserable and I’m just sick of this you know. I’m just sick of it.”
    

            Power was restored at the condo complex later that afternoon after the body was removed from the apartment, the station reported.

‘As bad as Covid’: Texas doctor on combination of heat wave power outages


            The latest name added to Harris County’s list of confirmed Beryl-related deaths was Christine Davis, who had turned 110 in May, according to the 110 Club, a site about super-centenarians. She died Tuesday at Memorial Hermann Hospital Northeast from hyperthermia caused by “environmental heat exposure due to power outage,” according to the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences.
    

            Another confirmed storm victim was Pamela Jarrett, 64, who died of hyperthermia on July 11, days after the hurricane, in her home in Spring, Texas, just north of Houston. Relatives told CNN affiliate KTRK on Wednesday that Jarrett relied on a wheelchair and feeding tube.
    

            “It could have been avoided, and she didn’t have to die,” said her sister Janet, who took care of her and struggled to keep the feeding device charged during the outage. She said she tried to keep Jarrett cool with ice and water until she became unresponsive.
    

            “As much as I tried to save her,” Janet Jarrett told the station, “I couldn’t save her.”
    

            Power was restored in the Jarrett home on Tuesday.
    

            In the city of Humble, about 20 miles north of Houston, Christina Bourgeois, her three children – between the ages of 5 and 9 – and their dog Mimosa spent the first night after the storm in her Dodge Journey outside their home. She kept the Dodge on with the air conditioner running because of the heat.
    

            “I slept in the driver’s seat,” she told CNN Friday. “It was awful. You know, my younger son, I had to get up and take him inside to use the restroom.”
    

            The children later stayed with relatives and Bourgeois, 32, spent every night in the car until power was restored on Wednesday.
    

            “I would wake up every two or three hours or so to turn the air and then turn it off,” she said of the nights she spent alone in the Dodge. “I hadn’t slept. I was exhausted. I was starting to swell. I had bags under my eyes. Any little noise would wake me up because I have the windows down, you know … Any kind of rustle of the leaves or, you know, even cars passing by, I would just wake up.”

Texas Gov. Abbott gives CenterPoint Energy deadline for plan to fix power issues after Beryl slams Houston


            Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last Sunday threatened executive action if CenterPoint Energy did not address concerns over the prolonged outage. And the Public Utilities Commission of Texas said it would investigate the company’s response to the power outages, according to Chairman Thomas Gleason. He told reporters Monday the utility’s ability to maintain its infrastructure and its communication with customers has been called into question.
    

            CenterPoint Energy told CNN in a statement it was “committed to doing a thorough review of our Hurricane Beryl response.”
    

            “We are engaging with community leaders, elected officials, local clergy leadership and others across the area to learn about how we can be more responsive to their needs and concerns,” the statement said.
    

            Doyle, before he returned to his apartment on Thursday, said he had about $150 worth of food on his refrigerator that went bad. He said he was unsure about the condition of some of the insulin he had left behind. He blamed the utility company for leaving thousands of Houstonians marooned in the heat and darkness.
    

            “You have no idea how frustrating this is,” he said. “We should not be subjected to this.”
    

            Furlough, whose father, Julius Gordon, is a cancer survivor and has heart disease, said he – like many Houston residents – felt hopeless and abandoned until power to his home was restored on Tuesday.
    

            Her father told CNN, “You’re just there. You just vegetate.”

CNN_40,A global tech outage brought many computer systems and businesses to a screeching halt. Here’s what happened,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/tech/timeline-crowdstrike-system-outage/index.html,2024-07-21 03:05:00,us,"
            A global software outage Friday brought many computer systems across business, healthcare, technology and government sectors to a screeching halt in under 12 hours.
    

            How did the crash unfold? Which systems have recovered, and which ones are still affected? We break it down. (All times Eastern Time.)
    

            Overnight on Thursday and into Friday, several states, including Alaska and Arizona, experience 911 service outages. Some hospitals also begin experiencing technology issues overnight, according to nurses on shift.
    

            Between 2 and 3 a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration announces that all Delta and American Airlines flights are grounded. Several minutes later, the FAA says flights from United and Allegiant Airlines have been grounded regardless of their destination.
    

            Spirit Airlines says its flight reservation system has also been affected by the outage.
    

            A few hours later, between 5 and 6 a.m., public transit systems in the Northeast begin announcing that they have been impacted. Washington, DC, public transportation services — including trains and buses — begin experiencing delays, according to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.
    

            In New York City, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, North America’s largest transportation network, says customer information systems have gone temporarily offline, but train and bus services remain unaffected.
    

            At 5:30 a.m., US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike tells customers that it was “aware of reports of crashes” of its software on Microsoft Windows operating systems, according to a company advisory viewed by CNN. CrowdStrike’s cybersecurity software — used by numerous Fortune 500 companies — detects and blocks hacking threats.
    

Between 6 and 7 a.m.: A White House National Security Council spokesperson tells CNN they are “aware of the incident and are looking into the issue and impacts.” A White House source familiar with the matter tells CNN there are no indications at this time of malicious activity, though the administration is still investigating.
    

            Global banks start reporting some service disruptions, including Australia’s Commonwealth Bank, South Africa’s Capitec, and the Bank of Israel. Australian lenders ANZ and Westpac were also impacted, according to Downdetector, a website that tracks cyber outages. Downdetector has also reported issues for New Zealand’s ASB Bank.
    

            Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler issues an emergency declaration in response to the outage that affected Bureau of Emergency Communication’s Computer Aided Dispatch system that is used for fielding emergency calls. The bureau begins taking calls manually, according to the mayor’s office.
    

            Meanwhile, United Airlines announces that it is resuming “some flights.”
    

            Delta Air Lines resumes some flight departures and issues travel waivers to affected customers.
    

            A spokesperson for Atlanta’s Hartsfield Jackson International Airport said that systems were operational and the airport put in place additional customer service personnel to address the challenges they’re facing.
    

            The spokesperson urged customers to “have patience. We’re trying to have grace and patience with all of the passengers. We’re asking the same.”
    

            Later Friday morning, Charlotte Douglas International Airport, an American Airlines hub, advises passengers to not go to the airport “unless they have confirmed their flight information with the airline.” Officials at Miami International Airport, another American Airlines hub, likewise warn travelers that US Customs and Border Protection operations have been affected nationwide, “so international passenger arrivals are currently being processed manually at a slower pace.”
    

            A little before 9 a.m., Alaska State Troopers and Phoenix Police Department in Arizona say that service at its 911 centers are once again operational after emergency and non-emergency call centers were impacted.
    

            Portland’s Computer Aided Dispatch system also comes back online at 9 a.m.
    

            “At no time was the community’s ability to make 911 calls impacted,” the mayor’s office says in a news release. “The critical, life-saving services of public safety bureaus, including Police and Fire & Rescue, continue.”
    

            The Federal Communications Commission announces it is working with federal agencies to provide assistance and determine the extent of the outage after it was made aware of “reports of a systems outage causing disruptions in service, including 911.”
    

            President Joe Biden is briefed on the CrowdStrike outage and his team is in touch with CrowdStrike and impacted entities, says a White House official. The president’s team is also engaged with agencies “to get sector by sector updates throughout the day and is standing by to provide assistance as needed,” according to the official.
    

            Around this time, an increasing number of federal agencies begin getting involved and reporting service disruptions. The US Department of Homeland Security says in a statement on X they are “working with CrowdStrike, Microsoft and our federal, state, local and critical infrastructure partners to fully assess and address system outages.”
    

            Social Security offices close to the public, as the agency warns the public that “longer wait times on our national 800 number are expected.”
    

            In an internal memo viewed by CNN, the US Department of Justice says it is feeling some impact from the technology outage and, while it’s working on workarounds, notes it does not have an “estimated restoration time.”
    

            Mail carriers UPS and FedEx tell CNN they were also impacted by the outage. UPS says its airline is operational and its drivers are on the roads, but there may be some service delays.
    

            A little after 11 a.m., CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz says in a post on X, the firm “(understands) the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption,” adding that the incident was not a cyber attack, and that customers’ data remains protected.
    

            “The issue has been identified and a fix has been deployed,” he said. “There was an issue with a Falcon content update for Windows Hosts.”
    

            The Massachusetts Department of Transportation announces that some Registry of Motor Vehicle operations are impacted. Other states also report impacts to their driving services, including Georgia, North Carolina, Texas and Tennessee.
    

            Around the same time, several of the nation’s healthcare and hospital systems announce they have been impacted by the global outage, including Mass General Brigham hospital system in Massachusetts, Penn Medicine in Pennsylvania, Northwell Health in New York, and Emory Healthcare in Atlanta.
    

            While some hospitals report delays in services, others cancel some non-urgent surgeries and medical office visits. Several cancer centers, including Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and New York’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center say they have paused certain procedures and scheduled appointments.
    

            In British Columbia, the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) announces its health system has been impacted, and is working on implementing contingency plans in order to ensure care for patients.
    

            Around 4 p.m., New York Blood Center, a supplier of blood to approximately 200 hospitals in the Northeast United States, says it has put in place an emergency driving operation to distribute blood.
    

            “The test tubes are not making it onto planes from yesterday and today, requiring for us to drive them,” New York Blood Center’s senior vice president Andrea Cefarelli told CNN in a phone call. “There is going to be a 12-24 hour delay in getting the test results.”
    

            Blood Centers of America, which rely on shipping companies like FedEx, says it is experiencing delays in reporting test results. Executive Vice President Jenny Ficenec says blood usage may be down due to hospitals canceling elective surgeries, so the delay should not cause any shortages unless the problem persists.
    

            Blood Assurance, which provides blood to hospitals in a number of Southeast states, including Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia, says its planned shipment of at least 20 platelets has been postponed due to flight delays and cancellations caused by the outage.
    

            “We are asking community members to help through donation,” Blood Assurance says in an email to CNN. “We have a fantastic community of donors that always shows up when we need them.”
    

            Meanwhile, CrowdStrike CEO Kurtz takes to social media again and promises customers “full transparency” on how the global IT outage involving the company’s software occurred.
    

            CrowdStrike would take steps “to prevent anything like this from happening again,” according to a statement on the company’s website.
    

            In a statement Saturday morning, Microsoft estimates the outage affected 8.5 million Windows devices.
    

            That’s less 1% of all Windows machines, according to Microsoft, but the company adds that “the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services.”
    

            Various sectors are still feeling the aftershocks of the outage. Although airlines have largely resumed services, many tell customers that they expect disruptions in schedules to continue.
    

            As of noon on Saturday, at least 3,375 flights across the United States have been delayed and more than 1,200 canceled, according to data from flight tracker FlightAware. Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the nation’s busiest airport, remains the most affected. Delta Air Lines has canceled more than 500 flights, while United Airlines has canceled almost 300, according to FlightAware.

CNN_41,Clintons privately urge donors to keep giving to Biden as long as he remains presumptive nominee,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/politics/bill-hillary-clinton-donors-biden/index.html,2024-07-21 05:04:00,politics,"
            Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have been privately encouraging donors in recent weeks to continue financially supporting President Joe Biden’s campaign, according to two sources familiar, in the aftermath of Biden’s disastrous debate performance that has sent the Democratic Party spiraling into chaos.
    

            One of the sources said the Clintons are choosing to be “deferential to Biden’s decision.” However, the second source, who is familiar with the Clintons’ thinking and has spoken with the couple in recent days, insisted that it is more accurate to say they are “deferential to the process.”
    

            According to this source, the Clintons have made clear in private conversations recently that it doesn’t matter what anybody says or thinks — unless Biden decides he will drop out of the 2024 race or the delegates vote for somebody else, he is the party’s presumptive nominee.
    

            This source declined to comment on whether the Clintons have expressed a personal view on whether they believe Biden should continue seeking a second term.

Democratic consensus solidifies around Harris, should Biden step aside


            Since the CNN debate on June 27, big-dollar donors have held back from writing checks amid growing concerns about Biden’s candidacy, raising serious concerns about how long the campaign can continue operating in full force if circumstances don’t change.
    

            “I don’t know how you campaign with a broadening electoral map without money. I don’t know what they’re doing. I don’t know,” one major Democratic donor told CNN on Friday. “I’ve never seen this strategy where you think you can win without money.”
    

            This donor mused that perhaps the campaign can get away with digging in for a few more weeks under the current circumstances, but that anything longer would become extraordinarily difficult.
    

            They also noted that the emails from the campaign for events and fundraisers have significantly slowed in recent weeks: “They seem far and few between,” they said.
    

            Still, the Biden campaign has boasted record-breaking grassroots fundraising.
    

            On Friday, Vice President Kamala Harris joined a call with donors amid ongoing party panic. The vice president was asked to do the call by the West Wing, according to campaign officials. Harris’ aides have repeatedly stressed that there’s no daylight between the vice president and the president, and she maintained her defense of Biden on Friday.
    

            Harris attended a fundraiser in Massachusetts on Saturday.
    

            The Biden campaign also previewed upcoming fundraisers in Chicago, as well as in Northern and Southern California in the upcoming days and weeks to rake in more cash. “He will be doing big fundraisers and focusing on continuing to bolster grassroots fundraising,” Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said on MSNBC on Saturday.

CNN_42,Trump has long been criticized for his public treatment of women. The ones in his life argue he’s different in private,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/politics/trump-treatment-women/index.html,2024-07-21 04:18:00,politics,"
            When Sarah Huckabee Sanders faced what she described as “relentless attacks from the left,” it was former President Donald Trump who comforted her, she said.
    

            Trump attorney Alina Habba described the Republican nominee as her “friend.”
    

            And Kai Trump, his oldest grandchild, made a surprise appearance to share “the side of my grandpa that people don’t often see.”
    

            A common theme rang through speeches from women at this year’s Republican National Convention: Despite how Trump’s public treatment of women may seem to some, he is an advocate for them behind closed doors.
    

            In speech after speech in Milwaukee this week, women spoke of quiet moments when they said Trump comforted them in the wake of Democratic attacks or media criticism, advocated for them professionally or showed compassion or familial care. They described him as a friend and a loving father and grandfather in the moments people don’t see.
    

            Trump has long been known for the brash, even vulgar way he sometimes speaks about women. He has also been dogged by allegations about sexual misconduct and extramarital affairs. Accusations of sexism plagued his 2016 presidential campaign, a race he won despite the October release of a video in which he bragged about being able to grab women by their genitals because he’s a celebrity.
    

            Speeches from women, including his family members and people who have worked for him, fit into a broader effort at the convention to soften his public image.
    

            “I was insulted as a guest at the White House Correspondents Dinner, my family was denied service and kicked out of a restaurant, and a parent at my 3-year-old son’s preschool spit on my car,” Sanders, who served as one of Trump’s White House press secretaries, said during her Tuesday night address. “And in those moments, it was President Trump who defended me.”
    

            Sanders, now the governor of Arkansas, said at one point the former president pulled her aside and told her, “Sarah, you’re smart, you’re beautiful, you’re tough, and they attack you because you’re good at your job.”
    

            Habba, one of Trump’s lawyers, said she wanted to take the audience “behind the headlines” to reveal “his character, his kindness” and his commitment to the country.
    

            “President Trump championed my journey, empowering me to be who I became today,” Habba said.
    

            Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s 2016 campaign manager and White House senior counselor, praised the former president for elevating women to key roles in his campaign and administration.
    

            “He saw something in me and the other working moms that perhaps we did not see in ourselves,” Conway said.
    

            Family members, from his granddaughter – who said the former president bragged to friends when she made the honor roll – to his son’s partners shared their personal experiences with him.
    

            “I know what you hear out there about Donald Trump,” Lara Trump, the former president’s daughter-in-law and the co-chair of the Republican National Committee, said in her speech. “But when I look at Donald Trump, I see a wonderful father, father-in-law and, of course, grandfather to my two young children, Luke and Carolina.”
    

            The effort to reframe Trump’s treatment of women was part of a larger push to soften the former president’s image in the wake of the assassination attempt last weekend.
    

            “The media’s negative portrayal of President Trump and his treatment of women is entirely false,” Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign’s national press secretary, said in a statement. “President Trump is loved by millions of women across the country, and those who know him personally, myself included, will tell you he’s supportive, generous, and kind.”
    

            Leavitt added that during Trump’s first term he supported policies such as expanding access to paid family leave and child care and that he would do so again.
    

            Broadening the former president’s appeal to women will be key in November. Biden’s success in swing states in 2020 is attributable in part to his stronger support among women turned off by Trump’s brashness. In 2020, Biden won 57% of women, compared with 42% who backed Trump, according to CNN exit polls.
    

            But it’s not clear whether praise of the former president’s private behavior will impact how people perceive years of his public behavior. Trump had faced allegations of sexism since he sought the Republican nomination in 2016.
    

            During a 2015 GOP primary debate, moderator Megyn Kelly asked then-candidate Trump about his history of referring to women he disagreed with as “fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.” He later blasted Kelly and said she had “blood coming out of her wherever.”
    

            During that first campaign, he insinuated that both Carly Fiorina, one of his Republican opponents, and the wife of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, another 2016 rival, were unattractive.

Trump’s epic week began with cheating death


            And in the final weeks of that election, old Access Hollywood footage of him bragging about being able to kiss women and grab them by their genitals prompted mass condemnation from members of his own party.
    

            Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, his 2016 Democratic opponent, argued that Trump’s past treatment of women made him unfit to be president.
    

            “When I think about what we now know about Donald Trump and what he has been doing for 30 years, he sure had spent a lot of time demeaning, degrading, insulting and assaulting women,” Clinton said at a Florida rally days before the election.
    

            Clinton’s loss, and fears over what a Trump presidency would entail, prompted global Women’s March protests.
    

            Since then, other parts of his background have been scrutinized. Earlier this year, Trump was found guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up an alleged extramarital affair with a porn star. In 2023, a civil court found Trump liable of sexually abusing writer E. Jean Carroll in the 1990s. The former president was later ordered to pay millions of dollars in damages for his defamatory statements disparaging Carroll and denying her rape allegations.
    

            Trump has denied the affair at the center of the hush money case and denied assaulting Carroll.
    

            The former president has also denied about a dozen other sexual misconduct allegations, including groping and sexual harassment, that took place before he took office. In 2017, Trump called the claims “fake news.”
    

            Sanders, the White House press secretary at the time, was asked whether the White House’s official position was that all the women were lying.
    

            “Yeah, we have been clear on that from the beginning, and the president has spoken on it,” she said at an October 2017 press briefing.
    

            For much of the 2024 campaign, Democrats have focused their criticisms of Trump on his policies, specifically his appointment of Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn federal abortion protections. But as President Joe Biden has faced increased pressure within his own party to step aside, he has started to broaden his attacks. During a rally in Detroit earlier this month, Biden referenced both the hush money case and the civil case involving Carroll.
    

            “Mr. Trump raped her,” Biden said, referencing what the judge in the Carroll case wrote.
    

            In Milwaukee, however, Trump’s criminal cases were framed as further evidence of persecution he’s suffered for his supporters.
    

            “Every attack on President Trump only strengthens our movement,” said Habba, who represented Trump in the Carroll defamation suit. “Sham indictments and baseless allegations will not deter us, because the only crime President Trump has committed is loving America.”

CNN_43,"Restorations are ongoing after global tech outage strands thousands at airports, disrupts hospitals and public services",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/us/flights-canceled-delayed-global-it-outage/index.html,2024-07-21 04:47:00,us,"
            Operations are gradually being restored but delays continue for a second day after “the largest IT outage in history” disrupted sectors across the globe, leaving thousands of passengers stranded at airports, emergency communication services down and blood donation centers without vital shipments.
    

            Airlines, businesses, government agencies, health and emergency services, banks and schools and universities around the world ground to a halt or saw services disrupted due to a flawed software update for Microsoft Windows operating systems issued by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, experts told CNN.
    

            CrowdStrike’s CEO said a fix has been deployed, but experts say getting systems back in order will be a lengthy process.
    

            The outage affected an estimated 8.5 million Windows devices, less than 1 percent of all Windows machines, according to a Saturday blog post from Microsoft. “While the percentage was small, the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services,” Microsoft said.
    

            According to the tracking website FlightAware, over 1,600 flights into, out of, or within the US have been canceled and almost 5,000 delayed, as of Saturday afternoon.
    

            On Friday, more than 3,000 flights were canceled and more than 11,000 were delayed, according to FlightAware.com.
    

            Worldwide, major airlines have said services are being restored.

Timeline: How the CrowdStrike outage unfolded


            A majority of United Airlines systems have recovered from Friday’s outage, the airline said in a statement.
    

            “While most of our systems have recovered from the worldwide third-party software outage, we may continue to experience some disruption to our operation, including flight delays and cancellations,” United said.
    

            Delta Air Lines is “continuing its operational recovery” after the outage prompted the airline to pause flying on Friday, according to a Saturday morning update. Still, over 600 Delta flights have been canceled Saturday.
    

            “Additional cancelations are expected as some of Delta’s technology continues to recover from Friday morning’s vendor-caused issue,” the update said.
    

            Jetstar Japan, Hong Kong Express and Cebu Pacific airlines said Saturday their operations are gradually being restored too.
    

            Frustrated passengers lined up at airports backed up with flight cancellations and delays, some missing life events like funerals and birthdays. At Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, long lines of passengers waited for assistance Saturday, with many flights still canceled or delayed.
    

            After spending more than 19 hours at Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, one passenger won’t be getting home to Los Angeles anytime soon.
    

            “I couldn’t get another flight rebooked because the system is down, so I couldn’t get any vouchers for food, hotel, nothing,” Kiah Hampton told CNN on Friday afternoon.
    

            Hampton described sleeping on the floor at the airport after a previous flight was canceled Thursday night, adding, “It seems like I am going to have to sleep here tonight.”
    

            New Jersey resident Jennifer Small likewise slept at the airport overnight and had her flight canceled twice.

            “I want to get home to my son. I want to get home to Jersey,” Small said, adding she didn’t believe she would be able to travel home until Saturday.
    

            Thousands of people crammed together in airports across the country, waiting for answers. Passenger Ty Kelley, who was traveling to Philadelphia to attend a funeral, described it as a chaotic scene.
    

            “It’s wild, it’s crazy, it’s crowded — I have anxiety right now,” she said. “I’m going to wait in this long line and try and get to Philadelphia today.”
    

            Another passenger told CNN she had been traveling with her toddler to Boston for a birthday party. “It has been frustrating to say the least,” Spirit Airlines customer Miya Haney said.
    

            The issues didn’t just plague airports. Americans felt the impacts of the outage in various facets of their everyday lives, including while trying to call 911 during emergencies in some areas, getting or renewing their driver’s licenses or shipping or receiving packages.
    

            There were reports of 911 outages in various states, like Alaska, and cities, like Phoenix, where the system was down for hours but has since been restored.
    

Driver’s license offices were closed or had limited services in Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina and Georgia.
    

            Meanwhile, thousands of companies around the world struggled with payment processing after the outage brought down systems across a wide range of businesses. Major hotels, including Marriott International and some Hiltons, were impacted both in regard to payment processing and delays to check in-processes.
    

            Cybercriminals capitalized on the chaos by promoting fake websites filled with malicious software designed to compromise unsuspecting victims, according to warnings from the US government and multiple cybersecurity professionals.
    

            Former McAfee CEO Dave DeWalt told CNN a group of private sector and government agencies worked overnight to “ascertain the threat” and find a solution to the global outage. The call included the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and other private and government organizations.
    

            CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz apologized to customers Friday for the outage and said the company is working with those affected.
    

            “We understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption,” Kurtz posted on X. “We are working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on.”
    

            But it could be easier said than done: Manual restarts of individual systems take time and expertise some customers don’t have, which is why companies were slow to recover from the outage.
    

            CrowdStrike promised customers “full transparency” on how the outage occurred and it would “prevent anything like this from happening again.”
    

            While most hospitals remained open to treat medical emergencies, some said an inability to access electronic medical records and order lab tests and prescriptions had caused them to cancel patient appointments and surgeries.
    

            Hospital workers scrambled to provide needed care to patients without the technology they rely on.
    

            Kim Brown was near the end of her shift Thursday night as a labor and delivery nurse at Kaiser Permanente in San Jose, California, when the hospital’s computer systems, which it relies on to care for women in labor and their babies, went down.
    

            “All of our babies get little plastic tags that will set off an alarm if they get too close to an exit or an elevator. That went down,” Brown said. “It was unnerving because we had zero information. It was just, ‘Oh, well, everything’s out now.’”
    

            With the outage posing a security risk to newborn babies, the hospital called security guards to sit by the elevators to keep them safe.

            At the postpartum care unit in Dignity Health California Hospital Medical Center in Los Angeles, nurse Laura Topete said she ran into a roadblock trying to get analgesic drugs for a woman who was in pain after delivery, but couldn’t access the doctor’s orders to see what kind of medications she could have.
    

            “The patient was in pain longer than she needed to be,” Topete said.
    

            Epic Systems, a company that makes widely used electronic health records systems for hospitals and doctors’ offices, said on Friday its Nebula cloud-based platform had been impacted by the outage overnight and some services, including telehealth visits, were not available during the outage. Another electronic medical records company, Veradigm, also said its systems were impacted by the CrowdStrike outage.
    

            A spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services said it was “working to assess the impact of the CrowdStrike outage on patient care and HHS systems, services, and operations,” along with federal, state, local and private sector partners.
    

            In addition to hospitals, blood donation centers experienced challenges and altered blood shipment methods due to flight delays. New York Blood Center, which supplies about 200 hospitals in the Northeast, initiated an emergency driving operation to distribute collected blood. And Blood Assurance was concerned for its planned shipment of at least 20 platelets — the disc-shaped fragments that help with clotting — due to flight issues.
    

            The impacts of the global tech outage were felt across the US as countless government agencies waited for services to get back to normal.
    

            The mayor of Portland, Oregon, issued an emergency declaration due to the ongoing outage. It affected the city’s servers in city data centers, employee computers and single sign-on to cloud services, Mayor Ted Wheeler said in a news release.
    

            In Southern California, the disruption caused connectivity issues at the Los Angeles County Superior Court and it temporarily limited jail bookings in San Diego County, officials said.
    

            Elsewhere, some voting locations in Arizona experienced outages in Maricopa County as early voting continued in the state’s primary, according to the Maricopa County Elections Department. The county is the fourth-most populous in the US and is home to Phoenix, the county website said.
    

            The Social Security Administration closed its local offices to the public on Friday after the outage shut down numerous services. The agency said in a statement it expected longer wait times for the national 800 phone number, and some online services may be unavailable.

CNN_44,"At least 80 injured, Houthis say, as Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen day after Tel Aviv drone attack",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/middleeast/yemen-israel-strikes-hodeidah-intl/index.html,2024-07-21 05:50:00,world,"
Israeli airstrikes targeted Houthi rebels in Yemen a day after the Iran-backed group claimed a deadly attack on the Israeli city of Tel Aviv.
    

            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its fighter jets struck “military targets of the Houthi terrorist regime” in the area of Yemen’s Hodeidah Port on Saturday in what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said was a direct response to the death of a 50-year-old Israeli in a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv Friday.
    

            This is the first time Israel has struck Yemen, according to Israeli officials.
    

            The Houthi-run Al Masirah TV said the Israeli strikes targeted oil facilities in the port on Yemen’s west coast and injured at least 80 people, most of them with “severe burns.”
    

Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam said the strikes had also hit civilian targets and a power station. He slammed what he said was “brutal Israeli aggression” aimed at increasing the “suffering of the people of Yemen” and pressuring it to stop its support of Gaza.
    

            Houthi army spokesperson Yehya Saree vowed to respond to the strike, saying the Houthis would not hesitate to strike Israel’s “vital targets” and warning that Tel Aviv was still not safe.
    

            “We have prepared for a long war with this enemy until the aggression stops and the blockade on the Palestinian people is lifted,” Saree said.
    

            Netanyahu said in a statement on Saturday that Hodeidah was “not an innocent port.”
    

            “It was used for military purposes, it was used as an entry point for deadly weapons supplied to the Houthis by Iran,” Netanyahu said, adding that Hodeidah had also been used to attack international shipping in the Red Sea.
    

            Netanyahu also said the operation, which hit targets 1,800 km (1,118 miles) from Israel’s borders, shows the enemy Israel is serious about responding to threats.
    

            “It makes it clear to our enemies that there is no place that the long arm of the state of Israel will not reach,” Netanyahu said.
    

            IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said the strikes were also in response to the roughly 200 projectiles the rebel group has fired towards Israel since October, when Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza began.

Israel investigates security failures around deadly Tel Aviv drone strike


            Since the start of the war, the Yemeni rebels have regularly targeted the country with drones and missiles, most of which have been intercepted by Israel’s defenses or those of its allies. However, the Houthis have claimed their drone attack in Tel Aviv Friday – which also injured 10 people – was performed by a new drone capable of “bypassing the enemy’s interception systems.”
    

            The Houthis have also regularly attacked US targets and commercial shipping in the Red Sea.
    

            Both the UK and the US have responded to the attacks on shipping by carrying out strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. However, Israel has not taken part in those responses.
    

            An Israeli defense official told CNN that this was a 100% Israeli strike. The official said Israel had previously let the US and UK take the lead on responding to Houthi attacks but decided to respond itself this time because of the death of the Israeli citizen in Tel Aviv.
    

            According to the official, Israeli Defense Minister Gallant informed US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin before the strike was carried out.
    

            The defense official added that Israel was able to strike so quickly because it had been preparing for this scenario for months.
    

            A White House official said US President Joe Biden had been briefed on “developments” in the Middle East. A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said the US had not coordinated with Israel on the airstrikes, but added that the US fully recognizes “Israel’s right to self-defense.”
    

            The strike on Hodeidah comes amid rising tensions in the region.
    

            In recent weeks the Lebanese Iran-backed Islamist group has been ramping up cross-border attacks with Israel after months of low-intensity fighting, prompting the Israeli military to warn that it is prepared to launch a large-scale attack on its northern border.
    

            Following the Hodeidah strike, Israel’s Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir congratulated Netanyahu on the operation and said Israel should “adopt the same policy against Hezbollah in Lebanon.”
    

            Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant echoed Gvir’s sentiment. Smotrich said Israel must continue to attack “with all its might even in distant places,” while Gallant said “the blood of Israeli citizens has a price,” and that anywhere Israelis are attacked the “result will be identical.”

            “The fire that is currently burning in Hodeidah, is seen across the Middle East and the significance is clear,” Gallant said.
    

            Hezbollah in Lebanon condemned the attack on Yemen and said “we stand firmly with the Yemeni people in defending themselves, their sovereignty, and their heroic and historic stance alongside Palestine.”
    

            Meanwhile, Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Israel Katz called on the international community to “maximize sanctions on Iran.”
    

            “Iran supports, trains, and finances the Houthi terror organization as part of its regional network of terror organizations aimed at attacking Israel,” he said.
    

            “Iran is the head of the snake – it must be stopped now,” Katz added.
    

            Iran condemned the Israeli strike on Hodeidah. Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Nasser Kanaani warned of the risk of war in the region, saying Israel’s actions in Gaza were the “root” of the escalating tensions.
    

            “The oppressed but powerful people of Yemen are paying the price for their honorable support of the innocent citizens, women and children of Gaza,” Kanaani said.

            A German citizen has been sentenced to death in Belarus after being charged with terrorism and mercenary activities, according to a Belarusian human rights group.
    

            The group Human Rights Center “Viasna” said the German national is a 29-year-old German Red Cross employee named Rico Krieger.
    

            According to his LinkedIn profile, he worked as an emergency medical technician for the German Red Cross and as an armed security officer for the US Embassy in Berlin.
    

            Krieger was sentenced in the Minsk Regional Court on June 24, Viasna said on its website on Friday.
    

            Krieger was charged under six articles of the Criminal Code of Belarus, according to Viasna, including “mercenary activity,” “agent activity,” an “act of terrorism,” the “creation of an extremist formation,” “intentional disrepair of a vehicle or communication lines,” and “illegal actions in relation to firearms, ammunition and explosives.”
    

            Viasna also reported that Krieger was found guilty of “arranging an explosion in order to influence decision-making by authorities, intimidate the population, [and] destabilize public order.” It is unclear exactly what led up to Krieger’s alleged crimes or when they occurred.
    

            “The Federal Foreign Office and the Embassy in Minsk are providing consular support to the individual concerned and are working intensively on his behalf with the Belarusian authorities,” a spokesperson from the German Foreign Office told CNN on Saturday, in an apparent reference to Krieger.

            “The death penalty is a cruel and inhumane form of punishment that Germany rejects under all circumstances. We are actively working worldwide to abolish it and are strongly advocating against its execution in all affected cases,” the spokesperson added.
    

            Belarus says it has ensured consular access to a German national, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Anatoly Glaz said in a statement on X. Minsk has “proposed a number of options” to Germany “for the development of the situation,” he said, according to Belarusian state media BelTA. 


            “There have been contacts with the German side on this topic, of course. This criminal is a German citizen and we understand the German side’s concern for him,” said Glaz, according to BelTA.”Consultations on this topic are being held by the foreign ministries of the two countries,” he added.
    

            The German Red Cross (DRK) told CNN’s German affiliate N-TV that while “the man in question,” without naming Krieger, had previously worked for them, his stay abroad was not related to his work with the DRK.
    

            CNN has also reached out to the German Red Cross for comment.
    

            “I am concerned by news that German citizen Rico Krieger was sentenced to death by Lukashenko’s regime in Belarus,” exiled Belarusian opposition figure Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said on X on Friday.
    

            “We are collecting more information on his case at the moment. From what we know, he was accused of several so-called ‘extremism’ related crimes,” she added.

CNN_46,Residents stage rare protest over power cuts in Russia’s Krasnodar,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/europe/russia-krasnodar-protest-power-cuts-intl/index.html,2024-07-21 04:44:00,world,"
            Residents in the southern Russian city of Krasnodar staged a rare protest on Saturday over electricity cuts and water supply interruptions due to a power grid failure amid record-high temperatures.
    

            Angry residents gathered on the streets near residential buildings shouting “Give me light,” after experiencing power cuts for several days, videos posted on social media show.
    

            Work to repair the accident is underway and residents are being supplied with drinking water, the city’s mayor Evgeny Naumov said Saturday. “We all need to remain calm and understand what is happening, although this is not easy,” he said in a Telegram post.
    

            The power cuts came as the city is experiencing unusually high temperatures and on Friday a daily record was set for the fourth day in a row, according to Russian state news agency TASS. The maximum temperature was 39 degrees Celsius on Friday, according to TASS.
    

            Krasnodar Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said Saturday that the “abnormal heat,” the lack of proper capacities during peak load periods and the operation of the Rostov Nuclear Power Plant were some of the factors that contributed to the outages. One of the units of the Rostov plant, the largest in the region, was temporarily shut down earlier this week due to a technical malfunction.
    

            “There has been abnormal heat in the Krasnodar region for a week now. The load on the energy system is colossal,” Governor Kondratyev said. “I know and understand all the indignation of residents due to the power outages.”
    

            He said he is “in constant contact” with energy workers and that “Where possible, emergency crews repair breakdowns as quickly as possible.” Kondratyev said the city’s mayor is currently in the area that has been affected the most and “constantly reports on the situation.”
    

            Public protests in Russia are very rare, especially after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The government has introduced war censorship laws that can result in severe punishment, including imprisonment, for discrediting the military.

CNN_47,Open Championship: American Billy Horschel edges ahead after Shane Lowry sunk by ‘coffin’ bunker nightmare,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/sport/billy-horschel-open-championship-third-round-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-21 05:02:00,world,"
Billy Horschel will carry the slenderest of leads into the final 18 holes of the Open Championship in Scotland, as the American capitalized on Shane Lowry’s grisly slide to edge clear in a rain-soaked third round.
    

            The eight-time PGA Tour winner navigated a testing Royal Troon in two-under 69 to edge clear by a stroke but will have to hold off a chasing group of six players in his rearview mirror to clinch his first major title.
    

            A closing bogey put a dampener on what had been another strong showing from Horschel, who tore out of the blocks with four birdies across his first nine holes.

‘Perfection’: South Korea’s Kim Si-woo makes historic 238-yard ace on one of the Open’s most menacing holes


            The 37-year-old has often struggled at the Open – missing the cut in six of his previous nine outings – but continues to impress amid brutal wet and windy conditions that sent half of the world’s top-10 ranked players tumbling towards an early exit.


            “I’ve wanted to be here my entire life. I’m finally here. I’m embracing it,” Horschel, whose career best major performance was a tied-fourth finish at the 2013 US Open, told reporters.
    

            “Something I’ve done this year … is manifest seeing myself holding the trophy before I go to sleep every night, envisioning myself holding that trophy on 18, walking out to the crowd and being congratulated as Open champion.
    

            “That’s what I’m going to do again tonight, and hopefully that comes true tomorrow. If it doesn’t, then I’ll get back on the grind and work harder to get back in a position like this again.”
    

            A bunched chasing pack sets the stage for a grandstand finish, with South Africa’s Thriston Lawrence, American trio Sam Burns, Russell Henley and Xander Schauffele, as well as English pair Justin Rose and Daniel Brown just one stroke behind Horschel’s four-under par benchmark.
    

            World No. 272 Brown had looked on course to take a shock lead into Sunday after birdieing the 16th hole, only to finish with a bogey and a double bogey that resigned him to a two-over 73.
    

            Regardless, the 29-year-old – who had to go through final qualifying just to stamp a last-minute ticket to his major debut this week – sits within striking distance of what would be a truly stunning sporting upset.
    

            “I suppose a lot of people probably thought I was going to be shaking this morning and really nervous, but I’ve been absolutely fine,” Brown, who clinched his first victory on the European Tour last year, told reporters.
    

            “After the last two holes it’s a little bit of a kick in the teeth, I suppose, but if you’d have told me I was going to go into the final round of the Open one or two shots back, I would have ripped your hand off.”
    

            Brown’s playing partner Lowry had carried a two stroke advantage over the Englishman into the weekend and started confidently, but was sent into a tailspin after the pair both found the infamous “coffin” bunker from the eighth tee.
    

            While Brown managed to exit the sand relatively smoothly to leave the “Postage Stamp” hole with bogey, his Irish counterpart put himself in even greater trouble when he pulled his escape effort into the thick rough beyond the green.
    

            The 2019 champion had rebounded superbly from a double bogey at 11th hole during the second round, but could not channel the same response on Saturday, signing off with his fifth bogey of the back nine for a 77.
    

            Having taken a three shot advantage to the eighth tee, the 37-year-old will start the final round three strokes adrift of leader Horschel, and one back from world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, who shot even-par 71 to stay in contention for a second major title of the season.
    

            “This game is just hard, and now you feel how hard it was for playing well the first two days in those conditions. Honestly, it was brutal,” Lowry told reporters.
    

            “The 8th hole was killer really, make par there, and you can still shoot three or four-over from there and still be leading the tournament.
    

            “I don’t really know what to say. It was a grind. It wasn’t much fun.”
    

            Lowry will tee off alongside Australian Adam Scott at 1:45 pm local time (8:45 am EDT) Sunday, with leader Horschel and Lawrence the last group out at 2:25 pm (9:25 pm EDT).

CNN_48,The global software outage affected this forecaster’s broadcast. He took the weather report into his own hands – literally,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/us/global-it-outage-california-forecaster-trnd/index.html,2024-07-21 06:54:00,us,"
            As what was possibly the “largest IT outage in history” impacted computer systems across the globe this week, a Northern California weather forecaster found a creative – and hands-on – solution to keep his viewers updated as his news station’s software remained offline.
    

            On Friday, many computer systems for healthcare, business, technology and government sectors worldwide crashed after cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike issued a software update for Microsoft Windows operating systems.
    

            The widespread disturbance affected 8.5 million Windows devices, or fewer than 1% of all Windows machines, Microsoft said Saturday. The lengthy process of restoring operations continued on Saturday.


            But early Friday morning, Preston Donion, a forecaster and multimedia journalist for CNN affiliate KRCR in Redding, California, says he woke up to chaos after “everything had gone completely haywire” with the systems at his job the night before.
    

            “They didn’t end up even running a broadcast on our stations at 10 and 11 (p.m.), so they were really kaput,” Donion told CNN on Saturday.
    

            He says he rushed into work to find that, sure enough, they had no weather graphics available.
    

            Donion and his producer teamed up to figure out how they could display a weather forecast on air with the systems down, he said.
    

            “Because I have my numbers, I can get my forecast built, but I have no way to communicate that,” recalled Donion, who’s worked at KRCR since June 2022.

            He says he spent the first half hour of the show pulling up websites or screen sharing from one of the station’s iPads and stepping off the screen to read numbers.
    

            “But I realized that wasn’t very engaging, wasn’t very effective,” Donion said.
    

            About 45 minutes into the broadcast, the Washington native says he used a Sharpie and a pen to draw a rough sketch of a map he had saved as a reference for familiarizing himself with California.
    

            “I just went to work on the back of a piece of paper that had my rundown on it, and just did my best,” Donion said.
    

            His on-air solution to the tech fiasco turned out to be the hand-drawn maps of his coverage area, which he admitted to viewers weren’t “perfect” renderings.
    

            “I just drew this up,” Donion can be seen telling local viewers in a video he shared to his X account Friday. “I know Trinity County looks like it’s been on somewhat of a diet there, and things are a little square in Modoc County, but I wanted to give you a visual.”
    

            He also shared on air the seven-day forecast using a chart he typed in his phone’s Notes app, the video shows.
    

            “I thought it was the best way to just kind of put together some visuals without having computer technology, so it was fun to me,” said Donion. One viewer commented the retro approach to the forecast took them back to the 1970s, when TV meteorologists used paper maps and magnets in their weather centers, he said.
    
Well, it has been a heck of a morning... With the outage, I present to you perhaps the most cobbled-together forecast of all time! Thanks for bearing with us today!! #CAwx pic.twitter.com/eXoWfJiBaJ

            “I definitely got some messages on Facebook and on Twitter saying, ‘Hey, you know, thanks for adapting. We appreciate you just getting the information out,’” Donion said.
    

            “Other meteorologists have reached out and said, ‘You know, I was thinking I’d have to get my magnets out,’” he added.
    

            Many of KRCR’s systems were back online by the end of Donion’s shift around 11 a.m. local time Friday, and the evening shows went smoothly, he shared.
    

            CNN Meteorologist Elisa Raffa gave kudos to Donion for his quick thinking.
    

            While learning about meteorology in school, Raffa says weather students learned to hand-draw fronts and storm systems.
    

            “It’s a skill you never think you’ll need again – until the computers go out,” Raffa said.
    

            “And if you ask a 30-plus-year veteran in the industry, they’d be happy to remind us that this was how weather was done before the magic of green screens,” she added. “Markers, chalk, magnets and a whole lot of paper were used to get a forecast on TV. It’s amazing how much we depend on technology now!”

CNN_49,Energized crowd greets Harris at Provincetown fundraiser,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/politics/harris-fundraiser-biden-buttigieg/index.html,2024-07-21 07:49:00,politics,"
            Defending Joe Biden and ripping into Donald Trump, Kamala Harris got one of her most roaring responses in years as she spoke at a fundraiser Saturday afternoon in Provincetown, Massachusetts.
    

            The vice president didn’t directly address the turmoil facing her running mate — whom she referred to at points as “our president” and “one of the most consequential presidents in American history” — but she did speak to the anxiety pulsing through the white tent in the shadow of the Pilgrim Monument by repeating, “We are going to win this election,” and asking the crowd to tell that to their friends.
    

            “It’s not going to be easy. But we are a group of people who understand anything worthwhile takes a lot of hard work,” Harris said. “It takes grit. It takes believing in something and then going forward.”

Clintons privately urge donors to keep giving to Biden as long as he remains presumptive nominee


            The event was scheduled weeks ago, in very different political circumstances. By the time she took the stage, Harris was greeted with the excitement of many in the crowd who clearly believed they might be looking at a replacement nominee and, soon, potential next president. A $1 million fundraising goal for the afternoon was more than doubled; a large oil portrait of Harris’ face was positioned on an easel; toward the back; and a woman shouting out, “Go get ‘em, Kamala!” was greeted with a huge cheer and applause.
    

            Harris — who stood in front of a giant sign declaring the location to be “VPTOWN,” a riff on the town’s “Ptown” nickname — wasn’t the only one to get a warm reception. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who is seen by some leading Democrats as a potential running mate should Harris become the nominee, spoke before she did.
    

            Buttigieg likewise expressed support for Biden and touted his accomplishments.
    

            “We aren’t so much holding on to a democracy as we are building one, making it more perfect, in this extraordinary American project that will turn 250 years old in 2026, during the president’s next term,” Buttigieg said.
    

            Addressing the mood of many Democrats, Buttigieg added, “That’s what is possible if we say no to the people out there banning books and yes to the people out there building bridges. That’s why I don’t just have dread about the worst that could happen, but hope for what comes next.”
    

            Organizers said the event raised more than $2 million, even as some big-dollar donors have held back from writing checks amid growing concerns about Biden’s candidacy, raising serious concerns about how long the campaign can continue operating in full force if circumstances don’t change.
    

            Harris, who is being very careful with what she says during this period, did not speak separately to reporters traveling with her. But as she boarded Air Force Two and one shouted to ask whether she has spoken to Biden and whether he’s well, she flashed a thumbs-up and said yes.
    

            At the event in front of a largely LGBTQ crowd, Harris talked about her record on key issues, including performing same-sex weddings early as San Francisco district attorney in 2004, and contrasting that to her new opponent, Trump’s running mate JD Vance, who opposed marriage equality and gender-affirming care. That, on top of Trump’s own record rolling back LGBTQ protections, Harris charged, is enough reason to oppose them.
    

            Harris closed by invoking Harvey Milk, the famed gay political pioneer in San Francisco.
    

            “Those who oppose progress will always try to suggest that a movement for freedom is somehow subversive and it undermines who we are as a nation.
    

            “Harvey Milk liked to say, ‘Hope will never be silent — and neither will we,’” Harris said.

CNN_50,"At least 3 killed and 87 injured, Houthis say, as Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen day after Tel Aviv drone attack",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/middleeast/yemen-israel-strikes-hodeidah-intl/index.html,2024-07-21 07:43:00,world,"
Israeli airstrikes targeted Houthi rebels in Yemen a day after the Iran-backed group claimed a deadly attack on the Israeli city of Tel Aviv.
    

            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its fighter jets struck “military targets of the Houthi terrorist regime” in the area of Yemen’s Hodeidah Port on Saturday in what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said was a direct response to the death of a 50-year-old Israeli in a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv Friday.
    

            This is the first time Israel has struck Yemen, according to Israeli officials.
    

            The Houthi-run Al Masirah TV said the Israeli strikes targeted oil facilities in the port on Yemen’s west coast, killing at least three people and injuring 87, most of them with “severe burns.”
    

Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam said the strikes had also hit civilian targets and a power station. He slammed what he said was “brutal Israeli aggression” aimed at increasing the “suffering of the people of Yemen” and pressuring it to stop its support of Gaza.
    

            Houthi army spokesperson Yehya Saree vowed to respond to the strike, saying the Houthis would not hesitate to strike Israel’s “vital targets” and warning that Tel Aviv was still not safe.
    

            “We have prepared for a long war with this enemy until the aggression stops and the blockade on the Palestinian people is lifted,” Saree said.
    

            Netanyahu said in a statement on Saturday that Hodeidah was “not an innocent port.”
    

            “It was used for military purposes, it was used as an entry point for deadly weapons supplied to the Houthis by Iran,” Netanyahu said, adding that Hodeidah had also been used to attack international shipping in the Red Sea.
    

            Netanyahu also said the operation, which hit targets 1,800 km (1,118 miles) from Israel’s borders, shows the enemy Israel is serious about responding to threats.
    

            “It makes it clear to our enemies that there is no place that the long arm of the state of Israel will not reach,” Netanyahu said.
    

            IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said the strikes were also in response to the roughly 200 projectiles the rebel group has fired towards Israel since October, when Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza began.

Israel investigates security failures around deadly Tel Aviv drone strike


            Since the start of the war, the Yemeni rebels have regularly targeted the country with drones and missiles, most of which have been intercepted by Israel’s defenses or those of its allies. However, the Houthis have claimed their drone attack in Tel Aviv Friday – which also injured 10 people – was performed by a new drone capable of “bypassing the enemy’s interception systems.”
    

            The Houthis have also regularly attacked US targets and commercial shipping in the Red Sea.
    

            Both the UK and the US have responded to the attacks on shipping by carrying out strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. However, Israel has not taken part in those responses.
    

            An Israeli defense official told CNN that this was a 100% Israeli strike. The official said Israel had previously let the US and UK take the lead on responding to Houthi attacks but decided to respond itself this time because of the death of the Israeli citizen in Tel Aviv.
    

            According to the official, Israeli Defense Minister Gallant informed US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin before the strike was carried out.
    

            The defense official added that Israel was able to strike so quickly because it had been preparing for this scenario for months.
    

            A White House official said US President Joe Biden had been briefed on “developments” in the Middle East. A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said the US had not coordinated with Israel on the airstrikes, but added that the US fully recognizes “Israel’s right to self-defense.”
    

            The Houthi movement, also known as Ansar Allah – Arabic for ‘Supporters of God’ – is a Shi’ite Islamist political and military organization backed by Iran, that emerged in the 1990s.
    

            Similar to chants used by Lebanon-based Iranian proxy Hezbollah, the Houthis’ official slogan reads, “God is the Greatest. Death to America. Death to Israel. Curse the Jews. Victory to Islam.”

            In 2014, Houthi forces allied with former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh took control of Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, from the UN-recognized Yemeni government, sparking a civil war that has afflicted the country ever since.
    

            Since March 2015, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have led a coalition in Yemen against Houthi forces.
    

            More recently, the group has come to be seen in parts of the largely-Sunni Muslim world and beyond as champions of the Palestinian cause, defending the people of Gaza against Israel.
    

            Since October 7, Houthi rebels have carried out numerous missile and drone attacks on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, asserting that these vessels are linked to Israel and its allies, which has escalated tensions throughout the Middle East.
    

            The strike on Hodeidah comes amid rising tensions in the region.
    

            In recent weeks the Lebanese Iran-backed Islamist group has been ramping up cross-border attacks with Israel after months of low-intensity fighting, prompting the Israeli military to warn that it is prepared to launch a large-scale attack on its northern border.
    

            Following the Hodeidah strike, Israel’s Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir congratulated Netanyahu on the operation and said Israel should “adopt the same policy against Hezbollah in Lebanon.”
    

            Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant echoed Gvir’s sentiment. Smotrich said Israel must continue to attack “with all its might even in distant places,” while Gallant said “the blood of Israeli citizens has a price,” and that anywhere Israelis are attacked the “result will be identical.”

            “The fire that is currently burning in Hodeidah, is seen across the Middle East and the significance is clear,” Gallant said.
    

            Hezbollah in Lebanon condemned the attack on Yemen and said “we stand firmly with the Yemeni people in defending themselves, their sovereignty, and their heroic and historic stance alongside Palestine.”
    

            Hamas also condemned the attack, calling it a “dangerous escalation.”
    

            Meanwhile, Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Israel Katz called on the international community to “maximize sanctions on Iran.”
    

            “Iran supports, trains, and finances the Houthi terror organization as part of its regional network of terror organizations aimed at attacking Israel,” he said.
    

            “Iran is the head of the snake – it must be stopped now,” Katz added.
    

            Iran condemned the Israeli strike on Hodeidah. Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Nasser Kanaani warned of the risk of war in the region, saying Israel’s actions in Gaza were the “root” of the escalating tensions.
    

            “The oppressed but powerful people of Yemen are paying the price for their honorable support of the innocent citizens, women and children of Gaza,” Kanaani said.

WaPo_1,Trump and Zelensky speak as election hangs over U.S. aid to Ukraine,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/19/trump-zelensky-call-ukraine/,2024-07-20 08:55:02.865520,,"Former president Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said they spoke on Friday as the U.S. presidential race hangs over the future of the war in Ukraine.Zelensky said in a statement that he emphasized the importance of U.S. support for Ukraine amid Russia’s invasion, now in its third year, and added that he and Trump agreed “to discuss at a personal meeting what steps can make peace fair and truly lasting.” Trump, in a social media post about their phone call, said he will “end the war” and that “Both sides will be able to come together and negotiate a deal that ends the violence” — but did not elaborate on the terms he would accept.Trump has spoken with many foreign leaders as he seeks the presidency, but his call with Zelensky is especially significant because of the election’s implications for U.S. policy toward Ukraine and Russia. A Trump victory could herald an abrupt change to the transatlantic support for Kyiv that President Biden has established.With less than four months left until the election, Trump and Biden have taken sharply contrasting positions on the war in Ukraine. Biden has been a staunch defender of Ukraine and a vocal critic of Russia’s invasion. Trump, who for years has often praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and touted an “America First” policy anchored in skepticism about intervention abroad, has privately said he could end the war by pressuring Ukraine to give up some territory, people familiar with the matter previously told The Washington Post. He has also suggested he would scale back vital U.S. military aid.At the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this week, Trump formally accepted the nomination and named a running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), who has strongly criticized U.S. assistance to Ukraine and voted against a major aid package this spring. Vance’s selection deepened fears among proponents of U.S. engagement abroad that a second Trump term would dramatically shift the United States’ posture. Zelensky has pushed for continued support from allies around the globe, urging them not to let up in helping his country’s cause.When Trump was president, he had a private chat with Zelensky that culminated in a rare kind of presidential rebuke on Capitol Hill. Five years ago, a July conversation with Zelensky led to Trump’s first impeachment in 2019. Trump had urged Zelensky to investigate Biden, a political rival, while raising the possibility of a White House meeting Zelensky wanted — prompting a whistleblower complaint and an effort to remove Trump from office that failed in the Republican-controlled Senate.Both leaders said in their readouts of Friday’s conversation that Zelensky congratulated Trump on securing the Republican nomination for president and condemned a gunman’s attempt to assassinate Trump at a campaign rally last weekend in Pennsylvania.In his statement on the call, Zelensky wrote that he “noted the vital bipartisan and bicameral American support for protecting our nation’s freedom and independence” and said, “Ukraine will always be grateful to the United States for its help in strengthening our ability to resist Russian terror. Russian attacks on our cities and villages continue every day.”Putin has said he will end the war only if Kyiv drops its efforts to join NATO and surrenders territory claimed by Russia — demands that Ukraine flatly rejects. Trump said at a debate with Biden in June that Putin’s terms are “not acceptable,” but also emphasized the amount of U.S. money going to Ukraine and said he would push to end the war swiftly.“I will have that war settled between Putin and Zelensky as president-elect, before I take office,” Trump said, lamenting “people being killed so needlessly, so stupidly.” He did not explain how exactly he would broker such a peace and suggested Putin respects him more than Biden.Biden has repeatedly pushed for continued assistance to Ukraine, and in April signed the aid package with bipartisan support, despite fierce resistance from some “America First” Republicans who argued such spending is not in the United States’ interest.Some of the billions in funds were given via a loan that the U.S. president could forgive. Trump had advocated for a loan rather than a gift.Vance, Trump’s vice-presidential pick, has emerged as a leader of the GOP’s isolationist wing, concerning some hawkish Republicans who believe it’s important for the United States to aid allies abroad. Vance wrote an op-ed this spring arguing that the support the Biden administration urged would not defeat Russia.Zelensky advocated forcefully for aid at this month’s NATO summit in Washington and noted the foreign policy stakes of the presidential election. “The whole world is looking to November,” he said.Like Biden, Zelensky argued that Putin would not stop in Ukraine if unchecked and would go on to threaten NATO countries, forcing further U.S. involvement. The Ukrainian president acknowledged Trump’s and Biden’s differences but said he believes Putin “will hate both of them.”Michael Birnbaum contributed to this report."
WaPo_2,"Sarah Gibson, rising pianist and composer, dies at 38",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/07/19/sarah-gibson-composer-dead-obituary/,2024-07-20 08:38:02.865520,,"Sarah Gibson, an American pianist and composer whose music combined grace, invention, lyricism and prismatic color, died July 14 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 38.The cause was colon cancer, said her husband, Aaron Fullerton.Ms. Gibson’s death came as a shock to the close-knit classical music community, where her work had come in for excited admiration ever since she was in her early 20s. She had been commissioned to write a piece for the Proms series of BBC-sponsored classical music concerts at London’s Royal Albert Hall in August.She had her new piece, entitled “beyond the beyond,” nearly finished for its world premiere but grew too sick to finish it in time. Instead, the BBC Philharmonic is scheduled to play an earlier composition by Ms. Gibson, “warp & weft” (2021) for large orchestra, on Aug. 8. The world premiere of “beyond the beyond” will happen at a BBC-sponsored concert in 2025, in a version completed by a friend and longtime colleague, the composer and pianist Thomas Kotcheff.It is expensive to create a work for full orchestra, and most of Ms. Gibson’s early works were for small groups — “Sea Monkey” (2010), “sure baby, mañana” (2016), “Outsider” (2017) and “I prefer living in color” (2017). Ms. Gibson also made a chamber arrangement of the Afro-British pop musician Laura Mvula’s “She.” (Her musical works were often inspired by the works of visual artists, many of them women.)In 2022, Ms. Gibson was commissioned by the League of American Orchestras to write “to make this mountain taller,” which has already been given its premiere by the Sarasota Orchestra in Florida, with more performances to come.“To have a commission that gives you a platform like this, with a confirmed premiere and multiple performances, is just huge,” Ms. Gibson told music writer Nancy Malitz. “It’s generally much easier to get your smaller pieces performed, and it’s frankly impractical to write a full orchestra piece if you’re only hoping that it might get played, no matter how much you want to scratch that itch.”Sarah Elizabeth Gibson was born in Spartanburg, S.C., on May 21, 1986, and grew up in the Atlanta suburb of Roswell. Her father sold retirement plans, and her mother was a homemaker.She began taking piano lessons at 7 and by her teens was a pianist and principal keyboardist for the Atlanta Symphony Youth Orchestra. Writing in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, music critic Pierre Ruhe in 2004 praised her six-minute concerto for cello and strings, “Summer’s Breath.” Ms. Gibson, he noted, “creates moments of striking elegance and panache, particularly in her orchestral writing — a serious talent to watch.”At Indiana University in 2008, she received a double bachelor’s degree in piano performance and music composition. From the University of Southern California, she received a master’s degree (2010) and doctorate (2015) in composition.In addition to her husband, whom she married in 2014, survivors include their son, Benjamin Fullerton; her parents, Joseph Gibson and the former Beth Medlin of Johns Creek, Ga.; and a brother.With Kotcheff, Ms. Gibson co-founded the new music piano duo, Hocket, and was a core artist for Piano Spheres, a performing arts organization in Los Angeles that presents concerts of new music.She served as assistant director for the Los Angeles Philharmonic Composer Fellowship Program and held teaching roles at colleges and conservatories in Southern California.“Sarah was on a brilliant upward trajectory with her writing and career,"" said composer Andrew Norman, a two-time Pulitzer Prize finalist. “She was creating powerful, personal music. ... We are left with a beautifully crafted and deeply felt body of work that will live on."""
WaPo_3,Capital Fringe fest more or less retains its weirdo spirit,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater/2024/07/19/capital-fringe-2024/,2024-07-20 08:19:02.865520,,"Like other resilient organisms, the Capital Fringe Festival has survived via frequent mutation.This year’s edition, the 17th, includes 34 productions, roughly a quarter as many as a decade ago, when the festival was at its most sprawling. Once again, it has moved, its five venues being split between the Edlavitch DCJCC, which hosts two, and the 1100 block of Connecticut Avenue NW, where it occupies three storefronts.Sadly, there is no official bar. The Baldacchino Gypsy Tent Bar and its successor, the Fringe Arts Bar, were a huge part of why Fringe veterans recall the decade of festivals circa 2008-2017 with such fondness. Though the festival moved during that era, from a now-razed former restaurant it had been leasing in Mount Vernon Triangle to a gallery space on Florida Avenue NE in Trinidad it purchased in 2014, both locales had a central outdoor gathering place selling cold drinks just steps away from several of the performance venues — a massive value-add. (Capital Fringe eventually opted to sell the Florida Avenue building after a planned renovation ran into funding problems.)I’d covered the festival intensively during that era, and after a number of years away, I was eager to dive back in and see how, or if, it had changed. Maddeningly, the Capital Fringe website does not offer a calendar view, which made building a sample platter needlessly difficult. Still, I tried to curate an itinerary that conformed to my arbitrary notion of Fringeitude: I looked for things that seemed idiosyncratic, personal, District-centric or otherwise unlikely to be available in another context.I chose one show — director Michael Chamberlin’s 50-minute edit of Ben Power’s translation of Euripides’s infanticidal tragedy “Medea” — because it was one of the first of the festival, and because a close friend (who happens to be a Washington Post staffer) was in it. Express versions of famous tragedies have been something of a Fringe staple, and often funny. (Tragedy plus time equals comedy, but tragedy-minus-performing-time can have the same effect.) “Medea” wasn’t funny, but it was lavish by Fringe standards, featuring a cast of a dozen and making good use of its venue — the DCJCC’s 140-seat Cafritz Hall — with stark lighting effects throwing dramatic shadows on the curtain behind the actors. Happily, they played to a full house.I picked my next show, the musical “Over Her Dead Body (Revival)” because I’d enjoyed Pinky Swear Productions’ many prior Fringe entries. This one is a lightly revised, new-to-me remount of an offering they’d first staged in 2016, and — as performer/co-artistic director Karen Lange announced — the first show the company would be taking to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, which takes place in Scotland next month. It imagined a live-in-the-studio broadcast of a radio show called “Bluegrass Benediction.” Members of the company sang murder ballads like “Long Black Veil” and “Delia’s Gone” while offering tongue-in-cheek advice about how to avoid becoming the subject of one. “No. 1: Try very hard not to be a woman,” their advisory began.This show was in the DCJCC’s larger space, the 240-seat Aaron & Cecile Goldman Theater. The room felt more than a little formal, in contrast to my memories of bawdy, beer-soaked Pinky Swear performances at the Gypsy Tent of old, but the DCJCC is a comfortable building, with space to sit and chat in between performances. Veteran Fringegoers know better than to take reliable air conditioning and clean, plentiful bathrooms for granted.I loved “Penis Envy,” a monologue (solo shows are a key part of the Fringe taxonomy) by Becky Bondurant. Obviously, an attention-grabbing title is not nothing: “Are you here for ‘Penis Envy?’” the staffer at the desk asked when I entered the DCJCC lobby, without any discernible inflection. I was more persuaded by the detail in Bondurant’s bio that she’d taken two years of classes from controversial monologuist Mike Daisey, whose work I’d followed after first encountering it in the festival many years prior.Speaking before a backdrop of presidential portraits she’d made with her two children, Bondurant told us she’d been nine months pregnant with the daughter she’d expected to be born into a country that had just chosen its first woman commander in chief when Donald Trump was elected instead, throwing her into a tailspin. The show segued into a journey back through her burgeoning social, political and sexual consciousness as adolescence gave way to young adulthood, and an account of how she struggled to reconcile her ambitions as a writer and professor with her other responsibilities. Nothing radical, but it was all vulnerable and truthful to her, and funny and inviting.That same afternoon I attended “Why Are You Brown?”, a showcase of comedians of color (plus one White guy) organized by civil rights attorney, filmmaker and comic Badar Tareen. “How’s everyone doing tonight?” Tareen asked us at 3:35 p.m. on a scorching Saturday. The five comics were varied in their material, though all addressed the theme of racial stereotypes and prejudice. “I was inspired by a lot of American movies,” Indian-born comic Prince Arora began. “Like ‘American Pie.’” Later, Dee Ahmed referred to the inner suburb of Arlington, Va., as “White Wakanda.”These comics perform regularly outside of the festival, and every one of them made me laugh. But stand-up isn’t an oddity; it’s on TV every night of the week. It just doesn’t feel fringey to me in the way that a 75-minute solo adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft’s “The Call of Cthulhu” does, or a romantic dramedy “Love West of Dupont Circle.”I sought out the latter, a two-hander by John Harney, which was performed at a venue the festival dubbed Delirium, a former Gap. (The other Connecticut Avenue venues are Laughter, formerly a T-Mobile, and Bliss, formerly a Talbots.) It turned out to be an hour-long meet-cute between two youngish Catholic writers who disagree politically but are drawn to one another nevertheless. It was earnest and heartfelt and charmingly clunky, as many fringe shows are. The festival is most enjoyable if one is willing to meet the artists halfway or even a little more than that, whether because they’re your friends or family or simply because you respect the fact of a nonprofessional artist (though pros take part, too) screwing up the courage to put their imaginative work into the world.The Sunday matinee I attended was the only one of the show’s four performances, as the playwright told us, to feature understudy Jocelyn Honoré as the conservative columnist. Gil Mitchell plays the more liberal churchgoer who falls under her spell. Both were solid, but I was impressed that Honoré had learned such a large part to perform it just the once. Fringe!On the sidewalk after the show, Harney told me this was the second Capital Fringe in which he’d taken part. Despite having dotted his play with references to specific D.C. churches, neighborhoods, publications, restaurants and watering holes — one of his characters calls Georgetown’s Cafe Milano “a hangout for adulterers from both parties” — he was not a native; he’d moved from New York a few years prior. He confirmed he’d set out to write something that reflected his adopted city.I loved that. I loved that the city I’ve chosen to live in provided a place for him to do that. Even if it happened to be a place where I’d once returned a pair of pants."
WaPo_4,"At WNBA All-Star Game, Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese go from rivals to teammates",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/19/wnba-all-star-game-angel-reese-caitlin-clark/,2024-07-20 08:18:02.865520,,"PHOENIX — Caitlin Clark launched her shot at Footprint Center as the WNBA all-star team wrapped up practice with a half-court contest. The ball careened off the backboard just to the left of the square. Before Clark walked away, Angel Reese stormed toward the all-star logo and fired. The orange and white ball bounced off the middle of the square and right through the twine, and Reese turned and lifted her right arm in victory, giving high-fives to a couple of teammates before doing a little dance.Hall of Famer and all-star coach Cheryl Miller soon stood in the middle of the floor doling out cash to Reese and Arike Ogunbowale, who also made her half-court heave.“I’m about my money,” Reese said with a laugh. “I’m going to shop when I get to Paris, so I need Paris money.”Reese is going to the Olympics but only to watch, so she and Clark will be teammates for the first time in Saturday’s All-Star Game, which pits the WNBA team against the U.S. Olympic squad. The much-discussed rivalry between the two goes back to the 2023 NCAA championship game, in which Reese and LSU were crowned champs and she made the you-can’t-see-me hand gesture that Clark has used herself.The two will be forever connected. Clark was the No. 1 overall pick after becoming the NCAA’s all-time leading scorer, and Reese was selected seventh. The two are the front-runners for WNBA rookie of the year, and fans have sold out arenas around the league to see them. Reese set the WNBA record with 15 consecutive double-doubles, and Clark broke the WNBA record with 19 assists in the final game before the all-star break.“That’s what everybody wants to see,” Reese said of the two playing together. “We got a little pick and roll, obviously, in practice today. It’s going to be really cool playing with each other.“I know y’all have been seeing the get-along shirts. … Everybody can really wear their get-along shirts together, for one day at least.”Clark added: “Obviously as two rookies, getting to share this experience for the first time, it’s super rare to be here as a rookie. And to have two of us here, it’s just really great overall.”The duo have drawn so much attention that the league adjusted its media rules. On the day of games, players were required to be available to the media after shoot-around, before the game and after it. The new rules allow teams to designate two players not to be required to speak after shoot-around.Even at Friday’s post-practice media sessions, Clark and Reese began later than the rest of the team to accommodate the throng of people — at least four deep — that surrounded them.“I can only assume what it’s like to be that young and have that much attention and that much criticism,” Nneka Ogwumike said. “To be honest, I don’t think I’d be able to handle it. Those are two very different people, and they’re handling it in the best way that they know how but still representing the league and also themselves in ways that continue to help grow the game.”Said ESPN analyst LaChina Robinson: “They have really entered into new territory where not just sports fans are interested in Angel and Caitlin but they’re household names. So I’ve enjoyed watching them really take the league to new heights, both with their play on the court and who they are as people.”Clark is averaging 17.1 points (13th in the WNBA), a league-best 8.2 assists and 5.8 rebounds (19th). She also posted the first triple-double by a rookie in league history. Reese has averaged a double-double with 13.5 points (24th) and 11.9 rebounds (second). Both the Indiana Fever and Chicago Sky are in playoff position despite low expectations for the season.“I love and appreciate the rivalry,” Miller said. “I love what they’ve done for the women’s game from the collegiate level to now. And it’s working. And it was only a matter of time. Great narratives, great storylines.“But now the bottom line comes down to one thing: It’s about basketball, and it’s about wins. And both these young ladies and their teams, people don’t want to face them down the stretch because now it’s starting to click.”Reese added: “It’s a blessing. I never thought I would be a rookie all-star. I never thought I would be in this moment.”Both will get a well-deserved break after the All-Star Game following a busy two years. They both played in the final college game of the year in 2023 and met again in the Elite Eight this past season, with Clark and Iowa going all the way to the championship game. A week later, they were drafted, and training camps began 13 days after that.Not making the Olympic team was a disappointment for Clark, but there’s a silver lining.“Getting this break is going to be very beneficial for myself and something that I deserve,” Clark said. “There has to be a point where that has to stop and you have to take care of yourself and do things for yourself, and maybe some of those decisions at times can be hard. And you want to give the world and everybody watching what they want, too, and help this game get better and better. But relaxing and reflecting on everything that’s happened to me over the course of the last year will be super important because my life has moved so fast.“Sure, I’m tired, but at the same time there’s so many people that would kill to be in my shoes and so many people that are going through so much worse in their lives.”"
WaPo_5,"Friday heat was near July’s average, and cool by comparison",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/19/weather-summer-heat-dc-average/,2024-07-20 08:00:02.865520,,"Often extremes get all the attention, and the average is ignored. But Friday’s heat in the D.C. came close to average, and in such a month as this one, that seemed alluring.After four consecutive days of temperatures above 100 degrees, neither Thursday nor Friday even touched 90 in the District.That made them welcome, even if it did not make them uncommonly cool. Both days had highs of 89 degrees, which is obviously as close to 90 as can be without actually touching it.But even to seem to scorn a day in the 80s in July in the nation’s would appear to show meteorological ingratitude. July’s claims to thermal infamy do not rest solely with the four days of 101 degrees and higher.As a prelude to those notorious times, July can lay claim to nine other days with temperatures of 94 or greater.All this is to say that any excesses of enthusiasm for Friday (and Thursday) might seem pardonable, although each day reached the thermal pinnacle of the 80s.Friday’s 89, as was Thursday’s, was a single degree below the average daily high for the District at this time of year. So both of those days could be regarded as generic sorts of summer days, and they also seemed welcome for that.In addition, Friday was not without humidity, but it did not seem to be present in insufferable excess. The heat index, the feels-like temperature did not exceed the actual temperature.Just as the actual temperature never touched 90, the hourly heat index also remained below 90.It is not quite 30 days since the summer solstice, and the sun of Friday, July 19 was strong. Sometimes clouds, thick or thin, and often gray, shielded the city’s streets from the direct heat of the sun.But sometimes the unmitigated infrared energies of July sunshine beamed with full force on the District.It is a fact of summer life, that at such times, in the sunshine, it can feel far hotter than the 89-degree thermometer reading.As a result, seeking shade might seem an act of summer survival that is performed almost without thinking, in deference to innate instinct.But many streets for much of the day did have a shady side, which helped enhance the almost exhilarating sensation of comparative comfort provided by high temperatures only in the 80s.With their 89 degree highs, Friday and Thursday proved to be this month’s first two back-to-back days below 90 since July 2 and 3, when each day was 88.Those two early July days may be only dimly recalled across the searing stretch of time since then.That has made a day like Friday, though its maximum heat registered merely one degree below average, worthy of enshrinement as part of the still-being-created legend of this month."
WaPo_6,Afghanistan War Commission opens inquiry of America’s longest conflict,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/07/19/afghanistan-war-commission/,2024-07-20 08:00:02.865520,,"Against the backdrop of America’s roiling political landscape and two raging foreign wars, a coterie of former U.S. government officials and academics on Friday opened what will be an extensive examination of the United States’ 20-year foray in Afghanistan — the nation’s longest conflict.“Today we make history,” said Shamila N. Chaudhary, co-chair of the Afghanistan War Commission. “Never before has the United States commissioned such a wide-ranging independent legislative assessment of its own decision-making in the aftermath of a conflict.”The mission is daunting. The 16-member bipartisan panel has been tasked by Congress with determining what went wrong and what U.S. leaders could do differently the next time the United States goes to war. Their mandate encompasses policies and actions taken by four presidential administrations, the U.S. military, the State Department, U.S. allies, and many other agencies, organizations and people.The commission has 18 months to carry out its research and until August 2026 to deliver a final public report.The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021 ended the war, but delivered the country back into the hands of the Taliban, an enemy Washington spent trillions of dollars trying to vanquish beginning in the aftermath of 9/11. The bloody and chaotic exit resulted in the deaths of 13 U.S. service members and scores of Afghans; left thousands of American allies behind to an uncertain fate; triggered broad, bipartisan outrage; and gave rise to bitterly politicized congressional inquiries and hearings.The Republican-led House Foreign Affairs Committee is expected next month to deliver a final report detailing the findings of its investigation of the withdrawal. That inquiry has featured hours of heated and sometimes emotional testimony from Biden administration officials, military commanders, veterans and their families. The committee next week intends to interview Jen Psaki, President Biden’s White House press secretary at the time of the withdrawal.The war commission’s 4½-hour discussion Friday, held in the Washington headquarters of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, featured former ambassadors, military officers and CIA personnel as witnesses. It drew a small crowd of observers, many of whom were also connected to the war.Chaudhary and her co-chair, Colin F. Jackson, a former Defense Department official, are cognizant of the charged atmosphere that surrounds their undertaking. The commission itself was born of the collective outrage that followed the withdrawal three years ago.But they stressed that they seek a dialogue that is thoughtful and apolitical, even if commission members were handpicked by Republican and Democratic lawmakers in the heat of national anguish. “We are bipartisan in our composition, but our work is nonpartisan,” Chaudhary said.It’s hard to ignore the issue of blame, they concede. It “keeps coming up in our conversations,” Chaudhary told the panelists. People want to know if the commission will name and shame; if it will deliver some measure of justice by calling out the leaders who made the worst critical decisions in the war.The commission will try not to do that, while at the same time endeavoring to produce “a full, objective, rigorous, unvarnished and unflinching account of our performance as a government and a military,” Jackson said. “We owe it to the generation that served in Afghanistan, and the generation that will serve somewhere else.”It isn’t just an assessment of the war’s failures. The commissioners’ report will include guidance, they said: practical advice that could be applied to other wars the United States is involved in, such as those ongoing in the Middle East and Ukraine, or to wars that have yet to happen, but someday will.If the first hearing can serve as a guide for what commissioners are likely to conclude, it’s that so many different things went wrong.Consecutive administrations failed to address the critical role that Pakistan — an ostensible U.S. ally — played in sustaining and shielding the Taliban, said Nader Nadery, a witness who served as a senior Afghan government official. U.S. leaders also often prioritized short-term military goals over longer-term values, and sometimes employed rhetoric that undermined the Afghan government’s credibility, he said.There were convoluted chains of command throughout the war; disruptive personality clashes between American decision-makers and agencies; and commanding officers served tours of duty that were so short as to represent “the institutional equivalent of a frontal lobotomy,” said another witness, Ronald Neumann, a former ambassador to Afghanistan and the author of “The Other War: Winning and Losing in Afghanistan” — published 11 years before the U.S. withdrawal.There was a terribly devised system for parliamentary elections that invited fraud, said Noah Coburn, a political anthropologist who provided testimony Friday. There was too much public meddling in Afghan politics by U.S. leaders, and too little policy input solicited from the Afghans. Poor U.S. decisions when it came to security partners, development and investments fueled corruption, which spread mistrust of the government and support for the anti-government Taliban, said Coburn. Civilian casualties, abusive warlords and poor security did that too.It’s not that no one was saying this during the war. Much has been written. Experts and documentation of on-the-ground events were ample as they were happening, commissioners and panelists acknowledged. But often, U.S. officials failed to absorb the information, and consecutive administrations failed to use that knowledge to change course.Jackson, the co-chair, said, “A fair question is, but what decisions are you going to look at?”“The easy answer is we’re going to consider a much larger set of decisions than we can possibly cover in detail, and there will be a very difficult winnowing process,” he said.Among the obvious points of interest, Jackson said, will be the decision to invade Afghanistan in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The commissioners will examine the decision to surge U.S. forces in Afghanistan in 2009. They will look at the decision-making that went into negotiations with the Taliban. And of course, they will look at decisions related to the withdrawal.The commissioners acknowledged that their mandate has become vast — to cynics, perhaps, so ambitious as to be almost impossible. What started as a mission to understand and to educate is also partly an exercise in collective therapy, the commissioners said, an opportunity not just for government officials, but for the larger population, and particularly veterans, to come to terms with what happened.“For so many of us, the war still lingers in our minds. We carry the moral, physical and emotional injuries in our daily lives,” Chaudhary said. “Closure may not be possible for everyone.” But a space is needed for “civic discourse,” she added."
WaPo_7,These Maryland siblings were skeptical about summer camp. It won them over.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/20/summer-ymca-camp-letts/,2024-07-20 08:00:02.865520,,"Katie Garcia couldn’t believe it. Five nights in the woods, and no cellphone? How would she stay in touch with her boyfriend? What about her TikTok streak? Plus, it was going to be hot and there would be bugs.Her mom, Jessica, had just dropped off Katie, 13, and her brother Johann, 12, at Camp Letts in Edgewater, Md. It was an hour’s drive from their home in Silver Spring, but it may as well have been five hours. The kids had never been to sleepaway camp before, and they weren’t particularly excited to be there — especially after they learned of the camp’s no-phone policy.Jessica pulled her two kids into her arms.“This is going to be super fun,” she assured them.As they said goodbye, Katie looked at her mom with doe eyes. Please, Mom? she seemed to say.Johann grabbed her arm.“Let’s go Katie,” he said. “It’s a week.”Katie and Johann weren’t convinced they’d have any fun. Sitting together at check-in on the first day, they agreed that neither of them were particularly interested in trying to make friends.They already knew how hard it was to say goodbye. The kids had switched schools so many times that they had to count on their fingers keep track of how many they had attended.“I’m not going to cry, like I did this school year, ” Johann said.Katie lugged her suitcase up the stairs to a cabin tucked into the woods. She stretched a navy blue sheet over the thin mattress on the last available bottom bunk. Then she realized that she hadn’t packed a pillow.She didn’t know she’d need one.A counselor assured her they’d find one.Sticky summer air and an awkward silence filled the cabin as five 13-year-old girls sat in a circle making name cards for their bunks. Aside from the best friend duo who came to camp together, they were all strangers.There were first-time campers like Katie, and others who had been coming there for years.
“Wear lots of sunscreen,” a camp veteran advised. “And do all the waterfront activities.”
Katie listened as a counselor listed the activities: kayaking, archery, ziplining, paddleboarding, paintball, high ropes.
“High ropes?!” Katie’s face lit up. “Oh, that’s cool.”
Maybe, just maybe, that one part of camp could be fun.
That night, Katie and her cabin mates sat around an unlit firepit as counselors taught them team chants that they would use the rest of the week. The girls joined in hesitantly.Katie and Johann had never been away from home for longer than a few days. Camp Letts is run by the YMCA of Metropolitan Washington and offers scholarships through its “Send a Kid to Camp” program, which funded their trip.Despite their hesitation, Garcia thought it would be good for the kids to connect with nature and get out of the house for a bit. She wanted her kids to experience a cornerstone of American childhood: canoeing on the lake, singing around the campfire, making fast friends, crafting bracelets.Katie and Johann started every morning with paddleboarding, then swam in the pool, then headed back to the waterfront to kayak. They ate lunch, then played tennis and volleyball and other activities in the afternoon. At each meal, the cabin groups burst out into loud songs about being the best crew at camp, banging tables and stomping so hard the whole floor would shake.By the middle of the week, Katie was fitting in. She bragged about being the only girl in her cabin who didn’t fall off the Banana Boat, a rubber raft pulled by a motorboat. Her nails were stained purple from tie-dyeing T-shirts. As she walked to the pool, she rehearsed the camp songs she’d learned.She had even made friends, a lot of them. They bought matching bandannas at the camp store and planned to exchange phone numbers.On the last day, tears streamed down Johann’s cheeks as he said goodbye to his counselors and new friends. He and Katie wore matching Camp Letts T-shirts printed with the word “campsick” — a play on “homesick” — as they boarded the bus back to Silver Spring where their mom awaited them.Katie didn’t cry. But she said the week had surprised her.She may even go back next year for another five nights in the woods.Without a cellphone."
WaPo_8,"At British Open, a mighty wind shoos Rory McIlroy and kisses Shane Lowry",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/19/british-open-shane-lowry-rory-mcilroy-troon/,2024-07-20 08:00:02.865520,,"TROON, Scotland — The way this British Open said cheerio to Rory McIlroy on Friday night felt either barbaric or puckish. It ushered him off with a dozen closing holes that verged on pristine, as if he should have brought along a dog and a leash and a small plastic bag of treats. It even found a place for his work of art from the bunker beside the No. 14 green, which plopped down and rolled in with a near-cruel obedience. By then and toward 8:25 p.m. when he finished, both the crowds and the wind had thinned. How absurd.Otherwise, this 152nd British Open kept acting like a classic British Open wind-wise, savaging many with scores that looked like many, and it nodded toward some wind veterans heading into the weekend: Irishman Shane Lowry leads at 7 under par, and Englishmen Justin Rose and major debutant Dan Brown are at 5 under after both came through the wilds of qualifying. Lowry, for one, won the 2019 British Open at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland as the wind sang, the skies brooded, the galleries boomed and the clouds wept heavily for joy. Scottie Scheffler, for another, lurks at 2 under with his six wins this year and his No. 1 ranking while hailing from a place prone to wind (Texas) and fielding a question about whether he thinks his name causes stress to other players by using his trademark level of bombast.“Not really,” he said.“I can’t wait to watch this weekend,” said McIlroy, whose triple-bogey 8 on No. 4 finished him off early, assured his major drought would reach 38 and made it the eighth time in that ludicrous span he has missed a major cut. Referring then to Lowry, he said: “He’s so creative. I think even just watching the coverage the last couple of days, that little sort of squeezy cut that he can hit, especially going out on that front nine, is going to be really helpful to him. Yeah, look, he relishes these conditions. The Open Championship is his favorite tournament in the world. He gets more up for this than anything else. I’m looking forward to cheering him on and hopefully him getting his second [claret] jug.”He won’t have to contend with any of the people who couldn’t contend with Troon’s earnest wind off the Firth of Clyde, which reached midafternoon levels ideal — for sailing. It kept pummeling people right off the bat or at least before the turn, sending them into vegetation and agitation. It often sent people looking through wilderness for golf balls as if on treasure hunts. It dispatched Tiger Woods pretty much by No. 2, when his tee shot veered through the gray sky way left to a botanical bonanza and the 77 he piled atop his 79 seemed booked. He double bogeyed there, missed his third straight major cut and made off for five months of looking forward to that father-son event in December he dubbed “our fifth major.”Justin Thomas, whose 68 on Thursday looked swell and contentious, slipped from third to 38th when his 78 featured this off-key chorus: bogeys on Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 6; double bogey on No. 5; triple bogey on No. 9. His cobbling of a back-nine 33 after his front-nine 45 qualified as herculean. Robert MacIntyre, the 27-year-old Scot who just won the Scottish Open with ample exhilaration and told of ample beverages thereafter, went through the first four holes at 7-5-5-8, meaning two triple bogeys and 8 over. “That was carnage,” he said. He, too, did well to hold together a 75 to make the carnage cut of 6 over by a stroke. Sahith Theegala made a triple-bogey 8 on No. 6, Elvis Smylie made a triple-bogey 8 on No. 4, David Puig made a triple-bogey 8 on No. 4, and Angel Hidalgo made a quadruple-bogey 9 on No. 4.The front and the middle parts kicked the rear parts of a player the caliber of Wyndham Clark, 2023 U.S. Open champion and 2024 Olympian. He shot an 80, free-fell to 16 over and left. Japanese hopeful Aguri Iwasaki, 26, peppered his 91 with some numerals seldom seen in such highbrow events: consecutive 9s, a quintuple bogey on No. 13 and that rarely witnessed sextuple bogey on the par-3 No. 14, during which he had three bunker shots of four yards or shorter.“I suppose the thing you’ve got here, you’ve got three different sixes,” the great Padraig Harrington said of the course sequences. “You’ve got six downward going out or, as we played them, into the wind. Then you have six in the middle that are really awkward. They’re really tricky. There’s blind shots. There’s gorse.”At the famed Railway hole, No. 11, Lowry wound up making a double bogey but saying, “To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a 6.”Also within that stage of the course, Joaquin Niemann’s quintuple-bogey 8 at the wee par-3 Postage Stamp, No. 8, deserves a review. He went into a green-side bunker. He went across to another green-side bunker. He went zero yards and stayed in that green-side bunker. Then he went 27 yards to another green-side bunker.Question: “Then what was kind of going through your mind as you were going from …”Niemann: “Bunker to bunker?”Reporter: “Bunker to bunker.”Niemann: “Just get it out of there.”(Laughter.)In a similar fate in a different place, McIlroy’s second shot from the native area somewhere near No. 4 moved two yards to portend that big-old 8 there. It left him finished in his own realistic mind, marking the second major occasion of the year when “the wind got the better of me,” as he put it of the Friday at the Masters and the Thursday and Friday here. “Yeah, I think once I made the 8 on the fourth hole, that was it,” he said. “Twenty-two holes into the event” — an event in which he figured to contend — “and I’m thinking about where I’m going to go on vacation next week.” He called it “a pretty meaningless 14 holes after that.”The meaningful holes are left to Rose, the 2013 U.S. Open champion hoping for a big career autumn at 43, and to Brown, who said that after his opening-round lead, “I was knackered,” yet still shot a non-collapse 72. And they’re left to Lowry, who proved a grand front-runner at Portrush such that one observer asked whether the chasers should fret. “I don’t know,” the good-natured Lowry said, soon adding, “Honestly, I’m not sure Scottie Scheffler is too worried about anyone with the form he’s in.”And the meaningful holes in a different way are left to Max Homa. His 28-foot attempt to make the cut rolled past McIlroy as it traveled, and when it plunked in, Homa, who called it “an out-of-body experience,” hollered. “I didn’t really expect to yell like I won a golf tournament,” he said. It led to a typically gracious hug thereafter from McIlroy, who walked off with that slight frown so familiar on an evening nicer than it had a right to be."

Sherrod Brown (Ohio) and Martin Heinrich (N.M.) and 10 House members on Friday added their names to the rapidly growing list of Democrats worried that Biden was on track to lose the election to Republican nominee Donald Trump. But the president’s campaign reiterated in no uncertain terms that he would be staying put.The tense standoff between the president and his party set up a pivotal clash that is expected to intensify this weekend and could reach its culmination next week. The increasingly intense impasse between supporters and skeptics of the president suggests there is no end in sight to the Democratic infighting that has surrounded Biden’s candidacy as both sides have grown more dug-in and willing to allow the standoff to play out in public.“I think the President should end his campaign,” Brown said in a statement Friday. Heinrich, hailing from a traditionally Democratic state aides fear has suddenly become competitive, called on Biden to “step aside” for the good of the country.The president’s aides remained defiant in the face of the biggest threat to his candidacy so far.“He’s not going anywhere,” Biden campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” saying the president was “absolutely’ committed to continuing his campaign. She called him the “best person to take on Donald Trump” and suggested that the growing angst among top Democrats about Biden’s candidacy does not reflect the broader sentiment across the party.Less than two hours after O’Malley Dillon’s appearance, four House Democrats released a joint statement calling on Biden to “pass the torch,” the broadest collective effort from Congress thus far — and a move some officials said was representative of a larger, growing groundswell against Biden among lawmakers that could erupt into view if Biden does not step aside over the weekend. By the end of the day, the 12 additional Democratic lawmakers who called on Biden to step aside Friday marked the highest total of any day since such calls began July 2.“We must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign,” Reps. Jared Huffman (Calif.), Marc Veasey (Tex.), Jesús “Chuy” García (Ill.) and Mark Pocan (Wis.) told Biden in the joint statement.The push highlighted an unmistakably ramped-up push in Congress to oust the president from the ticket. Lawmakers including Reps. Gabe Vasquez (N.M.), Betty McCollum (Minn.), Zoe Lofgren (Calif.) and Morgan McGarvey (Ky.) added their names to a fast-growing list. The total number of congressional Democrats urging the president to bow out has now risen past 35, more than 12 percent of all Democrats in Congress.It is clear the diverse group of Democratic stakeholders are seeing this moment very differently. Some people close to Biden are urging Democrats to give him the time and space to end his candidacy on his own, to end his half-century of political life with grace. Other Democrats say they have spent weeks giving the president every opportunity to leave with dignity on his own terms, only to see them all rebuffed.Yet others are fully backing the president’s continued candidacy. O’Malley Dillon has told campaign aides privately that recent reports that Biden is considering imminently dropping out of the race are far removed from reality, according to a person familiar with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Top White House adviser Anita Dunn has echoed that sentiment, giving some campaign aides confidence that Biden remains committed to being the Democratic nominee even as he appears to be losing the confidence of significant portions of his party.Yet the pressure to push Biden aside was only intensifying Friday ahead of what some officials described as a crucial weekend, given that the Democratic National Convention is a month away — and the party is planning a virtual nominating process sooner to lock in the nominee.That has fostered a “now or never” mood on Capitol Hill, with multiple lawmakers discussing a public effort to oust Biden from the race. A new Political Action Committee called Pass the Torch announced Friday that it was launching ads in Washington and Rehoboth Beach, Del., urging Biden to end his reelection bid. A group of Democratic delegates gathered via Zoom on Friday to discuss how an open convention would work.All the while, Biden remained behind closed doors at his home in Rehoboth Beach, where he is self-isolating after testing positive earlier this week for the coronavirus and experiencing mild symptoms. In a statement Friday, Biden said he planned to return to the campaign trail next week.“The stakes are high, and the choice is clear,” Biden said in the statement, a response to Trump’s speech at the Republican National Convention on Thursday. “Together, we will win.”Biden’s doctor said Friday that the president continues to experience a loose cough and hoarseness, though his vital signs are normal and his symptoms have improved. Meanwhile, his political standing appears to be worsening. In a sign that Biden is planning to move forward with his bid for a second term, he plans to join comedian David Letterman for a July 29 fundraiser at the home of Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, a according to a person familiar with the planning. Yahoo News reported the planned fundraiser earlier.The makeup of the four lawmakers behind Friday’s joint statement is significant, since they are all members of larger groups that have expressed support for Biden. Pocan is the former chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which has largely stuck with Biden. Garcia is a member of the Hispanic Caucus, whose fundraising arm endorsed Biden on Friday. Veasey is a member of the Black Caucus, whose leadership has also stood with the president.“Passing the torch would fundamentally change the trajectory of the campaign,” they wrote.Both Huffman and Veasey directly raised concerns to the president about his ability to win during separate calls that lawmakers held with Biden last weekend.Heinrich suggested Biden could not win against Trump. “The return of Donald Trump to the White House poses an existential danger to our democracy,” he said. “We must defeat him in November, and we need a candidate who can do that.”Heinrich is running for reelection in New Mexico, a state that Biden won by 11 points in 2020, but aides say the presidential race is tied in the state.More lawmakers are expected to follow suit in coming days, as polls appear to be solidifying with Biden trailing Trump in important battleground states. That would create the spectacle of a party torn apart and publicly at war with its leader, but a growing number of Democrats are concluding there could be little alternative.“There’s been a gradual shift — it may be accelerating somewhat — with a few more obviously, speaking publicly, and a good number privately,” said one senator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations with colleagues and the White House. “I think also the mood in the White House or the campaign also seems to be shifting somewhat, so I think the two trends are complementary.”But, publicly, Biden’s team is showing no sign of shifting.On Friday, Biden campaign aides pointed to support the president had received from key figures including liberal lawmakers such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). During a lengthy Instagram Live session Thursday night, Ocasio-Cortez told supporters that ousting Biden would lead to chaos and harm the party’s chances of defeating Trump. Sanders, speaking on “Morning Joe” offered a full-throated endorsement of Biden, saying the president could help Democrats win “in a big way.”Campaign officials said they were planning multiple press events and volunteer events in the coming days, aiming to showcase that Biden’s candidacy was forging ahead.The campaign also touted Friday’s endorsement of Biden by BOLD PAC, the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. The group said in a statement that Biden and Vice President Harris “have delivered for the Latino community.”But not all members of the PAC or the Hispanic Caucus are supportive of Biden remaining at the top of the Democratic ticket. Reps. Raúl Grijalva (Ariz.), Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (Wash.), Garcia (Ill.) and Mike Levin (Calif.) are among House Democrats who have called for the president to leave the race. The group had agreed to endorse Biden before Biden’s debate performance on June 27, which rocked the president’s candidacy after he struggled to complete his sentences, according to multiple people familiar with the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.Members of BOLD PAC, which includes a majority of Hispanic Democrats in Congress, were only alerted shortly before the release went out.More House Democrats are in discussions about how and when to publicly call on Biden to step down. Some believe there is no need to participate in sinking an already waterlogged ship, others want to give Biden the weekend and still more, like the four who jointly spoke out Friday, believe it is important to keep up the pressure.In the Senate, a group of Democrats is also discussing whether to come forward as a group to call on Biden to step aside. They are also discussing the timing — whether to do it after the weekend or sooner, according to three people familiar with the discussions.The mood among Democratic senators has shifted against Biden’s candidacy just in the last few days, according to multiple senior aides. Last week, Democratic senators were divided. But as new polling has shown that states he easily won in 2020, including New Mexico and Virginia, are now essentially tied, Democrats are increasingly fearing they could lose if Biden heads the ticket.Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), who is in a tough reelection in a conservative state, added his name to the calls to withdraw on Thursday.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and his lieutenants spent the week continuing to hear from concerned members. They have not warned members against coming out against Biden, as they did in the days immediately after the debate. Instead, they are telling their colleagues to do what is best for their campaigns.Jeffries told reporters Friday he was continuing to support Biden as “our nominee,” though his remarks were little changed from previous public comments, in which he has suggested the president needs to make a decision about his candidacy.Some in the president’s orbit suggest the mounting pressure campaign is counterproductive.“Message to everyone trying to affect the president’s decision about whether to pass the torch: GIVE JOE BIDEN THE SPACE & TIME TO PROCEED AT HIS OWN PACE.” Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard Law School who has spoken to Biden since the debate, wrote on X on Friday. “Stop pressuring the man. He has earned the right to your respect.”The debate over Biden’s candidacy became even more tense in the aftermath of the Republican National Convention, which ended with a lengthy, meandering and at times dark speech by Trump. The display convinced several Democratic officials that Trump could be beaten if the party has the right candidate.“Donald Trump’s dark vision for the future is not who we are as Americans,” Biden said in a statement after the speech. “Together, as a party and as a country, we can and will defeat him at the ballot box.”Many in the party remain unconvinced. The 30-second ads by Pass the Torch feature Democratic voters in Pennsylvania urging Biden to step aside. Delegates Are Democracy, another newly formed group, held a Zoom for delegates to the Democratic National Convention to inform them how an open primary would work if Biden were to step aside.Elaine Kamarck, an expert on presidential nominations and a member of the Democratic National Committee, told the gathered delegates that if Biden were to bow out of the race, the road to an open convention could be fast-moving and “fascinating.”“Basically, think of it as a redo of the primary system in a very, very, very compressed period of time,” she said.Caldwell reported from Washington and Sotomayor from Milwaukee.

WaPo_11,Behind the scenes as Joe Biden lost control of the Democratic Party,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/19/biden-democrats-drop-out/,2024-07-20 08:00:02.865520,,"The president of the United States had spoken — with 24 million Americans watching on TV. Every Democratic leader knew Joe Biden would continue his campaign. Statements like that used to mean something.But two days after that July 11 NATO news conference, the president found himself hunched in front of a stone fireplace in his Rehoboth Beach, Del., home, losing his temper. A war hero had just questioned the toll that age took on his ability to lead.“Tell me who enlarged NATO. Tell me who did the Pacific basin,” Biden snapped over Zoom at Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), a decorated, retired Army Ranger, according to a recording of the virtual meeting with House Democrats. “Tell me who did something that you never done with your Bronze Star — and your — like my son — and, you know — proud of your leadership. But guess what? Well, what’s happening? We got Korea and Japan working together.”Crow was not the problem, however. He was the tip of the spear.Significant parts of the president’s campaign and White House team were saying privately that, after a disastrous debate performance on June 27, they no longer believed. Big donors were withholding money, demanding change. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) sat down with Biden after the news conference to warn the president that his candidacy imperiled Democratic hopes of taking back the House. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) shared the same warning days later. Delegates and party members sketched out a Plan B.Just a month earlier, all of those people had been united behind Biden, focused on the threat they saw in former president Donald Trump — the felon, Capitol riot agitator, election denier, self-proclaimed “day one” dictator and provocateur. The mantra of former House speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) — “Diversity is our strength. Unity is our power” — still governed Democrats in June.But now even Pelosi was saying Biden needed more time to decide what he said he had already decided. Former president Barack Obama, Biden’s old running mate and governing partner, told allies that the path to victory had diminished. House Democrats, who had planned to cast Republicans as “chaos agents” in the fall, edged toward revolution. Seven more called for Biden to step aside on the day of his NATO news conference.The sudden collapse of Biden’s control over the party he brought to power, just four months before a presidential election, is without obvious historical precedent. Behind the scenes, people working inside the bowels of Democratic politics and government described the first three weeks of July as a kind of nightmare — too extraordinary to be real, too unexpected to be believed.This story of Biden’s shrinking political power is based on interviews with more than three dozen people who played behind-the-scenes roles, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe painful private events and respond frankly to even more astounding public ones.The terrible Biden debate was followed by a far more terrible attempted assassination of Trump on live television July 13, from which the former president rose triumphant — fist in the air, blood streaked across his face. Biden’s polling, which held steady at first, began to erode.Then the 81-year-old president, traveling to campaign events to try to prove his vigor, contracted covid again. As Trump welcomed his new running mate this week in Milwaukee, video footage showed a delicate Biden struggling to get up the short stairs to Air Force One on his way to further isolation. Aides passed along the footage in dismay, a person familiar with the messages said. A dozen Democratic lawmakers — 10 House members and two senators — called on Biden to step aside after the conclusion of the Republican nominating convention, meaning that as of Friday evening 37 lawmakers had urged him to leave the race. Biden and his campaign team still maintain that nothing has changed. Even Jeffries continues to state publicly, as he did Friday, that Biden has “the ability, the capacity, and the track record to make a case to the American people that will result in us being successful in November.”“I don’t want to be rude, but I don’t know how many more times we can answer that,” principal deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said Thursday morning.But Fulks spoke those words on behalf of a president no longer backed by an entire party. Two-thirds of the country, including 56 percent of Democrats, said in a Washington Post-ABC-Ipsos poll in early July that Biden should drop out. Biden is testing how far a president can lead when his followers go astray.“This is a brand-new political problem,” said Matt Bennett, co-founder of the Democratic group Third Way. “It is the wickedest of political problems because one, no one knows if there is a solution. And two, there’s no one to coalesce around. And three, everyone has their own theory of the case, so it’s just incredibly, incredibly complicated.”The first week after the debate had not gone well. No one, not even Biden, contested that. He needed to get out more, to prove his mettle, to replace the images of the doddering debate night in everyone’s mind. History will record that as things got worse, Biden fought harder.A long interview with Complex magazine, another with BET, a third with Lester Holt of NBC News. Over a 48-hour period, he had calls with the Congressional Asian American Pacific Caucus, the New Democrat Coalition, the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, whose political arm endorsed Biden on Friday. Lawmakers confronted him repeatedly to ask him to reconsider.The White House circulated a list of about 20 other elected leaders or union officials the president had spoken with on the plane or while traveling. About 75 members of Congress have reiterated their support for him. He rallied another raucous crowd in Detroit. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) closed ranks.“Can you hear the helicopter in the background?” Biden shouted through the phone to the Rev. Al Sharpton as he boarded a plane for Nevada, according to Sharpton. “We’ve got to keep going, Al.”The president wanted Sharpton’s help to let his base know he would not give up. The debate over Biden’s future had become its own wound, Sharpton argued. “It undercuts potential enthusiasm. It confuses people who want him to fight,” he said. “If he steps down, then what? If you have an open convention, couldn’t that be a disaster?”One lawmaker who recently flew on Air Force One described only lately realizing the change in the president, after meeting with him several times over the last four years. Biden was speaking in hushed tones and could barely be heard across the table. Another lawmaker who spoke with Biden in the last few weeks described him as trailing off at times and calling the lawmaker by the wrong name, even as he seemed sharp at others.And a third lawmaker who recently interacted with Biden described him as mentally sharp, if frail, and serious about staying in.“He believes he can still win,” this person said. “I don’t think he is even spinning. He really thinks that everyone has always counted him out, and he has a chip on his shoulder, and he thinks he can win.”Trump advisers and operatives in key states began discussing how they could help keep Biden in the race, believing he is a weaker candidate than other options for Democrats. “If Democrats want to win Georgia, they’d be better off with a potted plant at the top of their ticket,” said Cody Hall, a top adviser to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R), describing the current environment there.At the White House, officials stoked the fires they could control. The policy shop began to fast-track plans that had long been in the works, including a blueprint to create term limits for the Supreme Court and impose new ethics rules on the justices — catnip for the liberal base. Propeller heads finalized a plan for legislation to take away tax rebates from corporate landlords who increased rent by more than 5 percent a year, a potentially massive new federal intervention to reverse a major driver of inflation.Advance teams set up the big moment Tuesday at the NAACP National Convention in Las Vegas, where Biden would show he could paint the contrast with Republicans and debut his 5 percent rent cap.But reading from a teleprompter, he lost his way.“What I am about to announce,” he told the crowd. “They can’t raise it more than —” he trailed off. A pause. “Fifty-five dollars,” he finally said, for reasons that are not clear. The crowd cheered anyway.Inside the West Wing, informal camps formed and pressure mounted. At times, it seemed the code of loyalty that had long followed Biden’s operations was coming undone. Some engaged in black humor. Some advisers shifted their focus from planning a second term to planning ways to lock in the policy wins they had achieved before Trump would take over, according to a Biden administration official briefed on the work. Other officials said more effort was still being put into planning a future agenda. The preparations for a Trump takeover, they added, had begun months earlier, as a normal course of business.Some sought to rally the troops. “Keep the faith,” senior deputy White House press secretary Andrew Bates posted on social media Thursday.Someone inside the White House anonymously texted Politico blaming “green badge staffers,” who do not have direct access to the West Wing like their “blue badge” peers, for the critical blind comments to the press. “This is out of line,” shot back Saloni Sharma, a top adviser to White House chief of staff Jeff Zients. “We are all a team and in this together.”Among those working on the Biden campaign effort, things were not much better: work hard, panic in private, take nothing personally.“The Republican Convention should light a fire under every American who wants to beat Trump and the Project 2025, and it certainly does for our campaign,” campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz said Friday. “It reaffirms just why President Biden is in this fight.”One campaign aide said that junior and even some senior staff were in the dark about how Biden wanted to forge ahead. Text messages flew between Capitol Hill, administration officials and others, trying to figure out what was going on. Hungry journalists began reporting the impressions of their sources, who offered guesses about what might happen on the assumption that something different had to happen.“It has been intriguing to learn how many ‘Biden insiders’ seem to exist all of a sudden, who just happen to sound identical to the people who’ve been giving blind quotes doubting us for five straight years, during win after win after win,” Bates responded.Access to Biden, in calmer times, had been a stove-piped affair. Now people worried to each other that the future of the world order could be at stake. White House senior staff let it be known that their doors were open to underlings if anyone needed to talk through the difficulties.White House staffers did not contest that Biden was spending more time with two of his longest-serving, most loyal advisers: Mike Donilon, senior campaign adviser, and Steve Ricchetti, counselor to the president. They argued that their expertise was more in demand. Both had argued that polling had become less meaningful.Some advisers traded accusations, without evidence, that top aides had misplaced loyalties, selfish interests, personal ambitions. Those aspersions even made it onto MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” the president’s favorite cable talkfest, days later.“The anger I hear are at the people that are keeping  him in a bubble or who may have their own interests, some financial, in keeping him in the race,” co-host Joe Scarborough said, laying out for the world the ugliness growing in Biden’s world. “That is anger from inside his own political camp, and it is widespread. It is widespread. Joe Biden deserves better.”It was a remarkable breakdown.As his NATO news conference concluded, Biden laid down a gauntlet. He would get out, he said, only if his advisers came to him and said, “There’s no way you can win.”“I thought he bought us some time with the NATO news conference,” one campaign adviser said. “There was a sigh of relief that night. If that had gone poorly, I think we all thought it was over within 24 hours.”Like others, this person said there had been lots of mistakes: Jill Biden’s Vogue photo shoot, a family meeting at Camp David, defensive Zoom calls, a sometimes polarizing communications strategy. There were increasingly dismal polls — and a sense the campaign might not last.“The polling isn’t good, and it feels like things are just getting worse every day,” the campaign adviser said.Political polling and analytics deal in probabilities, not absolutes like “No way.” They create snapshots in time, out of focus. Biden won in 2020 by 4.5 percentage points nationally, but he now trailed Trump by about 2 points, according to a Washington Post average of polls. Public surveys since the debate showed him down slightly in the must-win Northern swing states and by larger margins in Western and Southern states he hoped to win.Democratic House polls showed him significantly behind his 2020 margins in key districts. Senate polls showed him trailing statewide Democrats by double digits in battleground states.The campaign has been comforted by internal data showing that most of the people Biden has lost since the debate are unlikely to vote for Trump, suggesting they may come back. Most of them had not even watched the debate. But polling matters little when your party infrastructure is not behind you.Democratic strategists outside the campaign argued that if Biden were an incumbent senator or congressman running at around 40 percent in a five-way ballot test, as Biden has been doing in some surveys, he would get only symbolic financial support from the Democratic Senate or House campaign committees and their affiliated super PACs.Even before the debate, approval of Trump’s remembered presidency was running well ahead of Biden’s current one. Democrats assumed that Trump would get a bump out of his convention and probably a further boost in favorability once the trauma of the failed assassination was digested by voters.The fate of the Democratic Party now hinged on the gut sense of a man who has spent the last 52 years working in national politics. “This is just purely emotion. It is not a vigorous data-driven exercise,” said one Democratic strategist, describing the decision Biden had already made and would have to make again.“The truth of the matter is the decision is all in the hands of President Biden; there is not a practical way to prevent him from being the nominee if he wants to be the nominee,” said Jeff Weaver, the former political strategist for Sen. Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaigns. “If he were to demur, then the question becomes: What’s the process after that? Is it a coronation of Kamala Harris, which a lot of people are making the case for, or do we have some sort of truncated process?”Donors dreamed of a sort of reality TV competition at the convention in August — a bake-off for the history books. Many had withheld tens of millions of dollars from Biden. Big-money people tried an escrow account for a new candidate, new polling about replacements for the nomination, money bombs for elected leaders who called on Biden to go. There was even a slogan: “No more dough until no more Joe.”The campaign budget had been built on the assumption that tens of thousands of people who are not yet engaged would give millions of dollars. There is no survey data to say whether they will show up in September with $10 or $25 checks. There is no poll to predict whether the party comes back together. Trump remains unpopular, opposed by large shares of voters. But at the moment he is more popular than Biden.James Carville, the Bill Clinton strategist who had long called for Biden to get out, worked the phone from a cruise ship off the coast of Alaska, trying to divine what happens next and get his party to a better place. He echoed others when he said he was not sure how Biden finds a way out of the spiral in which he is caught — a constant questioning about the path to victory that only makes the path to victory harder.“What they are asking is, ‘How are you going to win this?’” he said of the people he had spoken to. “No one is over it, and we are moving ahead anyway.”"
WaPo_12,Elections 2024: 12 more Democratic lawmakers call on Biden to step aside,https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/07/19/election-2024-biden-trump-campaign-updates/,2024-07-20 08:50:02.865520,,"Several prominent Democratic lawmakers —  including Sen. Sherrod Brown (Ohio) and Rep. Zoe Lofgren (Calif.) — on Friday joined calls to urge President Biden to exit the ticket, bringing the total number of congressional Democrats to do so to more than 35 according to a Washington Post tally. Earlier on Friday, campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that Biden is “absolutely” staying in the presidential race, calling him the “best person to take on Donald Trump.” The efforts come as the Republican ticket hits the campaign trail, with former president Donald Trump and his new running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), planning an appearance together at a rally in Michigan on Saturday. Biden continues to isolate in Delaware after testing positive for the coronavirus."
WaPo_13,The old Trump opened the door for Democrats to defeat the new Trump,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/19/trump-rnc-convention-speech-offscript/,2024-07-20 08:28:02.865520,,"Donald Trump sounded like a changed man during the opening of his acceptance speech Thursday night at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. His voice softer than usual, the former and maybe future president solemnly recounted in gripping detail how a bullet came within a quarter of an inch of killing him during last Saturday’s assassination attempt. His ear still bandaged, he marveled at his miraculous survival and called for unity. “The discord and division in our society must be healed,” Mr. Trump said. “I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America.”If he had kept with that theme, the speech would have been a memorable success. But the new Mr. Trump could not keep the old Mr. Trump in check. After saying the 2024 election should be about the issues that most affect Americans, Mr. Trump decried “crazy Nancy Pelosi” and claimed that the 2020 election was stolen. “They used covid to cheat,” he said.The former president’s advisers had told reporters on Thursday afternoon that Mr. Trump would not mention President Biden by name during what they said would be a high-altitude address. Their candidate went off-script — acknowledging in an aside that he was doing so — and asserted that Mr. Biden has done more damage to the country than the 10 worst presidents in U.S. history combined. By contrast, Mr. Trump praised Hungarian strongman Viktor Orban and boasted about getting along well with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.There has always been a difference between Teleprompter Trump and Truth Social Trump, and there was again on Thursday. Mr. Trump said he was speaking “with great humility.” A moment later, he boasted about how much the convention crowd loved him. He offered moments of hope and optimism only to counter them with darker sentiments.Convention speeches tend not to be policy masterworks, and this was no exception. Mr. Trump avoided social issues such as abortion, LGBTQ+ rights and guns. He claimed falsely that Democrats want to “destroy Social Security and Medicare.” (In fact, neither party has shown much inclination to address the nation’s looming debt crisis by adjusting entitlement programs in even modest ways.) Mr. Trump pledged to put a tariff of between 100 and 200 percent on every imported car. “They will be unsellable in the United States,” he said. A tariff like this would likely increase inflation; it might also violate the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which, as Mr. Trump noted a moment later in the speech, he helped negotiate as president.On immigration, Mr. Trump reminded listeners that he skirted Congress’s power over federal spending, diverting money from the military budget for his border wall when lawmakers refused to fund it. He promised the largest deportation operation in U.S. history, modeled on President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s “Operation Wetback.”In other words, it was a missed opportunity. Instead of speaking in a new, expansive and unifying voice, Mr. Trump reverted to past tendencies. By virtue of this choice, Mr. Trump left the door open for Democrats to explain how they would heal and lead a country hungry for peace, prosperity and civility. Of course, it’s up to Democrats to salvage their own presidential campaign effort, which has been in free fall since Mr. Biden’s debate performance nearly a month ago.To this point: On Friday, more Democratic lawmakers called on Mr. Biden to exit the presidential race, even as the Democratic National Committee continues to press its plan to nominate the president before delegates even meet in Chicago next month. There are now four senators and more than 30 House members on record in favor of a change at the top of the ticket.  The coming days might determine whether and how Democrats themselves can manage the sort of growth and renewal that failed to shine through on that brightly lit stage in Milwaukee."

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.As the ripple effects spread from the massive IT outage, social media was flooded with posts from people grappling with the fallout. Billboard-sized screens in New York City’s ordinarily sleepless Times Square were left dormant.The nation’s hospitals had to contend with inaccessible machinery and medicines, as well as a swell of missed appointments and canceled surgeries. At a Kaiser Permanente hospital in San Jose, nurse Kim Brown noticed something was amiss Thursday night when the computers in her labor and delivery unit abruptly restarted and the screens turned blue. “Everything just went down,” she said.With a central monitoring system disabled, nurses had to go into patient rooms to check each baby’s heartbeat. A security guard was stationed at the entrance of the unit because the digital alarm system wasn’t working. Because the hospital’s systems were mostly restored by midnight, Brown said she and her colleague didn’t realize the scope of the problem. “We thought it was just us,” she said.But the scale of the CrowdStrike outage set in quickly at Providence Health and Services, one of the nation’s largest nonprofit health-care systems. Providence has almost 15,000 servers running primarily on Windows, and although it eventually restored access to most of its clinical applications, it hadn’t been able to update systems that support anesthesia machines as of Friday morning. The Renton, Wash.-based system had to cancel surgeries at its 50-plus hospitals across seven states, said B.J. Moore, Providence’s chief information officer. A Providence spokesperson later said fewer hospitals were impacted than originally thought, and the elective procedures will be rescheduled.One crucial lingering challenge for hospitals: Third-party vendors such as MRI image processors and blood-testing labs may take longer to apply the CrowdStrike fixes. “Patients are still impacted because other companies may not be remediated this quickly,” Moore said. “The blast radius of this impact is big.”Airline travelers, both domestic and international, faced serpentine lines from Philadelphia to Singapore as flight monitors lit up with thousands of delay and cancellation notices. In Baltimore, airport staff served water and cookies to exhausted travelers who had been stuck since the previous night. In Dallas, the outage forced some airport workers to draft boarding passes by hand.Andy Luten, an American expat living in Australia, had just boarded his red-eye flight from Los Angeles to Sydney when a delay notification flashed on his American Airlines app. He and his fellow passengers spent a couple of antsy hours on the tarmac before getting off the plane around 2 a.m.Inside the Los Angeles airport, Luten was struck by the “heaps of people all over, finding whatever free space to get some rest.” He got as far as the airline lounge, sleeping on the floor for a few fitful hours before rebooking his flight for Friday, nearly 23 hours after his original trip.8:12am The crowd continues to grow.

Though she made it onto her American Airlines flight shortly before midnight without issue, several 30-minute delays eventually forced her to deplane around 2:30 a.m. She attempted to rebook her flight or switch to another airline but found herself at a loss.“It was frustrating because they didn’t have any information for us about whether or not they would be able to rebook us or get us anywhere,” Brown said.As she left the airport, Brown saw dozens of people sleeping on the floor, while the monitors on the wall glowed with the Windows operating system’s bright “blue screen of death” everywhere she looked.Kiosks at the Delta ticket counter of DFW being restarted after showing the “Blue Screen of Death.”Long lines are backing up as several airlines deal with the #CyberSecurity outages. @wfaa pic.twitter.com/mkwjLx1LkTShreya Chudasam, associate director of data science for a telecom company, said she missed a Friday deadline because her work laptop was unusable from 8 a.m. until well into the afternoon. She had to limit herself to what she could complete on her work phone, texting with her boss and reviewing her team’s work through screenshots shared on Slack.“It was definitely frustrating,” Chudasam said of her workarounds. “If the work phone wasn’t there, I wouldn’t have gotten done half of the things.”Even the Paris Olympics organizing committee found itself waylaid by the outage as it continued preparations for the kickoff of the Games next week. The outage has had a “limited” impact so far, the panel said in a statement Friday, affecting “the delivery of uniforms and accreditations.” Some delegations were experiencing flight delays, it added.The Microsoft / CrowdStrike outage has taken down most airports in India.

WaPo_15,She called 911. The deputy who responded is charged with murdering her.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/19/illinois-deputy-charged-sonya-massey/,2024-07-20 09:37:02.847142,,"An Illinois sheriff’s deputy has been charged with first-degree murder for allegedly shooting an unarmed Black woman in her house after she called 911 to report a prowler.Sean Grayson, 30, was one of two Sangamon County sheriff’s deputies who went to 36-year-old Sonya Massey’s house in Springfield, Ill., early on July 6. Within a half-hour, Grayson had shot Massey in the face and — as she lay dying — told another deputy not to bother with trying to save her, prosecutors allege.On Wednesday, Grayson was indicted on first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct after a weeks-long investigation by the Illinois State Police and the Sangamon County State’s Attorney’s Office. At prosecutors’ urging, Circuit Judge Ryan Cadagin denied Grayson a bond and ordered that he be jailed. Records show he’s locked up at the Menard County Detention Facility.Grayson, who was fired Thursday after his indictment, faces life in prison if convicted on the murder charge.Sangamon County State’s Attorney John Milhiser and Grayson’s attorney, Dan Fultz, declined to comment on the case.Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who’s representing Massey’s family, said his clients have endured “unimaginable pain and suffering” for what he called “the heinous actions” of a guardian Massey had called on to help her.“Sonya Massey called 911 for protection, but instead was tragically shot by Illinois Sheriff’s Deputy Sean Grayson,” Crump wrote Friday on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter. “He not only took her life but also discouraged his partner from giving aid.”Around 12:50 a.m. on July 6, Grayson and another deputy responded to Massey’s 911 call about a prowler near her house in Springfield, prosecutor Mary Rodgers wrote in a sworn affidavit. They allegedly went into her home to get more information and make sure it was safe.While inside, Grayson noticed a pot on the stove and allowed Massey to remove it to prevent an accidental fire, Rodgers said. Meanwhile, the other deputy searched Massey’s house and found nothing dangerous, she added.Grayson then made a comment about the pot, which held heated water, Rodgers said, and Massey responded by setting it down on the kitchen counter while Grayson was still in the living room.Despite having cover and being some distance away from Massey, Grayson allegedly pulled his gun and threatened to shoot Massey in the face. Massey put her hands in the air and said, “I’m sorry” as she ducked behind the counter between them, the prosecutor said.Grayson came toward her and “aggressively yelled” at Massey, Rodgers said. Massey grabbed the pot and tossed out the water, according to an Illinois State Police memo obtained by the New York Times.Then, Grayson allegedly fired three times at Massey, hitting her once in the face.Only then did Grayson turn on his body camera, Rodgers said while contrasting his actions with those of the other deputy who turned on his camera upon arriving at Massey’s house.After Grayson shot Massey, his fellow deputy said he was going to get a medical kit from his vehicle, Rodgers said. Grayson allegedly told him not to bother given the severity of Massey’s injury. The other deputy, nevertheless, rendered aid and stayed with Massey until EMTs arrived, she said.Medics took her to HSHS St. John’s Hospital in Springfield where she died.That day, the Sangamon County Sheriff’s Office asked the Illinois State Police to investigate the shooting.A use of force expert with the Illinois State Police watched the body-camera footage of both deputies and determined Grayson’s shooting was not justified, Rodgers said. The expert compared the shooting “to an officer intentionally and unnecessarily putting himself in front of a moving vehicle and then justifying use of force because of fear of being struck,” she added.Grayson’s “disregard of his training as a law enforcement officer, and his disregard for human life, shows by clear and convincing evidence that he is a danger to persons in the community,” Rodgers said.On Wednesday, Massey’s family met with prosecutors and state police to get an update on the investigation and watch the deputies’ body-cam footage, according to a news release from the Sangamon County County State’s Attorney. Prosecutors plan to publicly release those videos on Monday.Grayson was arraigned Thursday during his first court appearance. His next hearing is on Aug. 26.Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) on Thursday called Massey’s death a “devastating occurrence and tragedy.”“We’ve seen too much of this where an innocent person — unarmed — who actually called for assistance was the target and victim of a shooting by a police officer,” Pritzker said.Later, the governor said, “The tragedy of this is heartbreaking.”Daniel Wu contributed to this report."

WaPo_18,Hectic day leads to (almost) leisurely night for Nationals,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/19/nationals-reds-patrick-corbin-josiah-gray/,2024-07-20 10:09:03.093165,,"The all-star break is a time for players, staff and coaches to get away from the nonstop pace of professional baseball. But it is no coincidence that the break falls during July, in some ways the busiest month in the game.There’s the MLB draft, a three-day event that starts the day before the all-star break. There’s the All-Star Game itself. There’s also the trade deadline, which falls on July 30 this year. And, oh, yeah, there’s still baseball to played.So by Friday afternoon, when the Washington Nationals’ clubhouse reopened, it didn’t take long for everything to return to breakneck pace. What proved to be a hectic day ended with an 8-5 victory over the Cincinnati Reds to open a six-game homestand.The Nationals (45-53) scored seven of their runs over the fourth and fifth innings, providing more than enough run support to Patrick Corbin, who allowed one run on three hits over six innings. The Reds (47-51) scored four runs in the ninth against Jose A. Ferrer and Derek Law, but Kyle Finnegan earned the final out.“Corbin was really good, pitched really well tonight,” Manager Dave Martinez said. “That’s what we needed after four days off. And our offense showed up. We were patient, got a couple of home runs.”Well before the game, the clubhouse was filled with boxes. First-time all-star CJ Abrams was at his locker unpacking his new gear, including a bag with the All-Star Game logo on the side. His teammates pulled out new bats as they caught up with one another.Then there was the pregame move: The Nationals reinstated Ferrer from the 60-day injured list after he missed most of the season with a left shoulder strain. To clear space, Washington optioned reliever Amos Willingham — who made one appearance last week in Milwaukee — to Class AAA Rochester. Ferrer, paired with Robert Garcia, gives Manager Dave Martinez two left-handed options out of the bullpen — a rarity for the team the past few seasons.There were the injury updates, mostly positive. First baseman Joey Gallo could start running next week as he rehabs a left hamstring sprain. Starter Cade Cavalli will head to West Palm Beach, Fla., soon to continue his rehab after Tommy John surgery. Trevor Williams, out with a right flexor strain, is throwing up to 75 feet now. But there was one major negative: Josiah Gray has a partial tear of his ulnar collateral ligament, meaning he will miss the rest of the 2024 season and a significant chunk of the 2025 campaign. He will have surgery Wednesday.And there was a rare, hour-long post-all star break workout featuring two guests: shortstop Seaver King and catcher Kevin Bazzell, the Nationals’ first- and third-rounds pick from this year’s draft who signed their contracts Friday.“There’s a lot going on. We got a game today,” Martinez joked. “It’s pretty cool to see those young kids. I don’t know if I’m getting older or they’re getting younger. But I’m excited to see them and excited to see where our organization is going.”King and Bazzell took batting practice in the team’s final group; Bazzell, who is from Texas, said he grew up watching Joey Gallo, and they were in the same group Friday. Then King and Bazzell had their first news conference, joined by the team’s new scouting director, Danny Haas, and General Manager Mike Rizzo — who spoke to the media ahead of the team’s second half.Rizzo said the team will be aggressive ahead of the trade deadline, with the Nationals expected to be sellers. But he will have to get the right price, especially for Lane Thomas — whom Rizzo views as an everyday player, not a platoon player — and Finnegan — the team’s all-star closer who has performed so well that Rizzo said, “We’re not going to get rid of him easy.”And after all of the pregame madness, there was a baseball game.The Reds grabbed a 1-0 lead in the third inning when Jonathan India singled to drive in Stuart Fairchild. But that was all Corbin would allow, striking out six by keeping the Reds off balance with his cutter and slider. Corbin threw his slider at two different speeds Friday, with some as low as 71 mph; his season average is 79.9.In the fourth, James Wood hit a two-run single that drove in Jesse Winker and Juan Yepez. Reds right fielder Rece Hinds tried to throw Yepez out at home but accidentally hit Wood in the back rounding first. Two batters later, catcher Keibert Ruiz hit a two-run homer to put the Nationals ahead 4-1. And in the fifth, Yepez hit a three-run homer to push the Nationals firmly in front. Jacob Young scored on a wild pitch in the seventh.“When we get it going, it’s very fun,” Yepez said. “This team has a lot of talent, and we’re looking good.”The Reds clawed all the way back to bring Elly De La Cruz to the plate in the ninth as the tying runner, but Finnegan got him to ground out to second."
WaPo_19,Some Louisiana schools can’t post Ten Commandments while law is challenged,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/19/louisiana-ten-commandments-schools-lawsuit/,2024-07-20 10:07:03.093165,,"Last month, Gov. Jeff Landry (R) signed a bill that made Louisiana the only state  that requires public schools to display the Ten Commandments in every classroom — a move that quickly prompted a group of parents to file a lawsuit alleging the new law is unconstitutional.But while the law is tested in court, Louisiana has to hold off on posting biblical signs in the five parishes where the plaintiffs’ children attend school, according to an agreement approved Friday by a federal judge.In an order, U.S. District Judge John deGravelles of Louisiana’s Middle District set a hearing for Sept. 30 with a ruling expected by Nov. 15. Until then, the Ten Commandments can’t be displayed in schools located in the parishes of East Baton Rouge, Livingston, Orleans, St. Tammany and Vernon. Additionally, the state’s Board of Elementary and Secondary Education cannot “promulgate advice, rules or regulations regarding proper implementation” of the new law until Nov. 15, the agreement states.Under the new law, public K-12 schools and college classrooms must display the Ten Commandments — religious and ethical directives that in the Bible are handed down to the prophet Moses — on posters measuring at least 11 by 14 inches and featuring “large, easily readable font.” Schools are also required to post a three-paragraph statement that explains how the texts were “a prominent part of American public education” from the late 17th century through the late 20th century. The law gives schools until Jan. 1 to put up the Ten Commandments, and requires them to use donated posters or spend donated money, rather than public funds, to  buy the displays.Since it overwhelmingly passed in the Republican-controlled state legislature, the law has drawn national attention and become the latest example of lawmakers undertaking efforts that blur the lines between church and state — a battle that has particularly been brewing in public schools.Five days after Landry signed the bill, on June 24, a coalition of advocacy groups, including the Freedom From Religion Foundation, Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, and the American Civil Liberties Union’s national and state offices, filed a federal lawsuit. The plaintiffs in the case are nine Louisiana families of different faiths — among them four members of the clergy — who allege the law violates First Amendment language forbidding government establishment of religion and guaranteeing religious liberty.“Permanently posting the Ten Commandments in every Louisiana public-school classroom — rendering them unavoidable — unconstitutionally pressures students into religious observance, veneration, and adoption of the state’s favored religious scripture,” says the suit, which charges that there is no long-standing tradition of hanging the commandments in classrooms and that courts have already ruled against the practice.On July 8, the groups filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, asking the court to refrain from imposing the law or allowing any related enforcement of it during pending legal proceedings. The move, said Rev. Darcy Roake, a plaintiff in the case, sought to “ensure that our family’s religious-freedom rights are protected from day one of the upcoming school year.”“The Ten Commandments displays required under state law will create an unwelcoming and oppressive school environment for children, like ours, who don’t believe in the state’s official version of scripture,” Darcy said in a statement  this month. “We believe that no child should feel excluded in public school because of their family’s faith tradition.”However, under the terms of the agreement, only students in five Louisiana parishes won’t see the Ten Commandments when they return to school next month.The latest pushes to post the Ten Commandments in schools comes after similar — albeit failed — attempts throughout decades. In 1980, the Supreme Court ruled that a similar law in Kentucky violated the establishment clause of the Constitution, which bars the federal government from favoring any one religion. Other proposals to display the Ten Commandments in schools have been introduced — but have not become law — in Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi and South Carolina.Yet, recent Supreme Court rulings have been more lenient toward religion in schools. In 2022, the court ruled in favor of a Washington state football coach who knelt at midfield to pray and was joined by student-athletes. The prayers were protected by the Constitution’s guarantees of free speech and religious exercise, the court ruled.The Louisiana law has already been praised by members of the religious right and has found the support of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.During a gathering of the evangelical Faith and Freedom Coalition, Trump endorsed the Ten Commandments law, telling attendees: “Has anyone read the ‘Thou shalt not steal?’ I mean, has anybody read this incredible stuff? It’s just incredible. They don’t want it to go up. It’s a crazy world.’’At the Republican National Convention on Thursday, the law was once again touted — this time by Landry, who connected it with the assassination attempt against Trump.“I would submit that maybe if the Ten Commandments were hanging on [Thomas Matthew Crooks’] wall at the school that he was in, maybe he wouldn’t have took a shot at the president,” Landry said in an interview with Nexstar, the Louisiana Illuminator reported.Anumita Kaur and Michelle Boorstein contributed to this report."

I am connected to my phone almost 24/7, and I take all calls regardless of my location.I frequently take calls from clients and staff while using the ladies' room. I am distressed when others using the same restroom flush toilets and use loud hand-dryers while I'm on the phone. It must be obvious to them that I'm talking, and yet they make these noises, which interrupt my calls.How can I politely ask others to refrain from flushing or using the hand dryer while I’m on the phone?What did you have in mind? “Please stop going about your business while I’m trying to conduct my business?”Miss Manners suggests instead that you get yourself some boundaries — and go apologize to all of the poor women you annoyed.Dear Miss Manners: A while ago, we had a dinner party for about 10 people at our place. One of the couples announced that they had to leave early, and that they expected to be served sooner than the other guests.They have done this a few other times, too, claiming that they go to bed early. This couple has a tendency to come to dinner parties at our place and then rush us. They rarely hang around much to socialize. It's like they are interested in the food, but not in the company.I ended up heating their food early and, as good hosts, my husband and I sat with this couple at the table until they finished their meal and left. I wanted to tell my husband that he should go spend time with the other guests while I was tied up with this couple, but did not get a private moment to tell him so. Consequently, for about 45 minutes to an hour, we had to leave the other guests on their own. We do want to keep having this couple over, but dread this happening again.What is a polite way to make it clear to this couple that we don’t like to be rushed, and that serving them earlier than everyone else is very inconvenient and inconsiderate?Make an earlier start time? A revised guest list? Perhaps Miss Manners is missing something, since these solutions seem obvious.Who are they, that you felt you had to neglect your other guests to entertain them? If there is a reason to put up with their demands, you could issue a gentle reprimand, saying, “We’d love to have you over to meet the Pistlethwaits, but last time you left before we could all sit down together. What would be a good starting time for you, so that you are home in time for bed, but we all dine together?”And then make it 30 minutes earlier than that, just in case.New Miss Manners columns are posted Monday through Saturday on washingtonpost.com/advice.

Because I am between jobs, instead of turning to me, as he has in the past, he recently turned to our sister, who is very well off. We never get the money back when he asks. I am just the path of least resistance. Since my sister couldn’t give him the $6,000 he asked for to pay off credit cards, I told her I would, knowing full well I’d never see the money again. I can live with that.My brother thinks my sister gave him the money (I don't mind that at all). However, my sister is making sure she calls my brother every month to make sure he pays $100 a month. We use a cash app to disguise that it goes directly to me. It's going to take five more years to pay this off. I can't take the monthly ritual and the drama around it.I do not want to be my brother’s creditor. It is stressing me out and really bothers me, as I know he is doing his best to survive and support his family. I end up giving this payment back to him anyway. It’s insane. I want out. I want to be able to tell my brother that it was me and that I don’t want it back. I just want to move on, but my sister is adamant about making sure he pays her (me) back. What should I do?— Wants to Cash OutCash Out: Your sister doesn’t have a say here. She’s created a farcical caper in hopes of teaching your brother a lesson. But she can’t collect a debt that isn’t owed to her. Tell your brother directly that the debt is forgiven. And after that tell your sister what you did.It's so easy to put our own values on the ways other people manage their money. So much so that poor financial decisions can take on the weight of moral failings. The ways that you spend your money and your brother manages his money are none of your sister's business. Or, as folks used to say where I grew up, she doesn't have a penny in that nickel.Should you choose to lend/give your brother money again, it will be helpful to have an honest conversation about expectations — yours and his. You may be the path of least resistance for him when he runs into money trouble, but you still have a right to say “no,” “not right now,” and “can we find a different solution?”Dear Eric: This past year, my husband and I received three wedding invitations and a graduation invitation from our close relatives’ children. We were unable to attend these events due to them taking place out of state. We never hear from any of these relatives, and know that they send these invitations with the intention of getting a gift of some sort. We know that this is typical and normal.We don’t have a lot of extra money in our budget, but were gracious enough to send a card with $100 to each of them. To date we have not received a thank-you note or any acknowledgment from any of them. They are all under 30. We are at a loss for words with the lack of gratitude that the younger generation exhibits when a gift has been given for their special occasion.This really bothers us to the point that we don’t really want to engage in sending money or gifts for these special occasions anymore. How do we navigate our feelings?— Disenchanted Gift GiverGiver: The problem of thank you notes and expressions of gratitude comes up a lot in the letters I receive. This is especially odd to me because there seem to be more and more of those little stores that sell greeting cards, chocolates, and housewarming gifts. Are people just buying boxes of thank you notes and never sending them? What are they doing with them? Making papier-mache? Impractical.No matter the manners, saying “thank you” when someone does something kind is just basic communication. As such, it extends beyond generational shifts.Two options: communicate with your close relatives that their children dropped the ball or go directly to the children to let them know what your expectation was. It’s okay to say to someone “when I send a gift, I expect an acknowledgment. Do you have a different expectation?”In the future, if you get another gift solicitation from them, you can always opt to donate to a charity in their name and let them know. This is also a good option for invites that ask for “no gifts.” At the very least, the charity will send you a thank-you note.(Send questions to R. Eric Thomas at eric@askingeric.com or P.O.

It dawned on me I couldn’t even figure out what my ideal life looked like. I have some issues with my spouse (who doesn’t?) but ultimately know he’s the best partner for me, I’m meh on my job situation but make decent money and it’s fine, I love my kid and growing in being a mom but don’t wish for anything MORE from that. I have some new hobbies I’d like to try but no passions.I just feel like I lost sight of what goals should be when life is “good,” per se, and I have no complaints but still feel so blasé and untethered. Looking for some inspiration, maybe a good self-help book or podcast? Anything to help me reframe how to set goals when life has basically given me what I want and I do my best to share it well with others, but it feels … pointless? I don’t know. Is this depression?— I Don’t KnowI Don’t Know: Could be. Or inertia. Or fatigue. Or boredom. Or a domestic-rut trail mix of them all.So here’s the way I’m going to perversely under-advise you: long walks. Start fitting them in (any) where you can. If you have access to nature, vistas, environmental eye candy, even better. If you have limited exercise options, then do whatever is available — anything beats nothing. That’s because there is a proven link between physical motion and both mood enhancement and dislodging stuck thoughts.It’s also really hard to get emotionally unstuck from a cold start, but you just need 10, 20 minutes to get physically unstuck. Why not do the easier one? Jump-start your emotional car.It won’t deliver instant miracles, but getting into a regular motion habit can nudge you toward clarity — or maybe just a better frame of mind about the things in your life you already know and love.And that does seem to be the issue here, that nothing is wrong while also not feeling right. The nothing-wrong part is a good thing worth leaving intact, at least as you work to figure out the feelings part. I love a good blow-things-up approach as much as the next voyeur, but not when there’d be casualties.Re: Ideal life: Also consider that nothing is wrong, and your life is great. Capitalism is invested in telling us we need more or different or better. That creates a drive to work harder than we have to, to buy and consume and get things we don’t really need. You don’t have to listen to that! In all of human history, so few people have been given access to a life that is content and peaceful. That’s okay!— AnonymousAnonymous: You know, I was going to say — but for once, I passed on the opportunity — there is no such thing as an “ideal” life. There is just life. Like, is it my “ideal” to be sitting all alone at a fake-wood-grain institutional desk in a spare room, typing into the void? But I feel pretty lucky a high percentage of the time, and not because I’ve rigged up some comparisons that work in my favor (“Well, at least I don’t have to _____”), though those do have their place.There’s a lot to be said for the power of recognizing that a painful or disenfranchised life is worth the hard work to change. An imperfect one, though, may just need us to commit to being a little more creative about putting it to good use."

Jackson Lee, the daughter of a hospital orderly and a night-shift vocational nurse, grew up far from Texas, in the New York City borough of Queens. She received a bachelor’s degree from Yale University and a law degree from the University of Virginia before moving with her husband to Texas, where he was from, and where she began her political career as a municipal judge and a member of the Houston City Council.She was first elected in 1994 to her Houston-based congressional seat, which was once held by the charismatic African American congresswoman Barbara Jordan. Rep. Jackson Lee quickly established herself as an outspoken advocate for racial and gender equality, voting rights and the revision of the criminal justice system.She was a lead sponsor of legislation that in 2021, after decades of lobbying by advocates, recognized as a federal holiday June 19, or Juneteenth, a date that has come to memorialize the end of slavery in the United States.She also spearheaded legislation that in 2022 reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act, which was enacted in 1994 but expired in 2019. The original law provided protections for women against domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking. Under Rep. Jackson Lee’s leadership, it was expanded, among other ways, to specifically address Native American, transgender and immigrant women.Critics accused Rep. Jackson Lee of drawing attention to herself, in addition to her causes. She offered dizzying arrays of amendments that had little to no chance of passing and, according to C-SPAN data, was among the members who spent the most time speaking on the House floor, including when the chamber was empty.At the annual State of the Union address, she made it her practice to arrive hours in advance to secure an aisle seat from which to be seen on TV interacting with the president as he made his way to and from the podium.Also complicating Rep. Jackson’s Lee reputation were accounts of her mistreatment of staff members, whom she reportedly required to chauffeur her around Washington, dispatched on personal errands, phoned after midnight and scolded harshly for what she regarded as their shortcomings.Her office was known for having one of the highest turnover rates on Capitol Hill. In 2023, during an unsuccessful run for mayor of Houston, she expressed regret when a recording emerged of her insulting her campaign staff in a profanity-laced tirade.Rep. Jackson Lee said she attempted to ignore the criticism aimed at her and attributed it, at least in part, to sexism and racism.“I have been in the skin of a woman and an African-American, and I understand the injustices we have to live through,” she told the Texas Tribune in 2017. She added, “I just take it with a smile because I love the institution” of Congress.Politicians are often labeled, fairly or unfairly, as “workhorses” or “showhorses.” In many estimations, Rep. Jackson Lee fell squarely in the latter category. Robert Stein, a professor of political science at Rice University in Houston who followed Rep. Jackson Lee’s career for decades, said she was a “showhorse” — but not in a negative way.“She was a showhorse for the causes she cared about,” Stein said, also remarking that “she staked out a career in the Congress that I think suited her and her abilities.”In response to criticism that Rep. Jackson Lee was a publicity-seeking politician who demanded too much of her staff, Stein cited what he described as a double standard for men and women in politics. “If this was a White male, we would have said he was a great politician,” he said. “When she’s a Black woman from [Queens] who moves to Houston — nobody ever gave her a break.”Admirers lauded Rep. Jackson Lee for pushing causes that she believed in even when she was unlikely to see them prevail. Foremost among those causes was the campaign to obtain reparations for African Americans as a means of redressing the enduring consequences of slavery.In 2021, Rep. Jackson Lee successfully pushed H.R. 40, a bill to create a commission on the matter of reparations, through the Judiciary Committee. That committee vote was as far as the proposal had advanced on Capitol Hill since then-congressman John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) began advocating reparations more than three decades earlier.“We’re asking for people to understand the pain, the violence, the brutality, the chattel-ness of what we went through,” Rep. Jackson Lee said. “And, of course, we’re asking for harmony, reconciliation, reason to come together as Americans.”Within the House, Rep. Jackson Lee served as chief deputy Democratic whip and was a member of the Homeland Security and Budget committees in addition to the Judiciary Committee.Back in her district, she was known as a consummate politician, always on hand for weddings and funerals.Rep. Jackson Lee took pride in her reputation for showing up, whether at local gatherings or the State of the Union address. It was her job, she said, to represent her constituents as forcefully as she could.In 2009, when President Barack Obama made his first address to a joint session of Congress, Rep. Jackson Lee was ready when the transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, appeared in the chamber.“As he walked down the aisle, I made the final push for Houston being in the president’s budget … and for Houston being the first city that Secretary LaHood visited, and what were the results? We got in the president’s ’09 budget … and he made our city the first city to visit,” Rep. Jackson Lee told the Texas Tribune. “I hosted him the entire day.”Sheila Jackson, one of two children, was born in Queens on Jan. 12, 1950.Her father had been an artist for Marvel Comics in the 1940s, but he lost his job when White colleagues returned to theirs after serving in World War II, according to the Houston Chronicle. He later worked as a day laborer and as a hospital orderly. Her mother cared for premature babies at a hospital affiliated with the Salvation Army.Rep. Jackson Lee attended New York City public schools as they started to desegregate in the 1950s and ’60s. She was bused to predominantly White schools, she recounted, where she overcame discrimination to become involved in student government.Her junior year, she ran for student council vice president but was elected secretary, a position that she assumed her classmates deemed more appropriate for a female student, she told the Chronicle.She did not know if she would have the opportunity to attend college until she received a scholarship established at New York University for Black students after the 1968 assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.Years later, reflecting on the tragedy that made it possible to pursue her education, she told the New York Times that she was a beneficiary of the “hills and valleys, the broken bodies and broken hearts, the loss of life of many who have gone on before me.”She later transferred to Yale, where she studied political science and graduated in 1972, and where she met her future husband, Elwyn Lee, whom she married the next year. She received her law degree from the University of Virginia in 1975.The couple resided for three years in Washington, where she worked for the House Select Committee on Assassinations, convened to investigate King’s death and the slaying of President John F. Kennedy in 1963.Rep. Jackson Lee and her husband then moved to Houston, where she practiced law and mounted three unsuccessful races for local judgeships. She received an appointment to the municipal bench before winning an at-large seat on the Houston City Council in 1989.In 1994, she challenged Rep. Craig Washington (D), elected in 1989 to fill the seat left vacant when Rep. Mickey Leland (D) was killed in a plane crash in Ethiopia. Rep. Jackson Lee defeated Washington, 63 percent to 37 percent in the primary, then easily won the general election in her highly Democratic district.Upon her election to the House, Rep. Jackson Lee was awarded a seat on the Judiciary Committee, which under Republican leadership voted, along party lines, to support the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998. Clinton was accused of lying under oath about his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.Rep. Jackson Lee was one of Clinton’s most ardent defenders, remarking that “I know oppression when I see it” and denouncing Clinton’s impeachment trial in the Senate as “a sledgehammer to catch a fly.” He was acquitted in 1999.In 2019, Rep. Jackson Lee stepped down as chairman of a Judiciary subcommittee and as chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation amid accusations that she fired an aide who had also worked for the foundation and who threatened to sue the foundation over an alleged sexual assault by a supervisor.Rep. Jackson Lee denied having retaliated against the woman and was reinstated in 2021 as chairman of the subcommittee on crime, terrorism and homeland security.In her 2023 run for Houston mayor, the nation’s fourth-largest city by population, Rep. Jackson Lee had the endorsements of former president Clinton and his wife, Hillary Clinton, but she was soundly defeated in a nonpartisan runoff by a longtime Democratic state senator, John Whitmire, who attracted support from centrist Democrats, Republicans and independents with an emphasis on public safety.In the 2024 congressional election, Rep. Jackson Lee defeated a Democratic challenger, former Houston City Council member Amanda Edwards, in the March primary.Survivors include her husband, of Houston; two children, Jason Lee of Chicago and Erica Carter of Houston; a brother; and two grandchildren.Reflecting on the forceful approach she took to work on behalf of her constituents and causes, Rep. Jackson Lee told the Times in 1999 that she needed to “make a difference.”“I don’t have wealth to write a check,” she said. “But maybe I can be a voice arguing consistently for change.”"
WaPo_24,"In this city, people say Russia must defeat Ukraine and the West at any cost",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/20/kirov-russia-war-west-ukraine/,2024-07-20 14:56:02.808855,,"KIROV, Russia — In Kirov, a small city in the heart of western Russia, about 1,000 miles from the front lines in Ukraine, the war that initially few people wanted continues to fill graves in local cemeteries. But most residents now seem to agree with President Vladimir Putin that the bloodshed is necessary.“The U.S. and NATO gave us no choice,” said Vlad, the commander of a Russian storm unit who has been wounded three times since signing a contract to join the military a year ago. He spoke on the condition he be identified only by first name because he is still an active-duty soldier.After fighting in Ukraine this spring left him with 40 pieces of shrapnel in his body, Vlad was sent home to recover. Once healed, he plans to return to battle. “I’m going back because I want my kids to be proud of me,” he said. “You have to raise patriotism. Otherwise, Russia will be eaten up.”Elena Smirnova, whose brothers have been fighting in Ukraine since they were conscripted in September 2022, said she is proud they “serve the motherland” rather than sit on the couch at home.Nina Korotaeva, who works every day at a volunteer center sewing nets and anti-drone camouflage blankets, said that she feels “such pity” for the young men dying but that their sacrifice is unavoidable. “We don’t have a choice,” Korotaeva said. “We have to defend our state. We can’t just agree to being broken up.”A visit to Kirov last month revealed that many Russians firmly believe that their country is fighting an existential war with the West, which has sent Ukraine more than $100 billion in military aid, including sophisticated weapons, to defend against Russia’s invasion — assistance that has sharply increased Russia’s casualties.Interviews showed that the Kremlin has mobilized public support for the war while also masking the full, horrific consequences of it. Some residents of Kirov said they still find the war incomprehensible, while others who have lost relatives insist that the fighting must be serving a higher purpose.Olga Akishina, whose boyfriend, Nikita Rusakov, 22, was killed with at least 20 other soldiers when a U.S.-provided HIMARS missile slammed into their base this spring, said she found it too difficult to speak about him. Instead, she spoke for nearly an hour in an unbroken torrent about NATO bases in Ukraine and “the extermination” of Russian-speakers there — echoing the Kremlin’s unfounded justifications for the war, which are repeated frequently on state television.“Of course, if he hadn’t died, it would certainly be much more pleasant for me and his family,” Akishina said. “But I am aware that this was a necessary measure — to protect those people.”Washington Post journalists traveled to Kirov at the invitation of Maria Butina, a Russian citizen who served 15 months in a U.S. federal prison after being convicted of operating as an unregistered foreign agent. Butina had been an advocate for gun rights and other conservative causes during her years in the United States. Deported after her release, she was embraced as a hero in Russia and now represents Kirov in the State Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament.Butina’s office organized interviews with soldiers on leave from active duty, wounded servicemen, soldiers’ families, volunteers, local medical staff and young police cadets. Butina insisted that one of her assistants, Konstantyn Sitchikhin, sit in on most of the conversations, which meant some people may have felt unable to speak freely. At times, Sitchikhin interrupted, telling young cadets, for example, to speak “carefully and patriotically.”The Post also interviewed several people independently, in person or by phone.Butina said she extended the invitation because she still believes in dialogue with the West and wanted The Post to report “the truth.” But she insisted that Sitchikhin’s presence in interviews was necessary. “We need to feel that we can trust you,” Butina said. “I advise you to build bridges, not walls.”The Post accepted Butina’s invitation because it allowed access to a city outside Moscow where reporting might otherwise have proved risky. Since the invasion, Russian authorities have outlawed criticism of the war or the military and have arrested and charged journalists with serious offenses including espionage. Journalists also are routinely put under surveillance.Sitchikhin, Butina’s aide, cited a climate of fear. “You need to understand that we are at war and people here see you as the enemy,” he said. “I am just trying to protect the people I care about.”A day after speaking to The Post, Akishina, whose boyfriend was killed in the missile strike, sent a text message saying that she regretted talking to an American newspaper.“You will most likely be asked to present the material in the article in a way that will be beneficial to the newspaper’s editors,” she wrote.“I would not want there to be a headline under my story and our photographs that would blame our country and our President for the death of our military,” she wrote, adding that the 78 percent of Russians who voted to reelect Putin in March were proof of widespread public support for the war. (Independent observers said the Russian election failed to meet democratic standards, with genuine challengers blocked from running and Putin controlling all media.)“The truth is that the United States and the European Union countries that supply weapons to Ukraine are to blame for the death of our guys, as well as civilians in Donbas and Belgorod,” Akishina wrote.On Wednesday, June 12, thousands of people crammed onto Kirov’s main square to celebrate Russia Day, swaying to patriotic rock songs in the warm sunshine. Among them was Lyubov, tears streaming down her face as she cradled a portrait of her son, Anton, in uniform.“I cry every single day,” Lyubov said of Anton, 39, who was confirmed dead this spring.Lyubov said she had joined the festivities hoping to take her mind off her grief. But the dancing, happy families, and rousing music that at times drowned out her words proved too much. “I don’t want everyone to join us in our sadness,” she said, “but I can’t take this.”Anton was killed by machine-gun fire near Avdiivka, a city in eastern Ukraine that Russia captured in February after months of fierce fighting. Anton called her the night before the assault and told her that he was “on a one-way ticket” — a suicide mission. When she finally got her son’s body back, she was warned not to open the coffin.Lyubov said she did not understand the reasons for the war, who Russia is fighting or why her son volunteered to join the army. But she insisted that his death was not in vain. “He did it for us,” she said, smiling a bit, “and for Russia.”The Post arranged the interview with Lyubov independently by contacting her through a social media page for soldiers’ families. The Post is identifying her and her son by first name only because of the risk of backlash from the authorities.The interviews — with Lyubov, and more than a dozen others in Kirov — highlighted a striking duality: Many Russians are struggling with the deaths of loved ones or their return with grievous injuries, and some are deeply engaged in volunteer efforts, but many others are largely untouched by the war, which has killed thousands of Ukrainian civilians and destroyed entire cities.At the entrance to the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a pamphlet written by Kirov’s chief bishop, Mark Slobodsky, tells worshipers that this is not a fight over territory but a war to defend Orthodox Christian values. “It is a sacred and civilizational conflict,” Slobodsky wrote. “No one can stand to the side of these events.”Inside, priests blessed an icon that Butina’s office had commissioned by an artist from Donetsk, in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine, to honor Kirov’s soldiers. The icon bore an odd combination of images: Czar Nicholas II, Russian Prince Alexander Nevsky and the former head of the Russian-backed Donetsk People’s Republic, Alexander Zakharchenko, standing in various positions of piety before the slag heaps of Ukraine’s coal-mining Donbas region.At a small concert organized by a local volunteer group, people sang patriotic songs about victory and love for the motherland. Three men, the fathers of soldiers either killed or still fighting in Ukraine, were awarded medals for raising “heroes of Russia.”“Each fighter is a hero for us, and today we wish them the fastest victory,” the concert’s host proclaimed. “It’s thanks to them that we are able to hold such events like this today.”Public unity behind the war was fully on display in Kirov, including a little girl, whose father is fighting in Ukraine, in a T-shirt that said: “I am the daughter of a hero.”Several elderly residents said they donate their pensions to the war effort. Many are children of soldiers who fought in World War II and now view Russia as fighting a new war against fascism.Young cadets in their teens and early 20s, who are training to be police officers and emergency workers, spoke eagerly of volunteer stints they had just completed in occupied Ukraine. One cadet said: “Young people shouldn’t stay on the sidelines.” Asked how they would explain the war in Ukraine, they requested to skip the question.Some young people who joined the fight, however, are disillusioned by it. Denis, 29, a former Wagner mercenary whose left foot was amputated because of a war injury and who participated in a short-lived mutiny last year when Wagner fighters marched toward Moscow, said he was still enraged at “the corrupt and decaying” Defense Ministry.Post journalists encountered Denis by chance, independently of Butina’s office, and he agreed to meet to talk about his experiences in the war on the condition that he be identified only by first name because criticizing the military is now a crime in Russia.Speaking as fireworks marked the end of Russia Day, Denis complained that there was “not enough truth about the war and not enough real, organic involvement.”“Why are people still partying? Why are they spending money on fireworks and this concert?” he said. “It’s as if nothing is going on. Everyone should be helping, but most people do not feel the war concerns them, and politicians are using it to cleanse themselves and increase their ratings.”Denis said he planned to return to Ukraine once he is fitted with a prosthesis.“We have to end this, otherwise the West will see us as weak,” he said. “I thought this war would be short, that it would last six months maximum. We have really been screwed. And I’m disappointed that everyone who tells the truth about the war, about the Russian Defense Ministry, is immediately jailed.”Meanwhile, Kirov’s social media pages are flooded daily with funeral notices and pleas to help find missing fathers, sons or husbands.At the cemetery outside Kirov where Lyubov’s son is buried, there are about 40 graves of soldiers killed since 2022, adorned with wreaths and flags. Thirty freshly dug graves await bodies.Next to one grave, a family gathered to say a few words and raise a glass. “Thank you, Seryoga, for defending us,” said a man, who gave his name only as Mikhail. “You were only there for three days, but at least you tried your best.”"
WaPo_25,Toll in Bangladesh rises beyond 100 as Dhaka falls quiet under curfew,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/20/bangladesh-protests-violence-students/,2024-07-20 15:28:02.703277,,"DHAKA, Bangladesh — Life in the Bangladeshi capital ground to a halt Saturday as the government enforced a curfew to quell violent clashes between student protesters and security forces.Shops and businesses were closed and roads were largely empty in the typically congested city of 10 million people, save for military and paramilitary personnel on patrol. Late on Saturday, scattered street battles were reported across Dhaka. Sweeping restrictions on the internet imposed on Thursday remained in place.According to a Washington Post tally of hospital and police reports, at least 110 people have been killed in the demonstrations over the past four days — the most of any protests in Bangladesh in over a decade. Police forces said several of their personnel are among the dead. Thousands of others have been wounded.Mohammed Abir, a medical examiner at the morgue at Dhaka Medical College hospital, said he received 33 bodies Friday evening.The U.N. humans rights chief, Volker Türk, on Friday called the violence “shocking and unacceptable” and urged restraint. There needs to be “impartial, prompt and exhaustive investigations” into the attacks against students, he said, adding that he was especially worried about the actions of the government’s paramilitary police units, “which have long track records of violations.”Stories to keep you informed

Two dead in listeria outbreak linked to deli meat. Here’s what to know.Dhaka and several other major Bangladeshi cities have been engulfed this past week by protests against a new governmental policy of reserving a portion of civil service jobs for specific groups, including descendants of the nation’s freedom fighters. The quota system, which the protesters see as unfair, has fueled explosive anger toward the government under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which has deployed increasingly draconian methods to quell the unrest.Leaders of the student protest movement told reporters they met with government officials Saturday to convey a list of demands, including an overhaul of the job quota system, the resignation of certain cabinet ministers, and immediate trials for those responsible for the killing of students.The government must release student protesters who have been arrested, Abdullah Saleheen, a student activist, said in an interview. “Until that happens our protests will continue,” he added.Calls on Saturday from The Post to the Bangladeshi Foreign Ministry and Home Affairs Ministry, as well as the U.S. Embassy in Dhaka, went unanswered.In an alert Saturday, the embassy described the situation as “extremely volatile and unpredictable,” advising staff to shelter in place. “The Bangladeshi Army has been deployed nationwide. … Guns, tear gas, and other weapons have been used in the vicinity of the U.S. Embassy,” the alert said.Earlier Friday, the State Department issued a travel advisory for Bangladesh, urging U.S. citizens to reconsider travel “due to civil unrest” in Dhaka.On Friday, protesters stormed a jail in the district of Narsingdi, northeast of the capital, freeing hundreds of inmates. Police posts across Dhaka were set on fire as paramilitary and military forces deployed tear gas, rubber bullets and smoke bombs to disperse large crowds.At the end of the night, the government announced a nationwide curfew, ordering people to stay home until 10 a.m. Sunday local time. There was a two-hour window on Saturday from noon to 2 p.m. for public movement.Internet services have been shut down and mobile services disrupted in a near-total “blackout” that has left many of the country’s 170 million people unreachable. Banks have reported disruptions in operations.Bangladeshi officials say they have slowed internet connectivity to stop the spread of misinformation. But in a letter, a coalition of more than 300 digital rights groups said it is likely to have the opposite effect by reducing people’s ability to counteract misinformation and spurring panic. “Government agencies have a duty to ensure that people can access open, secure, and unrestricted internet when they need it the most,” the #KeepItOn coalition wrote.Another digital rights advocacy group, the Asia Internet Coalition, urged Bangladesh “to consider the serious impact of its action on its people and the country’s reputation as an investment destination.”Several of the biggest companies in the textile industry, a major contributor to Bangladesh’s economy, said they would close their factories on Sunday. Hasina has canceled a planned trip to Europe to deal with the unrest, her office said.Tan reported from Singapore. Sammy Westfall in Washington contributed to this report."
WaPo_26,Two dead in listeria outbreak linked to deli meat. Here’s what to know.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/07/20/listeria-deli-meat-states-lunch-meat/,2024-07-20 15:00:02.703277,,"At least two people in the United States have died in connection with a listeria outbreak linked to meat sliced at deli counters, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of Friday, 28 cases had been recorded in 12 states since the end of May.However, “the true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely higher than the number reported,” the CDC said in its investigation report. “... This is because some people recover without medical care and are not tested for Listeria.”Here’s what to know about the bacteria and the latest outbreak.The CDC is aware of 28 people infected with the strain of listeria in the outbreak, from a dozen states: New York (7 cases); Maryland (6); Virginia (2); New Jersey (2); Massachusetts (2); Georgia (2); Missouri (2); Illinois (1); Pennsylvania (1); North Carolina (1); Wisconsin (1); Minnesota (1). They had a median age of 75.It added that the outbreak “may not be limited to the states with known illnesses.” Samples from those infected were collected between May 29 and July 5, and “recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak,” the agency said.Of the two known deaths, one was in Illinois and the other in New Jersey.Many people affected by the outbreak reported to the CDC that they had eaten meat they had sliced at deli counters, at a range of supermarkets and delis.Investigators are still working to determine the specific products that may be contaminated, the agency said Friday. It noted that the most commonly consumed meats were turkey, liverwurst and ham but that there was not enough information to say which deli meats were behind the outbreak.It said there was no evidence to date that people were getting sick from prepackaged deli meats.Listeria is the infection usually caused by eating food contaminated with the Listeria monocytogenes bacterium. While the bacteria are common — living in moist environments, soil, water, decaying vegetation and animals — the infection is rare. It most often occurs in humans through food contamination. People who are pregnant, adults 65 and older, newborns and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk of falling seriously ill from a listeria infection.Foods that are more likely to be contaminated include soft cheeses; premade deli salads; unheated deli meat, cold cuts, hot dogs and fermented or dry sausages; refrigerated pate or meat spreads; cold-smoked fish; raw milk products; sprouts and melons.The first and most common symptoms of listeria infection are diarrhea and vomiting. Those typically begin within 24 hours of eating food contaminated with listeria and usually last one to three days. While unpleasant, these symptoms are not usually considered life-threatening.In serious cases, the bacteria spreads beyond the intestines and is classified as an invasive illness. These symptoms usually start within two weeks. They include fever, flu-like symptoms such as muscle aches and fatigue, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and seizures.About 1 in 6 people with invasive listeriosis who are not pregnant die, according to the CDC. It is the third-leading cause of death from foodborne illness in the United States.Although not typically fatal, invasive illness during pregnancy usually leads to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery or a life-threatening infection for the newborn.Anyone experiencing listeria symptoms should contact a health-care provider.For those at higher risk, the CDC recommends not eating meat that has been sliced at a deli counter unless it is reheated to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit or until steaming hot just before serving.Listeria can also grow on foods kept in the refrigerator and is killed by heating food to a high enough temperature. Recommended practices include cleaning refrigerators, containers and surfaces that may have touched sliced deli meat.Delicatessens should follow Agriculture Department guidelines on controlling listeria."
WaPo_27,Democrats have a record they’re proud of. Biden struggles to sell it.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/20/biden-democrats-trump-policy-communication/,2024-07-20 17:59:03.097922,,"In their private strategy sessions leading up to last month’s debate, President Biden and his advisers homed in on what they saw as one of their most effective political messages against Donald Trump — the administration’s success capping drug prices for millions of seniors, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the preparations.But during the June 27 debate, Biden spent an excruciating 10 seconds searching for the words to explain what his administration had done to lower seniors’ prescription drug costs, before abruptly telling the 51 million viewers: “We finally beat Medicare.” (The president appeared to be trying to say that he had finally defeated the drug companies that had long resisted letting the government negotiate the prices that Medicare paid.)The gaffe represented just one example of a pattern that is fueling the effort to push Biden aside as the Democratic Party’s nominee. Congressional Democrats and the administration believe Biden has major accomplishments to tout and ambitious policy ideas for the next four years. And yet Biden’s intensifying struggles in recent weeks to describe those policies — on abortion, housing, child benefits and more — have cast doubt over his effectiveness as the party’s leading messenger, even beyond the Democratic angst about the debate.“It’s pretty obvious why Democrats are intensely frustrated: They believe they have strong affirmative arguments to make, both in defense of what the administration has done but also what they propose to do — but it’s being totally overshadowed by Biden’s inability to articulate those arguments,” said Bill Galston, who served as a senior aide during Bill Clinton’s administration.Biden’s decades of verbal stumbles are well-documented, and his defenders have blamed some miscues on his lifelong battle with a stutter. Also, his syntax problems come and go. On foreign policy, for instance, the president’s allies say he has a good grasp of the issues. During a July 11 news conference at the conclusion of the NATO summit, Biden gave an accurate overview of the arcane rules of inbound investment into China and domestic concerns about Chinese overproduction in green manufacturing.Stories to keep you informed

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.“Since the debate, thousands of Americans have cheered the President in Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada and across the battlegrounds — not only because his words moved them, but also because his policies touch their lives everyday: whether it’s capping insulin at $35 month for seniors, repairing their bridges and roads, creating millions of union jobs or eliminating exorbitant junk fees,” campaign spokeswoman Lauren Hitt said in a statement. “Joe Biden grew up in Scranton and understands personally what Americans are facing at their kitchen table — and that’s why he has been so effective at delivering results that actually matter to people.”Trump has had his own communication struggles, underscored by a rambling, 92-minute acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention this week, the longest such address in history. The former president skipped over details of his policies and repeatedly went on tangents — giving Democrats hope that they just need to provide a more compelling alternative to win in November.Still, Biden’s repeated struggles to describe his own accomplishments and his goals for a second term have taken on new urgency in a campaign in which he lags behind Trump, according to most public polls. Those struggles have led the White House to carefully manage the president’s public appearances, limiting Democrats’ messaging even as Biden tries to shift discussion away from his age and toward the two parties’ approaches to government. And his stumbles are compounding the frustrations of Democrats who believe they would have a clear advantage over Republicans in a race about policy contrasts — especially if they can put a candidate onstage who can build a case for Democrats’ plans while deconstructing Trump’s.“I believe President Biden must do more to demonstrate he can campaign strong enough to beat Donald Trump,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a statement this month. “Our nominee must be able to articulate what Democrats have accomplished and everything we will do to make life better for American families and protect their freedoms — like making child care affordable and accessible for parents everywhere and restoring abortion rights for women in all 50 states.”Conservatives say replacing Biden with a new candidate to espouse similar policy proposals may not prove sufficient to guarantee Democrats’ success in November, particularly if that replacement could be tied to his record. Harris has been the vice president throughout Biden’s tenure, including the surge in inflation.“The vast majority of voters, especially those who decide elections, are not that ideological ... They’re upset about inflation, and cost of living, and that’s what polls continually show people are concerned about,” said Avik Roy, founder of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, which advocates free markets, and a former adviser to leading GOP policymakers. “It’s not enough to just be articulate in expressing the message -- if your governing background contradicts your message, that’s a problem, too.”Biden has tried to ramp up his campaign after his poor debate performance, but those appearances have brought new headaches. (Since Wednesday, he has been self-isolating in Rehoboth Beach, Del., after testing positive for the coronavirus.)In a speech to the NAACP on Tuesday in Las Vegas, the president previewed a White House policy proposal to strip tax benefits from certain landlords who raise annual rent by more than 5 percent. Democrats view the idea as a populist proposal to win over young voters stressed by high housing costs and a contrast to Trump, a billionaire real estate developer. But Biden mischaracterized the plan.“Look, folks, the idea — the idea that corporate-owned housing is able to raise your rent three, four hundred bucks a month or something — under what I’m about to announce, they can’t raise it more than $55,” Biden said. (Biden’s plan would need congressional approval.)Biden also appeared to run into trouble discussing his plans for drug-price cuts.“It will save taxpayers, just what I did on the first round on deal- — dealing with Medicare. It saves the taxpayer $160 billion — because they don’t have to pay these exorbitant prices to these — anyway, I won’t,” he trailed off in his NAACP speech.Biden’s struggles to explain his efforts to protect abortion access — an issue central to Democrats’ 2024 electoral hopes — also have frustrated allies and supporters. The president, a Catholic who once opposed abortion and often avoids saying the word “abortion” when asked about it, offered a convoluted response when pressed during the debate on legal limits on abortion.“First time is between a woman and a doctor. Second time is between the doctor and an extreme situation. And a third time is between the doctor — I mean, it’d be between the woman and the state,” Biden said.Biden inexplicably veered into talking about immigration in another abortion answer: “Look, there’s so many young women who have been — including a young woman who just was murdered and he went to the funeral. The idea that she was murdered by — by — by an immigrant coming in and [inaudible] talk about that,” the president said, according to the transcript.Reproductive rights activists characterized the comments as a major missed opportunity to draw a contrast with Trump, who appointed three of the five Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade.Taxes are another area where Democrats believe they should have an edge over Trump, who in 2017 signed into law a tax plan that disproportionately benefited the rich.But in an interview with Univision that aired Thursday, Biden veered from a discussion of his pledges to raise taxes on billionaires into comments about the nation’s education system.“Look what’s happening in our schools,” he said, according to a Univision transcript. “What’s happening in schools, all the stuff about gay and lesbian children. Look how they’re being. Anyway. And so many things we could do.”The president then alluded to his expansion of the child tax credit, which lifted millions of families out of poverty and expired at the end of 2021: “Everybody who had a child under, making under $200,000, or if they’re making $200,000, they got, they got a 38 — they got a write-off on their taxes.”Biden’s actions on prescription drugs present a particularly challenging test: His accomplishments can be difficult to explain simply, such as the provision that requires pharmaceutical companies to negotiate the prices of their drugs with Medicare, a long-sought goal for policymakers. But the issues poll well when voters understand them, so Democrats are eager to bring them up.Biden’s drug-pricing wins are “the number one testing proof point that I’ve seen in focus groups that I personally observed,” said a communications strategist at a major Democratic-aligned group, speaking on the condition of anonymity to be candid. “Lots of people said they would rein in Big Pharma; he actually got it done.”But many Americans are unaware of Biden’s efforts, which include capping seniors’ out-of-pocket spending on drug costs at $2,000 per year. About one-quarter of voters said they knew that a federal law would limit out-of-pocket spending on prescriptions for Medicare beneficiaries, according to a poll released in May by KFF, a nonpartisan health-care think tank. Thirty-six percent of voters said they knew that a law required the federal government to negotiate the price of some prescription drugs for Medicare.Leslie Dach, founder of Democrat-aligned advocacy group Protect Our Care, said he was frustrated by Republicans trying to co-opt the drug-pricing issue. He pointed to a video introducing Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) as Trump’s running mate on Wednesday night that suggested that the GOP would help rein in seniors’ drug costs. The claim incensed Dach, because Biden’s drug-price legislation did not receive a single vote from Republicans in Congress.“We have winning issues. But we’re fighting against people who are extending the ‘big lie’ to every part of their campaign,” Dach said. “It’s a communications war.”It’s not clear that Biden is well-equipped to fight it, even with the benefit of a teleprompter.At a speech in Detroit last week, the president again tripped over his explanations about the drug price cuts. “By the way, I got criticized for taking on Medicare — I mean, on — taking on the drug companies and pharma for that. Well — well it’s —,” Biden said, according to the official White House transcript.Toluse Olorunnipa contributed to this report."
WaPo_28,Does ‘compostable’ plastic actually break down? Here’s what to know.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/07/20/compostable-biodegradable-plastic-labels/,2024-07-20 17:59:03.097922,,"“Biodegradable.” “Compostable.” “Plant-based.” “Earth-friendly.”These buzzwords are increasingly appearing on utensils, to-go cups and food containers and other kinds of disposable packaging. While you might think the dizzying array of products could be a simple solution to the growing plastic pollution crisis, experts say you can’t always believe what you read, in part because of fierce disputes over which bioplastics are truly sustainable.“It’s almost the Wild West when it comes to marketing phrases that consumers are exposed to,” said Judith Enck, who served as a senior Environmental Protection Agency official under President Barack Obama and now heads the Beyond Plastics advocacy organization. “There’s real confusion over what is really biodegradable, what is really compostable, what is Earth-friendly.”Here’s what to know.Just trying to define bioplastics might make your head start to spin.Generally, materials are called bioplastics if they are partly or entirely made from plants. Some of these plastics can be broken down through composting or natural processes such as biodegradation, according to a recent report on compostable plastics from Beyond Plastics.But bioplastics don’t always break down in the environment or compost, said Kat Knauer, a polymer scientist and senior researcher at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Compostable plastics are also not all plant-based, she said. They can be made from fossil fuels, but are engineered to eventually break down.“Bioplastics are pretty diverse,” Knauer said. “They’re starting to be more than just the green compostable bag that I think we conventionally used to see.”Here are some common types you might come across:With so many different types of bioplastics, it’s often difficult to parse labels and figure out whether the product you’re buying can fully and safely break down when composted.Knauer recommends looking for items that have been certified as compostable either by the Biodegradable Products Institute, or BPI, or TÜV Austria. BPI is the lead certifier of compostable packaging in the United States, and TÜV Austria runs a certification program owned by the European Bioplastics Association. Some products sold in the United States have TÜV Austria labels that say “OK Compost Industrial” or “OK Compost Home.”But the recent report from Beyond Plastics raised concerns about the regulations and certifications for bioplastics. The report, in part, highlighted worries that BPI-certified compostable products could retain some toxicity and noted that the certifying organization’s board of directors includes executives from U.S. petrochemical companies.Beyond Plastics is urging the EPA to research bioplastics and is calling on the Federal Trade Commission to update and expand its guidance on environmental marketing claims involving these types of plastics. In the meantime, Enck suggested people look for products with other verified independent eco-labels, such as GreenScreen Certified or Cradle to Cradle Certified.BPI pushed back against the report. In a statement, the institute said that its certified products must meet baseline requirements, and that the group “requires compostability tests including strict heavy metals limits, plant toxicity, and biodegradation in compost.”“Claims that BPI’s certification has a conflict of interest due to its Board’s configuration are unfounded,” the institute said, adding that its certification decisions are made entirely by DIN CERTCO, an independent group based in Germany.Be wary if a product is labeled compostable but lacks certifications, Knauer said. You should also avoid putting any of these plastics in your backyard compost unless the label specifies that it can be broken down in home composting setups.Compostable plastic can typically break down only in industrial systems that maintain high temperatures for extended periods of time, said Muhammad Rabnawaz, an associate professor at Michigan State University’s School of Packaging who researches sustainable materials.But not all commercial composters will accept these products. In Oregon, for example, local composters say they generally do not want compostable packaging or serviceware items because the “materials compromise our composting programs and limit many of the environmental benefits of successful composting.” Among the reasons, they noted that not all certified compostable items “will actually compost (break down) as fully or quickly as we need them to.”“The result is a finished compost that is contaminated with bits of partially degraded ‘compostable’ material,” they wrote in a public message. They also raised concerns that some packaging could contain chemicals that transfer into finished compost.The city of Berkeley, Calif., however, does accept compostable products including bags, utensils, cups and containers, as long as they are clearly labeled “compostable” and “BPI-Certified.”“It is incredibly difficult to be an ‘ethical’ consumer and make the most sustainable choices,” Knauer said. “It is so challenging, and especially in the plastic space where things are very confusing in terms of labeling.”It’s critical to learn about your local community’s waste collection system, Knauer said. What is and isn’t recyclable or compostable will vary based on where you are.“Once you have that foundation, then you can start making really educated decisions on what will be the most effective, sustainable packaging for you and your family to use,” she said.Just because a product is compostable or designed to break down naturally doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the most planet-friendly option. Research hasn’t provided conclusive answers, and questions still remain on long-term sustainability, experts said.“There may be innovation in the future, but I would say the jury is still out,” Enck said.Compostable items are also often more expensive, Enck added. Sometimes they can cost up to five times as much as non-compostable alternatives.If you need to buy single-use products such as disposable plates or cups, she suggested considering nonplastic materials, such as paper.It’s also important to prioritize reducing and reusing rather than fixating on the details of what type of material might be better for the planet, Knauer said.Consumers have become dependent on plastics because of their convenience and cheap cost, which does not factor in their environmental impact, Knauer said. Hopefully, she added, we can “move more toward a conscientious world where we are trying to reduce and reuse as much as possible.”"
WaPo_29,Kamala Harris’s first presidential campaign was a failure. Has she changed?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/20/harris-campaign-president-2020-2024/,2024-07-20 17:00:03.097922,,"Kamala D. Harris, who was heralded as the inheritor to Barack Obama’s coalition when she launched her presidential campaign in January 2019, exited the race 10 months later, her aspirations asphyxiated by declining cash, an inability to articulate a cohesive campaign message and a steady patter of departing staffers.As President Biden battles Democratic doubts about his ability to beat Donald Trump after a damaging debate and Trump’s string of legal and political victories, Harris — now the vice president — is again her party’s heir apparent.If she becomes the Democrats’ nominee for president, the first Black, Asian American and female vice president will have to answer questions about her last campaign for the top job, an effort that collapsed before a single ballot was cast. Critics say Harris squandered her considerable potential by mismanaging her 2020 campaign, struggling to project authenticity and stumbling as a candidate.“She was always the dream for us, of the next phase beyond Obama, but she didn’t live up to it because she ran a terrible campaign,” said one Democratic strategist who spoke on the condition of anonymity, referring to 2019.Five years later, Harris’s allies argue, she has improved as a politician and manager. Her boosters say that her 3½ years as Biden’s No. 2 would help her quickly adjust to being thrust atop the ticket, if she finds herself there. They say Democrats should no longer be worried about Harris’s initial stumbles because she has improved how she communicates and shifted how she is perceived.Now, her defenders say, she is a bright spot during a dark moment for Democrats.“You see her becoming more comfortable with being a vice president,” said Bakari Sellers, a former South Carolina state representative and longtime Harris supporter who has also defended Biden as the nominee. “And she now has a team of people around her that have strengthened her, and the stories that are coming out of D.C. are changing. The narrative has changed.”This story is based on interviews with nearly a dozen of Harris’s veteran supporters and aides, who argue that the sour taste left from her presidential campaign has faded, evidenced by a growing number of Democrats who see her as a viable Plan B if Biden exits. Some of these supporters spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly at a critical moment.Harris, through a spokesperson, declined to be interviewed. She has championed Biden since the night of the debate, declaring repeatedly that he is the nominee and she is his running mate and encouraging others to “fight for him.”President @JoeBiden has devoted his life to fighting for the people of our country. In this moment, I know all of us are ready to fight for him. https://t.co/kDUS4AmjYCIf Biden steps aside, an easy coronation for Harris is far from guaranteed. Some Democratic power brokers are mulling an “open convention,” in which the presidential nominee is chosen on the fly. If she’s the nominee after the convention, Harris would face an impassioned GOP that has already intensified its attacks against her.But even with those hurdles, she would be closer to winning the presidency than she ever was in 2019.Harris’s stumbles began shortly after she announced she was seeking the White House.In April 2019, she expressed regret over a policy she championed that prosecutors used to bring charges against the parents of truant children. Prosecutors took parents across the state to court, and some were jailed, though never directly by Harris. The moment highlighted concerns by some Democrats that Harris was a product of an inequitable criminal justice system.By June, as primary opponents like Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) had staked out their positions on a broad range of economic and social policies, Harris struggled to articulate what, exactly, her administration would look like, instead hewing to long-held (and mostly safe) mainstream Democratic positions.During a debate that month, Harris was one of two who raised her hand when moderators asked which candidates would abolish private health insurance. A day later, Harris changed that answer, saying she had misheard the question.In July, her campaign put 35 additional staffers in Iowa and 25 in New Hampshire, following months of criticism that she had not made the two early-voting states a priority. Two months later, she adopted an Iowa-first strategy, hiring 60 more staffers in the state as she dropped behind other candidates in polls.By November, dwindling funds had forced her to retreat at a point when her campaign advisers expected her to be surging. By the next month, her presidential bid was over.Still, supporters say it showcased her potential as a campaigner and her ability to energize a younger, more diverse party powered by women. Biden selected her as his running mate in August 2020, making good on a promise to put a woman on his ticket. In doing so, he anointed Harris as the future of the party.Biden referred to his presidency as the “Biden-Harris” administration from the outset, instead of using solely his name, as previous presidents had done — a vote of confidence in his decades-younger vice president.Still, in her first year in the White House, Harris struggled at times to communicate, including in a Lester Holt interview from Guatemala, where she was dispatched to try to address the root causes of migration. During the interview, she ended up committing to go to America’s southern border, giving oxygen to Republican efforts to tie her to migrant crossings.Harris’s supporters say she is under a more intense microscope than most politicians and certainly most vice presidents, who have often been footnotes in presidential history. Harris entered the history books the moment she was inaugurated as the first woman and the first person of Black and Asian descent to win a nationally elected office.“People expected her to make history every time she walked into a room,” one former staffer said, adding that many of the attacks appeared to be rooted in racism and misogyny. “It was an impossible standard.”Major news organizations carved out lines of coverage centered on the vice president. The Los Angeles Times, her home-state newspaper, tracked her vice-presidential approval ratings. But former staffers say she eventually adjusted to the sometimes searing scrutiny.“Part of (it) is getting comfortable with all the cameras on you all the time,” said one former aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to give a candid analysis. “Even people at that level of the stratosphere have to learn how to get comfortable with it — that everything they say is going to get scrutinized. That people will not be forgiving about the time of day that they’re doing an event. You say something, and suddenly it gets scrutinized at a very high level, in terms of the number of cameras, in terms of the reach.”That scrutiny was perhaps most intense at the end of Harris’s first year as vice president, amid several high-profile staff departures, including her chief spokesperson, her communications director and her chief of staff. The resignations reignited questions about why Harris churns through top-level Democratic employees, an issue that has dogged her for almost all of her time in public service.The drumbeat of unflattering anecdotes took a toll. Some Democrats found her tenure as vice president underwhelming, marked by the messaging struggles and, at one point, near invisibility. It left many uncertain whether she had the force, charisma and skill to win the White House on her own. And some cast about for alternatives to lead the party into the future.Then the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, and Harris’s strategy — and reputation — shifted. She took dozens of trips to Democratic strongholds and battleground states, warning that the Supreme Court decision was an example of Republican overreach that would intensify if voters didn’t send them a message at the ballot box. And Biden’s team increasingly saw her as an important electoral asset, particularly in reaching younger voters and people of color, whose enthusiasm for the president appeared to be slipping.“The highest court in our land — the court of Thurgood and RBG — right? — took a constitutional right that had been recognized from the people of America, from the women of America. And now, we must speak of Roe in the past tense,” she said during a February event in Savannah, in the battleground state of Georgia.Other weaknesses that limited Harris in the 2020 primary have also been addressed, her supporters argue.One attack Biden used against Harris and other Democrats in 2020 was his personal relationships with a wide swath of world leaders, often name-checking them in debates and campaign appearances. But since becoming vice president, Harris has been the keynote speaker at the Munich Security Conference three times, rallying the European continent as Russia invaded Ukraine. She has sought to fortify allies in South Korea, Tokyo and Southeast Asia and to improve conditions in Northern Triangle countries, from which a vast number of immigrants to the United States come.She’s also shaken up her team. The vice president has a new chief of staff, Lorraine Voles, who was the director of communications for then-Vice President Al Gore and former senator Hillary Clinton. There have also been changes among staffers who help shape the vice president’s public image. And Anita Dunn, one of Biden’s closest political strategists, has focused more intensively on the vice president’s schedule and public events.But while supporters say Harris’s handling of the job has improved, she is also benefiting from a changed political landscape — one that is more favorable to her.In 2019, Harris was one of two dozen Democrats who vied for the presidential nomination — jockeying for top talent on their campaigns, cash from donors and, most importantly, voters’ attention. Harris’s story and her role as one of few Black women who have the reached the Senate were powerful symbols. But she was largely unknown nationally. Her campaign staff was filled with California politicos trying to make inroads in communities far removed culturally and geographically from the Golden State.If Harris suddenly becomes the Democrats’ 2024 nominee, she would have the support of the entire Democratic campaign establishment, which is desperate to beat Trump a second time. She has name recognition on par with any national politician, and the Biden-Harris campaign has already raised nearly a quarter-billion dollars that would flow to her.“The party and the structure of the party will all do the same to get behind her,” the Democratic strategist said. “So it’s not going to be about her, really. There’s no time for her to decide what the campaign looks like. That’s not going to happen. What is going to happen in this campaign for five months — it’s already been laid out.”Chelsea Janes, Isaac Arnsdorf and Paul Kane contributed to this report."
WaPo_30,Which books should be considered classics? Our readers have thoughts.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/07/20/classic-novels-new-list/,2024-07-20 18:59:02.965145,,"When we asked readers of the Book Club newsletter which classic books are overrated and which unsung novels should be considered top-tier, we didn’t predict the level of enthusiasm that would accompany the responses. Hundreds of people wrote in with very strong feelings about Holden Caulfield and Leopold Bloom, along with impassioned pleas to add novels by Percival Everett and Amor Towles to the literary canon. Here’s a selection of reader responses.“The Catcher in the Rye,” by J.D. SalingerAmong our respondents, this 1951 novel elicited the most — and most merciless — complaints. Much of the grumbling revolved around Holden Caulfield, a character whom multiple readers labeled “whiny.” “I refuse to call Caulfield a protagonist because he wasn’t ‘pro’ anything, save perhaps his own self-created misery,” Elizabeth Coleman wrote. “It has been decades since I suffered through it; perhaps I’d perceive the book differently now. However, I feel no obligation to take that risk; there are too many potentially wonderful books waiting to be read for the first time.”“The Great Gatsby,” by F. Scott Fitzgerald“Gatsby” didn’t inspire the level of indignation that Holden did, but a number of respondents felt that it lacked substance. According to reader Daniel McMahon, the novel is “filled with unlikable and despicable characters from such an incredibly narrow swath of American life. Humorless, joyless and intellectually pedestrian, this novel is not just overrated — it’s not good. It is the Emperor’s New Clothes of novels that ‘beats on’ because it is so endlessly assigned and students are told it is a classic. I suppose if one has read only 10 novels in one’s life (or high school career) that it might seem to be the best of those.”Everything by Ernest HemingwayWhile we fielded specific grievances about “The Sun Also Rises,” “The Old Man and the Sea” and “A Farewell to Arms,” quite a few readers wanted to relegate everything Hemingway ever wrote (“right down to the grocery lists”). “He attempts to dig for emotional depth and gives up after half an inch,” Sarah Miller wrote. “I do not get the unending praise for his work.”“Moby-Dick,” by Herman MelvilleIt was perhaps inevitable that this protracted and frequently assigned title would make the list. For some, reader Staci Sturrock’s fickle relationship with the novel may be more interesting than the novel itself. It all started in high school, decades ago, when a teacher assigned it even though, at 17, she “had zero hope of appreciating it, nay, even understanding it.” But maybe, she reasoned, as an adult she would finally understand Melville’s brilliance. “I revisited it last month and was so in LOVE with the language, characters and plot for the first third that I was heralding its brilliance from my own personal crow’s nest, telling my husband, friends, even my hairdresser that they HAD to read it,” she wrote. “Boy, was I proud of myself. ‘Look at me, I’m voluntarily reading “Moby-Dick” and enjoying it!’ Then I entered the murky, dense chapters on whaling history, whale behavior, the whaling trade, blah blah blah blubber blubber. That’s enough whale facts. I’m done. I went back and told everyone I was wrong, don’t bother.”“Ulysses,” by James Joyce“A mess.” “Chaos.” “Incoherent scribblings.” These are but a few of the descriptions readers had for Joyce’s experimental novel. “As a graduate student I was forced to read this book, which entailed my having to buy a 250-page book to....TRANSLATE IT!,” William J. Raabe wrote. “Now it quickly became obvious that Joyce was a linguistic genius. There were several examples of his writing a phrase which actually was a pun in more than one language. I’m sure if you were fluent in a number of languages, especially the classics, you thought this was great. However, to think that the ‘above-average’ English major needed a translation to read a work supposedly written in the English language and then label it the greatest work of all(!) is ludicrous!”“The Scarlet Letter,” by Nathaniel HawthorneReaders dinged this 1850 novel for being both melodramatic and dull. “Call me a skeptic (and a lapsed Catholic), but other people’s adulterous sins, writ large over hundreds of pages, lost my interest a long time ago,” wrote Mark Haviland, who was forced to read the book in high school and college. “Also, to paraphrase Monty Python, the Puritans are an ‘insufferable lot’ and not the best part of our history.”“Infinite Jest,” by David Foster WallaceIt turns out that if you’ve started this novel three times and never finished it (um, hypothetically), you’re not alone. Though, for better or worse, reader Harris Factor was not among the quitters: “Early on I realized that this would be a slog but I was swayed by all the glowing reviews and plowed my way through to the end. After more than 1,000 pages I concluded that I had wasted a lot of time and mental energy on a book that just wasn’t very good.”“To Kill a Mockingbird,” by Harper LeeWhile many readers wanted to remove this classic from the canon, Matthew Martin’s reasoning was especially thoughtful: “I love this book, but it has long since ceased to be a book. It’s a totem for a certain type of blinkered, well-meaning reader who reveres it not for the delicacy of its sentences, but as the ultimate expression of how just one upstanding White person can save Black people from racism. This book is, for a lot of folks, the end point of a lot of thinking about some very complex and difficult topics.”A few dishonorable mentions: “A Confederacy of Dunces,” by John Kennedy Toole (“A handsome senior recommended this to me in high school and 18 years later, I still have not forgiven him for wasting my time”); the Bible (“misogynistic historical fiction that millions believe is factual history”); “Lolita,” by Vladimir Nabokov (“prurience for the aged male academic”); and Ayn Rand’s “Atlas Shrugged” (“a hideously written clunker”).“True Grit,” by Charles PortisThere was less consensus in the “classics to add” category, but a number of readers wrote that this 1968 western deserves serious consideration. “Recommending it, you often get a quizzical look,” Brendle Wells wrote, “but it truly is one of the great American novels for its portrayal of the American West, the American mindset and for the characters, especially Mattie Ross, who is a heroine for the ages. And that writing … I could go on and on, but that would be in direct opposition to the tight, perfect prose.”“A Gentleman in Moscow,” by Amor TowlesMultiple readers waxed poetic about this 2016 bestseller, including Juanita Stein: “A perfect combination of historical novel, clever plot and a main character who is forced to find a purpose to his life in unexpected ways. Add a dash of mystery and intrigue, humor and brilliant observations about humanity, and you have what I consider to be the perfect novel.”“A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,” by Betty SmithA number of the novels that readers recommended are already considered classics, including George Eliot’s “Middlemarch,” Zora Neale Hurston’s “Their Eyes Were Watching God” and Willa Cather’s “My Ántonia.” “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn” feels on the cusp, if it’s not already there, but Kimberley Laws makes such an excellent case for the novel, we had to include it: “In a world in which little girls long to be princesses, wear flouncy gowns and inhabit dreamy castles, this book offers a much-needed dose of reality. Francie Nolan lives in Brooklyn, surrounded by poverty. Her father is a drunk and her mother works her fingers to the bone to support her kids. But Francie finds joy in the little things — the people she loves and life’s simple pleasures. While few will ever achieve the fairy tale ending depicted in princess stories, all of us will face adversity. This is why Smith’s message is so poignant. Girls need to know that their happiness does not rely on their looks, a knight in shining armor, or any of the trappings of a Disney-esque ‘happily ever after.’ Happiness is a choice that comes from within.”“Kindred,” by Octavia E. ButlerReaders called out Butler’s “Parable of the Sower” as well as this 1979 science fiction novel. “A masterpiece of character development, with complex themes, compelling plot, and clear yet poignant prose,” Melanie Shoffner wrote. “I’ve read — and taught — it multiple times and find more to consider each time. A work of fiction, yes, but its insight into the historical roots of American race, gender and socioeconomic issues offers much to consider now — yet it is still a fantastic story, not a treatise on U.S. issues. Everyone should read this — and I never make that proclamation lightly!”“The Dispossessed,” by Ursula K. Le GuinA number of Le Guin’s books were proclaimed masterpieces. As for “The Dispossessed,” Cheryl Glover wrote: “It removes you from the here and now and takes you to another place, another world, where you are free to explore life without the usual social constraints. Science fiction allows us to do that. Ease into another reality where things are different but they still work. This book challenges us to think about what we value, not about money or stuff, but about ourselves. I keep coming back to it and every time I get more out of it. It is critically acclaimed but I doubt many people have read it.”“Ceremony,” by Leslie Marmon SilkoLark Hammond wasn’t the sole reader to offer up this new classic, but the former prep school English teacher was the only one to supply us with a tempting comparative lit assignment. “This book is a challenging read, stylistically — a real tour de force — and the payoff is amazing,” Hammond wrote. “Silko weaves together very real post-war (World War II) PTSD sufferers, traditional myths of the Laguna Pueblo people, shamanic experiences and a plot that illustrates a vision of good and evil that compares most intriguingly with the Christian vision of good and evil developed in Milton’s ‘Paradise Lost.’”Everything by Percival EverettReaders recommended Everett’s entire bibliography, singling out “The Trees,” which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. A handful of readers also noted that his most recent novel, “James,” which revisits the plot of “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” from the perspective of Jim, should be taught alongside Mark Twain’s classic.“The Dollmaker,” by Harriette ArnowThis 1955 National Book Award nominee had several fans. “It describes presciently what we now understand as the hollowing out of the human spirit wrought by our belief that earning money to spend is the ultimate meaning of life,” Ronni Lundy wrote. “Perhaps if Arnow had been a man — maybe one named Steinbeck? — we’d have lifted this book to the top of the American canon long ago.”A few honorable mentions: The U.S.A Trilogy by John Dos Passos (“an engrossing snapshot of the chaos, dreams and inequities of a nation on the rise”); “Hamnet,” by Maggie O’Farrell (“a gripping story that leaves you heartbroken and with a changed perspective”); “The Memory Police,” by Yoko Ogawa (“a simple, perfect portrayal of a selfless soul”)."
WaPo_31,Teens and parents have wildly different views on kids’ support needs,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/07/20/teens-social-emotional-support-parents/,2024-07-20 18:30:02.965145,,"Adolescents and teens are less than half as likely as their parents to say they always receive the emotional and social support they need, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report suggests, with less than 30 percent of young people in a survey reporting that they always have such support.The analysis, released last week, draws on data gathered by the National Health Interview Survey, which queries a representative sample of U.S. residents. Nearly 1,200 adolescents ages 12-17 and some 4,400 parents were interviewed between July 2021 and December 2022.When teens were asked how often they get the social and emotional support they need, 27.5 percent said “always,” 31 percent said “usually,” 12.5 percent said “rarely” and 7.4 percent said “never.”But 76.9 percent of parents said their teenage children always have the support they need. The disconnect might reflect survey differences, parents’ unwillingness to answer sensitive questions negatively for an interviewer or differing ideas of what social and emotional support means, the researchers write.Overall, boys were likelier to report higher levels of perceived support, and teens under 15 were more likely to say they always or usually got such support than older teens.Black and Hispanic teens were less likely than their White counterparts to say they had enough support. Sexual- or gender-minority teens also reported getting less support than their counterparts. Teens whose parents had a bachelor’s degree or higher and whose families had higher incomes were likelier to report they always or usually get enough support. So were teenagers who live in nonmetropolitan areas and the Northeast.The teens who said they had enough support were less likely to have health problems, depression and low sleep quality than their peers with less support, the researchers write.The researchers call for ongoing research into the quality and types of support teens are given."
WaPo_32,CrowdStrike outage resurfaces debunked Trump conspiracy theory,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/20/crowdstrike-conspiracy-theory-trump-russia-dnc/,2024-07-20 18:05:02.965145,,"When the booming Austin-based cybersecurity company CrowdStrike made headlines this week for causing a calamitous global outage, the response was quick and sharp from some supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.They recalled that when he was president, Trump had blamed CrowdStrike for an alleged Democratic coverup in Ukraine, a narrative that was broadly debunked at the time but showed itself to still have legs. On social media Friday, fresh conspiracy theories blossomed about how and why the company triggered so much news in the immediate wake of Trump accepting the Republican nomination Thursday night.There has been no evidence to suggest any link between the outage and the Republican National Convention. CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said a defect in an update —  not a cyberattack —  caused the worldwide mess, grounding thousands of flights, disrupting 911 calls and delaying hospital procedures.But the global woe brought unexpected new life to a conspiracy theory involving Russia, Ukraine and the Democratic National Committee that took up considerable oxygen during Trump’s presidency and figured prominently in his first impeachment inquiry.CrowdStrike then seemed an unlikely candidate for political controversy. Founded in 2011 by two former McAfee executives, the company sells cybersecurity software to Fortune 500 companies and federal and state agencies. Its first product, Falcon, an update of which was cited for Friday’s outage, detects security breaches in Windows or Mac computers. The company also advises clients on how to improve their cybersecurity.Stories to keep you informed

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.After a 2019 initial public offering, CrowdStrike cracked into the S&P 500 last month, a landmark the company said it had reached faster than any other cybersecurity firm.While hawking its corporate services, CrowdStrike made its name investigating prominent hacks. In 2015, CrowdStrike linked a cyberattack on Sony Pictures to North Korea. The same year, it said it had evidence that hackers linked to China’s government may have tried to violate a U.S.-China agreement to hold off on economic espionage against one another.CrowdStrike got embroiled in politics in 2016, when it was hired by the Democratic National Committee to investigate the hacking of DNC computers a year earlier. The company concluded it had “high confidence” that a unit linked to Russia’s military intelligence arm was responsible for the attack.Trump repeatedly asserted that Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in the election, a view that alarmed some of his aides, concerned  that he might have been influenced by Russia. The Washington Post reported in 2019 that a former senior White House official recalled that Trump said he knew Ukraine was the real culprit because “Putin told me.”In a phone call in July 2019 that became a key part of the evidence in Trump’s first impeachment, the then-president urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate both former vice president Joe Biden and CrowdStrike. “I would like you to do us a favor,” he said. “… I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike …”The House Intelligence Committee’s Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry report reflected that multiple Trump aides had tried to disabuse him of the notion. Trump’s former Russia expert Fiona Hill told the committee that former homeland security adviser Tom Bossert and former national security adviser H.R. McMaster repeatedly told Trump that the CrowdStrike conspiracy theory was “completely ‘debunked,’ and that allegations Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. election are false.”In response to the conspiracy theories, CrowdStrike published an extensive Q&A in 2020 about its investigation of the DNC hack. It said that it had “proof” that Russia hacked the DNC and that its analysis was confirmed by other security companies such as Fidelis and FireEye, as well as U.S. intelligence.Social media posts on Friday reflected that the CrowdStrike controversy was still well and alive among a section of the public.“Today is not the first time that CrowdStrike has caused huge misery for the country, and even the world,” Hans Mahncke, a YouTube commentator, wrote in a post on X that drew thousands of likes, saying CrowdStrike’s report on the DNC hack had led to a “witch hunt” and “the criminalization of diplomacy with Russia.”Max Blumenthal, editor of the independent website Grayzone, which has faced criticism for misleading reports, on X called CrowdStrike “the shady firm hired by the DNC to find Russia responsible for hacking its server,” and former CBS correspondent Lara Logan said CrowdStrike had been “lying for years.”On X, Facebook and other social media platforms, hundreds of others of users piped up with fresh criticism of CrowdStrike’s 2016 report on the DNC, with some calling it a “hoax” and others speculating about whether the company could help to “steal” the upcoming election. “CrowdStrike and DNC criminality are intertwined,” one wrote. “The rot is deeper than any of you know,” another remarked. “It’s all connected,” wrote a third user.More general misinformation about the outage was circulating on social media, including an image that purported to show the Microsoft error message across the Las Vegas Sphere. Snopes.com published a fact check on the photo on Friday, calling it fake."
WaPo_33,"Lack of motive in Trump attack frustrates public, but fits a pattern",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/20/trump-shooter-motive-fbi-investigation/,2024-07-20 18:00:02.965145,,"In the week since the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, details have emerged about sniper positions and Secret Service agents, witnesses and warnings.But the answer to the biggest question remains elusive: Why?So far, investigators say, they have found little evidence of an ideology driving the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old nursing home aide who was killed at the scene. The information gleaned from his phone, family and friends doesn’t offer a motive, national security analysts say, and the absence of a quick explanation has left room for the rapid-fire spread of partisan and conspiratorial theories shaping how millions of Americans view the attack.Barring a breakthrough in the investigation, Crooks appears poised to join a string of high-profile attackers with no discernible ideological driver, or with influences from a mixed bag of beliefs. That outcome is frustrating for a nation struggling to make sense of the event, analysts say, but it fits into a pattern of bloody episodes that defy categorization along a traditional left-right spectrum.“It’s hard, because when you go after a political target, you do assume political motive,” said Daniel Byman, a terrorism researcher the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a national security think tank.Investigators haven’t produced evidence showing an ideological motive that meets official definitions of terrorism, Byman and other analysts say. Authorities typically explore other theories, too, including mental illness or a quest for notoriety. The lack of conclusive findings has been difficult to accept for many Trump supporters, who have embraced the idea that he was targeted by an enemy of the MAGA movement — a claim repeated this week by speakers at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.Since the shooting, conspiracy theories have proliferated — on the right and left — as every aspect of the incident is examined by self-appointed sleuths. The scraps of information released so far have been spun into elaborate hypotheses involving Biden administration coverups, foreign plots and demonic spirits.“It’s very unsatisfying, psychologically, to say, ‘Stuff happens and we don’t know why,” Byman said, adding that without a motive, “people fill the void with their own conspiracy theories that increase polarization and decrease trust in institutions.”Attacks without clear motivation aren’t unusual and have increased, researchers say, in part as a reflection of the ideologies that swirl together on social media and gaming platforms, creating a toxic soup of grievances with no cohesive political agenda. Authorities have cited unclear or overlapping beliefs in recent plots or violence where, for example, white nationalism melded with misogynistic “incel” subcultures, or when a member of a satanic neo-Nazi group invoked Islamist militancy in what the Justice Department called a “a diabolical cocktail of ideologies.”In 2022, an attack on Paul Pelosi, husband of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), was carried out by a hammer-wielding man who had been involved in nudist activism and Green Party support before more recent racist rhetoric and expressions of hatred toward Democrats, according to analysts who have studied his writings. As with Trump’s would-be assassin, extremists and partisans quickly stepped in to exploit the vacuum where a clear-cut motive would be.The deadliest recent example was the 2017 mass shooting at a country music festival in Las Vegas that killed 60 people and injured hundreds. To this day, it’s unclear precisely why 64-year-old Stephen Paddock opened fire on concertgoers. The FBI has released a trove of documents that showed he had a serious gambling habit but never declared a motivation for the rampage. Paddock killed himself before authorities reached him.Aaron Rouse, who led the FBI’s Las Vegas office when it investigated the attack, said the public should be patient while investigators pursue every possible lead, which will probably take months.“As a society, we’re kind of preprogrammed for a TV culture that there’s an event, then a resolution, and it has to make sense,” Rouse said. “People have to have patience and realize there’s not a grand cabal behind every event.”During the Las Vegas probe, Rouse said, he was surprised to learn from FBI officials who study mass shootings that roughly 20% of the time, a gunman doesn’t want anyone to know their motive or reasons.“Some of them don’t provide a manifesto or a recording,” Rouse said. “They don’t tell people, and that’s what we had in Las Vegas, and it was incredibly maddening.” Rouse’s team eventually concluded that the gunman was a person with a troubled past who didn’t handle disappointment well.Authorities say Crooks fired an AR-style rifle at Trump from a rooftop outside the rally security perimeter, killing one person in the crowd and critically injuring two others. He was then fatally shot by the Secret Service. Trump was injured, emerging from the attack with a bloodied ear.FBI agents combing through the details of Crooks’s life have found little in the way of ideology or politics to explain his attempt to kill Trump just days before the former president again became his party’s White House nominee. Crooks had conducted online searches for information related to Trump and Biden, and had photos of both men saved on his phone, according to lawmakers and others briefed on the investigation.Investigators have also determined that the gunman visited the site of Trump’s rally nearly a week in advance, those people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss details that have not been made public by the FBI.According to state records, Crooks was registered as a Republican, though campaign finance records show that someone with his name and street address gave $15 to the Progressive Turnout Project, a Democratic voter-turnout organization, in January 2021.In addition to Trump and Biden, the shooter had photos of Attorney General Merrick Garland and a member of the British royal family saved on his phone, two people familiar with the probe said. He had searched for information about major depressive disorder, the rally in Butler, Pa., and the Democratic National Convention scheduled for August. The gunman also searched online for information about teenage mass shooter Ethan Crumbley and his parents, according to a person familiar with a briefing law enforcement officials gave to lawmakers earlier this week.“He had a range finder and a backpack,” Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) said after a briefing Wednesday, in a statement that called for Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle to step down.With no signs of a political motive or a foreign element, investigators are focusing on the psychology of the gunman. But there, too, there is not much to go on, other than that he had searched the internet for information about depression.While many have assumed the motives behind Saturday’s shooting were rooted in the heated rhetoric of a presidential campaign, a 1997 Secret Service study of American assassins and would-be assassins of public figures found that “attackers and near-lethal approachers of public officials rarely had ‘political’ motives.”Karl Schmae, a retired FBI supervisory agent, said the most relevant comparison to Crooks may be John Hinckley Jr., who tried to assassinate President Ronald Reagan in 1981.Before that shooting outside a Washington hotel, Hinckley had stalked President Jimmy Carter. Investigators concluded he wanted to shoot a president to try to impress an actress.“John Hinckley was a troubled guy and he just wanted notoriety,” Schmae said. “There was nothing in particular about Reagan other than killing him would make Hinckley famous.”Given the level of security around a former president and the mode of attack, Crooks surely knew he was embarking on a suicide mission, said Gina Ligon, who leads a federally funded terrorism research center at the University of Nebraska at Omaha and has written extensively about political violence.“It certainly looks like someone who didn’t necessarily want to survive the attack,” Ligon said, but who sought “to do it in a way that’s remembered.”Ligon said there were still too many unanswered questions to conclude that Crooks fit the profile of a “lone wolf,” a term that some researchers criticize as overlooking the role of online networks in radicalizing people to violence.“Nobody acts alone — except the Unabomber,” she said.Ligon and other analysts pointed to Crooks’s use of an AR-style rifle, his T-shirt from a brand popular in gun circles and the homemade explosive devices authorities discovered in his car and home as indicators of influences from a wider “ecosystem.”Ana Velitchkova, a sociologist at the University of Mississippi who studies political violence, said what little is publicly known about Crooks meshes with research suggesting that attacks are more likely under certain conditions, such as when individuals “hone their violent skills.” The gunman was a member of the Clairton Sportsmen’s Club, a shooting club in Clairton, Pa., which through an attorney has condemned the attack as a “senseless act of violence.”With so few clues, “we might never know what exactly triggered Crooks to shoot at Donald Trump,” Velitchkova said in an emailed response to questions.“Nothing in Crooks’s reported profile seems out of the ordinary: no extremist ideology, no mental health issues, no struggles at school, no family issues,” she said. “Instead, Crooks appears to have been a ‘normal’ young man in today’s America.”Perry Stein contributed to this report."
WaPo_34,"GOP called for unity as it continued to feature far-right figures, ideas",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/20/republican-convention-far-right-immigration-transgender/,2024-07-20 18:00:02.965145,,"The Republican nominee for governor of North Carolina has said that acceptance  of gay people would help bring civilization’s end, that transgender people should be arrested for their choice of bathrooms and that “some people need killing.”But when Mark Robinson took the stage during prime time at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this week, he told stories of his hardscrabble youth and encouraged his audience to believe in the American Dream of economic uplift.“There is hope,” Robinson said to loud cheers. “And I am proof.”The Milwaukee convention, say party leaders from Donald Trump on down, was all about unity, bringing the country together days after the former president narrowly missed being assassinated. And in some of the speeches, there was evidence of a toned-down approach, with figures who normally trade in divisive and conspiracy-fueled rhetoric making gestures toward more inclusive themes. The convention came as the Trump campaign touted the GOP as a party for all, and attempted to expand the electoral map.But the gathering also underscored how speakers with views once considered fringe have seeped into the conservative mainstream. Researchers who study far-right movements say their prominence reflects the scope of radicalism that courses through the party and is likely to inform a second Trump presidency should he win in November.“Extremism is currency,” said professor John Horgan, director of the Violent Extremism Research Group at Georgia State University. “There’s no good political or strategic reason to root it out when it is a shortcut to ensuring political engagement. It mobilizes followers, generates funds, and effectively demonizes the other side.”From the opening night of the convention, appeals for restraint  have mixed uneasily with far more combative language, including  chants of, “Fight! Fight! Fight!” — Trump’s words when he reappeared, bloodied, after the attack Saturday.Analysts say a stew of extreme ideologies simmers under the softer image the RNC projected this week of a party that would make room for any MAGA-style patriot, whether a rap-world model or a Nicaraguan immigrant or a Sikh attorney. And despite efforts to mute the most extreme rhetoric, hostility has still bubbled up, with speakers winning applause for verbal attacks on transgender people  and migrants, among others.Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) focused his speech on violence committed by undocumented immigrants and accused Democrats of allowing them into the country to gain votes, a theory unsubstantiated by the facts.“Every day, Americans are dying — murdered, assaulted, raped by illegal immigrants that the Democrats have released,” he said. Delegates held up signs reading “Mass Deportation Now.”Robinson, a rising GOP star who’s in a tight race for governor of North Carolina, has a history of anti-LGBTQ+ language and Christian nationalism. He drew outrage for a speech at a church last month in which he said, “Some people need killing.” Mike Lonergan, Robinson’s campaign spokesman, said on X that the candidate’s words referenced World War II enemies and were taken out of context in a “gutless and dishonest smear.”Speaking the same night was Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who has promoted far-right ideologies including White nationalism, Christian nationalism, Islamophobia and various conspiracy theories. Greene has said that if she had led the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, “it would’ve been armed” and “we would have won.” At the RNC, she ridiculed Democrats for observing Transgender Visibility Day, for allowing  “millions of illegal aliens to pour in” and for failing to provide “unity.”Charlie Kirk, head of the influential right-wing student group Turning Point USA, was also given a prominent speaking slot. Kirk promotes a Christian nationalist  movement that seeks religious influence in all aspects of government and society. When he spoke to the convention, he stuck mostly to economic anxieties among young Americans.In a brief interview on the floor of the convention Wednesday, Kirk said that appeals for unity do not conflict with repeated calls from Republicans to “Fight, fight, fight.” “We’re rallying to his immediate rallying cry. It also means that we’re not going to give up, that we’re going to continue to push forward,” Kirk said. “We’re going to continue to organize and we’re not going to allow President Trump getting shot to ruin our movement.”Spokespeople for the RNC did not return messages seeking comment.The  delegates who announced the vote tallies for Trump that preceded his official nomination included GOP figures with extremist ties. Idaho’s Dorothy Moon, for example, ran a letter-writing campaign for a militia group leader who was involved in an armed standoff with federal agents. Another delegation head, Arizona’s Shelby Busch, recently told a gathering that she would “lynch” a Jewish county official she has been critical of, later describing the phrase as “political hyperbole.”The Washington Post  reported that Republicans involved with the convention included several who were present for the rally and  attack on the U.S. Capitol. Ed Martin, the deputy policy director of the convention platform committee, was in the mob outside the Capitol. At least three other people photographed in the crowd that day are serving as delegates.Although both Democrats and Republicans engage in political mudslinging, observers say there is a fundamental difference — especially during the Trump era.“I agree with the call to bring down the temperature. But the fact of the matter is, where the temperature is really high is on the far right and with figures” including convention headliners, said Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the nonprofit Global Project Against Hate and Extremism. “It’s not a normal thing to hear Democrats talking about televised military tribunals or going after your enemies or killing people.”Within the convention, White supremacist or anti-government symbols of the sort that are sometimes visible at Trump rallies were scarce among attendees, though one woman sported a dress designed like an “Appeal to Heaven” flag, which is associated with Christian nationalism and political violence. All week, far-right provocateurs such as Benny Johnson and Laura Loomer roamed the halls and posted on social media.Trump “blew me a kiss from the stage,” Loomer, a self-described White nationalist and Islamophobe, boasted alongside a video showing Trump sending her an air kiss and exchanging pleasantries after his speech.Texas delegate Adolpho Telles, 74, noted that the gathering also featured more establishment Republican figures, such as former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, along with some surprise appearances that were interpreted as gestures toward national unity.“We had a Teamster union boss here, and that just floored me,” said Telles, a retired accountant. “I didn't expect that.”Telles said he didn’t think calls for unity and the chants of “Fight, fight, fight” sent contradictory messages, explaining that Republicans were not calling for literal combat.“A physical fight — that’s never accepted, okay?” he said. “But when we have fights, and if I disagree with you, we’re going to have discussions and maybe we walk away agreeing not to agree. But that’s okay, too.”In the buzz over Trump’s arrival at the RNC on Monday — his first public event since the attack — cameras skimmed over a familiar face sitting in the same row as the former president.Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host, was ousted last year but still occupies a powerful perch in the conservative movement. Beirich, the extremism monitor, said Carlson was arguably the single biggest catalyst for mainstreaming the great replacement theory, which imagines the engineered replacement of White Christian Americans.The ideology has inspired mass shootings, including the 2019 attack on shoppers at a Walmart in El Paso that killed 23 and injured dozens.Carlson’s Thursday night speaker slot at the RNC sent an alarming message, said Freddy Cruz, a program manager at Western States Center, an anti-extremism watchdog group.“It’s essentially giving a green light to a lot of these ideas,” Cruz said. “This isn’t simply a conspiracy theory when you’re talking about the great replacement theory. This has had real-world consequences.”Trump himself has a history of disparaging Black and Hispanic people, Muslims, women, and many other groups.  His running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), also has espoused far-right talking points, playing down the seriousness of the Capitol attack and using replacement theory language in statements about immigration.Trump’s address Thursday was anticipated  as a barometer for the GOP’s seriousness about dialing back the heat. The former president  told an interviewer after the shooting that he was overhauling the “humdinger” of a speech he initially planned to deliver and instead was thinking about it as “a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together.”Beirich said the messages of Trump and his allies at the RNC and on the Truth Social platform don’t point to  a different tack  — only more bombast and conspiratorial thinking.“They’ve changed our culture,” Beirich said of the MAGA movement’s impact. “They’ve coarsened it, racialized it, and heightened discussions about political violence in a way that was unacceptable before.”Republican appeals for unity after the assassination attempt arrived so abruptly that some convention speakers struggled to keep up.Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said he’d quickly rewritten remarks to align with the healing theme, but then the older version of his speech was loaded into the teleprompter.That, he explained to PBS, was why his intended message of “unity” instead accused Democrats of posing “a clear and present danger to America, to our institutions, our values and our people.”A common refrain among speakers was that issues shouldn’t be viewed as red or blue but “red, white and blue.” But GOP speakers also promised mayhem if Democrats continue to lead.West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Trump family friend who appeared onstage with his bulldog, Babydog, painted a dire picture: “We become totally unhinged if Donald Trump is not elected in November.”Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) warned that the radical left seeks to tear down American values and “remold us into some sort of borderless, lawless, Marxist, socialist utopia.”“We’re here to say: Not on our watch,” Johnson told the RNC.Perhaps the most conciliatory message came from Haley, who said Trump invited her to speak “in the name of unity.”In addition to calling on the nation to come together, Haley encouraged the GOP to expand its ranks, a direct challenge to far-right party leaders fomenting hostility toward marginalized communities.“We are stronger when we welcome people into our party with different backgrounds and experiences,” Haley told the crowd.Behind the scenes, an attempt to do that was backfiring. The previous day, Harmeet Dhillon, a California Republican official, had delivered a Sikh prayer from the convention podium with a scarf draped loosely around her head.Some Republicans celebrated the moment as a refreshing showcase of GOP diversity. But some in the party’s hard-right Christian base accused Dhillon of positioning her faith as worshiping “the one true god,” a slight to Christianity.As Haley was onstage urging the crowd to embrace a big-tent Republican vision, Dhillon was on the receiving end of bigoted online attacks from fellow conservatives Across social media, pro-Trump commenters blasted her “satanic chants” and “witchcraft,” calling her a “pagan blasphemer” and demanding her deportation. Dhillon is a U.S. citizen.Again and again, she posted the same reply on X, “There is only one God.” Her supporters also pushed back, touting Dhillon’s service as a legal adviser on Trump’s 2020 campaign and her involvement in Women for Trump.Still, the attacks continued. The “unity” theme hadn’t stuck.“Blocking quite a few people,” an apparently exasperated Dhillon wrote on X.Wingett Sanchez and Marley reported from Milwaukee."
WaPo_35,School turned him liberal. His mom loves Fox News. Will their bond survive?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/interactive/2024/indoctrination-schools-student-political-views-change/,2024-07-20 18:00:02.965145,,"ITHACA, N.Y. — Two nights before he was supposed to graduate from college, Mike Lindgren called his mother with a warning.
Jennifer Lindgren, 53, was packing her pink suitcase for an early-morning flight from her home outside Chicago to Ithaca College in Upstate New York. In her son’s four years at the liberal arts school, she had never visited.
“Mom, this is the heart of liberal America,” Mike said into his iPhone, urging her to tread cautiously as she navigated his deep-blue college town. “You gotta be careful.”
Mike was half-joking, but only half. He and his conservative mother agree on almost nothing. She is a fervent Donald Trump supporter; he plans to vote for independent presidential candidate Cornel West this fall. She believes the events of Jan. 6, 2021, were staged by the government; he calls that day a violent insurrection. She is a former police officer, protective of law enforcement; he believes much of American policing is systemically racist.
It wasn’t always this way.
For much of his childhood, Mike said, he parroted his mother’s right-wing opinions without question, in line with the rest of their immediate family, which mostly leaned right. But after Mike failed several classes as a freshman in public high school, Jennifer sent him to the Leelanau School, a private boarding school in Michigan that promised a hands-on, “inclusive” approach to learning. There, surrounded by teachers and classmates he described as liberal, Mike said he grew more curious about his peers’ worldviews — and correspondingly less sure of his own. By the time he matriculated at Ithaca College, he was leaning left, he said. Living on campus solidified the shift. He would graduate college feeling closest, politically, to the Democratic Socialists of America, which aims to abolish capitalism in the United States.
Both Mike and his mother saw his education as the culprit — in different ways. Jennifer, a former patrol officer, came to believe the teachers and classmates at Mike’s private school influenced him to adopt viewpoints at odds with her own.
“He was indoctrinated,” she said.
But Mike decided the “indoctrination” he underwent actually took place at home, fueled by his family’s diet of Fox News, Trump speeches and Alex Jones. What his boarding school did, Mike said, was “counter-indoctrination”: It showed him there was more than one way to see things, leaving him the power to choose.
Early this year, Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson sent a questionnaire to students nationwide asking whether and how their views changed because of something they learned in school. From nearly 200 submissions, she selected Mike Lindgren, who wrote that he developed left-leaning views in high school, leading to tension with his conservative mother, Jennifer. With the Lindgrens’ permission, Natanson spent half a year following the pair, checking in by phone, over Zoom and through an in-person visit.
The story aims to reflect one family’s personal experiences with education at a fraught political moment, as well as a mother and son’s efforts to bridge an ideological gap with love. When Natanson finished reporting and writing the story, she reviewed the facts in it with Mike and Jennifer Lindgren to ensure accuracy and to make them aware of all the details being revealed.
Mike’s education took place amid a swelling national debate over what and how schools should teach about race, history, sex, gender and faith. Between his senior years of high school and college, legislators in red states passed nearly 80 laws restricting what educators can say about race, sexual orientation and gender identity, a Washington Post analysis found. And the summer of Mike’s college graduation, Oklahoma started requiring that all schools teach the Bible. At the same time, conservative politicians, pundits and parents began alleging teachers were pushing left-wing beliefs about LGBTQ+ people, policing, race and history onto students.
On the campaign trail, Donald Trump reportedly railed against the “liberal indoctrination of America’s youth” and promised to end federal funding for schools teaching “transgender insanity” or “other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content.” South Dakota Gov. Kristi L. Noem (R) and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson penned an op-ed declaring “defeating anti-American indoctrination” in schools the “biggest cultural challenge of our lifetime.”
As political charges of school indoctrination surged, Jennifer worried its effects were fracturing her family.
She fought more with Mike after he went away to college, and they spoke less. When they did talk, in minutes-long phone calls, they skirted an expanding list of topics too hot to touch: from the coronavirus vaccine, to the Black Lives Matter protests, to transgender rights, to presidential politics.
By his junior year of college, Mike noticed he wasn’t talking or laughing freely with his mother like he remembered doing when he was little. It felt like he couldn’t discuss anything that mattered with Jennifer. Like he had to hide parts of himself from his mother.
Jennifer, meanwhile, resented the way Mike questioned her beliefs, treating her as if she was stupid. And she watched as political disagreements ripped apart her town and threatened other relationships in her family: A stranger yelled at her for her Trump bumper sticker. A cousin stopped speaking to her after she posted “All Lives Matter” on Facebook.
A few months before Ithaca College’s graduation, she called Mike and told him they had to fix this. They had to stop fighting all the time. She didn’t want to lose her son, not over politics.
On the Saturday morning in late May when Jennifer arrived at the Syracuse airport with Mike’s grandfather and sister, Mike was standing at the base of an escalator waiting, shifting foot to foot.
“Hi,” he said, moving in to hug his mom.
“Did you get taller?” Jennifer asked, stepping back to look at him. “When was the last time I saw you, Christmas?”
It was her first time seeing Mike in months. Her first time visiting the state of New York: a liberal slice of the country foreign to her, but where her son had found a home. It was his first real chance to show her, up close, what he was making of his life.
And it was their first real test since Jennifer called demanding a solution. Could they accept each other, even if they didn’t understand each other anymore?
“Yeah,” Mike answered his mother. Turning toward the baggage claim, he warned, “I don’t really have a good plan” for the trip.
Gripping the handle of her pink rolling suitcase, Jennifer followed her son into the weekend.
***
Jennifer realized Mike was in trouble when she saw his ninth-grade report card: a slew of C’s, D’s and F’s. She knew Mike was smart, and she was sure he could do better. Her distractible son just needed a different way to learn. More one-on-one attention. Lessons that required him to use his whole body, not just his brain.
She and Mike’s father — who are divorced — sought help from a Chicago-based education consultant, who evaluated Mike and recommended the Leelanau School, which offers “kinesthetic, visual, and verbal learning” that engages “all your senses,” per the school website. At the tiny boarding school in Northern Michigan, where tuition and board cost up to $72,000 per year, teachers give lessons targeted as much to students’ “sight, sound and smell” as their brains. During a typical class day, students might wade into the river to learn about “aquatic life cycles,” or shoot slingshots to understand parabolic motion. The Leelanau website promises to celebrate “everyone’s unique learning styles in a culture of acceptance.”
Perfect, Jennifer decided, for her son. Mike’s grandparents got on board, too, agreeing to help pay tuition.
So, at the start of Mike’s sophomore year in 2017, Jennifer drove from Illinois to Glen Arbor to settle him into the wooded, 40-acre campus fronting Lake Michigan. She recalled him as angry and tearful throughout the six-hour car ride; Mike said in an interview that it felt like he was being sent away as punishment.
At first, he disliked the new school. He struggled to adjust to the super-small, unusual classes, which could involve anything from a fishing trip to looking at rocks. It was weird, Mike said, to take exams based on conversations rather than written questions.
And Mike felt out of place among his peers. Early on, he remembered, he tried making comments popular with his friend circle back home: Dinging Hillary Clinton for her private email server, for example, or calling Trump the GOAT, short for “Greatest of All Time.” Such opinions stemmed partly from his mother, he said, but also from “alt-right” corners of the internet and the irregular drip of Daily Wire articles he read at the time.
But, where kids at his old school had laughed or agreed, Leelanau students didn’t seem to like what Mike was saying. They told Mike his comments weren’t “okay,” Mike recalled. Especially one student, Jack Simermeyer, who lived in Mike’s suite and who happened to be gay — something Mike made fun of at the time, he said.
Jack, now 23, said in an interview that he remembers Mike using an anti-gay slur a lot: slinging it like a nickname, greeting him at night with, “’Sup, f-----?” Other times, Mike asked rude questions about sex acts or found ways to make “my gayness the butt of the joke,” Jack said. But Jack never complained to adults at the school. He didn’t find Mike’s behavior threatening, he said, just ignorant. He judged that Mike was hunting for reactions: He wanted to “trigger the libs,” Jack said.
“He wasn’t my favorite person,” Jack said, “but the way I viewed him — he just didn’t know. He wasn’t aware. He hadn’t had the exposure to other people where you can build tolerance.”
The Washington Post’s best immersive reporting and narrative writing.
Instead of reporting Mike, Jack decided to teach him. He explained the f-word was hurtful. He argued with Mike about politics and other current events, once pushing back, for example, when he heard Mike satirizing queer identities by claiming he identified as “an attack helicopter.”
Eventually, Mike started listening — out of simple curiosity.
“The discourse that was happening, I wanted to stop rejecting it,” he said in an interview. “I wanted to ask more questions. Why were things the way they were?”
By Mike’s junior year, Jennifer started to notice changes in her son, too. When she called to tell him she was planning a visit to Leelanau, he paused on the line before blurting out a warning: Do not wear your Trump sweatshirt.
“And don’t ever say ‘former president Trump’ while you’re here,” Jennifer recalls Mike saying. “I don’t want you to say anything about Trump.”
Jennifer was shocked. A little hurt. She hadn’t been planning to bring the Trump gear anyway — why would she? Her political views had nothing to do with visiting her son at school. Mike should have known that.
When she arrived on campus a few days later, making sure to leave the sweatshirt at home, she was further startled by how casually the teachers and students dressed and behaved toward one another: Some wore jeans, she said, and used first names. It was all so different from the conservative Catholic school she grew up attending. One day, Mike told her, school leaders let students out of class to protest for more gun control.
Both Mike and Jack said they guessed most Leelanau teachers were liberal based on the ways they decorated their classrooms or occasional comments they dropped in casual conversations. Still, both emphasized, they never received explicitly political education at Leelanau. Instead, educators canvassed left- and right-wing arguments in class, making sure students understood both sides.
The Leelanau School did not respond to requests for comment.
Driving home, Jennifer wondered if most of Mike’s classmates and teachers at Leelanau leaned left.
But she dismissed the thought before she finished the drive. The school seemed so good for Mike in other ways: His grades were up. He was more articulate. He spent less time playing video games. And she really liked his teachers: They clearly cared about her son and were able to work with him in one-on-one ways his public school hadn’t.
What, Jennifer thought, did politics really matter?
Soon it was Mike’s senior year, and time for him to choose a subject to investigate for his thesis project. Intrigued by swirling rumors of a mysterious disease just beginning to inflict fatalities on Wuhan, China, Mike chose to research the coronavirus.
He set out in January 2020 to assess just how far the illness might spread. Through hours of painstaking research online, he learned with his chemistry teacher’s help to distinguish between scientific reports, reliable news sources and social media-fueled rumors.
He came away convinced that covid had the potential to disrupt the entire globe — and that Americans should listen closely to National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases chief Anthony S. Fauci. By contrast, Mike became increasingly alarmed by conservative politicians’ skepticism around the virus, especially Trump’s. When Trump insisted the virus would “miraculously [go] away,” compared covid favorably to the flu or called the risk to the American people “very low,” Mike bristled. Such commentary, he was beginning to fear, would cost millions of lives.
As Mike raced to finalize his senior project, the virus began proving his worst projections true. Covid surged into the United States with a vengeance, forcing schools nationwide to shut their doors. Including Leelanau.
Come late spring, Mike headed home to finish his senior year by Zoom — and to find his mother repeating every right-wing theory he’d come to detest.
***
A couple of months before the 2020 presidential election, Jennifer was parking at the grocery store when a stranger stopped his car, jumped out and started screaming at her. It was a few seconds before Jennifer realized what he was yelling about: the Trump sticker on her bumper.
Around the same time, scrolling on Facebook, Jennifer noticed a cousin had posted to complain about police treatment of Black Americans, writing, “Black Lives Matter.” Stung by what she saw as a harsh reflection on her own career in law enforcement, Jennifer replied in the comments that, the way she saw it, “All Lives Matter.”
The ensuing torrent of abuse from the cousin and her friends drove Jennifer to quit Facebook, she said. The next time she saw the cousin at a family function, they stayed on opposite sides of the room, not speaking. Jennifer couldn’t help recalling how she used to change the cousin’s diapers.
But suddenly, ties like that didn’t seem to matter. America — like her town, like her extended family — was more split over politics than Jennifer had ever known it.
When Mike came home, so did the division.
One evening after dinner, Mike wandered into Jennifer’s bedroom and sat down on a large beige couch, a favorite childhood haunt for both Mike and sister Grace. Jennifer turned to face him, looking away from a television screen playing Fox News.
Mike began talking through what happened that day: inevitably, about covid. Jennifer told her son about a video she’d seen online showing military tanks taking over cities in lockdown. The person who posted the video, she told him, feared the government might use the virus as an excuse to enforce martial law.
“That s---’s crap,” Mike recalled responding, alarmed. He suggested she look at the resources he’d relied on for his covid presentation instead: the World Health Organization, for example, or bulletins from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Jennifer felt a burr of alarm. She didn’t agree with what her son was saying. And she didn’t appreciate the implication she was being duped. Just when had Mike become so confident his information was right, and hers wrong?
“Let’s just go to bed,” she said, after several silent minutes.
Soon, the meetings became a nightly ritual. It was a way to process a world that seemed to be spinning into chaos — and, increasingly, a measure of just how differently mother and son viewed that world.
At first, their evening discussions centered on covid. But when George Floyd was killed by police and demonstrations erupted across dozens of major cities, their conversations veered in a new direction. Jennifer cited theories — since debunked — positing Floyd died of a drug overdose, not because of a policeman’s knee on his neck. Pointing to fires and looting in some places, she argued the protesters were destroying cities. She objected to the way she felt Black activists were painting all cops as evil and racist. She knew police officers, she had worked nearly two decades in the force — and she wasn’t evil, or racist.
To Mike, though, Floyd’s death was undeniable proof of the racism baked into American structures and institutions. He deemed the protests, even those that turned violent, a long-overdue reckoning.
Neither budged. They both clung close to their opinions, convinced the other was wrong.
Mike had never argued like this with his mother. He was worried for her health, dismayed by her opposition to pandemic safety measures such as masking. He felt like she wasn’t listening to him; like suddenly, she didn’t believe him anymore.
Jennifer, meanwhile, was wondering when her son stopped respecting her. She never remembered behaving so rudely to her own parents, Reagan devotees who raised her with a Republican flag in the front yard and Fox News on the television. Her whole life, she had retained their views without question.
In the spring of 2020, Mike learned he’d been admitted to Ithaca College with a scholarship. Teachers told him it was a great school. He thought Upstate New York looked beautiful. And anything that took him away from Chicago and the nightly bickering, Mike felt, was a good option.
He decided to go, with Jennifer’s full support. Although she knew little about Ithaca, she was thrilled by the prospect of a college degree. She also hoped that, with a little distance, the fights might stop.
Instead, they changed subjects.
In almost weekly phone calls, Mike and Jennifer kept clashing over politics: First, Mike unsuccessfully tried to persuade his mother to support Biden. Then they disagreed over the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol — then over the coronavirus vaccine, which Mike signed up for as soon as he finished his first semester of college. But what he viewed as lifesaving, Jennifer deemed life-threatening. She refused Mike’s demands she get the shot, pointing to reports from Tucker Carlson that the vaccine might cause health problems, even death.
His in-person visits to see his mother dwindled to twice, then once a year.
During one call a few months into Mike’s senior year of college, he told Jennifer he didn’t like law enforcement. The sentence knocked the air from her diaphragm. She finished the call blinking through tears, fighting to keep tremors from her voice. She had always believed her children were proud of the way she’d served her state. The minute Mike disconnected, she turned to her second husband, Dave.
“I just want to pull my hair out,” she remembers saying. Why, she wanted to know. Why was Mike saying things that hurt so bad?
Dave looked at her. “Oh,” she recalls him saying, “it must be that school.”
And for the first time, Jennifer asked herself the question: Was Mike’s education the reason he had turned out so differently?
Had the teachers and students at Leelanau exposed her son to left-leaning viewpoints he never would have encountered otherwise? Yes, she decided. Had Mike become an unrecognizable version of the little boy she could still remember carrying in her arms, the kid she once saw as her devoted sidekick? Yes.
Still, hadn’t Mike also grown from a collector of D’s and F’s into a straight-A student? Hadn’t Mike’s teachers and classmates spurred his confidence and curiosity, developing him into a brave young man whose openness to new opinions she admired, despite everything? Wasn’t he at college now because of what he learned at Leelanau?
She tried to remind herself of all this whenever calls with Mike grew tense. To stay patient with her son, even when it felt like he was making fun of her. Mostly, she tried to avoid broaching topics she suspected might spark disagreement.
Then in a phone call late last year, mother and son somehow started chatting about drag queen story hours: events where drag performers read books aloud to children at school or public libraries. Jennifer was horrified. She couldn’t understand why anyone would think it was appropriate to confuse fragile young children by introducing them to the concept of cross-dressing before they were ready.
But Mike laughed at her, she recalled. “Well, what’s wrong with that?” he kept asking over the phone.
In another first for Jennifer, she hung up on her son.
***
Early this year, Jennifer phoned Mike yet again. This time, with a message.
“You,” she told him, “don’t understand where I’m coming from.”
She wasn’t some brainwashed idiot, repeating Republican rhetoric like a robot, she said. She didn’t believe conservatives were perfect or that they made all the right decisions — and he shouldn’t think Democrats were perfect, either. What Jennifer tried to do, she said, was “look for good people doing the right thing.”
What they couldn’t do, she added, was let politics come between them. Their relationship was more important than their disagreements, she said.
Mike told her he hadn’t understood how she picked candidates to support. He promised he’d try to be less dismissive of her views.
He’d been thinking lately about the nature of indoctrination. He still believed he’d been indoctrinated into right-wing views growing up. But so, he said, was his mother. And she wasn’t to blame: There was an entire ecosystem of conservative politicians and pundits ready and eager to influence public opinion, Mike thought. His family was just one of many caught in the cogs of a large, well-organized machine.
On the phone, he told his mother he had a favor to ask. Would she please, just once, try reading the Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post or the New York Times?
“Have you ever considered,” he said, “that media in general sometimes put out there what they want you to believe, not what is really going on?”
Jennifer said she never thought about it that way. Recalling some of the more vitriolic Infowars segments she had watched, she conceded: Perhaps Mike had a point. She promised her son she would try.
Three months later, Mike stood pointing at a red-awninged building on the Ithaca Commons, a slice of downtown near his campus crammed with cafes, bookstores and boutique clothing shops. It was the day before graduation, and he was a few minutes into giving his mother, grandfather and sister a tour.
“So this,” Mike said, pointing, “is the weed shop.”
Jennifer, wearing diamond earrings and a turquoise cardigan, nodded. Mike was testing her, she thought. She called this behavior “poking the bear” or “picking the scab”: little moments when Mike would lob ostensibly left-leaning viewpoints or activities, knowing it might set her off.
But now, she knew how to respond.
She swept an arm out, pointing out chattering crowds, people queued in front of packed restaurants, a vendor handing out free pizza, a street performer in a three-piece suit barking into a microphone. “Is it like this every weekend?” she asked.
“In the summer, yeah,” Mike said, grinning.
“So eclectic around here, isn’t it?” She smiled back, hugging herself and rising to her tiptoes. “Mish-mashy.”
It was their new approach. The tolerance they’d reached. Maybe they were going to disagree sometimes. Maybe even most of the time. But Jennifer wanted to know about Mike’s world — if he would let her in. And Mike could see Jennifer was open to learning — provided he made the effort to understand her, too.
He was her son, and she was his mother, and that mattered more than politics.
The next day, Mike approached the stage in a billowing blue graduation gown to collect a degree in journalism. His mother bounced on her toes, hands intertwined at her waist.
Onstage, part of Mike couldn’t really believe what was happening.
Ever since he’d flunked classes his freshman year of high school, higher education had felt out of reach: something for people who were good at school, not for him. He looked toward where he thought his mother and family were sitting amid the vast crowd. If his mother hadn’t supported him, Mike thought — hadn’t picked out Leelanau, driven him there despite his opposition, worked with his grandparents to pay for the school — he wouldn’t be where he was, crossing the stage.
If she had to do it over, Jennifer was asking herself as she watched from the crowd as her son’s small blue figure accepted a tiny diploma, would she send Mike to Leelanau again?
Yes, she realized, she would."
WaPo_36,Toll in Bangladesh protests rises above 100 as Dhaka falls quiet under curfew,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/20/bangladesh-protests-violence-students/,2024-07-20 18:03:02.965145,,"DHAKA, Bangladesh — Life in the Bangladeshi capital ground to a halt Saturday as the government enforced a curfew to quell violent clashes between student protesters and security forces.Shops and businesses were closed and roads were largely empty in the typically congested city of 10 million people, save for military and paramilitary personnel on patrol. Sweeping restrictions on the internet imposed on Thursday remained in place.According to a Washington Post tally of hospital and police reports, at least 110 people have been killed in the demonstrations over the past four days — the most of any protests in Bangladesh in over a decade. Police forces said several of their personnel are among the dead. Thousands have been wounded, mostly in Dhaka.Mohammed Abir, a medical examiner at the morgue at Dhaka Medical College hospital, said he received 33 bodies Friday evening.The U.N. humans rights chief, Volker Türk, on Friday called the violence “shocking and unacceptable” and urged restraint. There needs to be “impartial, prompt and exhaustive investigations” into the attacks against students, he said, adding that he was especially worried about the actions of the government’s paramilitary police units, “which have long track records of violations.”Dhaka and several other major Bangladeshi cities have been engulfed this past week by protests against a new governmental policy of reserving a portion of civil service jobs for specific groups, including descendants of the nation’s freedom fighters. The quota system, seen as unfair, has fueled explosive anger toward the government under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which has deployed increasingly draconian methods to quell the unrest.Stories to keep you informed

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.On Friday, protesters stormed a jail in the district of Narsingdi, northeast of the capital, freeing hundreds of inmates. Police posts across Dhaka were set on fire as paramilitary and military forces deployed tear gas, rubber bullets and smoke bombs to disperse large crowds.At the end of the night, the government announced a nationwide curfew, ordering people to stay home Saturday. There would be a two-hour window for public movement from noon to 2 p.m., officials said.Internet services have been shut down and mobile services disrupted in a near-total “blackout” that has left much of the country’s 170 million people unreachable. Banks have reported disruptions in operations.On Saturday, calls from The Washington Post to the Bangladeshi Foreign Ministry and Home Affairs Ministry, as well as the U.S. Embassy in Dhaka, went unanswered. Hasina has canceled a pre-planned trip to Europe to deal with the unrest, her office said.Bangladeshi officials say they have slowed internet connectivity to stop the spread of misinformation. But in a letter, a coalition of more than 300 digital rights groups said it is likely to have the opposite effect by reducing people’s ability to counteract misinformation and spurring panic. “Government agencies have a duty to ensure that people can access open, secure, and unrestricted internet when they need it the most,” the #KeepItOn coalition wrote.Another digital rights advocacy group, Asia Internet Coalition, urged Bangladesh “to consider the serious impact of its action on its people and the country’s reputation as an investment destination.”Tan reported from Singapore."

WaPo_38,Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese aren’t the only WNBA rookies making an impact,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/20/wnba-all-star-game-caitlin-clark-angel-reese-rookies/,2024-07-20 19:30:02.706168,,"A standout 2024 WNBA draft class has already made its mark three months into the season. At the midway point, ahead of Saturday’s All-Star Game, its two biggest stars have set records.The All-Star Game in Phoenix precedes the Paris Olympics this summer, and signals the start of a month-long league break. It pits the U.S. women’s national team against a WNBA all-star squad that excludes players heading to Paris.The 2024 draft class was headlined by Caitlin Clark, the top selection by the Indiana Fever, and Angel Reese, the No. 7 pick by the Chicago Sky. Both will play for the WNBA All-Stars.Saturday’s showcase comes on the heels of another gaudy performance by Clark, who set a WNBA record with 19 assists in a game Wednesday against the Dallas Wings. Clark, the NCAA’s all-time Division I scoring leader, has enjoyed scoring success early on as a pro.She averages 17.1 points, 8.2 assists and 5.8 rebounds per game. Her points total tops all rookies and her assist rate is the best in the league. She netted a career-high 30 points in games against the Los Angeles Sparks in May and the Washington Mystics in last month’s WNBA Commissioner’s Cup.She also became the first rookie in WNBA history to record a triple-double, accomplishing the feat earlier this month against the league-leading New York Liberty. She has double-doubles in eight of her last 11 games.After setting the single-game assist record Wednesday, Clark is 13 away from setting the rookie single-season assist record (225), set by Ticha Penicheiro in 1998. Clark and Penicheiro are the only players in WNBA history to exceed 200 assists in their rookie seasons, and Clark is just the ninth player with at least 400 points and 200 assists in a season — regardless of experience level.Still, ball security has been an issue, as it was at the end of the Fever’s Wednesday loss to Dallas, where Clark gave the ball away late in a close contest. Her 5.6 turnovers per game are well beyond the next closest player (Connecticut’s Alyssa Thomas, with 3.6), though that can partly be attributed to her aggressive playmaking style.“I think the beginning of the season was probably the most difficult for me. Just the adjustment of, first of all, playing in this league. And then second of all, the schedule that we had, playing a game, having a day off, playing a game,” Clark told reporters on Wednesday. “I think once we really kind of got into a flow and got a few wins under our belt and had a little more practice time, things have settled down and flowed a little better. I feel like my feet are definitely getting under me more and starting to build more and more confidence.”Caitlin Clark is in a category of her own 👏With 19 assists in tonight's game, Clark has set a new record for most AST in a single game in WNBA historyPreviously, Courtney Vandersloot held the record with 18 AST in a game for the Chicago Sky vs. the Indiana Fever in 2020 pic.twitter.com/dUVzusSBTpReese, the other rookie sensation, set the NCAA record for most double-doubles in a single season in 2023. She has extended her habit to the professional ranks, where she reset the WNBA-record for consecutive double-doubles with 15 straight. She came up two points short of extending the streak on July 13 against the New York Liberty.She averages 13.5 points and 11.9 rebounds per game. She sits just behind two-time league MVP A’ja Wilson for the league lead in the latter category — narrowly trailing Wilson’s 12 rebounds per contest.Where Clark was expected to make a significant impact, Reese has exceeded expectations. At the break, Clark is the front-runner for 2024 Rookie of the Year and Reese sees +650 odds. “[Winning] is what’s most important to me,” Reese told ESPN earlier this month. “I think I’ve done a great job, being able to be consistent and I’ve broken the record already. So [I want to] be able to just be me and do whatever my teammates need.”The countdown begins... ⏳Get ready to witness the ultimate clash of talent as #WNBAAllStar meets the USA Women's National Team on July 20th at 8:30pm/ET on ABC 📺 pic.twitter.com/oEyJciHmExIt’s not just Reese who has exceeded rookie expectations.Forward Rickea Jackson, the fourth overall selection by the Los Angeles Sparks, is the team’s third-leading scorer with 11.4 points per game. Aaliyah Edwards, a reserve forward and the sixth pick by the Washington Mystics, is one of the team’s top rebounders. Kamilla Cardoso, the 6-foot-7 center whom the Sky picked four places ahead of Reese, averages 8.1 points and 7.8 rebounds, and has been a reliable force in the paint. All three have made quality contributions.Beyond the top picks in April’s draft, others have made an impression.The Mystics’ Julie Vanloo, a Belgian point guard who entered the league this year at 31, averages 8.4 points and 5.1 assists through 25 games (starting all but four). Vanloo has been a perimeter threat for Washington this season, even before she broke the team’s rookie record for three-pointers made on Sunday (now 52).Rookie guards Jacy Sheldon (5.3 points and 1.8 assists in 21.5 minutes per game) and Sevgi Uzun (5.4 points and 3.5 assists in 24.3 minutes) have contributed to an — albeit struggling — Dallas team. Jackson, Edwards, Cardoso and Sheldon are currently considered longshots for rookie of the year with +20000 odds.Some rookies haven’t been as fortunate.Second overall pick Cameron Brink averaged 7.5 points, 5.3 rebounds and a team-leading 2.3 blocks in 15 starts for the Sparks. But her season ended last month after she suffered an ACL injury against Connecticut.Kate Martin, Clark’s college teammate at Iowa and a second-round pick by the Las Vegas Aces, has been a surprise contributor off the bench for the defending WNBA champions. She averages 3.6 points, 2.0 rebounds and 1.2 assists in just over 14 minutes of action per night. But her return is in question after she slipped late in the first quarter of Tuesday’s game against Chicago and suffered an apparent lower leg injury."
WaPo_39,Microsoft’s global sprawl comes under fire after historic outage,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/20/microsoft-outage-crowdstrike-regulatory-scrutiny/,2024-07-20 19:05:02.706168,,"A cascading computer outage that grounded planes, stymied hospitals and disrupted critical public services exposed the depth of the global economy’s dependence on a single company: Microsoft.Regulators and lawmakers across the political spectrum raised alarm that the sprawling outage that knocked out Windows showcases the danger of so much power concentrating into one firm, which drives governments, businesses and critical infrastructure around the world.The system failure ricocheted across the globe, as credit card systems went down in Australia, airlines in India handed out handwritten plane tickets, and courts in the United States delayed hearings, including one in the sex crimes case of Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein. And the impact reverberated across the giant’s many clients in the public sector, with the Social Security Administration closing its local offices through the weekend and the Federal Communications Commission reporting disruptions to the 911 call service that forced some local dispatchers to switch to analog phone systems.The outages were traced to a defective update from the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, which was shipped to Windows systems across the globe, triggering the mass outages.But the episode is resurfacing concerns that Microsoft’s grip over global systems is opening up federal agencies and businesses to unnecessary risk — raising questions about whether the power of one of the world’s most sophisticated political operators should be curtailed.Stories to keep you informed

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.“These incidents reveal how concentration can create fragile systems,” Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, a Democrat whose agency is looking into consolidation among cloud computing services, said in a Friday post on X.“The impact of today’s outages was defined by the reach of CrowdStrike; not the reach of Microsoft,” said Microsoft spokeswoman Kate Frischmann.Microsoft’s email, cloud storage and video conferencing products have long been workplace staples nationwide, including within the federal government, for which the company is a major supplier. But prominent security lapses, coupled with mounting regulatory concerns about the tech giant’s power in our economy, are testing the company’s oftentimes friendly relationships in Washington.The pervasiveness of Microsoft’s software in government IT systems reentered the spotlight earlier this year, after major hacks exposed federal officials’ emails, prompting lawmakers on Capitol Hill to haul in the company’s president, Brad Smith, to testify. A scathing report by the federal government’s Cyber Safety Review Board found that a “cascade of avoidable errors” and a security culture “that requires an overhaul” contributed to the events.CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said Friday that the outages were “not a security or cyber incident” and that the company was “working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on.”Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement Friday that the company is “working closely with CrowdStrike and across the industry to provide customers technical guidance and support to safely bring their systems back online.”But the flare-up is already fueling calls for the federal government to diversify the pool of vendors that conduct its daily operations, serving as a potential boon to Microsoft’s competitors.The outage “is the result of a software monopoly that has become a single point of failure for too much of the global economy,” said George Rakis, executive director of NextGen Competition, whose group advocates for more stringent antitrust enforcement. He accused Microsoft of squelching competition by locking in customers and called for it to be “broken up.”Spence Purnell, director of technology policy at the Reason Foundation libertarian think tank, said that while government officials often “ironically” complain about tech monopolies, “they help prop up Microsoft’s hold on government contracting through vendor lock-in.”The outages are also poised to deepen scrutiny of the company’s dominance on Capitol Hill.Lawmakers on at least three congressional panels — the House Oversight, House Homeland Security, and House Energy and Commerce committees — requested Friday that Microsoft and CrowdStrike brief members about how the outage took place and how it impacted agencies.“This incident highlights how dependent we have become on IT for every aspect of our lives, and how a single defect can have a ripple effect across the entire economy,” Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green (R-Tenn.) said in a statement.At least one Republican committee member, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.), learned of the outage as he faced his own flight disruptions while returning from the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, according to a spokesperson.Rep. William Timmons (R-S.C.), who sits on the House Oversight Committee, called for immediate hearings on the incident, saying on X that it “lays bare the multiple choke points in our IT and Cyber infrastructure.”Microsoft’s regulatory troubles have been piling up around the globe as it pushes more aggressively into new technologies, including artificial intelligence. Federal agencies reached a deal last month clearing the FTC to investigate its relationship with OpenAI. Regulators in Europe and the United Kingdom have been eyeing the relationship. The moves signal a shift for the company, which avoided much of the “techlash” directed at companies during the Trump presidency and first years of the Biden administration.Microsoft has deep lobbying and public-relations resources to neutralize the fallout of the outage. Over three decades, Microsoft has built perhaps the most sophisticated public policy shop of any tech company, learning from its missteps during its antitrust battles with the U.S. government in the 1990s and early 2000s.Under the leadership of Smith, the company has sought to portray itself as more diplomatic and willing to engage with policymakers about their concerns than tech peers. Smith’s reputation as the industry’s de facto ambassador to Washington will probably be tested by the outage fallout.Frischman confirmed the company was briefing policymakers in D.C. on Friday about the incident, but she declined to say which government officials the company was contacting.The White House told The Post that Biden was briefed on the incident and that his team was in touch with CrowdStrike. Microsoft was in touch with White House officials on Friday, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private conversations.After the hacks earlier in the year, numerous congressional committees and lawmakers called on federal agencies to investigate and evaluate their reliance on the company’s tools. Those calls gained fresh urgency after Friday’s outages.“It’s a failure that demands swift answers,” Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who in May urged federal agencies to probe Microsoft’s security lapses, said in a social media post on Friday.Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.), who recently grilled the Pentagon over plans to invest more in Microsoft products, wrote a letter to the Defense Department on Friday warning that the outage shows that “consolidation and dependence on one provider can be catastrophic” to IT systems.The FTC itself was impacted by the outage, and employees were working to resolve issues on Friday.Khan rose to the helm of the FTC with tough rhetoric about dismantling the power of tech giants, and under her leadership the agency brought an antitrust case against Amazon and challenged mergers in the sector, including Microsoft’s purchase of Activision. Microsoft ultimately prevailed in court, and the deal closed last year.Khan warned on a recent episode of “The Daily Show” that some companies have become so powerful that they suffer few consequences when they harm consumers.“Now we’re living with regular reminders of the consequences of prioritizing ‘efficiency,’ where an errant update shuts off the global economy for a day, or a hack stops millions of Americans from filling their prescriptions for weeks,” said an FTC official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the agency’s sensitive work, which includes inquiries involving Microsoft. “The dominant firms are often too big to care because their customers have no one left to turn to for better service.”Jeff Stein contributed to this report."
WaPo_40,The fading tradition of the Black family summer trip to the rural South,https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2024/07/20/black-family-summer-road-trip-south/,2024-07-20 19:00:02.706168,,"When she was a kid in the 1980s and ’90s, Evita Robinson took an annual summer road trip from Long Island, N.Y., down to Camden, S.C. Robinson and some of her extended family members piled into two or three cars around 1 a.m., hoping to avoid traffic around the Northern cities. They ate fried chicken out of shoeboxes on the way down. As they crossed into South Carolina, they hit the roadside attraction South of the Border and Robinson knew the 14-hour caravan was almost over.Robinson’s suburban life up north was very different from her time in the rural South. In Camden, the dirt roads were shades of yellow and red. Robinson’s grandfather taught her about gardening as he tended cucumbers, lettuce and tomatoes. The big event was a family reunion, where everyone put on matching t-shirts, took over a local park and reconnected over barbecue.The family was split between South Carolina and New York because back in 1954, Robinson’s grandmother had migrated from Camden up to New York City, later settling on Long Island. These trips from Long Island down to Camden were about “making sure that the lineage is not lost,” Robinson said.Between the 1910s and 1970s, approximately 6 million Black people fled the South, primarily from rural areas, seeking safety and jobs, mostly in the urban North and West. During this era, it was common for Black migrants to return to the rural South for visits, often in the summertime.That trip was at once a reunion, a history lesson and a rite of passage. For many Northern- or Western-born kids, this was a rare chance to do several things: see their Southern relatives who did not migrate, understand the segregated society that shaped their family and experience their ancestral landscape, where Black people had gone from enslavement on plantations to sharecropping and other agricultural occupations.But these trips aren’t as common anymore, said Robinson, the founder of Nomadness Travel Tribe, a leading Black travel community since 2011 with more than 36,000 members on Facebook.That’s partly because the rural South saw a massive exodus of Black people during the Great Migration, so today, there are fewer people there to visit. Over the last few decades, there has been a reverse migration from North back to South, but Black people largely did not return to rural areas. They moved to major metropolitan areas like Atlanta, where jobs were more plentiful.There’s little data on Black travel patterns, but experts say these habits have shifted in recent years away from the rural Southern family reunion. Instead, Black travelers are seeking new destinations and experiences, said Alana Dillette, who teaches about hospitality and tourism at San Diego State University and is a co-founder of CODE, an organization focused on equity in the tourism industry. Many Black travelers no longer have living relatives in the rural South anyway, she said.Robinson still visits her family in the rural South. But instead of driving the entire distance, she flies from her home in Newark, N.J., to Charlotte, then rents a car for the hour-and-a-half drive to Camden.She still employs safety strategies that were passed down in her family. “I will not do that drive at night,” she said. She makes sure to leave Charlotte with a full tank of gas and food in the vehicle to avoid stopping in an unfamiliar or potentially hostile area. And she has added her own contemporary precaution: Knowing she will lose reception for about 20 minutes on this drive, she screenshots the directions.“There’s still a lot of those sundown town remnants,” she said, referring to towns that historically did not tolerate Black people after dark. “It’s one of the few times I go and find out what time the sun is setting.”As a child, she was scared of certain things in the South, like the silence of the country and the cemetery where her relatives were buried. She was alarmed when her aunts mentioned that snakes used to slither up through the floorboards of an old family home. But over time, she developed a “sense of pride” about these Southern elements that shaped her family.Her father, William Robinson, made these same trips when he was a child in the 1950s and ’60s. He also experienced culture shock in the rural South. “Chickens were running all over the place,” he said. Some family members used an outhouse, pumped water from a well and cranked their clothes through a wringer.These trips also exposed the elder Robinson to Southern racism. Once, he went fishing with his grandfathers in a nearby creek; they all left to get something to eat, and when they returned, the rock they had been sitting on had “KKK” written on it, he said. There were bad experiences at gas stations, too. “Sometimes my father would come running back to the car, full speed, stick the key in the ignition, and zoom, we were off without putting any more gas in the car,” he recalled.Even so, many Black families had a deep, even warm, connection to the rural South. When Robinson’s family drove from Camden back to Long Island, he and his siblings smelled their grandmother’s coconut cake the whole way home.In 1988, Robinson moved to South Carolina for the lower cost of living. He now resides in Camden, where he is a business consultant, the executive director of a nonprofit, and the chair of the Democratic Party for Kershaw County. He lives in a house that his father left when he passed away.“People have just died off,” he said, citing one reason Black family trips to the rural South are less common than they once were.“The whole purpose of going what we call ‘down home’ was about literally a homecoming,” said Rue Mapp, founder and CEO of Outdoor Afro, a nonprofit dedicated to reconnecting Black people with nature. “Especially over the last 60-plus years, home feels more entrenched in other places, not necessarily in the South.”Mapp’s parents migrated from Texas and Louisiana at the end of World War II, ending up in Oakland. When Mapp was a child in the 1970s and ’80s, she took summertime road trips with her parents in their Cadillac from California back to Texas and Louisiana.When they arrived — first in Call, Tex., then in DeRidder, La. — they sat down to barbecue, cornbread, collard greens, sock it to me cake and 7UP cake. Mapp also spent a lot of time chatting on people’s porches. She explored with her cousins, played games and put on talent shows.Some Black children went South without their parents, Mapp said. Migrants were working tirelessly in Northern and Western cities, and sending their kids south for the summer was partly a child-care solution. “Black kids didn’t get sent to camp. They were sent down home,” she said.Mapp said she didn’t experience any racist incidents on these trips, but she heard upsetting stories. “Everybody also has in their consciousness the story of Emmett Till, which was the worst possible outcome of one of these experiences,” she said. Chicago-born Till traveled down to Mississippi in 1955 to visit his relatives, only to be brutally lynched, catalyzing the civil rights movement.But there is more than pain and peril to these trips, Mapp said. Visiting the rural South gave her “a beautiful rootedness,” she said, and helped her take pride in how far she’s come. “I am the granddaughter of a domestic,” she said. “We have a hard time marking progress when we don’t have a connection to where we’ve come from.”The old pilgrimage to the rural South may be fading away, but new traditions are emerging, Dillette said. In recent years, it’s become more common for Black travelers to take a DNA test to learn more about their African origins, then plan a trip to the African country from which they’re descended. These travelers generally don’t have known living relatives there, but the trip still connects them to their roots. “We could think of this as a pilgrimage as well, in a different sense,” she said."
WaPo_41,Jan. 6 rioter accused of giving Nazi salute sentenced to almost 5 years,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/20/tyler-bradley-dykes-marine-capitol-riot/,2024-07-20 20:25:02.705390,,"A Marine who allegedly gave a Nazi salute during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection has been sentenced to almost five years in prison for his role in the Capitol riot.Tyler Bradley Dykes, 26, of Bluffton, S.C., grabbed a riot shield from Capitol police officers during the insurrection, which he then used to “obstruct and intimidate” officers at the scene, according to prosecutors. He was serving in the Marines at the time, prosecutors added.U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell sentenced Dykes — who pleaded guilty to two felony counts of assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers in April — to four years and nine months in prison, the Department of Justice said in a statement Friday. He was also ordered to pay $22,000 in fines and restitution.Prosecutors had recommended a sentence of five years and three months, while the defense had requested a sentence of two years.Dykes had already “demonstrated his penchant for ideological violence,” having been charged and convicted of “felonious conduct” at a deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in August 2017, prosecutors said. An image showed him appearing to make a Nazi salute with one hand while carrying a lit torch with the other.“Tyler hates his involvement in the Capitol riot. He takes complete responsibility for his actions,” his lawyers wrote ahead of his sentencing, emphasizing his young age at the time of the offenses. In their sentencing memorandum, they added that Dykes would “forever regret” his conduct in the riot, and described him as “a young man who made incredibly poor decisions on January 6, 2021.”Dykes attended President Donald Trump’s rally on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, according to a Department of Justice statement. He then went to the Capitol, where he removed snow fencing and bicycle barricades with “AREA CLOSED” signs, “allowing other rioters to more easily enter the restricted area.”He was near the front of a “violent mob” that forced U.S. Capitol police officers from their positions near the barricades up the East Rotunda steps. From there, he celebrated by performing the Sieg Heil salute, the department said.Dykes denied making the gesture but prosecutors said the incident was caught on video, the Associated Press reported.Dykes grabbed the riot shield from the hands of two Capitol police officers, leaving them “exposed and vulnerable” to pepper spray and other attacks that followed, prosecutors said.He twice used the shield to push his way through police lines, including forcing D.C. police officers, who were trying to prevent rioters from getting closer to the Senate, to retreat further down a hallway.“Although Dykes’s assaults did not result in known injuries, Dykes was an active participant in a violent mob that left numerous officers seriously injured,” according to prosecutors.The FBI arrested Dykes in Virginia on July 17, 2023.Dykes briefly attended Cornell University in fall 2017 before joining the United States Marine Corps. He was discharged in May 2023 “under other than honorable conditions” for “participating in extremist behavior,” prosecutors said.“Rather than honor his oath to protect and defend the Constitution, Dykes’s criminal activity on January 6 shows he was instead choosing to violate it,” prosecutors wrote.More than 1,400 people have been charges with crimes related to the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol."
WaPo_42,How a one-man news site beat the national media on a Trump shooting scoop,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/07/20/beaver-countian-vranesevich-trump-shooting/,2024-07-20 20:23:02.705390,,"John Paul Vranesevich, the owner and only full-time reporter for the Beaver Countian, was reporting on a candlelight vigil for a slain transgender teen in Mercer County, Pa., last Saturday when his phone started pinging with text messages.A lone gunman on a roof had just fired toward Donald Trump at a rally in nearby Butler County, leaving the former president injured, a local man dead and serious concerns about security surrounding the event. People in law enforcement whom Vranesevich had come to know from a dozen years covering this corner of western Pennsylvania wanted the journalist to know what was happening.“I was literally in the corner, going back and forth with my sources, who were giving me the play-by-play,” he recalled this week.And he quickly realized that they were sharing details with him that had not yet been reported by national media.Vranesevich silenced his phone, telling his contacts he’d get back to them, and kept covering the vigil. But by Monday afternoon, his follow-up reporting culminated in a major scoop: Local officers had actually been stationed inside the building the shooter climbed to fire his shots. And another officer had alerted a command center about the suspicious man before he even climbed the roof.The journalist said it did not surprise him, as the solo full-time employee of his small local news site, that he was able to break a major story about the U.S. Secret Service’s most dramatic failure in decades — a story that took hours and days for national press, including The Washington Post, to confirm.“All news is local,” he said. “Everything that happens that the national [media] cares about is happening in some community, somewhere.”Vranesevich developed relationships with law enforcement sources over years following the ins and outs of Beaver County, from unsolved murders to drama at the county commission.He said that some of those long-standing sources contacted him after the rally shooting to share some of the details of what happened that day with him because they were concerned that the national narrative unfolding about the shooting was inaccurate or incomplete — that it would leave the public to believe that local law enforcement had failed to do their jobs and put the president at risk.Sources like these may be hesitant speaking to national reporters, thinking “they’re going to come here, get their story, leave, and they don’t care about me or my community,” Vranesevich said. “What they know about me is I was here before the big story happened, and I’ll be here after the big story happened.”As he was about to publish his story, though, Vranesevich said he tipped off contacts on CBS’s news desk. He knew his sources would want to get their story out to a national audience. CBS News published their story hours later, crediting the Beaver Countian’s original work.Vranesevich started his news site in 2011. He took an unconventional path into journalism, though. As a college student, he started a hacker news site, AntiOnline. But as his focus shifted to computer security and anti-hacking measures, he found himself attracting the ire of hackers. Vranesevich sold off his company — he would not disclose the price, citing a nondisclosure agreement — and decided to get involved in the other side of journalism after his work got the attention of the New York Times, Vanity Fair and other national press. He started the Beaver Countian as “one-person guerrilla journalism venture.” He now has the help of four or five freelance editors and contributing reporters.He has reported on stories that have gotten national attention, like the unsolved murder of a local teacher who had been one of his sources (CBS’s “48 Hours” hired him as a consultant for its own take on that story), but also topics of local interest, such as whether government officials are filing timely financial disclosures. He also publishes an automated log of all 911 calls in the county.For all the friendly sources he has developed, Vranesevich has had more than a few clashes with local officials, too. He accused a sheriff of threatening him with a gun; the sheriff was acquitted in a jury trial but voted out of office. Another local official tried to get him to reveal the names of anonymous commenters via a subpoena as part of a defamation lawsuit, though Vranesevich himself was not sued.Bill Vidonic, a former reporter at the Beaver County Times who now freelances for the Beaver Countian, said that Vranesevich is seen as somewhat of a “renegade,” who “doesn’t always have to play by the rules.”Some of his stories carry a certain editorial flair that corporate newspapers might frown upon. (He slapped the headline “Nepotism gone wild!” on top of a story recounting accusations about a local judge’s hiring of a secretary.) He has also harshly criticized the Beaver County Times in past editorials. But Vidonic said Vranesevich sticks to core journalistic tenets of reporting and corroborating facts before he publishes.“He’s been an outlier in terms of media, and I think that’s where his strength has been,” Vidonic said. “A lot of people reach out to him because they don’t think he’s part of the establishment. He’s one of them.”Vidonic sees a need for journalists like Vranesevich. As traditional sources of news have dried up in places like Beaver County, local news groups on Facebook have proliferated but can end up promoting misinformation. (Vranesevich erected an unusually tough paywall on his news site, which relies entirely on subscriptions, in part to dissuade readers from cutting and pasting his stories onto social media. He declined to disclose how many subscribers he has.)While Pittsburgh-based media sometimes cover Beaver County — NBC affiliate WPXI ran some major scoops about security at the Trump rally, including that the officer who first spotted the gunman had called the command center a full 26 minutes before the shooting — the Beaver County Times is the only daily newspaper dedicated to the county.Vidonic estimates that when he joined the Beaver County Times in 1994, it had around 50 staffers in the newsroom. But its staff has dwindled over the years, in a reflection of national trends of a decline in advertising, changes in reading habits and corporate consolidation. Now, the paper has five — three reporters and two editors, one of whom also edits a nearby paper — plus dispatches from the USA Today state capital bureau chief. They’re hiring a fourth reporter.“Local newspapers just don’t have the resources to cover what they should be covering,” Vidonic said.The Times, owned by USA Today owner Gannett, also broke stories about the rally tragedy, including interviews with a witness to the shooting and a local GOP official who tried to help resuscitate Corey Comperatore, the local fireman who was killed. A spokeswoman for Gannett also pointed out that USA Today was the first to publish the name of the alleged shooter, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks.“The Beaver County Times has deep roots in Aliquippa and throughout the western Pennsylvania region,” Patrick O’Shea, editor of the Beaver County Times and Ellwood City Ledger, said in a statement, “and we remain firmly committed to serving our readers and advertisers with trusted, reliable local news, while relying on the strength of the USA Today Network to ensure up-to-the-minute national coverage.”Vranesevich said he remains in constant communication with his sources on the rally shooting and expects he will publish more stories about it. Meanwhile, he is also writing about the county’s top public defender and gathering more reporting on the slain Mercer County teen. All along, he takes stock of his own limited resources to tackle the big stories when compared to regional or national press.“If I think someone else is going to tell that story, I don’t worry about it,” he said. “Being hyperlocal, I can’t compete with that. I concentrate on what’s not being told.”"
WaPo_43,A woman’s SUV was set on fire. A stranger gave her a replacement car.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2024/07/20/car-arson-gift-bannister-davenport/,2024-07-20 20:09:02.705390,,"Carla Bannister was startled awake at 4:30 a.m. by police knocking on her front door. They told her that her car was on fire.“I was terrified. I was discombobulated,” said Bannister, 38, who lives in Cincinnati with her 4-year-old twin daughters.Surveillance footage from her apartment building showed that someone intentionally scorched her 2007 Chevrolet Traverse in the parking lot on the morning of July 9.“This is definitely not a common thing that occurs in our area,” said Nicco Gumino, a detective with the Woodlawn Police Department who is working on the case.In the surveillance video, the perpetrator is seen walking up to the SUV and throwing rocks at it. The person hurls a rock through the rear window, breaking it.“He is also seen throwing a type of fluid on the vehicle, a possible [fire] accelerant,” Gumino said. “You can see him lighting something on fire, throwing it into the vehicle, and it just ignited.”Someone nearby heard the car alarm going off and saw the flames. They quickly called 911, and firefighters came to extinguish the fire.The arson incident is still under investigation, and police said they are pursuing a few leads. Bannister said she has no idea who targeted her car or why someone would do this to her.“I’m not a mean person or an evil person, so I don’t have anybody that I would suspect that would do this to me,” said Bannister, who is a manager at a local business.Bannister was worried about what she would do without a car. She said she has car insurance, but she doesn’t believe she has much coverage. Her insurance company is assessing the damage.In the meantime, Bannister had no way of driving her daughters to day care or getting herself to work.“I was overwhelmed and just at a loss,” she said.Then a total stranger showed up with a stunning offer: Jim Davenport wanted to give Bannister his old vehicle free.“She needed the car more than I did,” said Davenport, 67.Davenport — who bought a new car for himself last December — saw the local Fox19 news report about Bannister’s car and was disgusted by what happened to her.“Everything in life comes full circle, and this guy will get what’s coming to him,” he said. “It’s just a matter of time.”On the spot, he decided to give Bannister his extra vehicle, which is about 25 years old. Aside from some dents and dings, he said, “it’s a great running car.”“I felt bad for what happened to her,” said Davenport, who works as a security guard. “I figured, why not bless her with a car?”He promptly went to the police station in an effort to track her down, and officials contacted Bannister to let her know that someone wanted to give her their old car.“I was in awe,” Bannister said. “There are good people in the world.”Davenport met Bannister at the police station July 12 to give her the car. Fox19 was there to cover the kind gesture.“He handed me the keys and told me where to go to get the title,” said Bannister, who requested that the make of the vehicle not be disclosed in the story, as she is concerned about someone targeting her again. “I’m still terrified.”After such a frightening event, Bannister said, meeting Davenport helped restore her faith in humanity.“He’s a very nice man, a very genuine-hearted person,” she said.Davenport, a veteran, said he has esophageal cancer, which has spread to his liver.“I don’t know how much time I’m going to be in this world,” Davenport said, noting that he has another old vehicle that he also intends to give to a person in need. “I want to bless somebody else with another car.”He said he was glad to be able to help Bannister during a difficult time.“She was so appreciative of it, she was in tears,” he said. “I was almost as overwhelmed as she was. It made me feel so good that I did it.”Davenport said he has no family members to give his old cars to.“Even if I had family, that would have went to her,” he said.Davenport hopes his gift to Bannister inspires others to support someone in need.“I’ve done my little bit to make the world a better place,” he said. “If you plant good seed, it’ll grow good things.”"
WaPo_44,Tossing Trump’s case was risky for Judge Cannon — at least for now,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/20/cannon-trump-florida-appeal-special-counsel/,2024-07-20 20:00:02.705390,,"Judge Aileen M. Cannon’s stunning dismissal this week of the most serious charges faced by Donald Trump put her on shaky legal ground, according to experts, who say she is on track to be reversed on appeal and could even be removed from the case — an extraordinary, but not unheard of step.Because of the political calendar, however, any legal repercussions could be short-lived.Trump’s alleged mishandling of classified national security records and obstruction of government efforts to retrieve the material may not matter if the former president and current Republican nominee is elected in November. If he gets back to the White House, Trump could pressure his Justice Department to close the case. He could also promote Cannon to the very appeals court that will soon examine her decision to toss the case.Cannon’s finding that special counsel Jack Smith was improperly appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate Trump conflicts with numerous past court decisions and the nation’s long history — during both Democratic and Republican administrations — of allowing independent prosecutors to handle high-profile instances of alleged wrongdoing.Smith has filed notice of his plans to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, which reviews decisions from the Florida district where Cannon, a relatively inexperienced judge appointed by Trump in 2020, sits.The court has already rebuked her twice for her handling of other aspects of the classified documents case, sending what Yale Law School professor Akhil Amar described as a message that her decisions had been “way out of line.”The question now, Amar said, is how quickly and dramatically the appeals court acts on the latest ruling, which dismissed the entire indictment for Trump and his two co-defendants.“They may not want to stick their head in a buzz saw if they can just let the case take its slow, deliberative course,” he said.In her 93-page decision, Cannon said there is no specific statute authorizing the attorney general to appoint a special counsel. She also said the Constitution requires someone with Smith’s authority to be confirmed by the Senate.The judge acknowledged the tradition of special-attorney-like figures in moments of political scandal involving high-level government officials, from Watergate to Iran-contra to Russia’s attempts to interfere in the 2016 election.But Cannon said the practice of appointing such independent prosecutors has been inconsistent and based on a “spotty historical backdrop.” Smith, she wrote, is “a private citizen exercising the full power of a United States Attorney, and with very little oversight or supervision.”Conservative legal groups have long questioned the constitutionality of special counsel appointments. Cannon repeatedly cited Justice Clarence Thomas, who raised the issue in a solo opinion this month as part of the Supreme Court’s decision granting Trump broad immunity from prosecution for official acts. That Supreme Court case focused on Smith’s separate election interference prosecution of Trump in D.C.She also embraced the arguments in a law review article by Gary Lawson of Boston University School of Law and Steven G. Calabresi, a Northwestern law professor and a co-founder of the Federalist Society, with which Cannon is affiliated.Other legal experts, however, have joined former Justice Department officials and Smith’s legal team in saying her ruling ignores the history of special counsel appointments and flouts Supreme Court precedent.Most notably, the high court in 1974 unanimously required President Richard M. Nixon to hand over recordings to a special prosecutor as part of the Watergate investigation. In that opinion, the justices endorsed the office, citing several statutes under which the attorney general had “delegated the authority to represent the United States in these particular matters to a Special Prosecutor with unique authority and tenure.”While lower-court judges are bound to follow the Supreme Court’s lead, Cannon took the unusual step of finding she was not required to abide by that aspect of the high court’s opinion in U.S. v. Nixon, saying the case did not directly address the validity of the office of special counsel.Michael J. Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor who teaches about constitutional conflicts between presidents and Congress, said Cannon cannot just brush aside a unanimous high court ruling.“For a trial judge to ignore it is judicial malpractice,” he said, describing her most recent decision as part of a “pattern of bias that leads her to endorse wacky or unfounded arguments, and that’s a problem if you’re a judge.”Until the late 1990s, authority for an independent prosecutor was found in a federal law that many analysts believed was problematic in part because it required a panel of judges to appoint the independent counsels. The law was replaced by Justice Department regulations written according to specific statutes, according to former acting solicitor general Neal Katyal, who drafted the rules in consultation with Congress when he worked for then-Attorney General Janet Reno.Separately, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has twice rejected challenges to the use of special counsels. First, in a 1987 opinion upholding the appointment of Lawrence Walsh to investigate the Iran-contra scandal, and more recently in 2019, upholding the appointment of former FBI director Robert S. Mueller III to probe Russian election interference and possible ties between those efforts and the 2016 Trump campaign.Former deputy attorney general Rod J. Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller, said the fact that special counsels are accountable to the attorney general is significant. Just as rank-and-file federal prosecutors are subject to oversight in handling their assigned cases, the special counsel can be overruled by the attorney general, said Rosenstein, who also was part of independent counsel Kenneth Starr’s Whitewater trial team investigating President Bill Clinton and first lady Hillary Clinton in the 1990s.“The Attorney General’s authority to overrule the special counsel is critical,” Rosenstein said, “because in my opinion it would be unconstitutional to make a prosecutor fully independent.”Bruce Fein, another former high-level Justice Department official, worked in the office of legal counsel during the Nixon administration when then-acting attorney general Robert H. Bork appointed Leon Jaworski as the Watergate special prosecutor. Fein recalled deep concerns about the department’s internal ability to investigate the Nixon administration and a strong awareness of the need for independence.Contrary to Cannon’s opinion, Fein said, the position of special counsel was specifically designed to strengthen separation of powers by preventing the executive branch from covering up its own crimes. While Garland appointed Smith to reassure the public that the investigation of Trump would be shielded from politics, Fein emphasized that Smith is still subject to oversight by the attorney general and must follow Justice Department policies and regulations.Garland has met with Smith and the other special counsels he has appointed multiple times throughout their investigations, according to people familiar with the meetings, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss them.The appeals court has already shown skepticism of Cannon’s handling of Trump’s case in its earlier blunt reversals.In September 2022, the 11th Circuit unanimously granted the Justice Department a reprieve from Cannon’s order barring them from reviewing documents with classified markings seized from Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Florida home and private club. Three months later, a different 11th Circuit panel said Cannon was wrong to appoint an outside expert to decide whether any of the seized documents should be shielded from criminal investigators.In both cases, two of the three judges on the panel were nominated by Trump.But Cannon’s decision to appoint the special master nevertheless delayed the case — just as her dismissal of the indictment will at the very least push any possible trial past the coming presidential election. Such delays have been a primary part of Trump’s legal strategy in this and his other criminal cases.“Everything points in one direction,” Fein said of Cannon. “She is trying to ensure that Trump cannot be tried before November in hopes that if he’s elected he’ll shut down the prosecution.”It is not known how soon Smith will file an appeal or whether as part of it he will ask the 11th Circuit to take Cannon off the case. Such a move, while unusual, would not be unprecedented. The D.C. Circuit in 2006 removed a trial court judge from a case involving Native American oil and gas royalties, finding that the judge appeared biased against the Interior Department. It was the third time a sitting judge had been removed by the D.C. CircuitAt a hearing in her Fort Pierce, Fla., courtroom last month, Cannon acknowledged that precedent seemed to support Garland’s appointment of Smith even as she pressed prosecutors about whether there had been “any actual oversight” by the attorney general.Less than two weeks later, Thomas issued his concurring opinion in Trump’s immunity case that called into question the validity of the appointment of Smith.Even though the Florida indictment was not before the justices, Thomas seemed to speak directly to Cannon: “If this unprecedented prosecution is to proceed, it must be conducted by someone duly authorized to do so by the American people. The lower courts should thus answer these essential questions concerning the Special Counsel’s appointment before proceeding.”Cannon gave her answer Monday, declaring Smith’s appointment invalid. Adding to the drama was the fact that her opinion landed on the opening day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where Trump — ear bandaged for an injury sustained during a failed assassination attempt — was feted by the party faithful before accepting the nomination.Trump praised Cannon by name in his convention speech, referring to her as a highly respected federal judge.Whatever the 11th Circuit decides may be appealed to the Supreme Court, which issued several notable rulings favorable to Trump this term — including the sweeping grant of immunity.It is not clear how the justices would view Cannon’s conclusion on the special counsel issue, however. Legal experts said it was telling that no other justice joined Thomas’s separate opinion.One justice, Brett M. Kavanaugh, has been highly critical of the now-expired independent counsel law and the Supreme Court’s decision upholding that statute. As a young lawyer, Kavanaugh was part of independent counsel Starr’s team. During oral arguments in Trump’s immunity case, Kavanaugh called the 1988 ruling known as Morrison v. Olson “one of the court’s biggest mistakes.”But Amar, the Yale law professor, said those concerns do not necessarily translate to the separate position Smith occupies. Like Kavanaugh, Amar is critical of the former law because it required a panel of judges to appoint the independent counsel. The special counsel process avoids that problem and offers an antidote, he said, because the prosecutor is selected by the executive branch and can be fired by the attorney general.Even as he and other legal experts predicted Cannon’s ruling would be overturned, Amar also said her legal future could be bright.If Trump is reelected and Republicans take control of the Senate, he said, Cannon could be tapped for the appeals court or even to the Supreme Court, if there is a vacancy.Perry Stein contributed to this report."
WaPo_45,How romance authors celebrate life and love with a disability,https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/07/20/how-romance-authors-celebrate-life-love-with-disability/,2024-07-20 20:00:02.705390,,"When Mimi Matthews’s bone fusion for a previous neck injury snapped over a decade ago, it reshaped her world. Her planned career in law? Out of reach. Her passion for riding horses? Out of the question. With a neck flare-up always on the horizon, Matthews was navigating an uncertain future, with limitations she’d never anticipated.But the traumatic injury did give her something: a love for writing, which she has since turned into a successful career as a best-selling historical romance novelist. “This injury is 100 percent what brought me back to writing,” Matthews says. “I have written every book that I have written from bed.”For Matthews, writing romance is a way to process the complicated emotions that come from living with a disability. Reading the genre “just reaffirms your belief that everything’s going to work out, and that it all means something … the things you’re going through. I feel that romance is incredibly valuable in that way,” she says.Matthews isn’t alone in finding comfort within the genre and its happy endings. Our media landscape isn’t known for its positive depictions of disabled people. But within romance novels, characters with disabilities are frequently shown as they are — worthy of love and intimacy. They have meet-cutes, epic love stories and good sex. And as the romance genre continues to diversify, more nuanced depictions of disability are making their way onto shelves.Now before we get ahead of ourselves, it’s worth noting that romance hasn’t always done the best job with disability representation. For decades, the genre reliably portrayed physical disability as a barrier to love — particularly for scarred war heroes within historical romance novels. According to Sarah Wendell, co-founder of the site Smart Bitches, Trashy Books, that trope was frequently used within the narrative as a shortcut to emotional growth for the hero.Wendell says disability was often seen as a character’s defining trait, which could be a little heavy-handed. It was used “to create sympathy for an otherwise abominably behaved character. And … that in itself is kind of ableist, because it’s like, ‘Oh, you’re only sympathetic because you are missing a piece of your body,’ or ‘you are having emotional difficulties.’” But things have changed in recent years. “I think we’ve moved away from ‘your disability as part of the conflict’ and moved to ‘any disability is actually just part of the character,’” Wendell says.That’s the case in Erica Ridley’s upcoming regency caper, “Hot Earl Summer.” The book follows Elizabeth Wynchester, an axe-wielding heroine with debilitating chronic pain who’s determined to defend a castle against a power-hungry aristocrat. Ridley says she approaches writing about disability like she approaches any type of diversity. “I wanted to write about queer characters, where the angst wasn’t that they were queer,” she says. “I feel kind of the same way about the disability. … It’s a part of who you are, just like any other aspect of your culture, religion or anything else.”Ridley also notes that traditional publishing wasn’t always open to romances about disability: “I definitely felt [writing about] rich, White, able-bodied aristocracy was the only way I was going to get published.” So, what changed? According to Ridley, industry conversation only shifted when the self-publishing boom proved there was a market for diverse romances.And as the market has grown, so have the types of disabilities we see on the page. “In the last, I would say, 10 years or so, we’re seeing a lot more about neurodivergence,” says Jayashree Kamblé, a professor of English who focuses on mass-market romance novels.Best-selling romance author Helen Hoang didn’t think much of making Stella, the protagonist of her first romance novel, “The Kiss Quotient,” autistic. She was stunned to see people felt otherwise. “It was shocking to me to think that it was extraordinary to write an autistic woman who wanted to have a life like everybody else,” Hoang says. While crafting the story, she drew on her own life experiences as a woman with autism. “I didn’t feel like I was being so, so outrageous and brave when I wrote the character, because she was coming from somewhere very familiar,” she says.Nevertheless, for Hoang, writing Stella was an act of self-love. “It was very healthy for me at the time to write a female character with autism … portraying it empathetically, and not as, kind of, an infantilized character that you need to feel bad for.”Romance readers connected with that. Some had spent years hungry for positive portrayals of disability and neurodivergence within the books they love. But sometimes that hunger translates into pressure to only depict differences in a positive light. Matthews says she’s felt that pressure. “I think in trying to be a zealous advocate for disability rep, sometimes an able-bodied person … is trying so hard to advocate for a certain level of acceptance that they do not allow for these lived experiences of people who have had a traumatic injury and [are] like, ‘I’m unhappy. I have lost something.’”While the genre has taken strides toward more nuanced disability representation, romances between two disabled characters are still rare. Author Hannah Bonam-Young was looking for that kind of story when she drafted “Out on a Limb,” which follows Win, a woman with a limb difference, and Bo, a man — and total dreamboat — with an amputated leg.Bonam-Young says it was important for her to write two disabled characters that had vastly different life experiences. “I wanted to point out that the disabled experience is varying,” she says. “I think, unfortunately, even with the best intentions, in some romances where only one of the leads is disabled and accommodations are necessary, it can become a bit preachy or it can become a bit like a how-to guide of how to love someone with a disability.”Ultimately, Bonam-Young wants to see more romances where disability is normalized. “I really hope we can kind of continue to move in this wave of more subtlety and more nuance, and less … perfectionism,” she says. “We’re just messy people who are in disabled bodies and making mistakes and, you know, falling in love.”In a society where disabled people are rarely protagonists, there’s power in making their love stories visible. Wendell concurs: “The message of romance is that you are lovable … that you don’t have to conform to some external standard to become lovable. You are lovable exactly as you are.”If you are interested in reading a romance featuring a character with a disability:Mimi Matthews recommends “The Arrangement,” by Mary BaloghErica Ridley recommends “Can’t Escape Love,” by Alyssa ColeHannah Bonam-Young recommends “Act Your Age, Eve Brown,” by Talia HibbertHelen Hoang recommends anything by Chloe LieseJayashree Kamblé recommends “The Spymaster’s Lady,” by Joanna BourneKalyani Saxena recommends “The Winter Companion,” by Mimi MatthewsKalyani Saxena is a journalist and writer covering romance and fantasy.

WaPo_46,Toll in Bangladesh protests tops 100 as Dhaka falls quiet under curfew,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/20/bangladesh-protests-violence-students/,2024-07-20 21:53:02.855413,,"DHAKA, Bangladesh — Life in the Bangladeshi capital ground to a halt Saturday as the government enforced a curfew to quell violent clashes between student protesters and security forces.Shops and businesses were closed and roads were largely empty in the typically congested city of 10 million people, save for military and paramilitary personnel on patrol. Late on Saturday, scattered street battles were reported across Dhaka. Sweeping restrictions on the internet imposed on Thursday remained in place.According to a Washington Post tally of hospital and police reports, at least 110 people have been killed in the demonstrations over the past four days — the most of any protests in Bangladesh in over a decade. Police forces said several of their personnel are among the dead. Thousands of others have been wounded.Mohammed Abir, a medical examiner at the morgue at Dhaka Medical College hospital, said he received 33 bodies Friday evening.The U.N. humans rights chief, Volker Türk, on Friday called the violence “shocking and unacceptable” and urged restraint. There needs to be “impartial, prompt and exhaustive investigations” into the attacks against students, he said, adding that he was especially worried about the actions of the government’s paramilitary police units, “which have long track records of violations.”Stories to keep you informed

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.Dhaka and several other major Bangladeshi cities have been engulfed this past week by protests against a new governmental policy of reserving a portion of civil service jobs for specific groups, including descendants of the nation’s freedom fighters. The quota system, seen as unfair, has fueled explosive anger toward the government under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which has deployed increasingly draconian methods to quell the unrest.Leaders of the student protest movement told reporters they met with government officials Saturday to convey a list of demands, including an overhaul of the job quota system, the resignation of certain cabinet ministers and immediate trials for those responsible for the killing of students.The government must release student protesters who have been arrested, Abdullah Saleheen, a student activist, said in an interview. “Until that happens our protests will continue,” he added.Calls on Saturday from The Post to the Bangladeshi Foreign Ministry and Home Affairs Ministry, as well as the U.S. Embassy in Dhaka, went unanswered.On Friday, protesters stormed a jail in the district of Narsingdi, northeast of the capital, freeing hundreds of inmates. Police posts across Dhaka were set on fire as paramilitary and military forces deployed tear gas, rubber bullets and smoke bombs to disperse large crowds.At the end of the night, the government announced a nationwide curfew, ordering people to stay home until Sunday 10 a.m. local time. There was a two-hour window on Saturday from noon to 2 p.m. for public movement.Internet services have been shut down and mobile services disrupted in a near-total “blackout” that has left much of the country’s 170 million people unreachable. Banks have reported disruptions in operations.Bangladeshi officials say they have slowed internet connectivity to stop the spread of misinformation. But in a letter, a coalition of more than 300 digital rights groups said it is likely to have the opposite effect by reducing people’s ability to counteract misinformation and spurring panic. “Government agencies have a duty to ensure that people can access open, secure, and unrestricted internet when they need it the most,” the #KeepItOn coalition wrote.Another digital rights advocacy group, Asia Internet Coalition, urged Bangladesh “to consider the serious impact of its action on its people and the country’s reputation as an investment destination.”Several of the biggest companies in the textile industry, a major contributor to Bangladesh’s economy, said they would close their factories on Sunday. Hasina has canceled a preplanned trip to Europe to deal with the unrest, her office said.Tan reported from Singapore."
WaPo_47,Biden family grapples with pressure on their patriarch to step aside,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/20/biden-family-grapples-biden-calls-withdraw/,2024-07-20 22:27:02.760435,,"President Biden had just arrived back at the White House following a weekend at Camp David with his family, walking through the doors from the South Lawn shortly after 7 p.m. He had 45 minutes before he was to deliver remarks about the Supreme Court’s decision to grant immunity to Donald Trump for official acts he took as president.The president motioned to his son Hunter, who was standing nearby, asking him to listen and join the fine-tuning of the remarks that would be loaded into the teleprompter and delivered to a nation that had grown deeply skeptical of the president’s mental acuity in the aftermath of a stumbling, meandering debate performance four nights prior.Hunter’s presence that evening raised eyebrows among some White House staffers, who saw it as a troubling sign that a politically problematic family member was taking a renewed part in official business. But for those in and close to the family, it was the latest sign that Hunter had stabilized his life and was assuming a role he’d long held inside his father’s orbit as a confidant and sounding board.As remarkable as the past few weeks have been in the wider political universe, they have been equally turbulent inside the tight-knit Biden family, unfolding as the latest chapter in the clan’s long story of resolve amid tumult. Family members have flashed through a range of emotions, people close to them say — sadness, anger, determination — and are deeply frustrated by what they see as the betrayal and second-guessing of a man who has spent a half-century as a dedicated leader of the Democratic Party.This picture of the Biden family in its patriarch’s hour of peril is based on interviews with multiple people with direct knowledge of the family’s thinking and private actions. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters related to the president’s inner circle.Family members have often been with Biden in recent weeks as he seeks to ride out the political storm stemming from his debate performance. First lady Jill Biden joined him for a campaign swing in Pennsylvania. After he was diagnosed with covid-19 on Wednesday and with calls escalating by the day that he reconsider his decision to stay in the race, she joined him at their home in Rehoboth Beach, Del.Hunter, who lives in California, flew out to meet Biden when the president was in Las Vegas recently for campaign events. They have remained in close contact, with Hunter following daily, often hourly, developments, on calls with his father and acting as a sounding board and a gut check. Other family members have been exchanging their usual daily phone calls and frequent text messages.But in a family where any member can call an emergency meeting, no one has summoned the clan to discuss the patriarch’s political future, despite the extensive speculation from outsiders about some grand family council.The family’s anger is driven in part by a conviction that Biden could have moved beyond a bad performance in a 90-minute debate if so many Democrats had not immediately joined forces against him. They have come to view the past few weeks as a Game of Thrones-style war among various factions of the party, with the loudest calling on him to depart coming from those he has fought against in previous battles. The tone some in the party are taking in their effort to push him out has only stiffened Biden’s resolve to stay in, they say.“It’s like they don’t know he’s Irish,” said one person close to the family.The most striking development in this private world may be the return of Hunter Biden to a central, supporting role, just weeks after his criminal trial made him a source of personal worry and political peril.When he was convicted on June 11 of felony charges related to lying on a gun-purchase form, the family rallied behind him. His father called to make sure he was okay, then flew to Wilmington to embrace him on an airport tarmac.But overnight, the father-son roles have been reversed: As Joe Biden fights for his political life, Hunter has talked with his father frequently, providing support amid a clamor of skeptical Democrats.Interviews with several people close to family members say that, contrary to frequent depictions of Hunter and Jill Biden as irrational cheerleaders prevailing on the president to stay in while his political advisers press him to reconsider, the family dynamics are far more nuanced. The president throughout has been clear that he is not withdrawing, and they have affirmed all along that they are behind him no matter what. Biden may yet change his mind, and those close to the family say they would support that decision, too.When it comes to Hunter Biden, the past few weeks have shown how a father and a son, each well-versed in tragedy and trauma, have handled a series of extraordinary difficult moments, their own and each other’s.“The thing both of them care about more than anything else is not harming the other,” said one person close to the family. “It all has a Shakespearean quality to it.”On June 11, at around 11:15 a.m., a federal jury in Delaware found Hunter Biden guilty of felony gun charges. His crime was lying on a form when he bought a gun in 2018, but the week-long trial laid bare, in sometimes painful detail, his humiliating and distasteful behavior when he was in the throes of a drug addiction.Hunter hugged each member of his legal team after the verdict, thanking them and comforting his top defense attorney, Abbe Lowell, and whispering, “It’s all right.”He then gathered with his friends and family in a crowded room nearby for what several who were there describe as an emotional scene where Hunter was stoic even as many were in tears after a devastating verdict that shocked some in his camp.“Look guys, I’m going to be okay. This isn’t hell,” Hunter said, according to people who were there. “My addiction was hell. Whatever happens, I’m standing here today, and that’s what matters.”The president, who was in Washington, called his son and hastily made plans to fly to Wilmington to see Hunter. They met on the tarmac at Delaware Air National Guard base, embracing each other before Hunter flew back to his home in Los Angeles with his wife and young son, Beau.That evening, the president and first lady personally called some of those who had attended the trial to thank them and to ask how they thought Hunter was doing.The answers that came back were that he seemed surprisingly strong. It was an unquestionably significant legal setback, one that could result in a prison sentence, but he seemed to have achieved some sense of personal stability.Joe Biden soon left for the Group of Seven conference in Italy, joined by several of Hunter’s older daughters, including Naomi, who had testified at the trial.About two weeks later, as the president’s fateful debate performance played out in Atlanta, Hunter was home in California. Jill Biden was with her husband. Biden’s grandchildren were scattered around the country.Afterward, they knew the debate had not gone well and worried about the impression it left. But it did not alter their approach to the campaign.Many outside the family thought Biden faced an immediate decision about whether to stay in the race, but that seems never to have been a question for the president himself. He saw the debate simply as a setback in an otherwise sound campaign, a hurdle in a life full of them. That attitude was adopted by the family largely without discussion.“There is no walking into this as if he’s like, ‘Should I get out, should I not get out?' That’s just not who Joe Biden is,” said one person close to the family. “It’s not like he was teetering until he talked to Hunter and Jill.”By late Saturday night, some 48 hours after the debate, the whole family was at Camp David — not for some emergency council, but for a prearranged gathering in the days before Independence Day. Just weeks earlier, the question was how Hunter was faring against his detractors; now it was how Joe would face his.The tone of that weekend, in private moments without political advisers, set the course for the tumultuous weeks to come: Biden was staying in and the family was backing him. The question was how to proceed with the race, not whether to.Many in the family, like their patriarch, believe the election remains close. They dismiss polls that show otherwise and do not believe an alternative candidate would fare any better against Trump. Deep in Biden’s psyche is the conviction that he is an underdog who has consistently been underestimated by party leaders, only to prove them wrong.But family members resist the idea that they are the ones driving the decision. They resent any notion that they are propping up the president. He is capable of making these weighty decisions as he always has, they say, with their input and backing.There is also a redemptive quality to the family discussions.Five years ago, when Biden decided to run for president, the family was deeply fractured in the aftermath of his son Beau’s death, dealing with divorce, affairs and addiction. Hunter was in some ways more distant from his father than he’d ever been.This post-debate gathering at Camp David showcased a family that was largely united, with Hunter as present in his father’s life as he was before a drug addiction tore him away.When they returned to the White House after the weekend at Camp David, the family stayed close. They celebrated the Fourth of July together. Ashley Biden was dancing on the portico, hugging her father’s waist from behind. One granddaughter, Maisy, wore a white T-shirt with “I [heart] Joe” written on it.Jill stood by his side. They looked on as fireworks burst in the sky.Hunter flew back to Los Angeles on July 5 and his father flew to Wisconsin for a campaign event. They have remained in close contact.Biden remains certain he is the party’s best option, according to those close to the family, and they support him in that. But they also recognize that things can change quickly in politics and that Biden could be 100 percent in until he’s 100 percent out.“Hunter would support anything his dad wanted to do and he trusts his dad’s judgment,” one person close to the family said. “If his dad said, ‘I can hand this off and I can’t do it,’ Hunter would say, ‘Dad you’re the best, I love you, I trust you and I support you.’”Of anyone in the family, Hunter has faced the most scrutiny as a result of his father’s presidency. That arguably gives him an incentive to hope his father pulls out rather than endure a vitriolic reelection race potentially followed by four more years of an unwelcome spotlight.But if Biden pulled out and Trump were to win, some family members worry that he would use the Justice Department to target Hunter.In recent days, those close to the family have become more combative as a growing number of Democrats have publicly called for him to step aside. If Biden gets out, they say, he should make the decision based on his own political gut and not because of external pressures from figures such as George Clooney, former president Barack Obama or former House speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).Still, those in the family orbit say Biden’s relatives are not oblivious to the storms roaring around him, making the days ahead, even for them, difficult to predict.“They are not in a bubble. They don’t have their head in the sand,” one person close to the family said. “They’ve been very clear-eyed about this from the beginning. And that has continued.”"
WaPo_48,Disneyland Park employees vote to authorize potential strike,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2024/07/20/disneyland-vote-strike-unions-california/,2024-07-20 22:19:02.760435,,"Disney workers in Southern California overwhelmingly voted to authorize a strike after the unions representing them accused the company of unfair labor practices during ongoing contract negotiations.The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Local 324, one of four unions that together represent 14,000 workers at Disneyland, Disney California Adventure, Downtown Disney and the Disney hotels, said in a statement late Friday that 99 percent of the coalition’s members who voted backed a strike. It did not reveal how many members took part in the vote.The decision does not necessarily mean that workers will go on strike but provides the option to do so if further talks fail. UFCW Local 324 said the unions are set to meet with Disney again on Monday and Tuesday, adding that “a strike is always a last resort.”“We greatly appreciate the important roles our cast members play in creating memorable experiences for our guests,” Disneyland said in a statement, “and we remain committed to reaching an agreement that focuses on what matters most to them while positioning Disneyland Resort for growth and job creation.”The company added that the strike authorization “is not unusual as part of a negotiations process” and said that Disneyland Resort “continues to welcome guests.”On Wednesday, more than 1,000 union members held a rally outside the entrance to Disneyland Resort, according to a union statement.“We’re make the magic for guests,” Dee Dee Miranda, a candymaker at Disneyland and a member of the bargaining committee, said in the statement. “We are the ones to provide them with a once in a lifetime experience. It’s time for Disney to value what we do.”In addition to the UFCW 324, the other three unions representing the workers are the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers Local 83; the Service Employees International Union-United Service Workers West and the Teamsters Local 495.The unions, which represent workers from custodians and ride operators to candymakers and merchandise clerks, began negotiations over contract issues including wages and attendance policies in April. They say that 28 percent of Disney employees surveyed this year report food insecurity, while a third have reported experiencing housing insecurity.The unions have since accused Disney of unlawful discipline, intimidation and surveillance of more than 675 union members they say “have been intimidated, surveilled and disciplined for wearing union buttons in support of their contract campaign” during the talks."

WaPo_50,Trump and Vance set to speak at first rally since assassination attempt,https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/07/20/trump-vance-michigan-rally-grand-rapids/,2024-07-21 01:39:03.007022,,"GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Former president Donald Trump is set to hold his first rally since his attempted assassination at another campaign event, joined by his newly announced running mate, J.D. Vance.Trump and Vance, the Republican senator from Ohio, are expected to speak Saturday evening at Van Andel Arena in Grand Rapids, appearing exactly one week after a gunman opened fire at Trump’s rally in Butler, Pa. with an AR-style rifle. The attack killed one audience member, injured others and left Trump with a bloody ear, instantly creating a shocking and iconic election-year scene in which Trump pumped his fist and shouted “Fight!” as Secret Service officers rushed him offstage.Now, Trump is coming off his formal nomination at the Republican National Convention in perhaps his strongest political position this campaign cycle, with some Democrats pushing to remove President Biden last-minute from their ticket and Republicans full of optimism.Despite the violence last week, Trump supporters queued up in long lines early Saturday to hear from their official ticket.The Grand Rapids event will be Trump and Vance’s first rally as running mates and underscores the Trump team’s hopes that Vance’s Ohio upbringing and populist message will help them win the neighboring swing states of Michigan and Pennsylvania. Accepting his nomination for vice president at the GOP convention in Milwaukee this past week, Vance took the stage to Merle Haggard’s “America First” and told a story of family hardship in a small town.Saturday’s rally is taking place with extra safety precautions. The event was moved indoors after the shooting at an open-air event because an arena is easier to secure, The Washington Post previously reported, and Trump’s campaign does not expect to hold any more outdoor rallies soon. Secret Service sought additional help from local law enforcement as well.“They will be on heightened security obviously,” Kent County commissioner Walter Bujak told The Post. “They’re going to dot the i’s and cross the t’s for this one.”Trump’s campaign signaled in an event advisory that the former president will focus on Biden’s economic and border policies, attacking him for inflation and an influx of undocumented immigrants during his term.Biden’s campaign held a news conference Saturday ahead of the Grand Rapids rally to assail Trump’s agenda, saying it would hurt workers while giving breaks to the wealthy. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) shared a video with her “welcome” message for Trump and Vance, saying that “here, we protect reproductive freedom” and making other digs at Trump’s policies.But Democrats’ own turmoil has been a growing distraction. A dozen more Democratic lawmakers called on Biden to pull out of the presidential race on Friday alone, indicating a party still deeply unsettled by Biden’s struggle to hold his train of thought at a June 27 and other stumbles.A bout of covid-19 has also taken Biden off the campaign trail while Trump and Vance plan a bundle of events coming out of the Republican convention.On Monday afternoon, Vance will hold a rally in his hometown of Middletown, Ohio. Then he will head to a Monday evening rally in Radford, Va. — a signal of the Trump campaign’s continued efforts to expand the map of competitive states to places where Democrats usually prevail in the presidential race. Biden won Virginia by 10 points in 2020.Trump plans to speak at a rally in Charlotte on Wednesday evening.Trump, appearing at the convention with a bandage on his ear, used his speech to call for unity after last week’s rally shooting. “The discord and division in our society must be healed,” he said.But after recounting the assassination attempt and attributing his survival to divine intervention, Trump mostly returned to his usual material. He jabbed at “crazy Nancy Pelosi” and alluded to his false claims the 2020 election was stolen from him — “that horrible, horrible result that we’ll never let happen again.”Knowles reported from Washington."
WaPo_51,Israel strikes Yemen after Houthis claimed drone attack in Tel Aviv,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/20/israel-yemen-hodeida-drone-tel-aviv/,2024-07-21 01:21:03.007022,,"Israel said Saturday that it had carried out airstrikes on a port city in Yemen controlled by the Houthi militant group, in an attack that sparked massive fires and caused deaths and injuries, the Israel Defense Forces and the Houthi-run Masirah news channel said.The attack came a day after the Houthis, an Iranian-allied group, claimed responsibility for a rare drone attack on Tel Aviv that killed one person and struck just yards from a U.S. Embassy branch office.A brief IDF statement Saturday said that its jets had struck “military targets of the Houthi terrorist regime” in the port of the city, Al-Hodeida, in response to “hundreds of attacks” carried out against Israel in recent months. The Hodeida strikes were approved at a rare Saturday Sabbath emergency cabinet meeting called in the afternoon, according to Israeli media reports.The United States and Britain have been carrying out airstrikes in Yemen for months, in an unsuccessful bid to end Houthi attacks on maritime traffic in the Red Sea. Israel’s attack Saturday heralded a further expansion of the war in Gaza, and added a volatile new dynamic to what has become a building regional conflict.Stories to keep you informed

Mohammed Abdulsalam, a Houthi spokesman, writing on X, said the strikes Saturday “will not deter the Yemeni people or its brave armed forces, but only increase their determination and steadfastness in supporting Gaza.”The Israeli attacks, he added, had targeted “civilian facilities, oil depots and the electricity station” in Hodeida, an impoverished city that serves as a lifeline for imports to northern Yemen, as well as a critical source of revenue for the Houthis, a militant group from northern Yemen that has taken control of large swaths of the country during a civil war that started a decade ago.Footage of the aftermath of Saturday’s strikes showed black smoke billowing from massive fires in the port, and residents in Hodeida bathed in an orange glow as they watched. Al-Masirah quoted the Ministry of Health as saying that the strikes had caused an unspecified number of deaths and injuries and that a number of people were “severely burned” as result of the attacks. The channel aired footage from what appeared to be a hospital, of injured people on gurneys lining a hallway."
WaPo_52,Democratic donors funding an effort to vet potential VP candidates,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/20/democrat-donors-fund-vp-vetting-push/,2024-07-21 03:52:02.832867,,"Major Democratic donors are funding a preliminary vetting process for potential vice-presidential nominees should President Biden exit the race, according to four people familiar with the process, suggesting that influential figures in the party are growing increasingly restless and concerned about the time remaining to mount a national campaign.In recent days, people involved in the effort have contacted the teams of top Democratic figures, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive effort. The donors are also interested in vetting North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly.It is unclear if the subjects of the vetting are participating in the effort, which is independent of the Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee. A vetting process typically includes a deep review of a potential candidate’s governing record, public statements, personal finances and other personal and private activities to help decision-makers weigh the potential risks of each selection, but the specifics of this particular effort are not known.The Biden campaign and a spokesperson for Shapiro declined to comment. Spokespeople for Beshear and Whitmer did not respond to requests for comment.A person familiar with Kelly’s political operation was unaware of outreach from outside donors involving any sort of vetting for the Democratic ticket. Kelly has heard from many supporters since the presidential debate urging him to seek higher office, the person said, but “what they are hearing back is, Kelly supports Biden and Harris.”Vetting potential vice-presidential candidates usually takes months, so the group of donors, who have not been identified, decided to begin that process earlier this month. If Biden drops out, many Democrats believe Vice President Harris would become the front-runner to replace him, and should she secure the nomination, she would have to select a running mate under a compressed timeline to ensure the Democratic ticket meets all state ballot deadlines. The vice president has repeatedly said she fully supports Biden as the party’s nominee.One potential pitfall of the donor-run process is that its sponsors could be barred from directly coordinating with the Democratic presidential campaign, under election laws designed to ensure campaigns’ independence. That means the donors would likely have to share their findings in a public manner in order for the campaign to benefit from them.Yet such vetting is usually guided by strict confidentiality, in part to ensure the privacy of the individuals involved. It is not clear how the donors might navigate that hurdle.In recent weeks, Harris has appeared with many of the Democrats who are being eyed as potential running mates should she take over the top of the ticket. A day after the debate, Harris was in Nevada with Kelly. She has twice appeared at campaign events in North Carolina with Cooper, and she campaigned with Shapiro last weekend in Pennsylvania.Biden, who is isolating in Rehoboth Beach, Del., after contracting covid-19, remains publicly defiant, insisting he will return to the campaign trail next week after recovering from the virus. His campaign has responded to mounting calls for him to drop out of the presidential race by announcing new events designed to show that he has no plans to step aside. His campaign has 10 scheduled fundraisers over the last 10 days of July.Saturday began relatively quietly for Biden, after a dramatic Friday when a dozen lawmakers called for the president to step aside, but his allies were bracing for more such calls next week and seeking to showcase his determination to continue his campaign. The renewed push by Biden’s allies sets up a potential collision in the coming days between the president’s campaign and lawmakers who have urged him to leave the race by this weekend.On Saturday, Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.) added his name to a list of Democrats going public with their calls for Biden to withdraw, after previously expressing that sentiment privately.“Joe, I love and respect you,” Takano said in his statement, which called for Harris to take over as the Democratic presidential candidate. “But the stakes are too high to fail. It’s time to pass the torch to Kamala.”The Washington Post reported two weeks ago that Takano had privately called for Biden to step aside. Several more Democrats are weighing taking the step of turning their private desire for a Biden exit into a public declaration.Some have suggested they are on the cusp of doing so next week if Biden does not signal by Monday that he is moving to drop out of the race. Biden allies are urging fellow Democrats to give the president time to reach a decision on his own, but some lawmakers say privately they may be forced to take the dramatic step of coming out against their party’s presumptive nominee months before the November election because Biden has remained defiant.On Saturday, a group of Democratic donors planned to host a virtual fundraiser for Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.) and Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Mich.), all of whom have called for Biden to step aside, according to an individual involved in the effort. Some of the donors previously hosted Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minn.) after she called for Biden to step aside.“It’s just another indication that donors are ready and willing to support” incumbents who call for Biden to end his campaign for reelection, the donor said.But Biden’s campaign is suggesting he will be ramping up his activity in the days ahead, as aides attempt to show that he is determined to forge ahead with his reelection drive. The president is expected to travel to Austin, Tex., to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act next week. The event, originally scheduled for July 15, was postponed after the attempted assassination of Republican nominee Donald Trump.Biden is also preparing for a critical visit to Washington by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is scheduled to address a joint session of Congress on Wednesday. The two leaders have had a tense relationship, and Netanyahu’s handling of the war in Gaza has further soured things between them.Prior to his covid-19 diagnosis last Wednesday, Biden was planning to visit multiple states in the coming week to showcase his vigor and prosecute the case against Trump. While he said in a statement Friday that he still plans to return to the campaign trail within days, his doctor said he continues to battle a hoarse voice and loose cough, symptoms that could make it difficult for him to make his case to the public.The White House declared a “lid” on Saturday morning, indicating that Biden would not have any public activity before Sunday. The president was last seen in public on Wednesday, when he traveled to his Rehoboth Beach home to isolate after testing positive.The White House has said Biden’s symptoms are improving, and he has held calls with foreign leaders and received briefings from staff in private.He has also been joined by a small group of longtime aides, including senior adviser Steve Ricchetti, who has been fielding some of the calls from lawmakers concerned about Biden’s candidacy.During Biden’s isolation, the efforts to push him aside have intensified.The flood of a dozen statements by lawmakers Friday urging Biden to drop out of the race prompted a shift in tone from the campaign, which had often met such calls with defiance and at one point dismissed Democrats with concerns as the “bed-wetting brigade.” On Friday, the campaign suggested it respects those with different opinions on the best path forward — which now includes close to 40 Democratic members of Congress — even as it disagrees with them.“While the majority of the caucus and the diverse base of the party continues to stand with the president and his historic record of delivering for their communities, we’re clear-eyed that the urgency and stakes of beating Donald Trump means others feel differently,” a campaign spokesperson said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. “We all share the same goal.”If Biden steps aside, though, there is no guarantee that Harris would be the nominee. Many Democrats who fear a messy process to replace him, however, support the idea. In private conversations earlier this month, members of the Congressional Black Caucus made clear that they would immediately back Harris if Biden were to step aside.But some Democrats worry about the appearance of immediately crowning Harris without input from rank-and-file party members. Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), former House speaker, is among those in that camp, expressing her concerns to fellow members of California Democratic House delegation during a luncheon on July 10.Pelosi did not oppose Harris ultimately becoming the nominee, according to two people familiar with the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private conversation. Instead, she cautioned that elected Democrats and voters might be angered by the appearance of “party elites” forcing Biden out of office only to immediately crown a nominee.Harris is 59, while Biden is 81 and Trump is 78, so she would quickly bring a younger face to the top of the Democratic ticket. But some Democrats argue that she would benefit from a nomination process that would allow Democrats to show enthusiasm for her candidacy. Pelosi also made clear that should Harris become the nominee, California’s Democratic House delegation would use its outsize influence to build support for her.Olorunnipa reported from Rehoboth Beach, Del. and Wingett Sanchez reported from Phoenix.

WaPo_53,Trump releases letter detailing medical care since assassination attempt,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/20/donald-trump-shoot-ear/,2024-07-21 05:30:02.799908,,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump shared a letter signed by Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Tex.) on Saturday detailing the care he has received since last weekend’s assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.The letter marks the most extensive medical information Trump’s team has shared publicly about the care he received after the assassination attempt.Jackson wrote that he has evaluated and treated Trump’s wound on his ear daily. Jackson is a former White House physician who has remained a close Trump political ally since leaving the White House and later successfully running for Congress.Jackson stated that Trump sustained a 2 cm wide wound “that extended down the cartilaginous surface of the ear.” No sutures were required for Trump’s wound, Jackson said, but “there is still intermittent bleeding requiring a dressing to be in place.”That dressing, a white square of gauze, was visible at the top third of Trump’s ear throughout the convention. It also became a symbol for Trump supporters who sported makeshift bandages atop their right ears on the convention floor in solidarity with the former president.Jackson also noted that the trauma initially caused bleeding and swelling, but that the swelling has since resolved and the wound was beginning to “heal properly.”The memo, shared by Trump online on Truth Social, also provides new details about the medical care Trump received at Butler Memorial Hospital in Butler, Pa., immediately after the assassination attempt.Along with treating his wound, Jackson wrote, medical staff at the hospital “provided a thorough evaluation for additional injuries that included a CT [scan] of his head.”In a speech Thursday night in Milwaukee accepting the Republican nomination for president, Trump dramatically recounted the experience of narrowly missing a would-be assassin’s bullet at the Pennsylvania rally, saying he would describe what happened only once because it was “too painful to tell.”As he turned his head to the right to see a chart on display at the rally, he recalled, “I started to turn to my right, and was ready to begin a further turn — which I’m lucky I didn’t — when I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me, really hard, on my right ear.”“I said to myself, ‘Wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet,’ — and moved my right hand to my ear, brought it down, and my hand was covered with blood,” he continued. “I immediately knew it was very serious, that we were under attack.”Jackson said in the memo that Trump “will have further evaluations, including a comprehensive hearing exam, as needed.”“He will follow up with his primary care physician, as directed by the doctors that initially evaluated him,” Jackson continued, adding that he will be at the former president’s side “throughout the weekend to provide any medical assistance he needs.”Jackson, who served as White House physician to both Trump and former president Barack Obama, garnered scrutiny for his glowing praise of Trump’s health in 2018, when he said that Trump had “incredibly good genes.”The Washington Post confirmed earlier this year that the Navy demoted Jackson in July 2022 after a damaging Pentagon inspector general’s report that substantiated allegations about his inappropriate behavior as a White House physician.In Congress, Jackson has been staunchly pro-Trump and demanded that President Biden take a drug test before his CNN debate with Trump in June.Hannah Knowles contributed to this report."
WaPo_54,U.S. basketball barely avoids shocking upset against South Sudan,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/20/usa-basketball-south-sudan-exhibition/,2024-07-21 05:21:02.799908,,"Though South Sudan has never competed in the Olympics in men’s basketball and its roster lacks a current NBA player, the African nation of less than 13 million nearly turned in one of the biggest upsets in international basketball history Saturday against the United States.With the Paris Games just days away, the mighty Americans needed a late basket from LeBron James to hold off South Sudan, 101-100, during an exhibition at London’s O2 arena. The Americans, who are the odds-on favorites to win their fifth straight Olympic gold medal, were favored by 43½ points over South Sudan, which became an independent nation in 2011 following a lengthy civil war and made its major international basketball tournament debut at the 2023 FIBA World Cup.James hit a go-ahead layup driving to his left with eight seconds remaining, and South Sudan missed three shots to pull off a monumental upset on its final possession. James led the Americans with 25 points to go with six rebounds and seven assists.“I like those ones better than the blowouts,” James said as he walked off the court. “At least we get tested. I like getting tested, baby. I like being tested. Those are the best ones.”For the United States, the narrow win exposed several issues that could prove problematic when it opens group-stage play against Serbia on July 28. The Americans fell behind by 16 points in the first half as their starting lineup, featuring Joel Embiid at center, continued to struggle with slow starts and poor ball movement. South Sudan handily won the outside shooting battle, going 14 for 33 (42.4 percent) on three-pointers compared to the Americans’ 7-for-28 shooting (25 percent). And the Americans’ star-studded roster, led by James and Stephen Curry, committed 12 turnovers, many of them inexplicable.“It was a good reminder that when we play against teams, it’s the biggest game of their lives,” Coach Steve Kerr said. “We have to expect everyone to play like that. We let our guard down as a team and as a staff, for sure. What we’ve learned with USA Basketball is that the gap has closed.”Saturday’s exhibition was the fourth of five showcase games for the Americans before the Olympics. They beat Canada, Australia and Serbia in the first three, but their chemistry wasn’t always sharp as Kerr experimented with starting lineups and unorthodox rotations.If not for a dominant third quarter, which the Americans won 37-18 to erase a 14-point halftime deficit and take a lead into the final period, James never would have had the chance to play hero. Kerr elected to start five bench players to open the third quarter, a decision that paid dividends with a 14-4 run that shifted the momentum.Even so, the Americans, who nearly blew a 24-point second-half lead against Australia on Monday in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, flirted with pain again. They led by seven points with under two minutes to play, but South Sudan’s Marial Shayok made a three-pointer and a jumper to cut the lead to two. JT Thor, a second-round pick in the 2021 NBA draft who played for the Charlotte Hornets last season but is now a free agent, drilled a three-pointer to give South Sudan a 100-99 lead with 20 seconds left.Kerr, who had seen Curry miss two jumpers and Anthony Davis miss a shot near the rim in the closing stretch, put the ball in James’s hands for the Americans’ final possession. He wasted no time driving to the rim for the go-ahead basket, and the U.S. team held on for dear life on the other end.“South Sudan was amazing,” Kerr said. “I did not do a great job preparing our team. We did not focus enough on what [South Sudan was] capable of. That’s on me. That really allowed South Sudan to gain confidence early. ... The ending was good for us, just to feel what it’s going to be like in Paris.”Carlik Jones, a former NBA player who has played for Dallas, Denver and Chicago, missed a pull-up jumper, and Wenyen Gabriel, another former NBA player, couldn’t connect on two putback attempts before time expired. Jones had 15 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists for South Sudan. Shayok added 24 points, including six three-pointers.The U.S. men will face Germany on Monday in London to complete their exhibition schedule. After facing Serbia in its Olympic opener, the Americans get a rematch with South Sudan on July 31."
WaPo_55,Saturday’s hottest runway isn’t in Paris. It’s the WNBA All Star ‘tunnel.’,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/20/wnba-outfits-fashion-all-star-game/,2024-07-21 05:00:02.799908,,"Saturday’s WNBA All-Star Game will put rival rookie sensations Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese on the same team, a marquee pairing for a league whose popularity is skyrocketing.But some of the attention will come before the game, in a “tunnel” at the Phoenix Convention Center, where the country’s premier players are expected to show off some eye-catching looks.WNBA fashion has gained momentum for a few years, thanks to avant-garde trendsetters A’ja Wilson, Kelsey Plum and Skylar Diggins-Smith. It’s a big shift from the late 1990s and early 2000s, when players and coaches almost exclusively wore traditional business clothes, often assimilating with masculine flair (male NBA players had their own fashion crisis at the time, according to SB Nation).Now strutting down WNBA tunnels — sports parlance for entrances to game day arenas — chic menswear-inspired looks are mixed in with microminis, six-inch pumps and leather trench coats.Fashion’s bible, Vogue, has tuned in and designated the WNBA tunnel a new runway, and Saturday night’s All Star Game has the makings of a pregame fashion show.April’s draft started 2024 with No. 1 pick Caitlin Clark wearing a structured satin shirt from Prada and a crystal crop top. Before her season-ending ACL injury, second-overall choice Cameron Brink wore a sleek ultramodern one-shoulder black gown with cutouts, while No. 7 Angel Reese wore an awards-show-worthy shimmery gunmetal dress with a hood by Australian label Bronx and Banco.WNBA players make a fraction of what their male counterparts earn. Fashion — and the lucrative brand endorsements that can come with it — could boost earning potential for the league’s players.The promise of new endorsements for athletes, and more attention on the WNBA in general, prompted Christopher Ruff to create the WNBA League Fits social media account. Ruff has been a WNBA fan since he watched Los Angeles Sparks player Lisa Leslie two decades ago and in 2021 he started to think about how he could help draw more fans to the league.“Fashion can be used as the first step to get people to look and put more eyes on the actual product, which is the game,” Ruff said.A player’s outfit can communicate their personality and creativity, which can resonate with those who don’t normally watch basketball. Tunnel fashion is the individual glamour before the game-wear conformity.A post shared by Rickea Jackson ♡ (@r.ickea)But many athletes don’t have the luxury of big-name fashion houses knocking on their door, so they’re getting creative. WNBA stylists are hustling to source Italian fabrics and tailor looks to players who don’t have big-brand sponsorship, said fashion publicist Velissa Vaughn, who runs an Instagram account focused on WNBA tunnel looks.“They just want to really embrace their creativity, their self-expression,” Vaughn told The Post.Some, such as Napheesa Collier, prioritize emerging brands that are women- or Black-owned, or that are carried by locally owned boutiques in lieu of sourcing the same look from major retailers.The rising popularity is good for emerging designers, said Vaughn, and for the fashion-forward athletes.“To see what it’s like now, the respect and the admiration from pop culture and society is so rewarding,” Vaughn said, “because these players are really killing it in so many different ways than just on the court.”"
WaPo_56,Trump and Vance appearing at first rally since assassination attempt,https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/07/20/trump-vance-michigan-rally-grand-rapids/,2024-07-21 05:02:02.799908,,"GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Former president Donald Trump is set to hold his first rally since his attempted assassination at another campaign event, joined by his newly announced running mate, J.D. Vance.Trump and Vance, the Republican senator from Ohio, are appearing in Grand Rapids exactly one week after a gunman opened fire at Trump’s rally in Butler, Pa. with an AR-style rifle. The attack killed one audience member, injured others and left Trump with a bloody ear, instantly creating a shocking and iconic election-year scene in which Trump pumped his fist and shouted “Fight!” as Secret Service officers rushed him offstage.Now, Trump is coming off his formal nomination at the Republican National Convention in perhaps his strongest political position this campaign cycle, with some Democrats pushing to remove President Biden last-minute from their ticket and Republicans full of optimism.The Grand Rapids event is  Trump and Vance’s first rally as running mates and underscores the Trump team’s hopes that Vance’s Ohio upbringing and populist message will help them win the neighboring swing states of Michigan and Pennsylvania. Speaking for just over 10 minutes Saturday afternoon ahead of Trump’s remarks, Vance highlighted his roots in a “working class family” that struggled with addiction and said he viewed both political parties as “broken” for a long time.He laid out the “America First” and isolationist ideas he has championed in a changing GOP. He rebuked leaders across the political spectrum he said had allowed American jobs to be outsourced and suggested the U.S. should pick its foreign entanglements more carefully.“There’s nothing radical about having a strong national security that when we go to the war, we punch and we punch hard, but being cautious, and not trying to get America involved in every far-flung corner and conflict of the world,” Vance said. “Sometimes, my friends, it just is none of our business and we oughta stay out of it.” The crowd cheered.Despite the violence last week, Trump supporters queued up in long lines early Saturday to hear from their official ticket. Many rally attendees wore shirts with Trump’s words after the assassination attempt — “fight, fight, fight” — or with photos of Trump raising his fist, and a few sported ear bandages meant to mimic the one Trump had at the GOP convention.Saturday’s rally is taking place with extra safety precautions. The event was moved indoors after the shooting at an open-air event because an arena is easier to secure, The Washington Post previously reported, and Trump’s campaign does not expect to hold any more outdoor rallies soon. Secret Service sought additional help from local law enforcement as well.“They will be on heightened security obviously,” Kent County commissioner Walter Bujak told The Post. “They’re going to dot the i’s and cross the t’s for this one.”Supporters at the rally said they believed that God saved Trump’s life last week and expressed little fear for their own security.“I feel safe and I don’t feel worried. Security is beefed up as much as it could be,” said Angelic Johnson, 54. “We just have to look to God to protect us like he did that night that Trump got shot.” She said she came to learn more about Vance after only knowing his basic biography.Trump’s campaign signaled in an event advisory that the former president will focus on Biden’s economic and border policies, attacking him for inflation and an influx of undocumented immigrants during his term. Rallygoers booed and jeered when screens showed a mashup of Biden stumbling over his words and tripping onstage.Biden’s campaign held a news conference Saturday ahead of the Grand Rapids rally to assail Trump’s agenda, saying it would hurt workers while giving breaks to the wealthy. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) shared a video with her “welcome” message for Trump and Vance, saying that “here, we protect reproductive freedom” and making other digs at Trump’s policies.But Democrats’ own turmoil has been a growing distraction. A dozen more Democratic lawmakers called on Biden to pull out of the presidential race on Friday alone, indicating a party still deeply unsettled by Biden’s struggle to hold his train of thought at a June 27 and other stumbles.A bout of covid-19 has also taken Biden off the campaign trail while Trump and Vance plan a bundle of events coming out of the Republican convention.On Monday afternoon, Vance will hold a rally in his hometown of Middletown, Ohio. Then he will head to a Monday evening rally in Radford, Va. — a signal of the Trump campaign’s continued efforts to expand the map of competitive states to places where Democrats usually prevail in the presidential race. Biden won Virginia by 10 points in 2020.Trump plans to speak at a rally in Charlotte on Wednesday evening.Trump, appearing at the convention with a bandage on his ear, used his speech to call for unity after last week’s rally shooting. “The discord and division in our society must be healed,” he said.But after recounting the assassination attempt and attributing his survival to divine intervention, Trump mostly returned to his usual material. He jabbed at “crazy Nancy Pelosi” and alluded to his false claims the 2020 election was stolen from him — “that horrible, horrible result that we’ll never let happen again.”Knowles reported from Washington."
WaPo_57,Israel strikes Yemen port after Houthis claim drone attack in Tel Aviv,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/20/israel-yemen-hodeida-drone-tel-aviv/,2024-07-21 05:50:02.799908,,"Israel carried out airstrikes Saturday on a port city in Yemen that is controlled by the Houthi militant group, sparking massive fires at a critical hub for imports to the impoverished country in an attack that Israeli leaders cast as a warning to emboldened adversaries around the Middle East.The attack came a day after the Houthis, an Iranian-allied group, claimed responsibility for a rare drone attack on Tel Aviv that killed one person and struck just yards from a U.S. Embassy branch office. After the strikes Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said they came in “direct response to the drone attack” Friday as well as other Houthi attacks against Israel during the war in Gaza.The strikes made “it clear to our enemies that there is no place that the long arm of the State of Israel will not reach,” he said.The Houthis, an Iranian-backed group, have been striking ships off Yemen’s coastlines for the better part of the year, in attacks they say are aimed at ending Israel’s Gaza offensive, while throttling vital trade routes. Over the last few months, the United States and Britain have carried out airstrikes against the Houthis, in an unsuccessful effort to end the maritime attacks.Israel’s attack Saturday was also unlikely to deter the Houthis, Yemen analysts said, and might have the opposite effect, allowing the group to consolidate its power at home as it rallied Yemenis to mobilize against yet another foreign threat. The strikes also heralded a further expansion of the war in Gaza, adding a volatile new dynamic to what has become a building regional conflict, joined by militant groups in Lebanon and Iraq as well.Stories to keep you informed

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.A military spokesman for the Houthis said “several” Israel raids had struck the port, a power station and fuel tanks in Hodeida, a struggling city that serves as the entry point for imports to large parts of Yemen. He vowed the group would retaliate.“We will respond to this blatant Israeli aggression and will not hesitate to strike the enemy’s vital targets,” Yahya Saree, the military spokesman, said in a televised statement. “We have prepared, with the help of God Almighty, for a long war with this enemy until the aggression stops and the siege on the Palestinian people is lifted,” he said.Footage of the aftermath of Saturday’s strikes showed black smoke billowing from massive fires in the port, and residents in Hodeida bathed in an orange glow as they watched. Al-Masirah, a Yemeni TV channel, quoted the ministry of health as saying that the strikes had injured more than 80 people, most with severe burns. The channel aired footage from what appeared to be a hospital, of injured people on gurneys lining a hallway.The Houthi drone that struck Tel Aviv on Friday evaded Israel’s sophisticated air defense network and struck the city without even setting off air-raid sirens — a failure that Israeli officials blamed in part on “human error.” Weapons experts said it was possible that the Houthis had enhanced one of their existing drones to use in the attack by increasing its range.An Israel Defense Forces official said Saturday that Israel carried out the strike on military and “dual use” targets following months of Houthi rocket and missile attacks on Red Sea shipping and Israeli territory. The official would not comment on reports of involvement by other national militaries in the region, including Saudi Arabia, the United States and Great Britain, although those allies were notified of the operation, the official said.“The fire that is currently burning in Hodeida is seen across the Middle East, and the significance is clear,” Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defense minister, said in a statement. “The Houthis attacked us over 200 times. The first time that they harmed an Israeli citizen, we struck them. And we will do this in any place where it may be required. The blood of Israeli citizens has a price.”Netanyahu, in his remarks, said that the Hodeida port was “used for military purposes, it was used as an entry point for deadly weapons supplied to the Houthis by Iran. They used this weapon to attack Israel, to attack the countries of the region, to attack an international shipping lane, one of the most important shipping lanes in the world.”It was also the entry point for fuel and food that entered Yemen, a country that has suffered gravely through a decade of civil war as people struggled to get basic necessities. The strikes Saturday could imperil those supplies, said Mohammed al-Basha, a senior Middle East analyst at Navanti, a risk-assessment group.The strikes had resulted in “the complete destruction of oil tanks at Hodeida port, with extensive damage also reported at Hodeida power station,” he said in a message. The destruction, he added, was expected to “trigger severe fuel shortages across northern Yemen, significantly impacting essential services such as hospital diesel generators. The situation is likely to be exacerbated by the intense summer heat, intensifying the suffering of the local population.”While ships docked in the port and grain silos in the area were not believed to be affected by the strikes, there had been damage to refined oil tanks belonging to the Yemen Petroleum Company, he said. There were also concerns that “poorly equipped firefighters” would not be able to quickly put out the roaring blaze in the port.The attack has “sparked panic in Houthi-controlled areas, with residents rushing to gas stations in fear of an impending fuel crisis,” he said. To calm the public, the Houthi-controlled Yemen Petroleum Company was forced to issue a statement saying there were adequate fuel supplies.A 34-year old Yemeni man whose family has a house in Hodeida, near the port, said the home was damaged by the fire caused by the strikes. The man, who lives outside of Yemen and asked to be identified by his first name, Hareth, said a relative had checked on the house Saturday. It was in one of the “poorest neighborhoods,” he said, where people’s houses were made of wood in the “traditional style.” The area had been targeted previously, during Yemen’s civil war, but had survived.“This time, everything was burned,” he said.Fahim reported from Istanbul, Rom from Tel Aviv, Hendrix from Jerusalem and El-Chamaa from Beirut."

WaPo_59,Secret Service said to have denied requests for more security at Trump events,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/20/trump-secret-service-security-attempted-assassination/,2024-07-21 06:48:02.792130,,"Top officials at the U.S. Secret Service repeatedly denied requests for additional resources and personnel sought by Donald Trump’s security detail in the two years leading up to his  attempted assassination at a  rally in Pennsylvania last Saturday, according to four people familiar with the requests.Agents charged with protecting the former president requested magnetometers and more agents to screen attendees at sporting events and other large public gatherings Trump attended, as well as additional snipers and specialty teams at other outdoor events, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive security discussions. The requests, which have not been previously reported, were sometimes denied by senior officials at the agency, who cited various reasons, including a lack of resources at an agency that has long struggled with staffing shortages, they said.Those rejections — in response to requests that were several times made in writing — led to long-standing tensions that pitted Trump, his top aides and his security detail against Secret Service leadership, as Trump advisers privately fretted that the vaunted security agency was not doing enough to protect the former president.The Secret Service, after initially denying turning down requests for additional security, is now acknowledging some may have been rejected. The revelation comes as agency veterans say the organization has been forced to make difficult decisions amid competing demands, a growing list of protectees and limited funding.A gunman was able to fire off rounds from an AR-15 style rifle from a rooftop about 150 yards of the former president at the rally last Saturday. Trump was injured as were two others; a man in the crowd was killed. The agency has been under scrutiny over security lapses at the rally.Trump advisers’ anger deepened after an agency spokesman publicly denied that any request for additional security lodged by Trump or his detail had ever been rejected. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, who has been under pressure to resign over security lapses at the rally, repeated that denial in a meeting in Wisconsin with Trump campaign leadership in Wisconsin on Monday, people familiar with the discussions said.“The assertion that a member of the former president’s security team requested additional security resources that the U.S. Secret Service or the Department of Homeland Security rebuffed is absolutely false,” said Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the Secret Service, in a statement on the day after the shooting.After receiving detailed questions from The Washington Post, Guglielmi said the agency had learned new information indicating the agency’s headquarters may have in fact denied some requests for additional security from Trump’s detail and was reviewing documentation to understand the specific interactions better.“The Secret Service has a vast, challenging, and intricate mission,” he said in a statement. “Every day we work in a dynamic threat environment to ensure our protectees are safe and secure across multiple events, travel, and other difficult environments. We execute a comprehensive and layered strategy to balance personnel, technology, and specialized operational needs.”In response to a request for comment, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign referred to Trump’s Truth Social a statement Trump posted on his social media platform praising his own Secret Service detail.The extended tussle over safeguarding a former president who holds regular public events that draw large crowds raises new questions for the Secret Service, a long admired protection force that guards American presidents, their families and other senior officials. But it has been plagued by staffing shortages and hiring limits since 2010 and suffered a series of embarrassing security lapses during the Obama and Trump administrations.A Secret Service official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly describe sensitive internal discussions, said the agency has finite resources and has to juggle competing demands, especially for its countersnipers, counterassault teams and the teams of uniformed division officers who help screen attendees for weapons at events using magnetometers.The agency is currently responsible for security details for more than two dozen people, most of them requiring full-time security and a few others receiving what is informally called “door-to-door” protection from the moment they leave their homes. Protectees include the president and vice president and their families, as well as former presidents, candidates and a growing number of senior administration officials. After the Butler shooting, the agency added a protective detail to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent presidential candidate, and is now protecting GOP vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance as well.Bill Gage, a former Secret Service agent who served on presidential protection and counterassault teams during the Bush and Obama administrations, said the agency is always drowning in far more requests and events than it can possibly handle with its hiring limits, and that leads to headquarters denying requests even more frequently during the busy campaign season.“I hate to dumb it down this much but it is a simple case of supply and demand. The requests get turned down routinely,” Gage said. “A director has to finally come forward to say we are way understaffed and we cannot possibly continue with this zero fail mission without a significantly bigger budget.”The Service’s Office of Protective Operations reviews security requests for events, and as part of a regular push-and-pull, it sometimes reconsiders initial denials after being persuaded the risk justifies the expense, officials have said. But it must balance the reality that each agent, countersniper or magnetometer assigned to cover one event reduces what is available for other people the Service protects.The weekend of the Butler shooting, the Secret Service had sent multiple countersniper teams and hundreds of agents to the Republican National Convention and was also securing an event by Jill Biden and a scheduled trip by President Biden to Austin the day after the shooting.“It’s just true — we don’t have the resources to secure him [Trump] like we did when he was president,” the official said.None of the denied requests that The Post reviewed related to the Pennsylvania rally. But one of the denials that most concerned Trump officials came as he held a rally in South Carolina in July 2023, one of the first large-scale events of his current campaign. Trump was speaking in a downtown square in Pickens, a small town 20 miles west of Greenville, at a site surrounded by commercial and residential buildings. People familiar with the request said that Trump’s security team asked for more countersnipers to be stationed on rooftops to guard against potential shooters or other attacks.The people said the Pickens event was one of several in which Trump’s team was denied more tactical support. Trump’s detail was told Secret Service headquarters had determined they could not provide the resources after the detail made an extensive argument for why the teams were needed, they said.Guglielmi said the Service is still reviewing the planning for the Pickens event but said local countersnipers rather than Secret Service teams were on hand to help address the threats of potential shooters.On multiple other occasions, Trump’s team asked for magnetometers and additional help to screen attendees for Trump to attend sporting events, particularly wrestling matches and college football games, people familiar with those requests said. They were told no because the events were not campaign events.In one instance, the Secret Service argued the screening was unnecessary because Trump would be entering a stadium to watch a football game via a secure elevator and then be guided through a secure area to a private suite with controlled access, according to a Secret Service official who reviewed some of the security requests.“He was not going through the general population,” the official said. “You don’t need to mag the entire stadium” in those circumstances.But Trump advisers said he often moved through open-air concourses at the games, interacting with large swaths of the public. Some Trump advisers were repeatedly concerned about his safety at the sporting events as he moved through the areas, people familiar with the matter said.People around Trump were also concerned by what they feared was an insufficient number of magnetometers and security personnel at rallies, they said, including one in 2023 in Macomb, Michigan, where some attendees jumped over bike racks to get past security and were restrained by local police, according to people close to Trump who witnessed the episode.Several Trump advisers said the denials had been a frustration for more than a year.The Secret Service extends the highest level of protection to current presidents and officials. Former presidents receive a significantly lesser degree of Secret Service protection, but Trump’s high profile and daily routines make him a different kind of security challenge than most former presidents, according to former Secret Service agents.Trump is also the first former president in modern times to run for reelection, which carries additional security burdens, though candidates are not provided the same level of security as sitting presidents.Other former presidents only rarely make large, public appearances, living more private lives. Trump, on the other hand, is almost always around crowds, at his clubs and golf courses, and holds frequent campaign events attended by thousands, if not tens of thousands, particularly since he announced a new run for the presidency in November 2022.Cheatle, a veteran Secret Service agent, has called the security failure at the rally on July 13 unacceptable, as a gunman was allowed to fire from an unsecured roof around 150 yards from where Trump addressed the crowd. The gunman spotted acting suspiciously before Trump began speaking but the Secret Service did not intervene or prevent Trump from taking the stage.The Secret Service and Trump’s orbit also argued over planning for the Republican National Convention, particularly over how large of a security perimeter the agency would impose. The relationship grew so acrimonious that senior Republicans repeatedly sought meetings with Secret Service leadership in Washington after battling with agents on the ground over security and logistics.On Thursday, Trump senior adviser Chris LaCivita called for Cheatle to resign, as has a number of lawmakers in both parties. During the convention, several Republican senators chased Cheatle through the arena in Milwaukee, where she had traveled to brief them on the investigation. The senators screamed at her after she declined to answer questions about the attempted assassination."
WaPo_60,Harris speaks at fundraiser in Cape Cod amid more calls for Biden to drop out,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/20/joe-biden-kamala-harris-democratic-ticket/,2024-07-21 06:38:02.792130,,"PROVINCETOWN, Mass. — Vice President Harris attended a star-studded campaign fundraiser in Cape Cod, Mass., on Saturday, amid growing calls for President Biden to step aside as his party’s 2024 presidential nominee.Some 37 congressional Democrats have called on Biden to drop out of the 2024 race, and several have urged the president to pass the torch to Harris. Biden has been off the campaign trail after receiving a covid diagnosis earlier in the week, and the window is narrowing for the Democratic Party to consider a new nominee ahead of the party’s national convention. Since the night of his halting debate performance last month, the vice president has repeatedly defended Biden,  stating that he is the party’s nominee and encouraging others to “fight for him.”As arguably the heir apparent for the nomination should the president step aside, Harris would need to shore up voter and donor support quickly if Biden exits the race. At Saturday’s event, Harris struck a similar tone of optimism for the campaign and support for the president.“I’m testifying as a firsthand witness,” she said, raising her hands in the air, “with every decision [Biden] makes in the Oval Office, I’m telling you he thinks about how it will impact everyday working Americans.”“We are going to win,” Harris declared to enormous applause. “It’s not going to be easy. … It takes believing in something and then going for it.”Harris also criticized former president Donald Trump’s attempt to convey a message of “unity” at the Republican National Convention — a word used on both sides of the aisle after last weekend’s assassination attempt against him.“If you claim to stand for unity, then you need to know it’s more than just a word,” Harris said.Tickets for Harris’s sold-out event in Provincetown — a longtime hub for artists on Cape Cod that’s a popular beach getaway for the  LGBTQ community — ranged from $150 to $150,000. The  fundraiser, hosted by event planner Bryan Rafanelli, was announced before the presidential debate late last month.Harris recounted how her parents would take her to marches for “freedom and equality. Not for some, but for all,” she said. “So when it comes to the fight for LGBTQ rights, as much as anything, I know it to be a fundamental fight for freedom.”Harris also warned the guests that if Trump wins in November, “he will once again implement policies that target the LGBTQ community.” She added that Trump’s running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), will “undoubtedly be a rubber stamp” for Trump’s “extremist anti-LGBTQ agenda.”Rafanelli said that more than 1,000 people were in attendance and that more than $2 million had been raised“Back in 2012, we were fighting for the recognition of our marriages and it was Joe Biden who listened to our voices and stood up for our community,” Rafanelli said at Saturday’s event. “Let me be clear, if we do not win this election, we will be fighting for a lot more than marriage equality. We will be fighting for our right to exist.”He added that Harris “is not just a politician, she’s a trailblazer, a symbol of progress …[she] has consistently fought for the LGBT community.”Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Gov. Maura Healey of Massachusetts, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and actor Jennifer Coolidge were among the attendees of the event.Upon departure, a reporter shouted a question about whether the president was “doing okay.” She gave a thumbs-up.Vazquez reported from Washington.

WaPo_61,British Open devolves into ‘absolute survival test’ after weather turns sour,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/20/british-open-third-round-open-championship-billy-horschel-shane-lowry/,2024-07-21 06:29:02.792130,,"TROON, Scotland — All that futuristic golf equipment, the pariah of those concerned about its capacity to ruin the sport, has looked like a patsy here against a force even much more capable of oomph: Mother Nature. You take your fancy-schmancy clubs, she has seemed to say at this 152nd British Open, and I’ll show you just what I think of your so-called driving distance.She got befuddling with her wind directions Thursday. She got volatile enough for much of Friday that Justin Rose said, “Nothing makes sense with the yardage book, really.” Then Saturday, after taking a breather in the morning and midday, she went for the wind-and-rain exacta until the wind came back and the rain came hard and the best players in the world started letting their words get drastic.“I think that was probably the hardest nine holes that I’ll ever play,” top-ranked Scottie Scheffler said.“I mean, the back nine [are] the hardest nine holes I think you could ever play in golf right now,” two-time major winner Dustin Johnson said.“You’re standing there on the 18th tee,” 2019 champion Shane Lowry said, “wondering if you can actually hit the fairway, if you can reach the fairway, and it’s 230 yards to the fairway.”So what was a normal-looking Saturday — with American Sam Burns and South African Thriston Lawrence shooting 65s and with Lowry up ahead at 8 under par and Daniel Brown at 7 under — careened into a matter of attrition and retreat. By late, cold nightfall, England’s Brown led going into the par-4 No. 18 at 5 under but double-bogeyed, Ireland’s Lowry had spent the last 11 holes withering all the way to 1 under, and it figured that nobody would grab the lead but that somebody, in this case Billy Horschel, would inherit it. After Brown felt the cold wind of his closing 6, Horschel stood alone at 4 under.That’s the 37-year-old Floridian in his 43rd major tournament without any memorable contention, and that’s the guy who said, “I’ve just always enjoyed the toughness of anything,” and, “I get tired of golf where you’re making full swings and you lean into a certain [yardage] number and [the ball] stops.” Whatever happens with nature Sunday, he’ll start off with a cavalry just behind.The six players at 3 under after Saturday included Lawrence and Burns but also Rose and PGA Championship winner and chronic contender Xander Schauffele as well as Russell Henley and the major-debuting Brown. The one player at 2 under, Scheffler, is merely the runaway king of the sport at the moment. There’s Lowry at that 1 under. Major winners Adam Scott and Justin Thomas, forgotten much of the day, wound up at even par and viable once everybody came back toward them.Golf got a rare occasion with descriptions of insufficient equipment and stories seldom told anymore.Scheffler came to a microphone and told of hitting a driver and a 3-wood “really solid” on par-4 No. 15 and coming up — come on! — shy of the green. Lowry told of playing a par-3 with a driver and of hitting “driver, driver” into No. 15. Brown, holding up well amid that 3-under crowd in his first major at 29, hit driver into the par-3 No. 17. Here’s Schauffele on that hole: “So I literally smoked a 3-wood, a little off the heel, and thin into the wind and rain, and it went 218 yards or something like that. So that was pretty humbling.” Johnson, long since a long hitter, said: “It’s so long I could barely reach the par-4s. I had to smash two to get there.”Rose, 43, said he surely had been a junior when he last “played a round of golf where I’ve hit 4-iron into 10, 2-iron short at 11, 8-iron into 12, 3-wood into 13, 4-iron into 14, 3-wood into 15 . . . 3-wood into 17, 2-iron into 18. Yeah.”What fun, and to tack on more, Scheffler said he got distracted once because “raindrops falling off the front of the cap got me in the middle of my stroke.” The weather had not promised all it delivered, at least as the seasoned Rose had envisioned it, “and it turned into an absolute survival test out there.”He said, “I think I did a good job of surviving,” closing with a nervy six-foot par putt that kept him from finishing bogey-bogey and making his Saturday evening glum. He rejoiced beneath the gray skies after that, and the lingering patrons up in the grandstand sang his name in the 59-degree chill as if at some football — sorry, soccer — match on Boxing Day.He had joined in the test of fending off agony.“I found it really hard today to enjoy the crowds,” he said. “I found it really hard to enjoy the day today. I felt like it was good energy from the crowd, but obviously with everyone with umbrellas up, no one is clapping; everyone is shouting and cheering, people wanting high-fives. I normally engage in that type of stuff; today, I just had my head down. I was not interested in anything. I was just trying to get around the golf course today and hang in there.”And so, with 11 straight pars from No. 5 to No. 16, “I kind of felt like I was hanging on by my fingernails.”That meant the mental meant even more than usual. “It means everything,” Schauffele said. “It is a true test. It’s a long day, and you and your caddie are basically a team. He’s going to need an extra arm. I at times need an extra hand. We basically just plod our way around the property. You try to get lost in the process.”And so, “There’s times when you have to have a good attitude.”Horschel certainly has that as he approaches his first Sunday in this situation with enough years and turns behind him to imagine being “ecstatic” if he wins or getting “back on the horse” if he doesn’t. A winner 10 times on the two tours hugging the Atlantic, he’ll find a Sunday with who knows what coming from way off in the ocean and over the Firth of Clyde. It has been that kind of British Open, the kind that says damn the equipment and the kind that causes Schauffele to say, “When you look at the flow of an Open Championship, this is like a classic one to me.”"
WaPo_62,Trump and Vance appear at first rally since assassination attempt,https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/07/20/trump-vance-michigan-rally-grand-rapids/,2024-07-21 06:25:02.792130,,"GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Former president Donald Trump held his first rally since his attempted assassination at another campaign event, joined by his newly announced running mate, J.D. Vance.Trump and Vance, the Republican senator from Ohio,  appeared in Grand Rapids exactly one week after a gunman opened fire at Trump’s rally in Butler, Pa. with an AR-style rifle. The attack killed one audience member, injured others and left Trump with a bloody ear, instantly creating a shocking and iconic election-year scene in which Trump pumped his fist and shouted “Fight!” as Secret Service officers rushed him offstage.Now, Trump is coming off his formal nomination at the Republican National Convention in perhaps his strongest political position this campaign cycle, with some Democrats pushing to remove President Biden last-minute from their ticket and Republicans full of optimism.The Grand Rapids event is  Trump and Vance’s first rally as running mates and underscores the Trump team’s hopes that Vance’s Ohio upbringing and populist message will help them win the neighboring swing states of Michigan and Pennsylvania. Speaking for just over 10 minutes Saturday afternoon ahead of Trump’s remarks, Vance highlighted his roots in a “working class family” that struggled with addiction and said he viewed both political parties as “broken” for a long time.He laid out the “America First” and isolationist ideas he has championed in a changing GOP. He rebuked leaders across the political spectrum he said had allowed American jobs to be outsourced and suggested the U.S. should pick its foreign entanglements more carefully.“There’s nothing radical about having a strong national security that when we go to the war, we punch and we punch hard, but being cautious, and not trying to get America involved in every far-flung corner and conflict of the world,” Vance said. “Sometimes, my friends, it just is none of our business and we oughta stay out of it.” The crowd cheered.Despite the violence last week, Trump supporters queued up in long lines early Saturday to hear from their official ticket. Many rally attendees wore shirts with Trump’s words after the assassination attempt — “fight, fight, fight” — or with photos of Trump raising his fist, and a few sported ear bandages meant to mimic the one Trump had at the GOP convention.Saturday’s rally took taking place with extra safety precautions. The event was moved indoors after the shooting at an open-air event because an arena is easier to secure, The Washington Post previously reported, and Trump’s campaign does not expect to hold any more outdoor rallies soon. Secret Service sought additional help from local law enforcement as well.“They will be on heightened security obviously,” Kent County commissioner Walter Bujak told The Post before the rally. “They’re going to dot the i’s and cross the t’s for this one.”Supporters at the rally said they believed that God saved Trump’s life last week and expressed little fear for their own security.“I feel safe and I don’t feel worried. Security is beefed up as much as it could be,” said Angelic Johnson, 54. “We just have to look to God to protect us like he did that night that Trump got shot.” She said she came to learn more about Vance after only knowing his basic biography.Rallygoers booed and jeered when screens showed a mashup of Biden stumbling over his words and tripping onstage.Biden’s campaign held a news conference Saturday ahead of the Grand Rapids rally to assail Trump’s agenda, saying it would hurt workers while giving breaks to the wealthy. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) shared a video with her “welcome” message for Trump and Vance, saying that “here, we protect reproductive freedom” and making other digs at Trump’s policies.But Democrats’ own turmoil has been a growing distraction. A dozen more Democratic lawmakers called on Biden to pull out of the presidential race on Friday alone, indicating a party still deeply unsettled by Biden’s struggle to hold his train of thought at a June 27 and other stumbles.A bout of covid-19 has also taken Biden off the campaign trail while Trump and Vance plan a bundle of events coming out of the Republican convention.On Monday afternoon, Vance will hold a rally in his hometown of Middletown, Ohio. Then he will head to a Monday evening rally in Radford, Va. — a signal of the Trump campaign’s continued efforts to expand the map of competitive states to places where Democrats usually prevail in the presidential race. Biden won Virginia by 10 points in 2020.Trump plans to speak at a rally in Charlotte on Wednesday evening.Trump, appearing at the convention with a bandage on his ear, used his speech to call for unity after last week’s rally shooting. “The discord and division in our society must be healed,” he said.But after recounting the assassination attempt and attributing his survival to divine intervention, Trump mostly returned to his usual material. He jabbed at “crazy Nancy Pelosi” and alluded to his false claims the 2020 election was stolen from him — “that horrible, horrible result that we’ll never let happen again.”Knowles reported from Washington."
WaPo_63,Trump and Vance revel in Democratic troubles in first rally together,https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/07/20/trump-vance-michigan-rally-grand-rapids/,2024-07-21 07:26:02.852153,,"GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Former president Donald Trump reveled in Democrats’ turmoil at  his first rally since his attempted assassination at another campaign event, joined by his newly announced running mate, J.D.

Trump spoke gleefully about Democrats’ disarray Saturday, at one point polling the audience on who they most wanted him to run against.The crowd booed for Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) and Vice President Harris, whose name Trump butchered. But the audience roared loudest when Trump named Biden — reflecting Republicans’ growing confidence that they can beat the incumbent.As Democrats warn that Trump is a threat to democracy, Trump tried to cast his opponents’ wrangling over Biden’s future as undemocratic. The man who tried to overthrow his 2020 loss said that Democratic “bosses” are trying to “overthrow the results of their own party’s primaries” and declared, “last week I took a bullet for democracy.”The Grand Rapids event was Trump and Vance’s first rally as running mates and underscores the Trump team’s hopes that Vance’s Ohio upbringing and populist message will help them win the neighboring swing states of Michigan and Pennsylvania.

On Saturday, he also shared a letter from Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Tex.), a close ally and former White House physician, that said Trump’s wound required no sutures but still bled intermittently, requiring a dressing.At the rally, Trump made some efforts to pivot to a general election audience. He ramped up his attacks on a conservative policy effort called Project 2025, even as its architects include staunch Trump allies and members of his first administration. Trump has tried to distance himself as Democrats increasingly attack Project 2025, and on Saturday, Trump called the effort “seriously extreme” and a product of the “severe right.” But the package also includes many proposals that Trump has endorsed.At the same time, Trump returned to the red-meat issues that amp up his base. He got some of his biggest cheers promising to carry out mass deportations and “shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement.” He repeated his false claims the 2020 election was rigged.He criticized government rules meant to increase electric car production — but also tempered it with praise for Elon Musk, the CEO of electric-car maker Tesla, who recently endorsed Trump and is said to be planning large donations to Trump’s reelection. “I’ve had them, I’ve driven them, they’re incredible but they’re not for everybody,” Trump said of EVs.Trump also doubled down on his praise for leaders that President Biden and other U.S. officials have condemned as dictators. He recounted saying of Chinese President Xi Jinping: “He’s a brilliant man, he controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist,” and riffed on the idea, saying Xi makes people like Biden look like “babies.”“They’re all smart, tough, they love their country,” Trump said of Xi as well as Russian President Vladimir Putin.Despite the violence last week, Trump supporters queued up in long lines early Saturday to hear from their official ticket.

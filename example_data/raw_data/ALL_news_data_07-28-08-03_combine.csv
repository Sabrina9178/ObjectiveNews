NBC_1,FBI confirms that a bullet struck Trump's ear during assassination attempt,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fbi-confirms-bullet-struck-trumps-ear-assassination-attempt-rcna163896,2024-07-27 08:16:02.888228,,"The FBI said Friday that a bullet or fragments of it struck Donald Trump's ear during an assassination attempt on the former president this month at a campaign rally.
“What struck former President Trump in the ear was a bullet, whether whole or fragmented into smaller pieces, fired from the deceased subject’s rifle,"" the FBI said in a statement.
The statement comes two days after FBI Director Christopher Wray, whom Trump nominated to his post in 2017, told House lawmakers that ""there’s some question about whether or not it’s a bullet or shrapnel that, you know, hit his ear.""
Wray had testified about the FBI's ongoing probe into the assassination attempt. A gunman identified as Thomas Crooks, 20, was shot and killed after opening fire from an elevated post not far from Trump's July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, that left one spectator dead and two others critically injured.
The director's remarks before a House committee sparked widespread backlash among Republican lawmakers, as well as Trump.
Trump referred to the new FBI statement in a social media post Friday night.
""I assume that’s the best apology that we’ll get from Director Wray, but it is fully accepted!,"" he wrote on Truth Social.
House Speaker Mike Johnson had also criticized Wray's testimony.
“We’ve all seen the video, we’ve seen the analysis, we’ve heard it from multiple sources in different angles that a bullet went through his ear. I’m not sure it matters that much,” Johnson said on Thursday.
Wray’s testimony came the same day the House approved a resolution to create a bipartisan task force to examine the assassination attempt.
Before the FBI put out its statement Friday night, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., had written a letter to Wray urging him to revise his testimony, saying, ""the attempted assassin’s bullet ripped the upper part"" of Trump's ear, and that it ""should not be a point of contention.""
Graham said Friday night, after the FBI's statement, that Wray should never have suggested otherwise.
""Glad the FBI confirmed what everyone else knew. It was a bullet that struck President Trump. The statement by the FBI Director should’ve never been made,"" Graham wrote on X.Ken Dilanian is the justice and intelligence correspondent for NBC News, based in Washington.

NBC_2,"Measles cases in the U.S. are already triple last year’s total, and it’s only July",https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-cases-us-triple-last-year-total-rcna163413,2024-07-27 08:00:02.888228,,"The number of measles cases recorded this year is more than triple the total from all of last year — with five months still to go.
According to data released Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 188 cases have been reported in 26 states and Washington, D.C. No deaths have been reported, but 93 people have been hospitalized — mostly children under 5 years old.
The U.S. has seen 13 measles outbreaks this year, the largest of which took off at a migrant shelter in Chicago in March and was linked to more than 60 cases.
This month, measles cases have been reported in Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Oregon and Vermont. Massachusetts’ case was the first in the state since early 2020.
Last year, there were only four measles outbreaks in the U.S. and 58 cases in total.
This year’s tally is the highest since 2019, when the country nearly lost its measles elimination status. Most of the 1,200-plus cases that year were associated with outbreaks in Orthodox Jewish communities in New York.
“Having this year be even worse than 2019 — there’s definitely potential for that,” said Dr. David Hamer, a professor of global health and medicine at the Boston University School of Public Health. CDC models suggest that’s highly unlikely, however.
Experts attribute this year’s uptick to two main factors: declining vaccination rates in the U.S. and a rise in measles cases worldwide.
Around 85% of the people who got measles this year were either unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status, according to the CDC. Many of the cases have been linked to international travel, meaning the disease was brought into the U.S. by travelers who were infected in other countries.
“We live in a global community where vaccination rates everywhere affect diseases that are transmitted in the United States,” said Dr. Erica Prochaska, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at Johns Hopkins Children’s Center. “But the main issue is that in the United States, our population isn’t at the threshold of vaccination that we should be.”
A person infected with measles can spread the disease to up to 90% of people close to them if those contacts aren’t immune. So public health officials recommend that communities have at least 95% vaccination coverage to prevent sustained transmission.
As of the 2022-23 school year, 93% of U.S. kindergartners had received two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, down from 95% in the 2019-20 year. Twelve states and Washington, D.C., had rates below 90%.
“To me, what’s surprising is that the outbreaks aren’t more extensive,” said Dr. Gregory Poland, founder and director of the Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group.
He added that some people who are immunocompromised are not eligible for the MMR vaccine, “so they depend on all the rest of us getting two doses.”
The U.S. effectively eliminated measles in 2000, meaning the disease is no longer constantly present, though there are occasional outbreaks that originate in other countries. Before the first measles vaccine became available in 1963, around 3 million to 4 million people in the U.S. were infected every year, and 400 to 500 people died of the disease annually.
“It’s sort of dropped out of people’s minds as an important issue,” Hamer said.
Vaccine hesitancy — accelerated by misinformation during the pandemic — has contributed to the problem, he added.
Globally, vaccination coverage for measles fell during the pandemic to the lowest levels since 2008.
Hamer said lockdowns disrupted vaccination services in many low- and middle-income countries, and ongoing civil wars may have hindered vaccination efforts in countries like Ethiopia and Yemen, which represent a disproportionate share of global measles cases.
“The end result was that many countries that were sort of borderline in terms of having adequate coverage fell down on their coverage for routine childhood vaccinations, including measles,” Hamer said.
From 2021 to 2022, measles cases increased 18% and measles deaths went up 43% worldwide, according to a joint report from the CDC and World Health Organization. The number of countries experiencing large or significant outbreaks rose from 22 to 37 during that time.
Common symptoms of measles include a high fever, cough, conjunctivitis (pink eye), runny nose, white spots in the mouth and a rash that spreads from head to toe. Around 1 to 3 out of every 1,000 children infected with measles die from complications such as pneumonia or swelling of the brain.Aria Bendix is the breaking health reporter for NBC News Digital."
NBC_3,Packers sign Jordan Love to richest QB contract in NFL history,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/packers-sign-qb-jordan-love-richest-qb-contract-nfl-history-rcna163353,2024-07-27 10:00:02.649273,,"The Packers have signed Jordan Love to the richest contract for a quarterback in NFL history, per multiple reports. The four-year deal is for $220 million. 
Love, 25, was the No. 26 overall pick of the 2020 NFL Draft. Last season, in his first full year as a starter, he started all 17 games for Green Bay, throwing for 4,159 yards with 32 touchdowns, 11 interceptions and a 96.1 passer rating. Love led the Packers to the playoffs for the first time since 2021 and threw five touchdowns and two picks across two games.
The new contract also includes a record $75 million signing bonus, plus $155 million in new full guarantees, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported.
The new contract pays Love more than his contemporaries, including Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes, Cincinnati’s Joe Burrow and Baltimore’s Lamar Jackson. His deal seemingly resets the quarterback market after extensions signed by Jared Goff and Trevor Lawrence earlier this summer. Love’s new agreement will pay him an average of $55 million annually, equaling the amount shared by Burrow and Lawrence, ESPN reported. 
Before Love’s new deal, he was entering the final year of a contract set to pay him $11 million in 2024. 
The Packers drafted Love in 2020 despite still having former NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers under contract at the time. Rodgers would continue to be the team’s starter for three more seasons through 2022. During that period, however, Green Bay only won one playoff game — the same number Love won last season. 
For his career, Love has appeared in 27 games, throwing for 35 touchdowns and 14 interceptions. In 18 total starts he has a 9-9 record. He is 1-1 in the postseason, upsetting the Dallas Cowboys before losing to the San Francisco 49ers last January. 
After finishing last season 9-8 before losing in the Divisional Round of the playoffs, the Packers will open their 2024 season against the Philadelphia Eagles on Sept. 6 in a game that will be streamed on Peacock. Rohan Nadkarni is a sports reporter for NBC News. "

For those who caught last night’s opening ceremony, you may have noticed the torrential rain pouring down on Paris.
And due to the adverse weather, organizers have pushed back the men’s street skateboarding event originally scheduled to start this morning at the iconic Place de la Concorde, Paris' largest public square where half-pipes, skate ramps and grind rails set up for the games are still soaking wet and slippery.
The event has been postponed until Monday, July 29.

The medal matches of the 10-meter mixed team air rifle final get underway at 4:30ET, and the first gold of the Games will go to either China or South Korea — they topped the order in Saturday morning's qualifying round to progress to the gold medal match with Kazakhstan and Germany set to compete for bronze. 
Day 1 will see 13 sets of medals handed out across seven sports, with diving, road cycling and rugby sevens among those to be awarded before tonight's box-office action in the pool.

Team USA's Vinson Chiu and Jennie Gai started their mixed doubles campaign but were comfortably beaten by Huang Dongping and Feng Yanzhe of China, who are among the gold medal favorites in the event.

For an opponent standing across the badminton net from twin sisters Kerry and Annie Xu, it would be hard to strategize the weaknesses and strengths of each in the heat of battle.
“Very hard for the opponent to say ‘Hey, which one is not good today,’” laughed coach Harry Tan.
Though the sisters are individuals in every respect, their play on the badminton court has become one of a singular force — that’s propelled them to a spot at the 2024 Paris Olympics in the doubles category, even after a four-year layoff during which they barely touched a racket.

This year's Olympic surfers aren't heading to Paris. 
Instead, they'll catch waves in Tahiti and forgo the famed Olympic Village for a cruise ship stationed near their competition site. 
It's the first time Olympic athletes will spend the Games on this so-called floating Olympic Village. 
That's because the nearby village of Teahupo’o proved too small and lacking viable options for the incoming athletes, and the Paris Olympic committee requires all athletes to be housed within 45 minutes of their competition venue. 
The Olympic surfers will live aboard the Aranui 5 and will each have their own private room, complete with a real bed and an ocean view, in addition to access to a fitness center, outdoor pool, library, spa and panoramic bar.

NBC_5,A six-figure income and a struggle to afford a house in a Nevada battleground county,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/six-figure-income-struggle-afford-house-nevada-battleground-county-rcna162347,2024-07-27 19:00:02.669076,,"At 31 years old, Kashmir Martin would like to move into her first home and start a family with her husband in Reno, Nevada — part of a critical swing county in a swing state that’s expected to have a central role in the upcoming presidential election.
But despite her salary doubling since the start of the pandemic and the couple now making more than $200,000 a year, Martin says she’s feeling locked out of the dream of homeownership after prices in the region have jumped nearly 50% since 2019.
It’s not for lack of trying. Martin has looked at more than 100 homes, on some weekends going to more than more than 20 open houses. But even at the top of her $550,000 budget, most of the homes she has found would require extensive repairs she can’t afford, including sinking foundations, damaged sewer lines, 20-year-old roofs, and windows from the 1960s. One house was in such disrepair the lenders weren’t willing to finance it.
After about two years of searching, Martin says she has all but given up — and put on hold plans to have a baby until she can afford to buy a home.
“Seemingly, on paper, I’m making more money, I’m doing better,” Martin said. “But I feel less financially secure than I did back in 2015 when I had just barely graduated college and was a first-year accountant.”
Purchasing a home has grown increasingly out of reach for millions of Americans over the past three years — with little indication of the situation improving, according to the NBC News Home Buyer Index, a unique analysis that measures the difficulty of buying a home in America based on price, housing supply and the competitiveness of a market. Home prices have far outpaced middle-class incomes, mortgage rates are at their highest levels in more than two decades, and fierce competition among buyers has 3 out of 10 homes selling above their listing price, according to data from Redfin.
In Washoe County, where Reno is the largest city, that financial pressure from the housing market could have wider implications for how voters feel about the economy. As prices surged faster than wages, the county ranked in the top 200 out of 1,300 measured when it comes to the difficulty of buying a home, according to the NBC News index.
“Housing affordability is a massive issue,” said Mike Noble, CEO of Noble Predictive Insights, a polling and research firm that focuses on Nevada and other Southwestern states. “Housing is coming up everywhere in polls. It’s a huge burden on cost of living. A big part of why inflation is so painful is that people can’t afford housing — it shows up in multiple places in every poll.”
Washoe County is one of the few swing spots on the deeply divided Nevada electoral map, where voters in the Las Vegas area swing heavily for Democrats and those in the vast rural parts of the state widely favor Republicans.
The county has seen strong economic growth under President Joe Biden. Average weekly wages in Washoe County, while lower than the national average, have increased 27% since 2019, faster than wages nationwide, and the region’s labor force has also grown at a more rapid clip. While unemployment has ticked up in recent months, it was at a near-record low in 2022 and has been hovering close to the national average.
But with that growth has come a spike in housing costs that is putting a strain on households across the income spectrum. In Reno, the increases have been driven by a number of factors, including a wave of new residents in 2021 from California, who had the ability to work remotely and were drawn to the region’s lower taxes and housing costs, according to local researchers, realtors and government officials. Those California buyers brought with them higher West Coast wages and all-cash offers after selling their more expensive Bay Area homes, driving up prices above what many local buyers could afford.
In Washoe County, single-family home prices have increased 46% since 2019 to $580,000, according to data from the Washoe County Assessor’s Office. That would amount to a $3,000-a-month mortgage payment, not including taxes and insurance, at current interest rates of around 7% and with a 20% down payment. To afford that home, a household would have to make more than $100,000 a year, well above the current median household income of $80,000.
In 2019, the mortgage payment on a typical home in the area would have been $1,800 when interest rates were around 4% and the median home sale price was around $400,000. That payment would have been considered affordable for a household making around $65,000 a year — below the median household income of $72,000 in 2019.
For renters, the situation isn’t much better. Among those in the Reno area, more than half were paying over 30% of their income on rent and utilities, according to data compiled by Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies.
Martin, who works as an accounting manager for a mining company, has seen her salary more than double to $140,000 a year since the start of the pandemic. Still, she says she’s been unable to find a home with a mortgage payment of under $3,000 a month, the maximum amount she feels she can afford given future costs she anticipates from child care and possible fluctuations in her husband’s salary.
Most of the homes she’s looked at in that price range are around 1,500 square feet with three bedrooms and built between the 1940s and 1980s in the Old Northwest or Old Southwest Reno neighborhoods. Moving to some of the more affordable parts of the region farther north could add 45 minutes to her husband’s daily commute, which is already an hour each way.
At the current interest rate of around 7.5% that Martin has been given, she couldn’t even comfortably afford to buy her childhood home, which her parents bought decades ago on their salaries as a teacher and a casino worker. But despite doing well in school, choosing a well-paying profession and working hard to advance her career, Martin says she feels like she isn’t any better off financially than her parents were at a similar stage of life.
“I’ve taken all of the steps that I thought I would need to take so that I could do better than my parents,” said Martin. “But I kind of have this feeling that I am not getting ahead. If anything, I’m falling a little behind.”
That’s left her and her husband, who makes roughly $65,000 a year as an audio technician, continuing to rent a townhouse in Reno for $2,300 a month. If she were to buy the equivalent property, she estimates her mortgage payment would be $3,700 a month.
Martin said the struggle in trying to buy a home has made her more inclined to vote for candidates who support labor unions, which she thinks will help increase wages so more people can afford a home at the current prices.
“From a federal level, anything that can help increase wages and get people good, high-paying jobs is going to help this situation,” she said. “I just don’t foresee prices coming down.”
Vice President Kamala Harris, the de facto Democratic presidential nominee, has advocated for increased funding for affordable housing, tax credits for first-time homebuyers, and a cap on rent increases tied to tax incentives for landlords during her time in the White House.
Republican nominee Donald Trump’s campaign has said he would lower housing costs by encouraging the construction of new housing on the peripheries of cities and suburban areas where land is cheaper and roll back “anti-suburban housing regulations.” As president, Trump spoke out against building lower-income housing in suburban areas, painting a dystopian vision of low-income housing in the suburbs.
But neither party has made talking about the issue of housing a top priority — like immigration, climate change and abortion have been — making it unclear who comes out on top on the issue in November, said Noble.
“Since it’s basically a new issue, neither party has figured out how to dominate it,” he said. “Both parties are still fleshing out messages.”
For those who have purchased a home in the Reno area despite the high prices and interest rates, the cost can cause a significant financial strain.
Like Martin, Philip Chavez has also seen his wages jump since the start of the pandemic, but that hasn’t eased his financial worries. A year ago, Chavez was making $20 an hour working in a GM parts distribution center in Reno and renting a small two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment that he shared with his wife and children, ages 4 and 12.
After last year’s United Auto Workers strike, he saw his pay increase to $36 an hour. Now, with overtime and profit-sharing, Chavez is expecting to make around $100,000 a year. For the first time, he was able to qualify for a mortgage that would enable him to buy a home in the city where he’s lived for nearly two decades.
“That increase was the only reason why I was able to even start looking in any capacity. There was no way I was going to get a house on $20 an hour,” he said. “After the raise we got after the strike, it was the first time I felt like I was able to breathe.”
Though Chavez was recently able to purchase a home for $470,000, his monthly mortgage payment of $3,700 a month accounts for about half of his take-home pay. That’s left his family continuing to be on a stretched budget despite making far more than the area’s median income and buying a home below the median price.
“I am really praying for rates to go down so I can try to refinance quickly, because it’s a big payment. It’s a good portion of my income for now,” said Chavez. “It’ll be a little lean here and there, but, you know, I’ll eat less or something. We’ll figure it out.”
Politically, Chavez said he doesn’t see Republicans putting the economy on any better of a footing and thinks Harris is an improvement over Biden as the nominee in the upcoming election. Chavez said he remembers Harris walking the picket line with him and his colleagues in Reno during the 2019 UAW strike.
“If we want to have a country like it is now or make it better, we’re not going to do it by voting Republican,” Chavez said. “Trickle-down economics doesn’t work, because trickle-down economics relies on a benevolent person trickling it down, and that’s not the world we live in.”
At current home prices and interest rates, the average wage worker in all but two industries — information services and financial activities — is unable to afford the median-priced home in Washoe County, according to data compiled by Brian Bonnenfant, project manager for the Center for Regional Studies at the University of Nevada, Reno. That includes many working in the hospitality industry, which is the county’s largest employer with a median wage of $16 an hour plus tips, according to data from Bonnenfant.
“Working-class folks, they are getting squeezed out of the housing market, and rents are through the roof, and there’s a lot of abuses that haven’t been curbed,” said Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer for Nevada’s Culinary Workers Union, which represents 60,000 workers in the restaurant and hospitality industry. “I think with the political class out there, they are not taking this on as aggressively as they need to. We see some stuff from the Democrats on housing, but it’s just got to be much more aggressive.”
Local officials said housing has become the No. 1 issue they are hearing about from voters and they are working to provide relief, especially to some of the area’s lowest-income residents. The Reno City Council has approved funding or incentives to help add more than 4,300 affordable units over the past seven years.
Still, the city needed an additional 21,000 affordable housing units to meet demand as of the end of 2022, according to Nevada’s last housing progress report. The Reno Housing Authority has more than 3,000 households on its waitlist for federally funded housing vouchers that help low-income households pay for rent, and the number of people experiencing homelessness increased 4% this year to 1,760.
At the Food Bank of Northern Nevada, officials have seen a steady increase in demand since the pandemic even as wages have increased and more people have gone back to work, with rising housing costs a key factor cutting into budgets, said Jocelyn Lantrip, director of marketing and communications for the Food Bank of Northern Nevada. The number of people it is assisting has increased 15% since last year and 34% from two years ago.
“People have to pay their rent, and so they don’t buy as much food or they don’t have money to buy food, and that’s what we see a lot of,” said Lantrip.
Janine Cowie is among those struggling to navigate the city’s housing market on a lower income. Cowie was recently promoted to the role of behavior specialist at the child care center where she works — increasing her pay from around $17 an hour when she was working as a lead teacher to a salary of $45,000.
But while her pay has gone up, so has her rent. She now pays $1,700 for a two-bedroom apartment — more than half of her monthly take-home pay. It is a major strain for Cowie, who lost her husband to suicide in 2021 and is now the sole provider for her 2-year-old and 4-year-old children.
She recently started looking to purchase a home for $300,000 after being preapproved for a mortgage for that amount. But she came up empty-handed.
She said there were only a few homes available in that price range, all of which required significant home improvements she couldn’t afford.
“When I actually found a realtor, they were basically like, ‘You’re not going to find anything for the price around here,’” Cowie said.
She said her struggle to find housing has contributed to her leaning more toward a third-party candidate in the upcoming election. But she said she would be open to voting for Harris as she looks more into where the vice president stands on certain issues.
In the meantime though, she doesn’t expect to buy a home anytime soon.
“Unless you make a lot of money, I don’t see how anyone finds a place,” she said. “I’m almost 30 and all my friends are renting. I’m just kind of expecting to rent for a really long time.”Shannon Pettypiece is senior policy reporter for NBC News."
NBC_6,Harris' ascension could break a barrier — but fewer women are running for Congress,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/fewer-women-running-congress-harris-president-rcna163801,2024-07-27 19:00:02.669076,,"PHOENIX — Vice President Kamala Harris is on track to become just the second female major-party presidential nominee. But further down the ballot, the number of women jumping into congressional races is down this year after hitting record highs in 2020 and 2022.
The trend tracks against a surge in female voter registration following the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision returning abortion policy to the states in 2022. And despite the decline, the totals are still higher than they ever were before 2018, when hundreds more women than ever ran for the House of Representatives in the midterm elections during former President Donald Trump’s administration.
But it’s still a notable decline: The Rutgers University-based Center For American Women and Politics, the preeminent organization tracking the topic, counts 466 women running as major party candidates in the House, down from 583 female candidates in both 2020 and 2022.
One of the first primaries on the docket, when congressional races start back up next week after a summer break, exemplifies the trend. In Arizona’s 1st Congressional District — one of only 22 toss-up House races in the entire country, per the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter — Democratic voters will have a half-dozen options competing on the primary ballot for a fall campaign against GOP Rep. David Schweikert. Only one candidate, Marlene Galán-Woods, is a woman.
“This is hard, and it’s not for the faint of heart,” Galán-Woods said about why it might be that fewer women are running this year. “But I like doing the hard thing.”
Galán-Woods’ political experience is limited compared to her main challengers, with a career in broadcast journalism that sometimes draws comparisons to Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake. (Galán-Woods doesn’t fancy the parallel.) Other candidates include Andrei Cherny, a businessman and former chair of the Arizona Democratic Party who ran for Congress previously, and Amish Shah, a former member of the Arizona state House. 
But the mother of five has racked up key endorsements, including from Democratic state Attorney General Kris Mayes, with Galán-Woods arguing that her experience as a journalist has equipped her with skills that will make her an effective government official. 
“I’m a really good listener, and it’s lacking, lacking in government, it’s lacking in discourse, it’s lacking in our society,” said Galán-Woods of the overlap between her skills as a journalist and the skills needed to be an effective representative. 
Kelly Dittmar, the director of research at the Center For American Women and Politics, said the cause of this year’s decline is unclear. “We can’t right now say why,” she said, pointing out that fewer men are running for Congress in 2024, too. 
One of the potential reasons Dittmar considered echoed Galán-Woods: “If women look at these institutions, and in this case, Congress, and think that that’s not the place that they can get things done, they’re not going to run.”
There have been some notable shifts since the Dobbs decision, now more than two years old. CAWP found a 5.7% increase in Democratic women running for state House across the country, while there was a decrease of 6.5% among Republican women.
“If they’re motivated by Dobbs and abortion, where they can have an impact,” Dittmar said, then “right now, it seems that the states, based on this decision, are going to be really a primary site for legislating on this issue.”
When Arizona’s state Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that a near-total abortion ban from 1864 was enforceable, it was the state legislature that passed a repeal of the ban, which was signed by Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs.
But apart from policy considerations, things like “toxicity, the unpopularity of Congress, can affect the willingness to run, as can perceptions that it’s a toxic place to work,” Dittmar said at a July 23 press conference. 
“The perceived toxicity extends to harassment abuse faced by officeholders, and we know that that abuse is gendered and racialized and that it can discourage women, and especially women of color, from running,” she said. 
Galán-Woods said she has dealt with “certain things” while running as the lone woman in her race. But she struck a defiant tone.
“I have a job to do. I have girls and women to protect, and I have democracy to uphold, and that’s what I focus on,” she said.Alex Tabet is a 2024 NBC News campaign embed."
NBC_7,Three things to know about Venezuela's presidential election,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/venezuela-presidential-election-maduro-what-know-rcna163775,2024-07-27 19:00:02.669076,,"Venezuelans are getting ready to participate in what stands to be the most consequential presidential election the South American nation has seen in more than a decade.
On Sunday, voters have a chance to elect a new leader who could put an end to the long-standing Chavista regime, a socialist-inspired political movement turned authoritarian that began nearly three decades ago with the election of Hugo Chávez and continued under the leadership of his protégé Nicolás Maduro.
Maduro, who’s seeking a third term in office, has threatened a “bloodbath” if he’s not elected, prompting the U.S. to warn Maduro of the need to hold fair elections without any intimidation or repression.
Maduro is running against 10 presidential candidates. Of all the candidates, Edmundo González is seen as the most likely to beat Maduro.
González, a former diplomat, was a largely unknown figure to Venezuelans until he officially entered the presidential race in May to replace opposition leader María Corina Machado. She was barred by the Maduro regime from running for president over fraud and corruption allegations that many perceived as an attempt to obstruct legitimate elections.
Machado, a conservative and a former legislator, had gained enormous popularity after winning her primary in October — and her support of González made him a viable challenger against Maduro.
As concerns over free and fair elections in Venezuela persist, here are three things to know about what’s at stake.
Venezuela’s protracted economic, social and political crisis has pushed millions into poverty, consequently creating the largest displacement crisis in the world. An estimated 8 million Venezuelans have migrated to other parts of Latin America, the U.S. and other countries.
The once economically prosperous nation is home to the world’s largest oil reserves. Financial mismanagement of that sector during Maduro’s term, compounded with strict sanctions imposed by the United States in 2019, has triggered a domino effect that resulted in the collapse of Venezuela’s economy and the start of an ongoing humanitarian crisis that has left people without access to food, health care and other basic necessities. Over 80% of the people in Venezuela live in poverty.
Against this background, polls began showing eroding support for Maduro and the Chavista regime. The shift has reignited hope among Venezuelans who see Sunday’s election as “the final opportunity for a change in the country,” according to polls published by Americas Society/Council of the Americas.
Opposition parties and leaders have tapped into this sentiment to rally supporters, intensifying their calls to restore democracy.
Since winning her primary in October, Machado has become the driving force behind the opposition movement in Venezuela.
Machado gained appeal after promising to rebuild Venezuela’s economy in the hopes that many of the people who have fled will be able to return.
Her voter mobilization efforts have been able to cut through ingrained political apathy stemming from years of government repression from a regime known for arresting dissidents and suppressing protests.
But Venezuela’s highest court officially banned Machado from holding office in January based on fraud and corruption allegations she has denied. This made her ineligible to appear on the ballot Sunday.
González then emerged as the opposition’s surrogate candidate in May. The pair campaigned together until Thursday, when the presidential campaign season officially ended.
Venezuela’s main opposition party has said that more than three dozen opposition activists have gone into hiding or been detained since January.
During the election cycle, Maduro has retained control over the country’s legislature, military and the national election council, as well as the justice system, much of the media and violent paramilitary gangs.
That remains to be seen.
The U.S. and even some of Maduro’s allies in Brazil and Colombia have urged him to accept the results of the election after his threats of a “bloodbath.” 
“We support peaceful elections that we expect and hope will come on Sunday,” White House spokesperson John Kirby said at a regular briefing in Washington. “Any political repression and violence is unacceptable.”
As many Venezuelans yearn for a legitimate election and a chance to vote Maduro out, they also worry he can find other ways to retain power. In the event that Maduro does end up leaving office, he may seek to negotiate an exit deal with the opposition to avoid prosecution in an international court over charges of crimes against humanity, The New York Times reported. At the same time, few Venezuelans expect the election to result in Maduro’s ousting.
Polls are expected to open 6 a.m. Sunday and close at 6 p.m. local time. Those standing in line by the time polls close will be allowed to vote. The results could be known as early as Monday morning.

NBC_8,Beach volleyball begins under the Eiffel Tower despite the torrential rains,https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/olympics/beach-volleyball-eiffel-tower-torrential-rains-rcna163934,2024-07-28 02:00:02.905064,,"PARIS — It may have been unrecognizable from the blue skies of the promotional photographs. But even the dayslong downpour soaking Paris 2024 could not detract from arguably the Games’ most epic venue, the Eiffel Tower Stadium, which hosted its first beach volleyball events Saturday.
What makes this temporary venue so visually stunning is also the reason it’s so exposed to the elements. Its 11,800 seats are not hindered by any roof or awning, so every seat in the house can see the Eiffel Tower backdrop looming over them.
It also meant that everyone got drenched.
Not that many people seemed to mind. Even a defeat for the United States against Cuba could not dampen the spirits of the crowd, which was dotted with fans proudly touting American colors.
Follow along for live coverage of the Olympics 
Miles Partain and Andy Benesh, the youngest American volleyball duo in U.S. history, were beaten in straight sets by Nolsen Diaz and Jorde Alayo from Cuba in the first match of the men’s Pool D. It was closer than the headline suggested, however, with both sets finishing a narrow 21-18.
“I’m proud of how we fought, and we will get better for the next one,” Benesh told his sport’s national governing body afterward, looking forward to their next game against Egypt on Tuesday.
The day’s second game saw top-ranked pairing, Sweden’s David Ahman and Jonatan Hellvig, defeat Australia’s Mark Nicolaidis and Izac Carracher in Pool A.
Some spectators not familiar with the sport may have assumed it would be canceled amid the torrent. After light rain in the morning, the dark clouds over the Eiffel Tower waited until play started at 2 p.m. to really start hammering it down.
It takes more than a bit of rain to put off beach volleyballers, however. And their every serve, block and “dig” — where a player manages to somehow keep the ball in play from an opponent’s shot — was met with gasps, whoops and applause.
During the downtime, the bedraggled crowd under ponchos and umbrellas kept their spirits high with Mexican waves, chants and clattering, unified stamping on the temporary bleachers.
“We didn’t really know what was going on with all the moves, but we joined in anyway,” said Garrett Gravesen, 43, a consultant from Atlanta who defied the deluge with his Stars-and-Stripes suit and tie, red sunglasses and necklace. “We had a blast!”
Brighter days are ahead. The rain is forecast to stop Sunday, and there will be beach volleyball games here every day until the men’s gold and bronze medal matches Aug 10.
The other American male pairing is Chase Budinger and Miles Evans. And Taryn Kloth and Kristen Nuss, alongside favorites Kelly Cheng and Sara Hughes, make up the women’s teams for the U.S. Cheng and Hughes in particular will be hoping to defend the gold medal won by Alix Klineman and April Ross in Tokyo 2021.
They will do so in front of one of the most spectacular backdrops in world sport — just hopefully while the sun is shining.
“For Americans, we always want tickets to the basketball, but these were the tickets we wanted this time,” said Blake McCall, 38, who runs spas and hair salons in San Francisco.  “Just for the venue and the view of the Eiffel Tower. It’s so special.”Alexander Smith is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital based in London."
NBC_9,Trump hails crypto at largest bitcoin conference,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-hails-crypto-largest-bitcoin-conference-rcna163925,2024-07-28 07:00:02.835354,,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump promised to make America the world leader in bitcoin and other digital currencies if elected, likening the crypto-verse to “the steel industry of 100 years ago.”
Speaking at the annual Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, Tennessee, to a standing-room-only crowd, Trump promised to ensure America becomes “the crypto capital of the planet and bitcoin superpower of the world.”
Trump painted himself as a crypto advocate in contrast to the Biden administration and other Democrats, who he said had proven unfriendly to their cause.
Trump said — to rapturous applause from the Nashville crowd — that if elected, he would fire current Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, whom the crypto world has come to view as its chief opponent in government due to his agency’s rulings on digital tokens and lawsuits against bitcoin exchanges.
“I will appoint an SEC chair who will build the future, not block the future,” Trump said.
His embrace of crypto comes amid high-profile endorsements from bitcoin advocates including Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twin brothers best known for suing Mark Zuckerberg over the creation of Facebook and who founded the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange.
Trump’s remarks stand to further cement his growing alliance with other right-leaning figures in the tech world, though the novelty of his appearance at the conference was not lost on him. As he praised the audience as “geniuses,” he acknowledged he was still learning about crypto.
“Most people have no idea what the hell it is,” he quipped. “So what happens when everyone figures it out? That’ll be something.”
Trump offered up a proposal to create a national bitcoin “stockpile” that he said would serve as a “permanent national asset,” though stopped short of offering many details.
The idea of creating a strategic crypto reserve has caught on quickly among bitcoin supporters. On Friday, independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also proposed creating a bitcoin reserve, saying he would direct the Treasury to purchase 4 million bitcoins, which in today’s prices would equate to approximately $272 billion.
Immediately following Trump’s remarks, Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., said she would introduce a bill to create the reserve.
However, the price of bitcoin fell slightly in the wake of Trump’s remarks Saturday, perhaps reflecting crypto traders’ unmet expectations for a more definitive commitment on the reserve idea from the presidential candidate.
While the Bitcoin Conference is officially apolitical, Trump’s speech punctuated an event whose politico panelists leaned Republican, including four sitting GOP senators and three GOP Senate candidates.
The sole elected Democrat, California Rep. Ro Khanna, spoke early Saturday and criticized the tendency within his own party to further entrench traditional centers of finance.
“I thought the Democrats were opposed to monopoly power. … We don’t want the banks and the Fed to have a monopoly on fast payments,” Khanna said at a panel Saturday.
Shortly after his morning remarks, Bitcoin Magazine reported that a group of Democratic representatives and candidates had sent a letter to the Democratic National Committee urging party leaders to be more supportive of crypto.
In addition to Khanna, the letter’s signatories included representatives in purple districts in critical swing states like North Carolina and Arizona.
The current administration’s “hostility,” the signees said, does not reflect “our Party’s progressive, forward-looking, and inclusive values.”
“A refreshed leader of the ticket represents an opportunity to change that perception,” they wrote.
In a follow-up interview with NBC News at the conference, Khanna said that positively engaging with the crypto community would be in keeping with Democrats’ desire to be “the party of the future.”
“They’re passionate, they’re active on social media, and they’re mobilized,” Khanna said. “And it’s a community that’s going to vote.”
Conference organizers say Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris declined an invitation to appear at the conference. The organizers declined to comment further on the matter, though conference head David Bailey criticized Harris’ absence on X. Harris’ campaign has not commented.
In an interview with NBC News on Friday, Bailey said that despite Harris not appearing at the conference, the window had not closed on Democrats’ ability to win support from the crypto community.
“There’s a whole progressive case for bitcoin,” he said. While that rationale may not have received as much notice, Bailey said, “my intuition is, over the next four years, it will.”
On Saturday, the Financial Times reported Harris had approached top crypto companies seeking a “reset” of relations, citing unnamed sources.
Bailey said it would ultimately become a political necessity for all political parties to engage with bitcoin supporters as a political bloc.
“It’s not too late — in fact, everyone will have to come to terms with it,” he said. “They won’t be viable otherwise.”
Outside the conference early Saturday, pro-Trump bitcoin supporters made their presence known.
Chad Kozman, an Ohio resident, sported a “Free Ross/Vote Trump” shirt, referring to the community’s desire to see Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht’s life sentence on drug and money-laundering charges commuted, something Trump has promised he would do.
Kozman told NBC News that while Trump’s overtures to the crypto community were opportunistic, it was also a sign that the community had matured beyond its individualistic roots into a voting group that had to be reckoned with.
“For the bitcoin community, it’s been a really hard road to get people to see the benefits of collectivization and pulling together,” he said.Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com."

The New York Times editorial board pleaded with Vice President Kamala Harris to ""do better"" than her former running mate in fielding questions from reporters. 
""Vice President Kamala Harris, now the likely Democratic nominee, has the chance to encourage and embrace the kind of close examination that the public so far has had little opportunity to witness during the 2024 race,"" the Times editorial board wrote Friday. 
""Americans deserve a campaign that tests the strengths and weaknesses of the candidates; that highlights their differences and allows scrutiny of their plans; that motivates people to vote by giving them a clear account of how their choice in this election will affect their lives. Americans deserve the opportunity to ask questions of those who are seeking to lead their government.""

While the Times said the rollout of the Harris campaign offered ""promising signs"" of a positive change, it said the VP ""needs to do more, and she needs to do it quickly.""
""Ms. Harris ought to challenge Mr. Trump to a series of debates or town halls on subjects of national importance, such as the economy, foreign policy, health care and immigration. Mr. Trump claims that he is ready and willing to participate in debates once Democrats have officially selected a nominee. Americans would benefit from comparing the two candidates directly,"" the editorial board told readers. 
NEW YORK TIMES SPINS KAMALA HARRIS' PAST WORD SALADS AS ‘CELEBRATORY ARTIFACTS’ WITH CANDIDACY UNDERWAY
The Times went on to insist ""both candidates need to start taking questions from reporters, too.""
""Candidates have abundant opportunities to speak directly to voters, through social media and tightly controlled public appearances, without the mediation of journalists. Most voters, however, will never be able to speak directly with candidates,"" the editorial board said. ""President Biden has rarely granted the news media permission to ask questions on behalf of the American people, and on the rare occasions he did, his team sometimes sent scripted questions. It left him poorly prepared for the campaign trail and for confronting his opponent. Mr. Trump, too, rarely takes questions. Ms. Harris has the chance to do better.""

""Engaging with voters is especially important for Ms. Harris because she would be the first major-party presidential candidate in modern times who did not pass through the state primary process, in which voters have a chance to take the measure of candidates and to ask questions about the issues that matter most to their communities,"" the piece continued. ""Addressing small crowds in small places and answering questions from local reporters are rituals during the primaries for a reason. Unlike large public rallies, they are occasions for encounters on equal footing, and they are an education for the candidate as much as for voters.""
""Good leaders speak, and they listen. They welcome scrutiny. They accept responsibility. Ms. Harris now has a chance to demonstrate that she will be the kind of leader who deserves the nation’s support,"" the Times later added.

In April, the Times editorial board called out Biden for ""avoiding interviews and questions from major news organizations"" in a scathing piece. The paper also called on the president to drop out of the race following his disastrous debate performance last month.

Vice President Kamala Harris no longer supports a fracking ban, in a change in her stance during the last presidential election, her campaign said on Friday, according to a report. 
Before she dropped her bid for president in 2019 and joined President Biden’s ticket, she said in a CNN town hall ""there’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking.""
""And starting with what we can do on day one around public lands, right?"" she continued. ""And then there has to be legislation, but, yes, that’s something I’ve taken on in California. I have a history of working on this issue and to your point we have to just acknowledge that the residual impact of fracking is enormous in terms of the health and safety of communities.""
Harris also cosponsored the Green New Deal as a senator in 2019, a proposal to stem climate change that includes a ban on fracking.

""Climate change is real, and it poses an existential threat to us as human beings, and it is within our power to do something about it,"" Harris said on the campaign trail that year before exiting the race, according to The New York Times. ""I am supporting the Green New Deal.""
However, Biden’s campaign and his administration have not backed banning fracking despite Biden once saying during a primary debate ""We would make sure it’s eliminated."" His campaign later clarified that he ""supports eliminating subsidies for coal and gas and deploying carbon capture.""   
Since Biden announced he is dropping out of the race and endorsed Harris last Sunday, she has moderated some of her positions from her 2019 run, in which she embraced more progressive policies. 
Trump was quick to paint her as a ""radical liberal"" since she became the presumptive Democratic nominee.
Harris is the ""most incompetent and far-left vice president in American history,"" the former president told a rally crowd in Charlotte on Wednesday. 
Trump charged that Harris ""has been the ultra-liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe. She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country if she ever gets the chance to get into office.""

He added, ""She wants no fracking. You’re going to be paying a lot of money. You’re going to be paying so much. You’re going to say ‘bring back Trump.’""
Telling The Hill that Harris no longer wants to ban fracking, her campaign pushed back on Trump’s rhetoric. 
""Trump’s false claims about fracking bans are an obvious attempt to distract from his own plans to enrich oil and gas executives at the expense of the middle class,"" the campaign told The Hill. ""The Biden-Harris Administration passed the largest ever climate change legislation and under their leadership, America now has the highest ever domestic energy production,"" the spokesperson said in an email. ""This Administration created 300,000 energy jobs, while Trump lost nearly a million and his Project 2025 would undo the enormous progress we’ve made the past four years.""

In a statement to Fox News Digital, National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Mike Marinella, said, ""Kamala Harris is the most far-left progressive presidential nominee in history, and extreme Democrats in the Rust Belt now own every single policy she supports.""
He added, ""A fracking ban would be disastrous for workers and families, and extreme Democrats’ mission to force Biden to step aside and replace him with San Francisco radical Kamala Harris shows exactly how out of touch they are with their voters.""

""Clinging to life, he was able to catch a wave back to the beach,"" a fundraising site set up for McKenzie said. ""A retired police officer used his dog’s lead as a tourniquet to stem the bleeding before the victim could be airlifted to hospital.""
Amazingly, McKenzie’s leg washed up on the beach after the attack and doctors are hoping to be able to reattach it. 
McKenzie has undergone surgery and remains in critical but stable condition, according to ABC News Australia and the fundraising site.

Luke Short, who makes McKenzie’s surfboards, told ABC they had all hoped ""we heard it wrong.""
""It's amazing that he's survived,"" he added. 
His surf team RAGE called McKenzie the ""toughest person we know.""
""Sending love to @kai_mckenzie the youngest RAGE boy on the team and the toughest person that we know,"" the team wrote on Instagram this week. ""Yesterday he was attacked by a shark and has lost his leg while surfing in Port Macquarie. He has been through a lot breaking his back last year, he never once complained always just got on with doing what he loved as soon as possible. He is an inspiring person. The whole rage gang loves you man and we will see you soon.""

She added that the off-duty officer ""used the lead off a dog as a tourniquet to wrap around the young man’s leg and essentially saved his life.""
A post shared by RAGE (@ragetm)
Kevin Young, vice president of Bite Club, a shark attack survivors club, told the broadcast: ""And I know he lost a leg and they packed it with ice and they’re going down to try to reattach it. That just blows my brain that that might be possible.""

FOX_6,How to fight Democrats' devious Kamala Harris disinformation? Start with a song in your heart,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/how-fight-democrats-devious-kamala-harris-disinformation-start-song-your-heart,2024-07-27 10:00:02.649273,opinion,"Fox News correspondent Griff Jenkins has more on questions surrounding Vice President Kamala Harris' border role on 'Special Report.' 
If there was one thing we learned from the Biden administration, it’s that the best way to fight misinformation is with musical numbers.
It is in that spirit that I would like to take a look at the three most glaring and horrifying examples of blatant disinformation peddled to the American people in Vice President Kamala Harris’ six-day-old presidential campaign. Not just by showing the obvious lies, but with a few new versions of popular show tunes we can all sing along to and share.
The most obvious example is Democrats and the media’s stunning 180 on whether Harris was Joe Biden’s border czar. She was. The same way that John Kerry was climate czar and Bill Bennett was once education czar. It's a term of art, not an official, literal appointment to Russian royalty.
LIBERAL MEDIA CLAIMS KAMALA HARRIS WAS NEVER ‘BORDER CZAR,’ CONTRADICTING THEIR OWN REPORTING
Joe Biden put Harris in charge of stemming the tide at the border, several times, and it’s on tape. Republicans aren’t just making it up and the media had no problem at all calling the vice president the point person for the border. Now suddenly, it's not true.
So for this bit of misinformation I went with the Gene Autry classic written in 1939 by Michael Carr and Jimmy Kennedy, ""South of the Border Down Mexico Way.""
Our Southern border
Was run by a czar
Her name was Ka-ma-la 
And she had one job
The migrants to bar
She said - don’t come here,
In your homelands please stay
But over 8 million,
They came anyway.
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay, indeed. 
The next tremendous lie I wanted to tackle was that somehow, in just two and a half days, Kamala Harris ""earned"" the nomination through a vigorous, ""grassroots"" and ""bottom up"" effort. To hear good ol’ Chuck Schumer and the liberal media tell it, tens of millions of Democratic voters showed up at their local Elks Lodge or something and held straw polls. In fact, to this day, nobody has voted for Kamala for president except the party bosses.
Here I decided to go with the 1924 classic by Isham Jones and Gus Kahn, that we all remember Dooley Wilson playing in ""Casablanca:"" ""It Had to Be You.""
It had to be Kamala
It had to be Kamala
The voters be damned, the bosses demand
The poor suckers follow ya
For nobody else, Barack will obey
So, it’s Harris all the way
It had to be Kamala
Cacklin' Kamala
It had to be HER!

Finally, there is the little matter of Govtrack, a supposedly neutral website removing a past page accurately calling Harris the most liberal senator. All the while, her Wikipedia page is being scrubbed. And God knows what other information is being furiously erased in Orwellian fashion. It is the rewriting of history right before our eyes and they aren’t even trying to hide. Gone is the old leftist Kamala; in is the new moderate version.
The natural selection from the American songbook here is the Rogers and Hammerstein number ""Wash that Man Right Out of My Hair,"" from the musical ""South Pacific.""
I’m gonna wash that woke right outta my hair
I’m gonna wash that woke right outta my hair
Govtrack’ll will erase it
The media will replace it
And push new Kamala through the door.

Sunday marks 100 days until Election Day 2024.
It also marks one week since President Biden's political landscape-altering announcement that he was suspending his re-election rematch against former President Trump.
Biden made his move amid mounting pressure from within the Democratic Party for him to drop out after a disastrous performance in last month's first presidential debate with Trump.

The embattled president's immediate backing of Vice President Kamala Harris last Sunday ignited a surge of endorsements for the vice president by Democratic governors, senators, House members and other party leaders. Within 36 hours, Harris announced that she had locked up her party's nomination by landing the verbal backing of a majority of the nearly 4,000 delegates to next month's Democratic National Convention. 
ICING ON THE DEMOCRATS' 2024 CAKE - THE OBAMAS ENDORSE HARRIS
Former President Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama on Friday became the final major party leaders to endorse the vice president.
Harris also hauled in a staggering $129 million in fundraising following Biden's announcement, which her campaign touted on Thursday morning.
""It’s go-time for both sides,"" longtime Republican consultant David Kochel told Fox News.
Besides uniting and exciting Democrats, the replacement of Biden by his vice president as the party's standard-bearer - which is expected to become official during a virtual roll call of convention delegates that starts on Aug. 1 - has given Harris a bump in public opinion polling.

What was once a margin-of-error race between Biden and Trump had turned into a clear edge for the former president in the weeks after their June 27 debate showdown in Atlanta. However, with Harris now at the top of the ticket and Biden out of the race, surveys indicate it is back to a margin-of-error race.
""Instead of what was shaping up to be a Trump win, America has a real, bona fide race on its hands,"" veteran political scientist and New England College President Wayne Lesperance said. ""Game on.""
While Harris faces the monumental task of going from zero to 60 in an extremely condensed timeline, she is not starting from scratch, as she immediately inherited Biden's large campaign apparatus with its vast ground-game resources in the key swing states.
However, Harris does face a crucial immediate task - choosing a running mate - which could come as early as the next week or two.
Biden and Trump are both well-known commodities to American voters.
However, Kochel, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns who remained neutral in the 2024 Republican primary, emphasized that most Americans know so little about the vice president's record and that both the Trump and Harris campaigns are ""in a race to define"" Harris.

In his first campaign rally since the presidential race was upended, Trump did not waste any time in trying to define his new opponent.
At a rally in the crucial battleground state of North Carolina, the Republican presidential nominee repeatedly took aim at Harris, whom he derogatorily called ""lying Kamala Harris.""
Trump aimed to paint Harris as the ""most incompetent and far-left vice president in American history.""
The former president charged that Harris ""has been the ultra-liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe. She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country if she ever gets the chance to get into office."" 
Additionally, pointing to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an Independent, a far-left champion and two-time runner-up for the Democratic presidential nomination, Trump argued that Harris is ""more liberal than Bernie Sanders. Can you believe it?""
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
Throughout his more than an hour and a half stream of comments, Trump repeatedly slammed the vice president over border security and crime, two top issues in the 2024 election.
Trump campaign spokesman and senior adviser Steven Cheung said that the former president's team was ready to go on offense the moment Harris succeeded Biden as the Democrats' standard-bearer.
""There wasn’t any surprise. We were prepared for it. We had all our assets ready. We had all our content ready. It didn’t surprise anyone,"" Cheung told reporters ahead of the Trump rally.

Harris, pushing back, is pointing to her hefty law enforcement résumé as she spotlights Trump's numerous legal controversies, including his 34 felony convictions two months ago in the first criminal trial of a former or current president.
""As many of you know, before I was elected as vice president, before I was elected as a United States senator, I was the elected attorney general of California. Before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds,"" Harris said Monday at an event at her campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware.
""Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type,"" she emphasized as she pointed to Trump's multiple lawsuits and criminal cases, many of which are ongoing.
Harris repeated the line of attack the next day at a rally in Milwaukee.
With 100 days to go until Election Day, the rhetoric this past week on the campaign trail is just an appetizer of things to come.

FOX_8,House lawmakers leave DC until September with government shutdown deadline looming,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-lawmakers-leave-dc-until-september-government-shutdown-deadline-looming,2024-07-27 16:00:02.751608,politics,"Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., on ongoing far-left protests, U.S. pausing weapons shipment to Israel and TikTok suing the U.S. government

The House of Representatives is officially off to an early start for its summer recess – a five-week period when lawmakers are back home in their districts focusing on local issues and their own re-election bids.
They will return on Sept. 9 – exactly three weeks from the deadline to fund the government in the next fiscal year.
That means the GOP-run House will have to compromise with the Democrat-controlled Senate or risk a partial government shutdown, with some federal offices shuttered and potentially thousands of government employees furloughed.
It’s all but certain at this point that a short-term extension of the current year’s funding, known as a ""continuing resolution"" (CR), will be needed to avoid a partial shutdown.
BIDEN ENDS BID FOR SECOND TERM IN WHITE HOUSE AS HE DROPS OUT OF HIS 2024 REMATCH WITH TRUMP

""I've always said we'd have to do a CR,"" House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., told reporters earlier this week. ""And then whoever wins the election will make the decision. Do you want a deal by the end of the year, or do you want to kick them to the next Congress? I hope, my advice to whoever wins, would be do it by the end of the year."" 
House GOP leaders had laid out an ambitious plan to finish their 12 individual appropriations bills before the current recess, momentum that was derailed by intraparty disagreements about where Republicans’ starting point should be.
GOP rebels pushed for spending bills rife with culture war amendments on issues like transgender surgeries and abortion, arguing that it was the Republicans’ right as a majority to leverage from the most conservative starting point.
Rank-and-file Republicans, however, were uneasy about being forced to take politically unpopular votes on measures that would not become law anyway, with no chance of passing the Democrat-controlled Senate.
So far, six of 12 bills have passed the House floor, while the Senate has not passed any.
TRUMP SAYS BIDEN 'IS NOT FIT TO SERVE': 'WHO IS GOING TO BE RUNNING THE COUNTRY FOR THE NEXT 5 MONTHS?'

The main discussion when lawmakers return in September will likely surround what a CR would look like in terms of length and what, if any, riders are attached.
Allies of former President Trump have pushed for a CR to extend into the new year in the hopes that Republicans will take back the White House and Senate. But senior GOP lawmakers expressed concern that it would add unnecessary drama to what’s already expected to be an action-packed first 100 days of the new administration. 
Some Trump allies are now also pushing for any CR to be paired with the Safeguarding American Voter Eligibility Act (SAVE Act), a GOP-backed bill that would add a proof-of-citizenship requirement to the voter registration process.
""We have been in session week after week for months after Speaker Johnson passed a two part omnibus, fully funding the Biden/Harris agenda in May…For what? Messaging? When the reality that we ALL know is that we will be forced to vote on a CR by Sept 30th which is the government funding deadline,"" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., wrote on X.
""And since we all know a CR is coming you would think we would be working on one that makes an impact like attaching the SAVE Act for example because our elections matter. But nope, we are up here voting at 9 pm tonight on bills that won’t see the light of day in Schumer’s Senate for nothing.""

In his comments to reporters earlier this week, however, Cole signaled that he was not enthusiastic about the idea.

""I haven't really thought about it yet, it’s not a big deal to me. But again, if it can't pass the Senate, it isn't going to be an effective CR,"" Cole said. ""So a real CR, you know, I'm more interested actually in disaster relief. That's something that I think the two sides can come together on.""
When reached for comment earlier this week about GOP frustrations over the spending process, a spokesperson for Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told Fox News Digital: ""The House has made significant progress in advancing FY25 appropriations bills. The House Appropriations Committee has diligently moved all 12 bills out of committee and the House has passed 75% of government funding for the upcoming fiscal year, while the Senate has yet to even consider a single appropriations bill. The House will continue its successful effort to responsibly fund the government for FY25 when it returns from its district work period.""

If former President Donald Trump returns to the White House and the GOP regains control of the Senate and retains control of the House, the Republican congressional leadership will have the opportunity to use the ""reconciliation process"" to enact urgently needed legislation.  ""There’s not a moment to lose!"" was a saying of the Royal Navy in the ""age of sail,"" one familiar to anyone who has read Patrick O’Brian’s splendid 20 volume Aubrey-Maturin series set at sea in the Napoleonic Wars (and in the single screen adaptation of the novels in ""Master and Commander,"" where Russell Crowe as Captain Jack Aubrey utters the familiar admonition to take every advantage of every day, hour and minute.)  The need in D.C. is indeed for speed. In the post-war era, Republicans have always meandered their way through their rare opportunities to legislate when all three lawmaking bodies are headed by Republicans. Always they have employed the standard Beltway calendar and four-day work weeks. They are never ready to move quickly, and rarely by April if that. Their majorities and the president who brought them along with his campaign have never landed in Washington, D.C., with anything like a big agenda and the urgency that is required to move big legislative packages. 
TRUMP CAMPAIGN DISMISSES LEFT'S 'ABSURD' CRITICISM OF JD VANCE: 'WE'RE FIGHTING FOR WORKING WOMEN'
Conservatives are by nature a careful lot, often cautious in the extreme. Given where we are in 2024, that deeply embedded caution has to go by the boards and everyone from Trump down to the ""biggest reach"" candidate in a Senate campaign — probably the campaign of Nella Domenici against incumbent Democrat Senator Martin Heinrich in New Mexico — has to pledge to go far, go fast and go together.  
Former U.S. President Donald Trump would need help from congressional Republicans to hit the ground running the day he takes office. (Getty Images)
The country needs this dynamic urgency to repair the massive damage done to the economy during the Biden-Harris years and to assure the superpower status of the U.S. Indeed, the urgent need to stop our ""national bleeding"" in every phase of our federal government has to dominate the GOP’s collective fall campaign. Much needs to be done, and every GOP candidate should be insistent on its immediate doing when sworn in.  ""Reconciliation"" is celebrating its 50th anniversary, having been established by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. This process allows for expedited consideration of certain tax, spending and debt limit legislation. In the Senate, reconciliation bills aren’t subject to filibuster, which means the GOP would have real advantages for enacting controversial budget and tax measures.   The key is that every provision of bills passed pursuant to reconciliation must have a genuine nexus with the spending plans adopted by Congress as part of an overall budget. Thus, if the overall budget agreed to by the House Republicans and Senate Republicans is silent on a subject — neither spending money on a goal nor cutting past expenditures made on that subject — the reconciliation process cannot be used, and the Senate’s filibuster will prevent serious reforms of outdated laws and ruinous spending.  ""Reconciliation"" is the process that allowed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to spend trillions of dollars on pork on the unnecessary and hugely expensive ""COVID relief"" package in 2021 and the absurdly named ""Inflation Reduction Act"" of 2022, which spent more trillions and made inflation worse.  
If the reconciliation window opens in 2025, I hope President Trump would use it to:  (1) Mandate a massive defense re-armament on an expedited basis, one constructed along the lines of the program put forward by Mississippi Republican Senator Roger Wicker earlier this year, and one that specifically mandates the construction or refurbishing of shipyards without regard to any other law that would slow that process down. In short, we need an immediate and enormous crash defense build-up, one that gets the Columbia class nuclear submarine into the water in time to replace our aging Ohio class ""boomers,"" and one which substantially expands our and our allies’ attack submarine forces and which expands our cyber and satellite capabilities as we reorient our military toward the vast threat posed by Communist China;  (2) Extend the Trump Tax Cuts plus the exemption of tips from taxable income and the taxation of endowments greater than a billion dollars;  (3) Authorize the rapid expansion of energy production from every source, suspending the cumbersome regulatory hurdles used by the administrative state to cripple production and export of energy and the construction of modern nuclear plants which have to drive our AI revolution;

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)
(4) Mandate massive reductions in force across the hundreds of federal agencies and commissions and from the nearly 3 million federal bureaucrats via both the direct order to cut every federal bureaucracy not specifically exempted (the Border Patrol for example) by at least a third of its civilian workforce, and the repeal of those portions of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 that make it effectively impossible to discipline the administrative state;  (5) Mandate and ""authorize for immediate construction notwithstanding any other law or treaty with any nation"" of up to 1,200 miles of border wall;  (6) Condition the flow of federal dollars to K-12 education on the existence in every state that wants those federal dollars of a robust ""school choice"" program modeled on either the existing programs in Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Ohio or West Virginia. This exercise of the Constitution’s spending power is a tried-and-true means of creating incentives for the states to innovate;  (7) Prohibit the award of any grant or other form of federal subsidy to any college or university with an endowment in excess of a billion dollars. The idea what the taxpayer is funding institutions like Harvard with its nearly $50-billion-dollar endowment and deep ideological disfigurement is absurd. (The authority to suspend all federal funding on colleges or universities with documented histories of antisemitic environments should be a part of this new approach.)
(8) Zero out funding for National Public Radio, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities and all other grant-making by all other agencies for a period of four years or until a balanced budget is achieved. 
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION (9) Condition federal spending on maintenance of state election systems on the adaptation of a uniform set of election procedures including the use of voter ID and the limiting of absentee voting to carefully vetted ballots obtained via carefully regulated procedures. Every state should be able to report its returns on election night or within a week of a recount if mandated, or forfeit federal funding.  
The standard ""California model"" that sees routine delay of weeks for counting ballots for at least federal offices — a certain and recurring embarrassment to the Golden State — should not be tolerated or at a minimum not subsidized. No other country in the West permits California-like haphazardness in the rendering of the people’s decision, and the spending power and control over federal election law should be used to end the elections chaos in California and similarly ""progressive states."" The prohibition of ""ranked voting"" for federal office ought also to be passed into law. ""Ranked voting"" is a sham upon the electorate worked by progressives upon an unsuspecting citizenry and an invitation to even more election chaos. 
""Reconciliation"" is the process that allowed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to spend trillions of dollars on pork on the unnecessary and hugely expensive ""COVID relief"" package in 2021 and the absurdly named ""Inflation Reduction Act"" of 2022, which spent more trillions and made inflation worse.  
That’s a collective ""big swing"" of various measures that would reset the federal government, but all these measures (and more) should easily fit into the confines of the reconciliation process. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris used the process to vastly deepen our national debt, pour out previously unimaginable levels of pork, and unleash the ruinous inflation that has defined their tenure in office. 
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP When Donald Trump was new to the government business in 2017, he, his senior advisors and the congressional Republicans failed to make effective use of reconciliation in his first year in office, instead chasing after and failing to gain the repeal of the now embedded Obamacare. In his new term, Trump won’t go along with other than his own agenda. Making his own priorities clear will allow the Republican Congressional leadership to fashion the legislative language needed to get the big changes accomplished within Trump’s second ""100 days.""  ""Transitions"" are typically wasted on the game of who gets named to what job. Again, Trump learned hard lessons in the 2016-2017 transition, and will as a result come prepared with his list of his nominees and the new GOP Senate should expedite their confirmations, using round-the-clock and weekend sessions if defeated Democrats begin their slow walking immediately. But Trump also needs to light a fire under his GOP allies on the Hill. There is genuinely not a moment to lose.

FOX_11,Here's what American universities should teach instead of activism,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/heres-what-american-universities-should-teach-instead-of-activism,2024-07-27 20:01:02.900499,opinion,"Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., joins ‘Fox News Live’ to discuss the House hearing on campus workplace antisemitism.
Colleges and universities are failing our country. This seems to be the growing consensus among an increasingly large percentage of Americans and business leaders.
The recent Gallup and Lumina Foundation report shows that an increasing number of Americans have little to no confidence in higher education. For the first time since Gallup begin to measure the confidence level in higher education, America is ""now nearly equally divided among those who have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence (36%), some confidence (32%), or little or no confidence (32%) in higher education.""  
This finding represents a seismic shift from 2015, when almost 60% of Americans had a high level of confidence and 10% had little or none. 
America is ""now nearly equally divided among those who have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence (36%), some confidence (32%), or little or no confidence (32%) in higher education."" (Christopher Furlong/Getty Images) 
Many business leaders equally reflect the growing lack of confidence. In a recent interview, Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase CEO, criticized colleges and universities for the little focus they place on helping graduates find good employment. 
COLLEGES, CHAOS AND CASH: NO WONDER CONFIDENCE IN HIGHER EDUCATION TODAY IS SO LOW
This unwillingness, so argues Dimon, not only places an exorbitant amount of pressure on businesses to train their employees – something pre-employment education should do – but also disenfranchises large sectors of society.  
Kiersten Barnet, executive director of New York Jobs CEO Council – a group of 30 of America’s top CEOs and their companies – was perhaps more direct than Dimon, stating: ""When you think about what you need to do a job, it is skills. It's not a degree.""
America’s growing doubts about colleges and universities are rooted in a list of causes too long to detail here, but it is worth noting that the lack of confidence is connected to certain factors. The most notable of these being what colleges and universities teach and do not teach. 
In Gallup’s report, of the Americans who register little or no confidence, almost 40%, criticize colleges and universities ""for not teaching relevant skills, for college degrees not meaning much, or for graduates not being able to find employment.""
CONSERVATIVE COLLEGE STUDENTS SAY GROWING LIBERAL BIAS HAS FORCED THEM TO HIDE BELIEFS: 'CAN'T SPEAK FREELY'
Indeed, a new survey released this week by Cengage Group found that 55% of recent graduates said their degree programs did not prepare them for the workforce, with 70% saying basic AI training should be taught. These are, in essence, the same concerns of business leaders like Dimon and Barnet. 
Gallup’s report goes a step further, however. Slightly over 40% of Americans in this same low to no confidence group think that our colleges and universities ""are pushing certain political agendas."" In short, many believe that higher education is miseducating our students. Rather than preparing for careers and a productive life, colleges and universities appear to be preparing students to be radical activists.  
Further, the miseducation of our students as it relates to gainful employment – ""good jobs"" – is a serious problem since it robs from our students the opportunity for a fuller humanity. Jobs and compensation are essential for our humanity. But good jobs and good compensation are even more essential for a flourishing humanity and, by extension, a flourishing society. 
COLUMBIA PROFESSOR TOLD STUDENTS TO AVOID MAINSTREAM MEDIA BECAUSE 'IT IS OWNED BY JEWS:' REPORT
Amid its many laudable goals, higher education must focus on preparing students for good jobs and compensation. To do any less is to perpetrate a great injustice on our students and our future. 
When students are miseducated to become radical activists, the injustice perpetrated is even greater and the damage is even more corrosive. Students are duped into believing that radical activism adds value to their own life and to society when in fact it is the opposite. Such pursuits rob from students the exercise of their productive full potential, thus undermining their good as well as that of all society.
To re-ignite public and business confidence in their work, colleges and universities must have a singular focus on preparing students for meaningful jobs and careers. This begins with implementing industry-ready skills-based educational outcomes for their general education curriculum and all academic majors. 
US COMPANIES INCREASINGLY ELIMINATE COLLEGE DEGREES AS A REQUIREMENT AMID 'OUT-OF-CONTROL' SCHOOL COSTS
Colleges and universities should also require internships or apprenticeships for the honing of soft and industry-specifics skills as well as to create employment opportunities. And colleges and universities should require all academic departments to have industry and business partnerships for the continual refinement of curricula and preparation of students for the market.
While there may be additional market-related refinements that could be implemented, there is no doubt that the above initiatives would go a long way to re-igniting our confidence in higher education.
 The focus on jobs and market preparation must also consider and integrate the enduring questions and answers to what it means to be human. This is what the humanities used to address.
Today, much of the humanities are characterized by a turn toward a contrarianism and deconstructionism that emphasize moral ambiguity and skepticism. Such an approach has resulted in generations of students who at best are sophisticated critics and at worst are radical activists. These students are too often unable to discern, affirm and defend truth and what it means to be human. 
STEVEN PINKER: YOUNG PEOPLE SICK AND TIRED OF BEING TOLD, 'YOU CAN'T SAY THAT, YOU CAN'T THINK THAT' ON CAMPUS
A case in point are the recent protests in which students were clearly unable to discern good from evil. Some college presidents also fared no better. 
Colleges and universities must develop and implement moral skills educational outcomes for their general education curriculum and all academic majors that prepare all students to discern and affirm what is true, beautiful and good.  
All students should also have a significant service requirement during each year of college that is a prerequisite for graduation. This service requirement would be connected to the moral skills outcomes allowing students to apply and refine their moral reasoning and judgment in preparation for life beyond college.

Our colleges and universities must educate students with industry skills that position them for great market contributions. This education must also include moral skills that position our students for living a great life characterized by truth, beauty and goodness.  
Both industry and moral skills are essential for our students and for the future of our country, and a serious focus on these would go a long way in re-igniting the confidence in America’s colleges and universities.

FOX_12,Where does Joe Biden rank among America's worst presidents?,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/where-does-joe-biden-rank-among-americas-worst-presidents,2024-07-27 22:01:02.814944,opinion,"Former President Trump seemingly goes off-script to note the 'damage' the Biden administration has done to the country at the Republican National Convention.
President Biden's time in the White House is mercifully coming to an end. He's now officially a lame duck with six months to go.
Biden was a victim here of a corrupt Democratic machine (with a complicit media) that thought it could pull off a grand election-year deceit despite Biden's failing cognitive abilities. 
The establishment and a compliant media convinced millions of primary voters that he was of sound mind and ready to serve four more years. This lust for power put America in danger. How could they be so unpatriotic?
President Biden and former President Jimmy Carter (AP)
So where will Biden stand in the history books? He wasn't a failed president because of his declining cognitive abilities. It was his policies that wrecked America.
AMERICA'S WORST EX-PRESIDENTS: WOULD THESE 4 MEN BE ON YOUR LIST?
From his first days in the Oval Office, he governed from the far left on everything from climate change to radical income redistribution to massive government expansionism to racial politics to a ""blame America first"" foreign policy to his dangerous weaponization of every agency of government, from the IRS to the State Department to the FBI to the Justice Department and perhaps even the Secret Service. 
He made Richard Nixon look like an amateur.
It's hard to point to a single policy that he got right. On the economy he was catastrophically bad. The trillions of dollars of debt he rang up bought nothing. 
He sent inflation to the highest levels in almost 40 years. The average family lost $2,000 of income after inflation during his reign. Test scores fell. More people died of COVID-19 during his presidency than in former President Trump's – despite the availability of the vaccine 
BEFORE BIDEN, THESE 5 PAST PRESIDENTS FACED HEALTH ISSUES AMID RE-ELECTION
Interest rates rose. Home ownership became a pipe dream for young people. Homeowners faced mortgage payments that doubled.

Biden declared war on American energy. He put America back into the corrupt Paris climate accords. The rest of the world went on using more fossil fuels than ever. By impeding U.S. oil and gas production and pipelines, he played into the hands of our enemies – China and Iran.
Gas prices rose. Small business confidence sagged. Two-thirds of Americans consistently told pollsters that the economy was ""fair"" or ""poor."" Poverty rates rose.
Even the one statistic that Biden boasts about – job creation – is a mirage. Most of the jobs were government or health care jobs. With the government borrowing $2 trillion a year, there is no reason the government should be hiring more workers.
WHAT MAKES A PRESIDENT GREAT?
Then there was the sheer incompetence. The bungled Afghanistan withdrawal was a national security disaster. The border became a broken dam, with some 10 million illegals flowing into the country. The government spent $7 billion to build electric vehicles, and only a handful got built.
Biden gave away hundreds of billions of dollars for an illegal and immoral student loan forgiveness program. He put regulators of key agencies in charge even though – or because – they hate business. Less than 10% of his appointees had any business experience. It showed.

When he departs the White House in January, he will leave the nation poorer, weaker, more divided, more in debt, more vulnerable and less respected than when he entered office.

The Department of Justice has settled with two former FBI officials over violation of privacy rights.
Former counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page filed suit against the Justice Department over the release of their text message conversations expressing contempt for former President Donald Trump.
According to court documents reviewed by the Associated Press, Strzok settled his case for $1.2 million, while Page received $800,000.

In 2019, Strzok argued in a court filing in Washington, D.C., federal district court that his politically charged anti-Trump messages were protected by the First Amendment even though he sent them on bureau-issued phones while playing leading roles in the probes into both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.
Strzok, once the FBI's head of counterintelligence, said he was entitled to ""develop a full factual record through discovery,"" and that it would be premature to dismiss the case at this early stage. He went on to argue that the DOJ's position would ""leave thousands of career federal government employees without protections from discipline over the content of their political speech.""
""This outcome is a critical step forward in addressing the government’s unfair and highly politicized treatment of Pete,"" said lawyer Aitan Goelam, who is representing Strzok.

Goelam continued, ""As important as it is for him, it also vindicates the privacy interests of all government employees. We will continue to litigate Pete’s constitutional claims to ensure that, in the future, public servants are protected from adverse employment actions motivated by partisan politics.""
Page also filed suit against the FBI and Department of Justice, alleging the government's publication of her salacious text messages with Strzok constituted a breach of the Federal Privacy Act.

Page's complaint also sought reimbursement for ""the cost of childcare during and transportation to multiple investigative reviews and appearances before Congress,"" the ""cost of paying a data-privacy service to protect her personal information"" and attorney's fees.

(COURTESY: REUTERS)
Venezuelans head to the polls on Sunday for their first full presidential election in over a decade after opposition parties ended their boycott and coalesced around a single candidate in hopes of ousting the current regime. 
""The de facto opposition leader Maria Corina Machado has galvanized the Venezuelan people to the point that both Chavistas and anti-Chavistas in Venezuela want a change,"" Joseph Humire, the executive director of the Center for a Secure Free Society (SFS), told Fox News Digital. 
""But changing the president is not enough,"" Humire cautioned. ""Regardless of who is Venezuela’s next president, the criminal system embedded in Venezuelan institutions will adapt and continue operating. An internal effort is necessary but insufficient to dismantle the Venezuela Threat Network.""
""Yet, this doesn’t take away from what Maria Corina has done regardless of the outcome on Sunday – give Venezuelans another chance,"" he added. 
VENEZUELAN MIGRANTS' BARBARIC CRIMES COME AS MADURO REFUSES TO TAKE BACK ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM US
Opposition supporters have backed Edmundo Gonzalez, who had an overwhelming lead over the incumbent Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro heading into the weekend, according to the BBC. Maduro has warned that a defeat for his United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) would result in a ""bloodbath.""

PSUV led a coalition that holds 256 of the 277 seats in the country’s National Assembly, and has control over Supreme Tribunal of Justice courts and the National Electoral Council. The opposition could never unite behind a single candidate, and parties boycotted the 2018 election because of accusations that free and fair elections were not possible under Maduro’s government. 
Humire on social media platform X posted polling data that showed expected results based on low or high levels of expected voter participation, in both cases showing Maduro getting around half as many votes as Gonzalez would get.
HARRIS FAILED TO COMBAT ‘ROOT CAUSES’ OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, FORMER BORDER PATROL UNION CHIEF SAYS
Humire speculated that Maduro must either engage in massive fraud to steal the election or strike a deal to stay in power.
Demonstrations held Thursday ahead of the vote drew thousands to the capital, where Maduro claimed his opponents promoted violence while he wanted only peace, and the opposition faced an uphill battle to get their message out: State television did not broadcast any of the opposition rally, according to The Associated Press. 
And Reuters reported that Venezuelans abroad have struggled to register to vote as bureaucratic hurdles have kept all but a small fraction of voters from being ready for Sunday.

FOX_16,Pollster finds 'astounding change' in Democratic electorate since Harris' ascension,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pollster-finds-astounding-change-democratic-electorate-harris-ascension,2024-07-28 03:10:02.905064,politics,"Panelists weigh in on the latest Fox News polls between former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris in battleground states on 'Special Report'.
A new poll from The Wall Street Journal has found Vice President Kamala Harris neck and neck with Donald Trump after President Biden vacated the Democratic nomination for November’s election. 
""Only 37% of Biden voters were enthusiastic about him in early July, and now 81% of Harris voters are enthusiastic about her,"" Democratic pollster Mike Bocian, who conducted the survey with Republican pollster David Lee, told the Journal. ""This is an astounding change.""
The former president maintains a 2% lead over Harris in a two-person race, within the Journal’s 3.1% margin of error, indicating Harris has cut into the six-point lead Trump had over President Biden before Biden withdrew from the race last weekend.
When the field expands to include Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other independent and third-party candidates, the gap slips to a slender 1% lead for Trump over Harris, 45% to 44%. Part of that shift resulted from the change in voter demographics as she has galvanized Democrats and brought high levels of enthusiasm into the party. 
NY TIMES EDITORIAL BOARD URGES KAMALA HARRIS TO ‘DO BETTER' THAN BIDEN IN TAKING QUESTIONS FROM REPORTERS
Harris raised $100 million from over 1.1 million unique donors between Sunday afternoon to Monday evening after she announced she would run in place of Biden, marking what her campaign claimed to be the ""largest 24-hour raise in presidential history.""

The Journal poll does include good news for Trump, however. Republican pollster David Lee pointed out that Trump was trailing Biden in the July 2020 Journal poll by nine points. 
""Donald Trump is in a far better position in this election when compared to a similar time in the 2020 election,"" Lee told the Journal.
Voters favor Trump on key issues like the economy, immigration, foreign policy and crime and lean toward Harris on abortion.
""Instead of what was shaping up to be a Trump win, America has a real, bona fide race on its hands,"" veteran political scientist and New England College President Wayne Lesperance told Fox News Digital this week. ""Game on.""
HARRIS CAMPAIGN CLAIMS SHE NO LONGER SUPPORTS FRACKING BAN SHE TOUTED IN 2019: REPORT
A tied national poll would give Trump an advantage in the Electoral College ""given the way the country’s population is dispersed,"" according to the Journal. But Harris has yet to pick a vice presidential candidate, with the likes of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz; Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz.; and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper likely to shake up those numbers.

In Michigan, Harris and Trump remain in a dead heat, according to a Fox News poll released Friday, which marked a three-point shift for Harris, up from Biden’s 46% in April polling. 
The poll found that men favor Trump by 13 points, while women back Harris by 12. Trump has a two-point advantage with voters over 45 years old, while Harris has a five-point advantage with voters under 35 years old. Whites without a college degree pick Trump by 15 points, and Harris has a three-point advantage among Whites with a degree and voters of color, who back her by 39 points.

Fox News surveys in those battleground states found that Trump is meeting or exceeding his 2020 vote share when put into a two-way race with Harris, with greater support among voters who prioritize the economy and immigration as their top issues.

Harris also enjoys higher favorable ratings than Trump in each state except Michigan, where they remain tied.

(Rambam Medical Centre)
JERUSALEM – The Iran-backed terrorist movement Hezbollah on Saturday rained down rockets on Israel, with at least one hitting a soccer field where children were playing in the northern Israeli town of Majdal Shams right by the border with Syria. Initial reports say at least 10 dead and 29 injured, many thought to be children.
The soccer field in the majority Druze town is a scene of shocking violence and the most devastating loss of life in the north since Hezbollah entered the war on behalf of the terrorist entity Hamas on Oct. 7. The Magen David Adom ambulance service says the victims are aged 10 to 20. 
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) put the blame squarely on Hezbollah in a statement issued shortly after the attack. ""According to an IDF situational assessment and the intelligence in our possession, the rocket launch toward Majdal Shams was carried out by the Hezbollah terrorist organization. The Hezbollah terrorist organization is behind the rocket launch at a soccer field in Majdal Shams which caused multiple civilian casualties, including children earlier this evening.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is currently in the U.S., was being updated and holding situational assessments, according to a political source. It was further announced that he would be returning to Israel ""as soon as possible."" 
Israel's Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant, together with the IDF's Chief of the General Staff, LTG Herzi Halevi, were conducting a situational assessment on the attack. 
The IDF said approximately 30 projectiles were identified crossing into Israel from Lebanon on Saturday. The U.S.-designated terrorist organization Hezbollah is the de facto ruler over Lebanon.

According to Israeli Channel 12, the country's Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on a TV news show that, ""We are approaching the moment of an all-out war in the north against Hezbollah, we will react in a disproportionate way,"" he reportedly said in a translated note on X by Israeli journalists Ben Caspit and Dafna Liel.
Earlier this month, Yakkov Amidror, the former national security adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, discussed with Fox News Digital the likelihood of an imminent full-blown war between the Jewish state and the Lebanon-based terrorist movement Hezbollah.

Jason Brodsky, an expert on Iran and its proxies, told Fox News Digital that ""Hezbollah’s secretary-general [Hassan Nasrallah]has been warning in July about striking ""new targets"" in Israel. This kind of strike in Majdal Shams is likely what he had in mind—especially as it is outside of major population centers like Tel Aviv, which would almost certainly trigger a decisive response, and it’s a Druze town. Nasrallah might have thought Hezbollah could get away with it.""
The Israeli Druze community live in numerous villages dotted across northern Israel. They have had a presence in the region for at least a thousand years, and their communities are also found in Lebanon, Syria and parts of Jordan.

Brodsky, who is the policy director of United Against A Nuclear Iran, continued, ""But that may prove to be a miscalculation on Hezbollah’s part because an attack of this nature has the potential to change the dynamics of the conflict in the north due to the mass civilian casualties, including children. How did we get here? Eroded deterrence. Hezbollah has been under the impression that the U.S. would constrain Israeli operations in Lebanon. When U.S. policy is centered on deescalation, it begets the very escalation that they hope to avoid.""

Israel has fought two wars (1982 and 2006) against Hezbollah. The IDF estimates that it has killed 500 terrorists in Lebanon since the start of the war against Hamas, and that some 5000 projectiles have been fired into Israel.

FOX_18,Philippine forces sail to hotly disputed shoal without incident for first time since deal with China,https://www.foxnews.com/world/philippine-forces-sail-hotly-disputed-shoal-without-incident-first-time-deal-china,2024-07-28 04:42:02.810686,world,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here.

Philippine government personnel transported food and other supplies Saturday to a fiercely disputed shoal occupied by a Filipino navy contingent but closely guarded by Beijing’s forces in the South China Sea and no confrontations were reported, Philippine officials said.
It was the first Philippine government supply trip to the Second Thomas Shoal, which has been the scene of increasingly violent confrontations between Chinese and Philippine forces, since the Philippines and China reached a deal a week ago to prevent clashes, the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila said in a statement.
CHINA, PHILIPPINES ANNOUNCE DEAL TO STOP CLASHES IN SOUTH CHINA SEA
""The lawful and routine rotation and resupply mission within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone is a credit to the professionalism of the men and women of the Philippine navy and the Philippine coast guard and the close coordination among the National Security Council, Department of National Defense and the Department of Foreign Affairs,"" the Philippine Foreign Affairs Department said, without providing other details.

A top Philippine security official told The Associated Press that the Chinese and Philippine coast guards communicated for coordination Saturday, and their ships did not issue two-way radio challenges like in the past to demand that each other's ships leave the shoal immediately.
Also, for the first time at the shoal, Chinese coast guard ships did not shadow or block the Philippine vessels as they had repeatedly done in the past, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authorization to discuss the delicate issue publicly.
China’s coast guard said the Philippine ship delivered daily necessities ""in accordance with a temporary arrangement reached between China and the Philippines.""
""The China Coast Guard confirmed it, supervised and managed the entire process,"" spokesperson Gan Yu said in a statement posted online.
The deal was reached by the Philippines and China after a series of meetings between the two country's diplomats in Manila and exchanges of diplomatic notes aimed to establish a mutually acceptable arrangement at the shoal — which Filipinos call Ayungin and the Chinese call Ren’ai Jiao — without conceding either side’s territorial claims, Philippine officials said.
The deal has not been made public by either side.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed the news that the resupply mission was completed without a confrontation.
""We applaud that and hope and expect to see that it continues going forward,"" said Blinken, who was in Laos for a meeting of foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a group that includes the Philippines.
China's coast guard and other forces have used powerful water cannons and dangerous blocking maneuvers to prevent food and other supplies from reaching Filipino navy personnel at Manila’s outpost at the shoal, on a long-grounded and rusting warship, the BRP Sierra Madre.
In the worst confrontation, Chinese forces on motorboats repeatedly rammed and then boarded two Philippine navy boats on June 17 to prevent Filipino personnel from transferring food and other supplies, including firearms, to the ship outpost in the shallows of the shoal, according to the Philippine government. The Chinese seized the Philippine navy boats and damaged them with machetes and improvised spears. They also seized seven M4 rifles, which were packed in cases, and other supplies. The violent faceoff wounded several Filipino navy personnel, including one who lost his thumb, in a chaotic skirmish that was captured in video and photos that were later made public by Philippine officials.
China and the Philippines blamed each other for the confrontation and each asserted their own sovereign rights over the shoal.
The United States and its key Asian and Western allies, including Japan and Australia, condemned the Chinese acts at the shoal and called for the rule of law and freedom of navigation to be upheld in the South China Sea, a key global trade route with rich fishing areas and undersea gas deposits.

In addition to China and the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have been locked in separate but increasingly tense territorial disputes in the waterway, which is regarded as a potential flashpoint and a delicate fault line in the U.S.-China regional rivalry. The U.S. military has deployed Navy ships and fighter jets for decades in what it calls freedom of navigation and overflight patrols, which China has opposed and regards as a threat to regional stability.
Washington has no territorial claims in the disputed waters but has repeatedly warned that it is obligated to defend the Philippines, its oldest treaty ally in Asia, if Filipino forces, ships and aircraft come under an armed attack, including in the South China Sea."

Former President Trump called Vice President Kamala Harris' meeting with the Israeli prime minister ""terrible and insulting"" Saturday, claiming the White House disrespected the Middle East ally.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with both President Biden and Harris in Washington, D.C., Thursday, 
""P.M. Netanyahu of Israel had a terrible and 'insulting' meeting in D.C. with Kamala Harris, who also refused to preside over Congress during his speech, which is an obligation of the V.P. Rarely has such a thing happened,"" Trump wrote on his social media site, Truth Social.

""Her ineptness will greatly prolong the war and delay the hostage release,"" the former president continued. ""The same people that embarrassed us in AFGHANISTAN with their gross incompetence, are the ones who are telling Israel not to fight any longer with Hamas. Forget October 7th, they say!""
The post put the word ""insulting"" in quotations, but it is unclear if Trump was intending to directly quote the prime minister. Fox News Digital has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment.

The White House pushed back against those reports Friday, with one aide telling Fox News, ""I don’t know what they’re talking about."" 
Trump went on to repeat an idea he has conveyed in the past, that he is the only rational candidate for Jewish Americans. He offered the same sentiment about Catholic Americans.
""Any Jewish person that votes for Kamala, or a Democrat, should immediately have their head examined. Likewise Catholics, who are being persecuted by this Administration, should not be voting for Radical Left Kamala. VOTE TRUMP 2024. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!""

FOX_20,Conservative writer warns Kamala Harris 'could actually win' despite being a 'tragically flawed candidate',https://www.foxnews.com/media/conservative-writer-warns-kamala-harris-actually-win-tragically-flawed-candidate,2024-07-28 07:01:02.835354,politics,"In a video endorsement, the former president and first lady called on Americans to join them in getting to work to elect Harris for president.
A prominent conservative writer warned Republicans that Vice President Kamala Harris could win the presidency despite being a ""tragically flawed candidate."" 
""She’s a tragically flawed candidate, but so is Trump, who doesn’t have the media cheering for him from here to November,"" National Review's Charles C. W. Cooke wrote in a column published Thursday titled ""Kamala Harris could actually win.""
Harris has succeeded her boss, President Biden, as the presumptive Democratic Party nominee after Biden withdrew under pressure from the race and endorsed her on Sunday. She has rapidly consolidated support and endorsements, and also brought in huge fundraising hauls, to effectively clinch the nomination ahead of next month's Democratic convention.

Cooke argued that ""small shifts in sentiment"" brought on by positive press coverage for Harris can ""quickly add up"" in a divided country.
""If the question in play here were solely, ‘Is Kamala Harris a good candidate?’ my answer would be an emphatic, unalloyed ‘No[,]’"" the columnist said.
""But that’s not the sole question — or even the material question,"" Cooke continued. ""The material question is whether Kamala Harris and her as-yet-unappointed VP aspirant can win an election against Donald Trump and JD Vance. And I absolutely, unquestionably, categorically think that she can."" 
""The Biden-Harris administration is by no means loved,"" he wrote. ""Joe Biden is the most unpopular president in modern history, Kamala Harris is the most unpopular vice president since polling began, and, in the minds of the average voter, the years that those two have been in charge of the executive branch have been stained with inflation, waste, incompetence, a tornado of illegal immigration, a series of crises abroad, and, most recently, a dastardly conspiracy to cover up the president’s senility."" 
TRUMP QUICKLY MOVES TO DEFINE HARRIS AS 'MORE LEFT THAN BERNIE SANDERS'

Despite the unpopularity of the Biden administration, Cooke also said that voters ""still do not like"" the leading Republican ticket, Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance.
""Donald Trump is unpopular,"" Cooke wrote. ""JD Vance is unpopular. In every Senate contest other than West Virginia and (perhaps) Montana, the Democrat is running away with the race. Insofar as the GOP has a good shot at the presidency this year, it is because much of the electorate dislikes the incumbents marginally more than it dislikes the GOP. That, though, could change.""
""If, as it ought, the Republican Party wishes to prove me wrong in my suspicion, it’s going to have to escape from its post-convention jubilation — and work like hell,"" Cooke wrote. 
The Harris and Trump campaigns did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

CNN_1,"Trump was struck by bullet in assassination attempt, FBI says",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/fbi-trump-interview-assassination-attempt/index.html,2024-07-27 08:59:00,politics,"
            The FBI said Friday that Donald Trump was hit by a bullet, or a fragment from it, fired by the would-be assassin at his Pennsylvania rally earlier this month.
    

            “What struck former President Trump in the ear was a bullet, whether whole or fragmented into smaller pieces, fired from the deceased subject’s rifle,” the bureau said in a statement.
    

            The department’s confirmation Friday that the former president was struck in the ear by a bullet marks its latest attempt to quell a political uproar. The new statement is the most direct yet from federal law enforcement about Trump’s injury, though it changes little in practical terms.
    

            Some law enforcement officials – including FBI Director Christopher Wray – have previously said publicly that it was unclear whether Trump was hit by a bullet or by shrapnel, which is a fragmented piece of ammunition. Other officials questioned whether Trump had been struck by a bullet at all, or whether he was hit by a piece of glass or even injured while falling down.
    

            “As I said, I think with respect to former President Trump, there’s some question about whether or not it’s bullet or shrapnel that hit his ear,” Wray testified before Congress earlier this week.
    

            Questions about Trump’s wound have stoked political backlash, as the former president has said he “took a bullet for democracy” and attacked Wray on his social media platform over his testimony.
    

            For his part, Trump has repeatedly asserted that he was hit by an in-tact bullet, writing on his Truth Social platform that “it was, unfortunately, a bullet that hit my ear, and hit it hard.”
    

            “There was no glass, there was no shrapnel. The hospital called it a ‘bullet wound to the ear,’ and that is what it was. No wonder the once storied FBI has lost the confidence of America!” Trump posted.
    

            The campaign also has pushed back on any implication otherwise, with Trump adviser Steven Cheung telling CNN that “anyone who believes this conspiracy bullsh*t is either mentally deficient or willfully peddling falsehoods for political reasons.”
    

            The agency is seeking to interview Trump in its investigation of the assassination attempt to obtain a victim statement — a standard part of the investigation because he is a crime victim, according to a US official.
    

            Investigators, the FBI said Thursday, continue to examine bullet fragments and other evidence in the attack, but the agency made clear it has always considered the shooting an attempted assassination of the former president.
    

            “Since the day of the attack, the FBI has been consistent and clear that the shooting was an attempted assassination of former President Trump which resulted in his injury, as well as the death of a heroic father and the injuries of several other victims,” the agency said in its initial statement released in response to questions about Wray’s testimony on Capitol Hill Wednesday.
    

            The agency said it was “devoting enormous resources” to its ongoing investigation of the “heinous attack.”
    

            During Wednesday’s wide-ranging House Judiciary hearing, Wray shared new details with lawmakers about Trump’s would-be assassin, including that he searched for details of the John F. Kennedy shooting from his laptop and flew a drone in the area near the rally just two hours before the former president took the stage.
    

            Despite later criticism from Republicans about the FBI’s pending conclusions about the nature of the projectile, Wray was commended by representatives on both sides of the aisle for offering new insight into details about the investigation into the gunman. Those bipartisan expressions of appreciation stood in stark contrast to earlier testimony by then-Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned Tuesday after Democrats and Republicans accused her of stonewalling them and demanded her ouster.
    

            When asked Wednesday about how close the “assassin’s bullet” came to killing Trump, Wray said, “My understanding is that either it or some shrapnel is what, you know, grazed his ear.” He then agreed that it came very close to killing the former president.

CNN_2,"California’s Park Fire 0% contained as more than a thousand battle 178,000 acre blaze",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/us/california-park-fire-oregon-durkee-jasper/index.html,2024-07-27 08:54:00,us,"
Hot and dry weather is fueling wildfire activity in the Western United States and Canada, with fires damaging homes, causing injuries and forcing evacuations. The largest active wildfire in the US has scorched more than 280,000 acres in eastern Oregon and another blaze has exploded to more than 178,000 acres in California. Here’s the latest:


            • Park Fire roars across parts of Butte and Tehama counties, north of Sacramento, California: As of Friday evening, the Park Fire has burned more than 178,000 acres, or about 278 square miles, which is nearly twice the size of Las Vegas. More than 1,600 firefighters are working to slow its progress. Cal Fire reported the blaze was 0% contained Friday, with 134 structures destroyed and another 4,200 threatened. Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for both counties Friday. The state also secured a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to ensure there are enough resources to fight the fire.
    

            Billy See, incident commander for Cal Fire, said the fire is advancing at 4,000 to 5,000 acres per hour but with winds forecast to die down overnight and higher humidity moving into the area, See believes it will give firefighters a better chance to slow the fire down. He noted fire crews are working to hold the fire south of California Highway 36.
    

            The fire has forced road closures and mandatory evacuations in Butte County, where the state’s deadliest wildfire, the Camp Fire, killed more than 85 people and destroyed thousands of homes in 2018. Local officials cautioned it would take some time before people would be allowed back in their homes and urged residents to visit county websites for the most up-to-date information on evacuations and road closures.
    

            • Three firefighters injured and structures damaged: Three firefighters had minor heat-related injuries on Wednesday while fighting the Park Fire, Cal Fire Captain Dan Collins told CNN Thursday. They were treated and released, he said. Officials know structures have been damaged or destroyed by the fire, but there is no official count yet, Collins said.
    

• Man accused of starting California wildfire is arrested: A suspect has been arrested on suspicion of pushing a burning car 60 feet into a gully, “spreading flames” that caused what’s now become California’s largest wildfire of the year, authorities said. The Park Fire in the Butte County area has quickly burned an area larger than the city of Atlanta.
    

            • Firefighters battle massive Oregon fire: The Durkee Fire, which has burned more than 288,000 acres and is 20% contained as of Friday afternoon, started on July 17 near the Oregon-Idaho state line. The lightning-sparked fire is the largest of 34 large wildfires currently burning across Oregon, which has been the hardest hit by fires in recent days. More than 500 firefighters and resources from 22 states are working to fight the fire, according to InciWeb. Over the weekend and earlier this week, the Durkee Fire exhibited extreme fire behavior, even creating its own weather in the form of pyrocumulus clouds.
    

            • Oregon wildfire destroys buildings: Three people were injured and two homes and 12 other structures were destroyed as the fire spread, according to the Oregon Department of Emergency Management. Evacuations are still in effect in Baker County for areas around the Durkee Fire. Some communities do not have power, according to Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, who has deployed resources from the National Guard to assist. Dense smoke from the flames has also impeded traffic on Interstate 84, leading to periodic closure of the freeway. Wildfire smoke was spreading into Boise and beyond. Air quality alerts have been issued for parts of Colorado, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.
    

            • Wildfire engulfs tourist town in Canada: A fast-moving wildfire sent thousands of visitors and residents fleeing the town of Jasper in Alberta, where flames devastated up to half of the town’s structures. Officials say the losses are significant, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has deployed federal support to help battle the blaze. Cool temperatures and rain are expected to keep fire behavior low for the next 72 hours, which will help crews fight the blaze, Jasper National Park said on Facebook Thursday night.
    

            • Fire-conducive weather continues in Western US: Triple-digit heat and dry conditions across the West this week have made conditions poor for firefighters actively fighting to contain the 89 large wildfires burning nationwide. “Many wildfires in the Northwest area continue to exhibit active to extreme fire behavior, with evacuation orders in effect on 17 wildfires. Several teams are managing multiple fire starts as complexes. Evacuation orders are also in effect for several fires in California, the Northern Rockies and the Great Basin,” the National Interagency Fire Center said. Conditions will begin to improve for much of the West over the weekend as cooler temperatures and higher humidity levels arrive in the area.
    

            Some families have found themselves displaced as the Park Fire raged near Chico, a city in northern California, burning homes and forcing evacuations.
    

            A former news anchor told CNN affiliate KOVR she watched her Butte County house burn down live through security camera footage.
    

            “There is no rhyme or reason. Our house is gone, their house is okay. The house next to it, you can see it’s gone,” Julia Yarbough said.
    

            Looking at the remnants of her home, Yarbough said she felt numb.
    

            “It’s surreal,” she said. “It probably won’t hit me till later, I’m pretty sure.”
    

            Triple-digit temperatures and high wind gusts have fueled the explosive growth of the Park Fire amid an active fire season in California. An estimated 343,253 acres have burned across the state so far in 2024, compared to 22,439 acres burned by this time last year, according to Cal Fire.
    

            A 42-year-old man, identified as Ronnie Dean Stout II, has been arrested after being accused of igniting the inferno.
    

            Witnesses reported seeing someone “pushing a car that was on fire into a gully near the Alligator Hole in upper Bidwell Park shortly before 3:00 p.m. yesterday,” Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said Thursday. “The car went down an embankment approximately 60 feet and burned completely, spreading flames that caused the Park Fire.”
    

            The DA says the man was seen “calmly leaving the area by blending in with the other citizens who were in the area and fleeing the rapidly evolving fire.” Stout was later arrested at a mobile home park in Chico, Ramsey said.
    

            Stout will likely face an arson charge, though it is unclear what count, or whether any enhancements will be added, Ramsey said. The DA’s office told CNN Stout has not retained an attorney and will be assigned a public defender at his arraignment.
    

            He was previously convicted of second degree robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and drug paraphernalia possession in Kern County, according to criminal records. He was sentenced to 21 years in prison. He was released on parole in 2018, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation confirmed to CNN.
    

            He was also convicted of lewd or lascivious acts on a child under 14 in Butte County, records show.
    

            In Jasper, a popular tourist town in Alberta, 25,000 residents and visitors were forced to evacuate from a fast-moving blaze that has damaged 30 to 50% of the town’s structures, officials said during a news conference Thursday.
    

            “Homes and businesses have been lost to a wildfire that people are calling a ‘wall of flames,’” Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said.
    

            An “enormous wind gust” moved the wildfire roughly about 3 miles in “probably less than 30 minutes,” Alberta Minister of Public Safety & Emergency Services Mike Ellis said during the press conference. This created “a wall of fire that was about 100 meters high.”
    

            “Any firefighter will tell you there is little to nothing you can do when you have a wall of flames coming at you like that. Nobody anticipated that fire to come so fast, so large,” Ellis said.
    

            Two wildfires converged in the Jasper National Park area, becoming what authorities are referring to as the Jasper Wildfire Complex. It remains difficult to measure exactly how big the complex – which also includes a third nearby fire – is due to extreme fire behavior and thick smoke cover. Together, the fires have swallowed an estimated 89,000 acres, the Jasper National Park said.
    

            Damage wrought by the flames will result in “a significant rebuild and significant displacement,” Smith said. The most significant structural damage lies on the west side of town, according to a Facebook post from Jasper National Park.

            “We will recover from this,” Smith said while holding back tears. “To those in Alberta and around the world who have experienced the magic of Jasper, the magic is not lost, and it never will be.”
    

            The vast majority of evacuees were “visitors with other places to return to,” Ellis said. Along with about 5,000 residents who live in the town, 2.48 million people visited Jasper National Park last year.
    

            Jasper Mayor Richard Ireland said residents will work together to rebuild after the wildfire “ravaged our beloved community.”
    

            “Your resilience and strength have always been the backbone of our community. In the coming days and weeks, we will rally together, support one another, and begin the daunting process of recovery,” Ireland said in a statement on Thursday.
    

            Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said all federal agencies are working together to provide resources to Jasper, support evacuations and strengthen response efforts on the ground.
    

            “Our governments are working together to keep Albertans safe and supported through this,” he said on Facebook.

CNN_3,Italy’s famous ‘Path of Love’ reopens after more than 12 years,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/italy-cinque-terre-path-of-love-reopens/index.html,2024-07-27 08:01:00,world,"
            One of the most iconic and romantic trails in the world — Italy’s Via dell’Amore (“Path of Love”) – will reopen Saturday, July 27, after a lengthy refurbishment and an overall investment of more than $24 million, the Italian Tourism Ministry announced Friday.
    

            The 900-meter (2,950-foot) panoramic route overlooking the sea is located in the Municipality of Riomaggiore. That’s in the northern region of Liguria at the heart of the natural paradise of the Cinque Terre, which was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997.
    

            The trail had been closed since September 2012 after a landslide that injured four Australian tourists.
    

            The path’s reopening has been quite complex because of its fragile cliffside location. It has been an engineering challenge because of its precarious perch dug into the rock between the sky and the sea, the Tourism Ministry said in a news release sent to CNN.
    

            Refurbishment work started on January 14, 2022, and finished on July 19, 2024. Specialized companies worked on site, using helicopters to transport materials and installing a stainless steel net and deep bolts. Rock climbers moved the equipment on the walls while suspended with ropes and steel cables to special anchors.
    

            The overall investment was almost €24 million (about $26 million) split among several ministries in Italy.
    

            The path will be managed by the Municipality of Riomaggiore as an open-air museum.
    

            From July 27 to August 8, the path will be open exclusively to residents of the Cinque Terre as well as Levanto, La Spezia and former residents and owners of second homes in the Municipality of Riomaggiore and their families.
    

            Starting August 9, the path will also be accessible to tourists. Visitors will need to book in advance on the website www.viadellamore.info (which is still under construction) and pay a €10 (approximately $11) fee. Guides will be present during visits.
    

            Access will be limited to a maximum of 400 people an hour, divided into groups of 100 people every 15 minutes, the Municipality of Riomaggiore said Friday on its website.
    

            Tourists will enter from Riomaggiore going toward Manarola on a one-way route.

            On Friday evening the “Path of Love” was officially inaugurated by government officials and local authorities.
    

            “It is a source of great pride for us to be able to return the Via dell’Amore, in all its beauty, uniqueness and in complete safety, to residents, Ligurians and tourists from all over the world,” said Giacomo Giampedrone, commissioner for the safety work.
    

            Giampedrone said the region of Liguria financed and was responsible for the work of restoring the path’s safety.
    

            “It was a job as complex as it was spectacular, carried out exactly like the recovery of a work of art of inestimable value, with the utmost protection and respect for the surrounding environment,” Giampedrone said.
    

            “My invitation is to come to Liguria to admire the Via dell’Amore: let yourself be amazed by this unique place, suspended between the sky and the sea, set in the rock, in the heart of a natural paradise. You will be left breathless by its beauty.”

            Ex-FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page reached settlements with the Justice Department that will see the government paying out a total of $2 million in their lawsuits over the department’s 2018 release of their text messages.
    

            Former agent Strzok will get $1.2 million and Page, who was an FBI lawyer, will get $800,000, according to settlement agreements obtained by CNN.
    

            Strzok and Page finalized their settlements with the Justice Department in court filings Friday, after alleging the department violated the Privacy Act by releasing to the media texts they exchanged criticizing Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign.
    

            “While I have been vindicated by this result, my fervent hope remains that our institutions of justice will never again play politics with the lives of their employees,” Page said in a statement provided by her attorneys.
    

            The Justice Department declined to comment on the matter.
    

            Strzok played a senior role on special counsel Robert Mueller’s team until he was removed after an internal investigation first revealed his texts with Page, with whom Strzok had an extramarital relationship, that could be read as exhibiting political bias. Page, who had also briefly served on Mueller’s team, resigned from her role as a lawyer for the FBI after the messages were discovered. The release of the messages became political fodder for Donald Trump to oppose the Russia investigation during his presidency.
    

            Strzok has other ongoing claims in the lawsuit against the department for his termination during the Trump administration.
    

            “This outcome is a critical step forward in addressing the government’s unfair and highly politicized treatment of Pete. As important as it is for him, it also vindicates the privacy interests of all government employees,” Strzok’s attorney Aitan Goelman said in a news release.
    

            “We will continue to litigate Pete’s constitutional claims to ensure that, in the future, public servants are protected from adverse employment actions motivated by partisan politics,” Goelman continued.

CNN_6,Trump meets with Netanyahu for first time since departing White House,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/trump-netanyahu-meeting-mar-a-lago/index.html,2024-07-27 10:45:00,politics,"
            Former President Donald Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, the first such meeting between the two men since Trump left the White House more than three years ago.
    

            The meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence was requested by Netanyahu, sources familiar with the planning told CNN. It comes on the heels of the prime minister’s address to Congress and meetings with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris at the White House. Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee, conveyed a forcefulness on civilian suffering and ending the war following her time with the prime minister.
    

            Netanyahu said Friday that he hoped Harris’ comments would not make a ceasefire deal harder to reach.
    

            “I think to the extent that Hamas understands there’s no daylight between Israel and the United States, that expedites the deal,” said Netanyahu to reporters at his meeting with Trump. “And I would hope that those comments don’t change that.”
    

            Trump said Harris was “disrespectful to Israel” in her remarks to reporters after her meeting with Netanyahu.
    

            “I think her remarks were disrespectful,” Trump told CNN’s Kristen Holmes on Friday. “They weren’t very nice pertaining to Israel. I actually don’t know how a person who is Jewish could vote for her, but that’s up to them.”
    

            Ahead of Netanyahu’s remarks, Harris’ office rejected on Friday the suggestion originally from a senior Israeli official that the vice president’s remarks could have made a ceasefire deal harder to reach.
    

            “I don’t know what they’re talking about,” a Harris aide told CNN, in response to a senior Israeli official being quoted in The Times of Israel.
    

            “President Biden and Vice President Harris delivered the same message in their private meetings to Prime Minister Netanyahu: it is time to get the ceasefire and hostage deal done,” the aide to the vice president told reporters, adding that Harris’ meeting with Netanyahu was “serious and collegial.”
    

            Trump elaborated on his own meeting with Netanyahu while continuing to slam Harris during a speech in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Friday night.
    

            “She doesn’t like Jewish people. She doesn’t like Israel. That’s the way it is, and that’s the way it’s always gonna be,” Trump said. Harris’ husband Doug Emhoff is Jewish.
    

            The former president said he asked Netanyahu during their meeting how a Jewish person can vote Democrat.
    

            “I said, ‘How can a Jewish person or a person that loves Israel vote, think of this, vote for this, these parties?’ How can they vote Democrat? How can they vote for these horrible, these horrible people?”
    

            “We came to the conclusion, it’s mostly habit,” Trump said.
    

            Friday marks an opportunity for Trump and Netanyahu to reset relations at critical moments in both the war between Israel and Hamas and the 2024 election cycle.
    

            Trump, who often claims he was the most pro-Israel president in modern history, once touted his close, personal relationship with Netanyahu. However, their relationship has soured in recent years, and the former president has been reluctant to speak with him throughout the ongoing conflict.

Harris says she ‘will not be silent’ on Gaza suffering while telling Netanyahu to get ceasefire deal done


            In the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ attack on Israel, Trump criticized Netanyahu for his handling of the war, claiming to Fox News at the time the prime minister and the country overall were “unprepared.”
    

            Part of that criticism, which Trump has continued in the months since, stems from his complicated relationship with Netanyahu, one that a former Trump administration official described as “a love-hate relationship,” who added that the two leaders experienced a dramatic up and down in recent years.
    

            During his administration Trump enacted multiple policies to Israel’s benefit, including moving the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights and backing multiple countries in Middle East and North Africa to normalize relations with Israel as part of the Abraham Accords. Netanyahu called Trump the greatest friend Israel has ever had and heralded him for “unequivocally” standing by Israel during Trump’s tenure as commander in chief.
    

            But the relationship grew bitter after the 2020 presidential election when Netanyahu congratulated Biden on his victory – something that infuriated the former president who considered the move disloyal. “F**k him,” Trump told Axios at the time.
    

            Trump has also claimed that Netanyahu betrayed him in the final months of his presidency, arguing that Israel, at the 11th hour, declined to participate in the 2020 airstrike that killed top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani. Netanyahu “let us down,” Trump said at a rally in October 2023.
    

            Two sources close to Trump, meanwhile, said they are aware of attempted outreach by Netanyahu in recent months, including seeking communications through informal channels.
    

            And in March, Trump allies — led by Keith Kellogg, a leading national security adviser to the former president who also served in the Trump administration — traveled to Israel to discuss the current conflict in Gaza, though the Trump campaign said it had learned of those meetings after the fact.
    

            Many Israelis presume that Trump would give Netanyahu a longer leash to use greater force in Gaza. Trump has said that Israel must “finish what they started,” “get it over with fast,” and that the US must “let Israel finish the job.”
    

            A senior Trump campaign adviser told CNN that Trump’s willingness to meet with Netanyahu despite their fraught relationship shows that Trump “is willing to put any personal or political differences to the side and develop or reconnect with him, to develop a working relationship with him.”
    

            “It shows the evolution of how Trump will conduct himself in a second term,” the adviser added.
    

            Sources familiar with the meeting said that there is no set agenda or overarching message that Trump wants to convey. However, the former president has repeatedly said that, if elected in November, he would seek a speedy end to the conflict in the Middle East without offering details of how he would do so. Instead, he’s argued the war must come to a swift close because the country is “losing the PR war.”
    

            Asked about the meeting during an interview with Fox News on Thursday, Trump said: “I want him to finish up and get it done quickly. You gotta get it done quickly, because they are getting decimated with this publicity. And you know, Israel is not very good at public relations.”
    

            He also asserted during the interview that the October 7 attack wouldn’t have happened if he were president, a claim he repeats frequently on the campaign trail.
    

            Arab Americans who have said they will support Trump will also be watching the meeting on Friday closely, they told CNN. They were “saddened and bewildered” when Trump called Biden a Palestinian in a derogatory manner during the debate last month, said Bishara Bahbah, who lives in Arizona and has worked to rally the Arab-American community for Trump after the lifelong Democrat soured on Biden over his approach to the Israel-Hamas war.
    

            Bahbah, however, has maintained support for Trump despite the derogatory rhetoric toward Palestinians last month. He pointed to Trump’s move to share a recent letter on his social media platform from Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas ahead of Friday’s meeting. The letter was sent after the assassination attempt on the 2024 Republican presidential nominee.
    

            “Looking forward to seeing Bibi Netanyahu on Friday, and even more forward to achieving Peace in the Middle East!” Trump posted to Truth Social with the letter.
    

            In posting that engagement with Abbas, Trump was trying to “strike a balance” going into the meeting, Bahbah said, adding that he hopes Trump will come out of the Netanyahu meeting calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire.
    

            Jewish supporters of Trump are hoping the former president asks Netanyahu what he needs to win the ongoing war, explained Lee Zeldin, a Jewish Republican and Trump supporter.
    

            “At the table, the most important question is asking the prime minister what he needs to win. What does Israel need that they don’t yet have?” Zeldin, a former congressman, said. “That conversation about ensuring victory and pursuing a lasting peace is the most important fundamental threshold in my opinion.”
    

            Zeldin added that Jewish Americans will be watching the meeting closely because they hope that Trump, if he were to win the November election, would “pick up where he left off” in terms of putting policies into place that support Israel.
    

            Trump finds himself in a distinct position given he was president just over three years ago and has longstanding relations with many of the foreign leaders now arriving on his doorstep.
    

            He has met with a series of foreign leaders in recent months, including hosting Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and British Foreign Secretary David Cameron at Mar-a-Lago, and dining with Polish President Andrzej Duda and former Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso at Trump Tower in New York during his hush money trial, among other meetings. He has also spoken by phone with several world leaders, including with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is currently working with the US to normalize relations with Israel.
    

            The Trump adviser argued that the meetings reflect the reality of the former president’s poll numbers, adding that many foreign leaders want to ensure they have strong ties to him in the event he wins in November.
    

            “It could signify that they think Trump is best positioned to be the next president, and they want to get a head start on developing a real relationship with him,” the adviser said.

CNN_7,"California’s Park Fire now among state’s top 13 largest ever as it consumes 239,000 acres",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/us/california-park-fire-oregon-durkee-jasper/index.html,2024-07-27 10:20:00,us,"
Hot and dry weather is fueling wildfire activity in the Western United States and Canada, with fires damaging homes, causing injuries and forcing evacuations. The largest active wildfire in the US has scorched more than 280,000 acres in eastern Oregon and another blaze has exploded to more than 239,000 acres in California. Here’s the latest:


            • Park Fire roars across parts of Butte and Tehama counties, north of Sacramento, California: As of Friday evening, the Park Fire has burned more than 239,000 acres, or about 373 square miles, about the size of San Diego, which makes it the 13th largest in state history. More than 1,600 firefighters are working to slow its progress. Cal Fire reported the blaze was 0% contained Friday, with 134 structures destroyed and another 4,200 threatened. Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for both counties Friday. The state also secured a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to ensure there are enough resources to fight the fire.
    

            Billy See, incident commander for Cal Fire, said the fire is advancing at 4,000 to 5,000 acres per hour but with winds forecast to die down overnight and higher humidity moving into the area, See believes it will give firefighters a better chance to slow the fire down. He noted fire crews are working to hold the fire south of California Highway 36.
    

            The fire has forced road closures and mandatory evacuations in Butte County, where the state’s deadliest wildfire, the Camp Fire, killed more than 85 people and destroyed thousands of homes in 2018. Local officials cautioned it would take some time before people would be allowed back in their homes and urged residents to visit county websites for the most up-to-date information on evacuations and road closures.
    

            • Three firefighters injured and structures damaged: Three firefighters had minor heat-related injuries on Wednesday while fighting the Park Fire, Cal Fire Captain Dan Collins told CNN Thursday. They were treated and released, he said. Officials know structures have been damaged or destroyed by the fire, but there is no official count yet, Collins said.
    

• Man accused of starting California wildfire is arrested: A suspect has been arrested on suspicion of pushing a burning car 60 feet into a gully, “spreading flames” that caused what’s now become California’s largest wildfire of the year, authorities said. The Park Fire in the Butte County area has quickly burned an area larger than the city of Atlanta.
    

            • Firefighters battle massive Oregon fire: The Durkee Fire, which has burned more than 288,000 acres and is 20% contained as of Friday afternoon, started on July 17 near the Oregon-Idaho state line. The lightning-sparked fire is the largest of 34 large wildfires currently burning across Oregon, which has been the hardest hit by fires in recent days. More than 500 firefighters and resources from 22 states are working to fight the fire, according to InciWeb. Over the weekend and earlier this week, the Durkee Fire exhibited extreme fire behavior, even creating its own weather in the form of pyrocumulus clouds.
    

            • Oregon wildfire destroys buildings: Three people were injured and two homes and 12 other structures were destroyed as the fire spread, according to the Oregon Department of Emergency Management. Evacuations are still in effect in Baker County for areas around the Durkee Fire. Some communities do not have power, according to Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, who has deployed resources from the National Guard to assist. Dense smoke from the flames has also impeded traffic on Interstate 84, leading to periodic closure of the freeway. Wildfire smoke was spreading into Boise and beyond. Air quality alerts have been issued for parts of Colorado, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.
    

            • Wildfire engulfs tourist town in Canada: A fast-moving wildfire sent thousands of visitors and residents fleeing the town of Jasper in Alberta, where flames devastated up to half of the town’s structures. Officials say the losses are significant, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has deployed federal support to help battle the blaze. Cool temperatures and rain are expected to keep fire behavior low for the next 72 hours, which will help crews fight the blaze, Jasper National Park said on Facebook Thursday night.
    

            • Fire-conducive weather continues in Western US: Triple-digit heat and dry conditions across the West this week have made conditions poor for firefighters actively fighting to contain the 89 large wildfires burning nationwide. “Many wildfires in the Northwest area continue to exhibit active to extreme fire behavior, with evacuation orders in effect on 17 wildfires. Several teams are managing multiple fire starts as complexes. Evacuation orders are also in effect for several fires in California, the Northern Rockies and the Great Basin,” the National Interagency Fire Center said. Conditions will begin to improve for much of the West over the weekend as cooler temperatures and higher humidity levels arrive in the area.
    

            Some families have found themselves displaced as the Park Fire raged near Chico, a city in northern California, burning homes and forcing evacuations.
    

            A former news anchor told CNN affiliate KOVR she watched her Butte County house burn down live through security camera footage.
    

            “There is no rhyme or reason. Our house is gone, their house is okay. The house next to it, you can see it’s gone,” Julia Yarbough said.
    

            Looking at the remnants of her home, Yarbough said she felt numb.
    

            “It’s surreal,” she said. “It probably won’t hit me till later, I’m pretty sure.”
    

            Triple-digit temperatures and high wind gusts have fueled the explosive growth of the Park Fire amid an active fire season in California. An estimated 343,253 acres have burned across the state so far in 2024, compared to 22,439 acres burned by this time last year, according to Cal Fire.
    

            A 42-year-old man, identified as Ronnie Dean Stout II, has been arrested after being accused of igniting the inferno.
    

            Witnesses reported seeing someone “pushing a car that was on fire into a gully near the Alligator Hole in upper Bidwell Park shortly before 3:00 p.m. yesterday,” Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said Thursday. “The car went down an embankment approximately 60 feet and burned completely, spreading flames that caused the Park Fire.”
    

            The DA says the man was seen “calmly leaving the area by blending in with the other citizens who were in the area and fleeing the rapidly evolving fire.” Stout was later arrested at a mobile home park in Chico, Ramsey said.
    

            Stout will likely face an arson charge, though it is unclear what count, or whether any enhancements will be added, Ramsey said. The DA’s office told CNN Stout has not retained an attorney and will be assigned a public defender at his arraignment.
    

            He was previously convicted of second degree robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and drug paraphernalia possession in Kern County, according to criminal records. He was sentenced to 21 years in prison. He was released on parole in 2018, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation confirmed to CNN.
    

            He was also convicted of lewd or lascivious acts on a child under 14 in Butte County, records show.
    

            In Jasper, a popular tourist town in Alberta, 25,000 residents and visitors were forced to evacuate from a fast-moving blaze that has damaged 30 to 50% of the town’s structures, officials said during a news conference Thursday.
    

            “Homes and businesses have been lost to a wildfire that people are calling a ‘wall of flames,’” Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said.
    

            An “enormous wind gust” moved the wildfire roughly about 3 miles in “probably less than 30 minutes,” Alberta Minister of Public Safety & Emergency Services Mike Ellis said during the press conference. This created “a wall of fire that was about 100 meters high.”
    

            “Any firefighter will tell you there is little to nothing you can do when you have a wall of flames coming at you like that. Nobody anticipated that fire to come so fast, so large,” Ellis said.
    

            Two wildfires converged in the Jasper National Park area, becoming what authorities are referring to as the Jasper Wildfire Complex. It remains difficult to measure exactly how big the complex – which also includes a third nearby fire – is due to extreme fire behavior and thick smoke cover. Together, the fires have swallowed an estimated 89,000 acres, the Jasper National Park said.
    

            Damage wrought by the flames will result in “a significant rebuild and significant displacement,” Smith said. The most significant structural damage lies on the west side of town, according to a Facebook post from Jasper National Park.

            “We will recover from this,” Smith said while holding back tears. “To those in Alberta and around the world who have experienced the magic of Jasper, the magic is not lost, and it never will be.”
    

            The vast majority of evacuees were “visitors with other places to return to,” Ellis said. Along with about 5,000 residents who live in the town, 2.48 million people visited Jasper National Park last year.
    

            Jasper Mayor Richard Ireland said residents will work together to rebuild after the wildfire “ravaged our beloved community.”
    

            “Your resilience and strength have always been the backbone of our community. In the coming days and weeks, we will rally together, support one another, and begin the daunting process of recovery,” Ireland said in a statement on Thursday.
    

            Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said all federal agencies are working together to provide resources to Jasper, support evacuations and strengthen response efforts on the ground.
    

            “Our governments are working together to keep Albertans safe and supported through this,” he said on Facebook.

CNN_8,‘They just won the Olympics’: Internet goes wild for Mongolia’s Paris 2024 outfits,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/16/style/mongolia-olympic-uniform-2024/index.html,2024-07-27 10:52:00,world,"
            Move over Lululemon, Berluti and Ralph Lauren. The internet has chosen its new favorite national uniform at the forthcoming Paris 2024 Olympics: Mongolia’s.
    

            Featuring intricately embroidered vests, pleated robes and accessories inspired by traditional attire, the country’s opening and closing ceremony outfits have taken social media by storm since being unveiled earlier this month.
    

            The designs are the work of Michel&Amazonka, an Ulaanbaatar-based label producing couture and ready-to-wear garments that “express the essence of Mongolian tradition and culture” in what the brand calls a “contemporary light.”
    

            The label revealed its designs via a series of glossy photos and a video shoot reminiscent of a luxury fashion campaign. Female athletes’ outfits come with ceremonial earrings and embroidered bags, while male flag-bearers will wear an archery hat, belt and traditional Mongolian boots.
    

            Designs incorporate the national colors of blue, red, and white, as well as various traditional patterns and motifs, including the “Soyombo” symbol that appears in the country’s flag. Motifs associated with Paris and the Games, namely the Eiffel Tower and the Olympic flame also feature.
    

            The outfits took an average of 20 hours each to craft, according to the Mongolian National Olympic Committee.
    

            The uniforms have attracted attention on social media — especially TikTok, where fashion and sport commentators applauded the designs. “They just won the Olympics before it even started,” said style writer Ryan Yip in a video viewed over 2 million times.

            In another TikTok video, viewed almost 300,000 times, Australian user Bee Jamieson said: “The detailing is really beautiful… it looks like everything’s been really well thought out.” Popular sports creator geoff0w_ meanwhile said: “These go ridiculously hard.”
    

            On the brand’s Instagram page, users heaped further praise on the outfits. “The most beautiful uniform so far,” read one comment. “Such intricate, and beautiful designs!” wrote another user.
    

            Founded by sisters Michel Choigaalaa and Amazonka Choigaalaa, Michel&Amazonka previously designed the Mongolian team’s outfits for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics, where the country netted one silver and three bronze medals.
    

            Mongolia has participated in all but one summer Olympics since 1964. The landlocked nation won its first — and, to date, only — gold medals (in judo and boxing) at the Beijing 2008 games.
    

            This year, the country is sending more than 30 athletes to the Paris Olympics, which kick off on July 26. Mongolian athletes will compete in nine different sports, including cycling, shooting and wrestling.
    

            Elsewhere at the Games, Berluti have designed France’s opening and closing ceremony unforms and Ralph Lauren will again dress Team USA, having done so at every Olympics since 2008. Great Britain, meanwhile, has turned to menswear label Ben Sherman.

CNN_9,Las Vegas man charged with threatening officials including the judge and prosecutor in the Trump hush money trial,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/politics/las-vegas-man-charged-threats-bragg-merchan/index.html,2024-07-27 12:27:00,politics,"
Las Vegas, Nevada (AP) — A Las Vegas man has been charged with threatening to injure and kill government officials in three states and the District of Columbia, including the New York judge and prosecutor who handled former President Donald Trump’s criminal hush money trial, according to federal officials and court records.
    

Spencer Gear, 32, was being held Friday in federal custody in Nevada following his arrest and not guilty plea Tuesday to 22 felony charges of threatening a federal official and transmitting a communication containing a threat to injure. Gear’s indictment had been filed under seal July 16.
    

            Rebecca Levy, a federal public defender representing Gear in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas, did not respond Friday to messages seeking comment.
    

            The indictment lists 11 alleged victims by initials, including two in a phone call from Nevada to New York that “threatened to kill A.B. and J.M.,” referring to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and New York Judge Juan M. Merchan.
    

            Bragg’s office declined to comment. A message was left for a spokesperson for New York’s state court system.

            In her order remanding Gear to federal custody ahead of trial, U.S. Magistrate Judge Brenda Weksler cited “the number of calls at play in this case,” with victims also in New Jersey and Montana.
    

            The judge focused on a recording of a June 3 telephone message “which was directed at a judge and a district attorney” and called the language Gear allegedly used “of great concern to the court.”
    

            That date was the Monday after a jury found Trump guilty of all 34 charges in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to a porn actor who said the two had sex. Trump’s lawyers have since asked Merchan to overturn the verdict, citing the Supreme Court’s recent immunity decision. The judge said he’ll rule in September.
    

            Weksler noted that Gear had little prior criminal history, noting two driving-related offenses, but had been charged by federal authorities with resisting arrest last week.
    

            “The defendant does not seem to have respect for the judicial system and for judges,” the magistrate judge said. Trial is scheduled Sept. 24.
    

            Bragg’s office, which prosecuted Trump’s hush money criminal case, reported at least 56 “actionable threats” directed against Bragg, his family and staff, and nearly 500 threatening emails and phone calls since April.
    

            They included bomb threats at the homes of two people involved in the case on the first day of the Trump trial, April 15; a photo showing sniper sights aimed on people involved in the case, according to police; and threatening messages such as: “we will kill you all” and “Your life is done.”
    

            In 2023, police recorded 89 threats to Bragg, his family or staff, up from one threat in 2022, his first year in office.

            The wave of threats this year started March 18, according to an affidavit by the head of Bragg’s police detail, the day Trump falsely posted online that he was about to be arrested and encouraged supporters to protest and “take our nation back!”
    

            A few days later, Bragg’s office received a letter containing a small amount of white powder and a note stating, “Alvin: I’m going to kill you.”
    

            Court officials have said Merchan has also received dozens of death threats.
    

            Following Trump’s April 2023 arraignment, a state court spokesperson said Merchan’s chambers had been “getting the predictable harassing and defamatory calls and emails.”
    

            In April, a 26-year-old New York man was charged with sending text messages threatening New York state Attorney General Letitia James and the judge in Trump’s civil fraud case, Arthur Engoron, with “death and physical harm” if they did not “cease action” in the Trump matter.
    

            In August 2023, FBI agents killed an armed Utah man who was suspected of making threats against Bragg, Garland, James and President Joe Biden. Family members of Craig Deleeuw Robertson, who was killed by agents as they tried to serve a warrant at his home in Provo, Utah, described him as a gun enthusiast who was worried about “a corrupt and overreaching government.”

CNN_10,"‘Every moment we live must be documented’: A doll, letters and keys help displaced Gazans hold onto their identity",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/israel-gaza-war-palestinians-personal-objects-identity-cmd-intl/index.html,2024-07-27 12:01:00,world,"
            The final lick of paint was barely dry on the newly built, white-tiled Al-Hasanat home when the war in Gaza erupted in October.
    

            For three-year-old Ayten, the apartment in central Gaza was a source of immense pride. “This is our beautiful house,” she would say to anyone who would listen, her father, Ahmed Al-Hasanat, recounted.
    

            But two weeks after the family moved into their new home, they were forced to flee the besieged Al-Mughraqa neighborhood, said Al-Hasanat. When they returned in November, they found their apartment badly damaged by Israeli strikes. A doll belonging to Ayten lay among the rubble, peeking out from behind a broken door.
    

            “I cried for my area, my house, and everything around me,” Al-Hasanat told CNN in June. “Ayten said, ‘Our beautiful house is gone, Dad.’ Then I entered the apartment and brought her the doll.
    

            “She said, ‘Daddy, my doll died.’”
    

            After more than nine months of fighting in Gaza, the plush toy is now a precious reminder of the lives they led before the war. The Israeli military offensive has torn families apart, erased entire communities and reduced cultural sites to debris. Almost the entire population – up to 1.9 million people – has been displaced, according to the United Nations. Several Palestinians told CNN they could take only their most significant personal items on long and hazardous journeys of displacement.
    

            From neatly organizing letters while staying in labyrinthine tent camps, to keeping branches from family olive trees, some say they are doing all they can to keep memories alive. For many, repeated displacement means reliving the trauma of generations uprooted by al-Nakba, or “the catastrophe,” when roughly 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forcibly expelled from their homes in historic Palestine, during the creation of Israel in 1948.
    

            Others told CNN the preservation of family heirlooms symbolizes a collective effort to hold onto Palestinian identity – and the hope of returning to their homes in Gaza.
    

            Israel launched its military offensive on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, attacked southern Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted, according to Israeli authorities.
    

            Israeli strikes in Gaza have since killed more than 39,000 Palestinians and injured another 90,000, according to the Ministry of Health there.
    

            “Every moment we live must be documented,” Al-Hasanat, a father-of-three, told CNN.
    

        “We are being subjected to the biggest genocide. Every moment must be documented for the sake of other generations.”

            Before the war, Fadi Adwan was studying for an electrical engineering degree at the Islamic University of Gaza, his dream since he was a teenager. These days, he fiddles with a navy and gray scientific calculator inside a tent in Rafah, in the south.
    

            Israeli strikes destroyed several of the university’s buildings in the early days of the war, Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
    

            “Since I was in the 10th grade, I always had a calculator in my hands,” said the student, in his early 20s. He and his family have been displaced at least five times since October, he added. “I was thinking that we would go home after a month or so, but things were not the same in this war as previous wars.”
    

            Israeli bombardment has largely wiped out academic and cultural institutions in Gaza, according to the UN. More than 75% of schools in Gaza will need either full reconstruction or major rehabilitation work to be functional again, the UN reported in June. Thousands of students have been killed and injured since the start of the war, WAFA reported in early July, citing the Ministry of Education and Higher Education in Gaza. Students told CNN days spent on campus have been replaced by repeated displacement and bloodshed. Some have held onto their university notes, inspired by hopes of rebuilding their future after the war.
    

            “I stood with tears in my eyes in front of my wardrobe, gazing at my belongings,” 20-year-old Haya Ismail told CNN, as she recalled her final minutes in her home in Gaza City, amid the sound of approaching bombing last November.
    

            As her family prepared to flee, Ismail instructed her three sisters to fill a small box with their most treasured possessions. Her younger sister, Dina, contributed a necklace and some handwritten letters from close friends.
    

            Ismail said she chose to pack her third-year university notes, which were neatly written in English with a flash of pink and yellow highlighter underscoring the words “first lecture,” according to pictures seen by CNN. Seven months later, Ismail says she sits staring at her notes in a relative’s house in Deir Al-Balah, where her family have been displaced.
    

            The handwritten pages are a tribute to her much-loved university professor, Refaat Alareer, who was instrumental in helping young Palestinians tell their stories in English. The famed poet and writer spoke to CNN in October, months before he was killed by  an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza.
    

            “Dr. Refaat’s voice is what keeps ringing in my head whenever I see my notes,” said Ismail. “He made us aware of the power of words and writing in delivering messages to the world, so we as Gazans will be heard.”
    

            Ismail wonders if she will relive the plight of her grandparents, whose lives were uprooted in 1948, when they were children. Her only living grandparent - her paternal grandma, who has Alzheimer’s disease - still remembers the horrors of al-Nakba, Ismail said.
    

            Streams of Palestinians have been forced to flee under Israeli bombardment since October, as the war uproots new generations. Some told CNN that their experience echoed their ancestral history.
    

            “I hate it when I realize that I am reliving the exact wretched fate my grandparents once lived… I too will be traumatized and attached to my past life for as long as I live,” Ismail said.
    

            Cycles of repeated displacement – without the promise of return – are embedded within Palestinian communities, according to Rochelle Davis, an associate professor of anthropology at Georgetown University.
    

            “Every Palestinian in Gaza has the awareness that when you leave (home), you may not be going back, because of the experience of the Nakba and everything that’s happened since,” she told CNN. “That is very different than many refugees in the world today.”
    

            CNN previously reported on Palestinians in Gaza filling “emergency bags” with important documents and a select few keepsakes, leaving them by the door in case looming Israeli invasion forced them to flee – even before October 7.
    

            “I used to wonder why they were leaving their homes in 1948,” said Adwan, the electrical engineering student. “But when this war happened, I understood why they left their homes; because of the horrific massacres that took place and because of the blood that was shed.”
    

            Small green leaves cling to a withering olive branch which 19-year-old Raghad Ezzat Hamouda took in October from a tree which had been planted by her father in their home in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza.
    

            Having been displaced at least six times, Hamouda has preserved the branch – and a keffiyeh, the traditional scarf worn by many Palestinians, that belonged to her grandmother, Tamam – as they remind her of her “beloved homeland,” she says.
    

            “Our ancestors were displaced by Israel in 1948, and the scene today in 2024 is repeated,” she added.
    

        “The Palestinian keffiyeh is a symbol of my identity, which is Palestine.”
    

            Raghad Ezzat Hamouda, 19, displaced Palestinian
        

            Once a marker of Palestinian life, Hamouda says her black-and-white fishnet-patterned keffiyeh is now a symbol of loss.
    

            She said 85-year-old Tamam, a Nakba survivor, was injured when Israeli tanks opened fire as the family fled from northern to western Gaza in December. She was pushing her grandmother in her wheelchair at the time, she recalled. The teenager said her grandmother bled to death before they could get her to a hospital. “My grandmother was very affectionate and loved her grandchildren very much,” she said. “She loved to smile and gave us hope, especially during times of war.”
    

            The IDF told CNN it could not comment on allegations of the targeted attack without geographic coordinates and the specific time, but provided CNN with a generic statement it has often used during the war in Gaza. CNN provided the location and date for the assault in question.
    

            With no end to the war in sight, other Palestinians told CNN they have held onto their house keys as a reminder of home. Many may never be able to use them; Israel’s military campaign has destroyed 150,000 homes in the enclave, the Government Media Office in Gaza said on July 7. But for generations of Palestinians dating back to al-Nakba, the house key has become a potent symbol of a shared hope to return home, according to the Museum of the Palestinian People.
    

            Along with house keys, some Palestinians will also have passports and land deeds from the 1940s testifying to pre-existing ownership of land in what is now Israel, according to Dr. Scott Webster, an academic from the University of Sydney. At least 70% of residents in Gaza are refugees, those who were displaced from their homes during the creation of Israel and their descendants, Amnesty International says.
    

            “The house key is important because it brings with it all the memories, memories of the house and the garden around it, and the grapevines,” said Adwan, who has held onto his keys while being forced to flee multiple times, including from the besieged Al-Shifa Hospital.
    

            “My father and mother have been working hard for 30 years to be able to build this house… It was partially destroyed in 2014. We built it again and it was destroyed again,” he said. “We are people with lives and memories… Maybe one day someone might care about our cause and help end our suffering.”
    

            Palestinian parents told CNN they were juggling their own fears for survival while trying to reassure their children under a constant threat of Israeli strikes. Children across the Gaza Strip are experiencing loss of appetite, persistent anxiety and emotional outbursts, according to the UN children’s agency, UNICEF.
    

            Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed at least 15,983 children, the Government Media Office reported on July 7.
    

            Guardians may use personal objects – including toys – to provide emotional support for displaced children, said Davis, of Georgetown University. Meanwhile some adults hide their psychological trauma because they do not want to overload younger generations, according to Dr. Samah Jabr, a psychiatrist, psychotherapist and head of the mental health unit at the Palestinian Ministry of Health, in Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.

            “We are talking about historical trauma that affects masses of individuals,” she told CNN. “It damages the social fabric of the Palestinian people.”
    

            For Al-Hasanat, saving Ayten’s doll from the wreckage of their home was an attempt to soothe his daughter’s psychological trauma.
    

            “She used to always laugh and spread happiness,” he said, explaining that she has now developed anxiety-related habits.
    

            “I want to look for a safe place for the sake of my children, and for the sake of a happy life for Ayten, who needs a lot to return to the way she used to be,” he added. “The pain is indescribable. We have become without feeling or sensation.”
    

            Since their visit in November, Al-Hasanat said, their apartment has been completely destroyed by bombing. “Nothing remains of the house,” he said.
    

            Ismail, the literature student, says the stress of war has made her feel like “a stranger in my own life.”
    

            “That’s how I and all Gazans feel after being snatched out of our lives and being forced to evacuate,” she said. “I am exhausted, counting days waiting for this all to end. I feel I am no longer me.”

CNN_11,"Justice Department responds to TikTok lawsuit, argues algorithm could allow Chinese government to influence US elections",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/tech/tiktok-response-to-us-ban/index.html,2024-07-27 13:19:00,us,"
            Allowing TikTok to continue to be operated by its current parent company could allow the Chinese government to covertly influence US elections, the Justice Department said in a court filing late Friday.
    

            In a federal appeals court filing, prosecutors raised concerns that TikTok’s algorithm could be used in a “secret manipulation” campaign to “influence the views of Americans for its own purposes.”
    

            “Among other things, it would allow a foreign government to illicitly interfere with our political system and political discourse, including our elections,” prosecutors wrote. The filing added, “if, for example, the Chinese government were to determine that the outcome of a particular American election as sufficiently important to Chinese interests.”
    

            “Allowing the Chinese government to remain poised to use TikTok to maximum effectiveness at a moment of extreme importance presents an unacceptable threat to national security,” prosecutors wrote.
    

            The filing is in response to a federal lawsuit TikTok brought against the US government in May in an attempt to block a law that could force a nationwide ban of the app. That law, which President Joe Biden signed in April, says that TikTok must find a new owner by mid-January 2025 or it will be banned from the United States entirely.
    

            The filing Friday marks the first time the federal government has responded to the lawsuit. The legal battle could determine whether US security concerns about TikTok’s links to China can trump the First Amendment rights of TikTok’s 170 million US users.
    

            In their lawsuit, TikTok and Bytedance say that US law is unconstitutional because it runs afoul of free speech rights and prevents Americans from accessing lawful information.
    

            “For the first time in history,” attorneys for TikTok wrote in the lawsuit, “Congress has enacted a law that subjects a single, named speech platform to a permanent, nationwide ban, and bars every American from participating in a unique online community with more than 1 billion people worldwide.”
    

            The lawsuit follows years of US allegations that TikTok’s ties to China could potentially expose Americans’ personal information to the Chinese government.
    

            The Justice Department now says that TikTok is misapplying the First Amendment. “The statute is aimed at national-security concerns unique to TikTok’s connection to a hostile foreign power, not at any suppression of protected speech,” the DOJ filing reads, adding that ByteDance could sell TikTok to an American affiliate and then the app could run in the US without interruption.
    

            Senior justice officials, in speaking about the filing, said that the Justice Department is concerned about any efforts by the People’s Republic of China, or PRC, to “weaponize technology,” such as apps and software that run on phones used in the US.
    

            One official said those concerns are “compounded when those autocratic nations require and force, as the PRC does, companies under their control to turn over sensitive data to the Chinese government in secret.”
    

            Some department officials have already spoken out about the video app’s security risks, though not in the context of this lawsuit.
    

            Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco warned against using the app last year, saying that “any company doing business in China for that matter is subject to Chinese national security laws, which requires turning over data to the state, and there is a reason we need to be very concerned.”
    

            “I don’t use TikTok, and I would not advise anyone to do so,” Monaco said.
    

            “TikTok application collects vast swaths of sensitive data from its 170 million U.S. users,” the DOJ filing reads. “That collection includes data on users’ precise locations, viewing habits, and private messages — and it even includes data on users’ phone contacts who do not themselves use TikTok.”
    

            Some of the users that TikTok is gathering data on are teenagers who could become “family members or potential future government employees,” prosecutors wrote.
    

            The Friday filing makes clear that law enforcement officials believe TikTok could – and has in some instances – taken direction from the Chinese government.
    

            Prosecutors wrote that the proprietary algorithm TikTok uses “can be manually manipulated, and its location in China would permit the Chinese government to covertly control the algorithm — and thus secretly shape the content that American users receive — for its own malign purposes.”
    

            Law enforcement officials know of one tool used in China, for example, that allows TikTok to suppress certain content on the app. While it is not believed that the tool has been used within the US, department officials said the existence of that technology has sparked major concerns about whether the app could collect, censor or even promote certain content for American users.
    

            Senior officials also expressed concerns about employees’ abilities to collect bulk information based on a user’s content that discussed issues like gun control, abortion and religion.

CNN_12,California’s Park Fire destroys buildings and forces thousands to flee as a fast-moving fire ravages Canadian tourist town,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/us/california-chico-park-fire-canada-jasper-fire/index.html,2024-07-27 14:35:00,us,"
California’s largest wildfire of the year has burned an area about the size of San Diego, destroying dozens of buildings and forcing thousands of residents to flee their homes as wildfires wreak havoc in the Western United States. Meanwhile, homes and businesses in a popular Canadian resort town were incinerated as a wildfire continued to roar through the area. Here’s the latest:


            • California’s Park Fire destroys more than 100 structures: As the Park Fire exploded across parts of Butte and Tehama counties, north of Sacramento, California, it scorched 134 buildings and threatened another 4,200. The fast moving blaze has burned more than 239,000 acres, or about 373 square miles, making it the 13th largest wildfire in state history. More than 2,400 firefighters are working to slow the fire’s progress as it remains 0% contained, according to Cal Fire.
    

            • California governor declares state of emergency: Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for both counties Friday. The state also secured a federal grant to ensure there are enough resources to fight the blaze. The fire is advancing at 4,000 to 5,000 acres per hour, Billy See, incident commander for Cal Fire, said Friday. With winds forecast to die down overnight and higher humidity moving into the area, See believes firefighters will have a better chance to slow the fire down.
    

            • A man is accused of igniting Park Fire: A 42-year-old man, identified as Ronnie Dean Stout II, was arrested on suspicion of pushing a burning car 60 feet into a gully, “spreading flames that caused the Park Fire,” authorities said. The DA says the man was seen “calmly leaving the area by blending in with the other citizens who were in the area and fleeing the rapidly evolving fire.” Stout, who has not retained an attorney, will likely face an arson charge, the DA’s office told CNN.
    

            • Fire wipes out many of a Canadian town’s buildings: A fast-moving wildfire sent thousands of visitors and residents fleeing the town of Jasper in Alberta, where flames devastated an estimated 30% of the town’s structures. Officials say the losses are significant, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has deployed federal support to help battle the blaze. Cool temperatures are expected to calm fire behavior, which will help the 154 firefighters in Jasper fight the blaze, Jasper National Park said on Facebook Friday night. High winds, however, could increase fire activity.
    

            • 96 large wildfires burning nationwide: Triple-digit heat and dry conditions across the West this week have made conditions poor for firefighters actively fighting to contain the dozens of wildfires burning nationwide, including 36 in Oregon and 14 in California. “Elevated to critical fire weather conditions will persist through the weekend across the Western U.S. Isolated dry thunderstorms could lead to new fire starts over portions of the northern Rockies,” the National Weather Service said. Smoke from wildfires will also result in continued unhealthy air quality.
    

            The Park Fire, which began Wednesday in the Chico area, has forced about 4,000 people to evacuate in Butte County, where the state’s deadliest wildfire, the Camp Fire, killed more than 85 people and destroyed thousands of homes in 2018.
    

            A heavy plume of smoke once again looms over the county as crews battle thick flames that are torching everything in their path. The Park Fire has left graveyards of burned cars and charred, hallowed out structures, video from the Chico area shows.
    

            For Butte County residents, the advancing flames bring with them painful memories of the losses they endured from the Camp Fire six years ago.
    

            One evacuee, Tim Ferguson, told CNN affiliate KOVR he had lost his father in the Camp Fire, and it’s painful thinking about having to experience more loss this time around.
    

            “We’ve got our home, and we’ve been working on it a lot lately, fixing it up, and it’s just we’re at the verge of maybe losing all that,” Ferguson said.
    

            Lauri Schwein, who lost her home in the Camp Fire, told CNN affiliate KCRA she’s on high alert. “I’m packing up, my dog, my cat,” she said. “All I can do is wait and watch.”
    

            In the town of Paradise, the smoke is enough to bring back the horrors the Camp Fire unleashed when it incinerated much of the town.
    

            “It was very impactful, every once in a while we smell smoke or see smoke like that, it does trigger us. It triggers the people here in Paradise. When you go through trauma, that’s what happens,” Ron Lassonde, the mayor of Paradise, told KCRA.
    

            The Park Fire is burning just three weeks after the Thomspon Fire in Butte County burned more than 3,700 acres, forced people from their homes, and destroyed more than two dozen structures, including houses.
    

            Local officials cautioned that it would take some time before people would be allowed back in their homes.
    

            “We are no strangers to evacuations in Butte County,” said Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea at a news conference Friday. “We are constantly looking for the earliest opportunity to get people back in.”
    

            The North Valley Animal Disaster Group has rescued 88 animals from the blaze as its members dealt with losses of their own. In 2018, the group managed to shelter over 4,000 animals during the Camp Fire.
    

            “When you’ve been through a big fire and you’ve lost everything, sometimes the only thing you have left to give is to go help the animals,” Vice President Norm Rosene told CNN.
    

            Triple-digit temperatures and high wind gusts have fueled the explosive growth of the Park Fire amid an active fire season in California. An estimated 467,000 acres have burned across the state so far in 2024, compared to 22,600 acres burned by this time last year, according to Cal Fire.
    

            “It’s been nothing but challenging,” Cal Fire Captain Dan Collins told CNN. “If we see fires behave like this in July, they may behave even more radically come the fall when the fields are even drier.”
    

            In Jasper, a popular tourist town in Alberta, 25,000 residents and visitors were forced to evacuate from a fast-moving blaze that has destroyed 30% of the town’s structures, officials said.
    

            Two wildfires converged in the Jasper National Park area, becoming what authorities are referring to as the Jasper Wildfire Complex. It remains difficult to measure exactly how big the complex – which also includes a third nearby fire – is due to extreme fire behavior and thick smoke cover. Together, the fires have swallowed an estimated 89,000 acres, the Jasper National Park said.
    

            An evacuation order remains in effect for Jasper and Jasper National Park, with the vast majority of evacuees being visitors, officials said. Along with about 5,000 residents who live in the town, 2.48 million people visited Jasper National Park last year.
    

            Out of a total of 1,113 structures in the town, 358 have been destroyed, according to a Facebook post from Jasper National Park.
    

            The owner of Maligne Lodge in Jasper told CNN news partner CTV News that she was shocked when she saw a photo of the 98-room hotel up in flames. It had been in the family since 1961 after her father purchased the property, and she had been working there since she was a child.
    

            “As soon as we’re given the go-ahead, we’ll be in there rebuilding our hotel,” Karyn Decore said.
    

            Jasper Mayor Richard Ireland lost the home that his family had moved into around his second birthday, according to CTV News.
    

            On a tour of the wreckage in Jasper, Ireland said that the loss of his home of 67 years “is shattering.”
    

            “Now it’s memories of family and fire,” Ireland told CNN news partner CBC. “So many others are going to go through this same thing.”
    

            But he said “when I stood back and looked, and saw what remains, I know that the community is still there.”

CNN_13,"Israel warns it will ‘forcefully operate’ in part of Gaza’s Khan Younis, issues evacuation order",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/israel-evacuation-order-gaza-khan-younis-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-27 15:19:00,world,"
            Israel’s military issued an evacuation order to residents in the southern part of Khan Younis, warning it would “forcefully operate” in the embattled Gazan town, according to a statement on Saturday morning.
    

            Khan Younis has faced intensifying bombardment recently, and a fresh Israeli ground assault earlier this week killed dozens of Palestinians there. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) warned on Monday it would reduce its so-called humanitarian zone in the eastern part of the city, due to intelligence that militant group Hamas had embedded in the area.
    

            Tens of thousands have been displaced over the past week. Israel said Friday that about 100 militants had been killed during recent fighting.

            “The IDF is about to forcefully operate against the terrorist organizations and therefore calls on the remaining population left in the southern neighborhoods of Khan Yunis to temporarily evacuate to the adjusted Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi,” the military wrote on Telegram on Saturday.
    

            The designated humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi has come under repeated Israeli attacks, including a strike on July 14 which reportedly killed 90 people and injured 300 more.
    

            The statement said the move was in retaliation to “significant terrorist activity and rocket fire” emanating from southern Khan Younis. It added that the location previously defined as a humanitarian area “will be adjusted.”
    

            Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza on October 7 after Hamas attacked southern Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted, according to Israeli authorities.
    

            Israeli strikes in Gaza have since killed 39,090 Palestinians and injured another 90,147, according to the Ministry of Health there. CNN cannot independently verify the figures from Gazan authorities.
    

            The military said on Saturday that “the calls for the temporary evacuation are being communicated to residents through SMS messages, recorded voice messages, phone calls, media broadcasts in Arabic and flyers,” adding that the early warning to civilians was “being made in order to mitigate harm to the civilian population.”
    

            The United Nations estimated that about 150,000 people fled the area on Monday alone, following evacuation orders issued by the Israeli military, intensifying pressure on meager supplies of food and water, and places to seek shelter.
    

            Aid agencies working in Gaza have warned previously that new rounds of evacuation orders are making the delivery of emergency rations even more difficult.
    

            “People in Gaza are exhausted, living in inhumane conditions, with no safety at all,” the UN Relief and Works Agency posted on X on Monday.
    

            On Thursday, the IDF said it had recovered the bodies of five Israeli hostages the previous day from a tunnel in an area of Khan Younis which it had previously designated as a “humanitarian area.”

CNN_15,‘A point of no return:’ Why Europe has become an epicenter for anti-tourism protests this summer,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/travel/why-europe-has-become-an-epicenter-for-anti-tourism-protests-this-summer/index.html,2024-07-27 16:30:00,world,"
            Anti-tourism protests have been sweeping across Europe this summer, with demonstrations taking place in the Netherlands, Greece, and of course, Spain.
    

            In early July, protesters marched through popular tourist areas in the Spanish city of Barcelona spraying unsuspecting visitors with water pistols while chanting “tourists go home.
    

            And most recently, thousands protested in the Spanish island of Mallorca, with organizers claiming the island’s tourism model “impoverishes workers and enriches only a few.”
    

            At the center of the protests lies the growing issue of rising rents and house prices, which has made home ownership almost impossible for some residents.
    

            Carlos Ramirez, a school teacher in Barcelona, northeast Spain, has been saving for his first house for years and earns a “decent” state salary, he says.
    

            But prices in the Catalan capital are skyrocketing and Ramirez, 26, fears he will be driven out.
    

            “Everyone I know lives here,” he told CNN. “But the only way you can afford to live right now in Barcelona is sharing with two, three, four people.”
    

            Like other residents in Southern Europe whose cities double as popular summer travel destinations, Ramirez puts much of the blame for the increasing costs on one thing: mass tourism.

            “It’s becoming more and more difficult for locals, especially younger people, to have their own place,” he said. “As the years have gone by, more and more tourists have come.”
    

            In Barcelona, rents have increased by 68% over the past decade, according to the city’s mayor Jaume Collboni – a pattern that is mirrored across other European cities.
    

            Many residents have had enough. Some have taken extreme measures to make their voices heard, with locals demonstrating against excessive tourism in the Spanish Canary Islands calling for a hunger strike back in April.
    

            When anti-tourism protesters started to fire water pistols at visitors in the Barcelona city center on July 6, a moment that gained international attention, Ramirez said he could “feel the resentment” in the air.
    

            He says he was pleased to see so many residents join the demonstration, which some 2,800 people attended according to Barcelona’s City Council.
    

            “A lot of people, a lot of companies, are now warning tourists about visiting Spain because of hostility and all of that. Frankly, I think it worked,” Ramirez said, reflecting on the ability of the protests to dissuade tourists from visiting the city.
    

            Antje Martins, an expert in sustainable tourism from the University of Queensland, said the reputational impact of such protests could influence where tourists decide to travel.
    

            “Barcelona now has a really bad reputation for other tourists who don’t want to visit because they’re scared,” she said.
    

            But Eduardo Santander, CEO of the European Travel Commission, a nonprofit association responsible for the promotion of Europe as a travel destination, suggests that incidents like the protests in Barcelona are “isolated” and do not “reflect the complete reality of Spain or Europe.”
    

            Generally, Martins believes that this isn’t a clash between tourists and residents.
    

            “For me, they’re a broader reflection of tourism that is not sustainably managed,” she said.
    

            “When I see those clashes where residents are sort of revolting against tourism… I think that’s a reflection of them not being happy because they don’t get any benefits from the tourism that they see,” she added.
    

            Ramirez agrees with this sentiment.
    

            “I can empathize with them, we are not blaming the tourists directly,” he said. “We want to pressure our government to change policies.”
    

            The main issues at play here are structural, not personal, Martins said.
    

            Residents who are priced out due to unsustainable levels of tourism are typically paid lower wages and some are working in the tourism industry itself, she added.
    

            In some European cities, local authorities are taking bold action in a bid to bring tourism levels under control.
    

            Officials in Venice have recently hailed a temporary entrance fee, designed to regulate tourist numbers, as a success.
    

            The new €5 (about $5.4) tourist charge, which began on April 25 and concluded on July 14, brought in more than €2.4 million (about $2.6 million), significantly more than expected, according to Venice mayor Luigi Brugnaro.
    

            Some residents told a CNN team on the ground that while still busy, crowds seemed smaller during the scheme. But others don’t agree.
    

            Susanna Polloni, from the Venice-based Solidarity Network for Housing group, told CNN the tax is “not only useless, but also harmful,” as it brings into the international imagination the idea of a “Veniceland,” where you must buy a ticket to enter.
    

            Polloni adds that mass tourism has already caused healthcare services to close, neighborhood shops to be replaced by souvenir shops and house prices to boom in Italy’s canal city.
    

            “We are about to reach a point of no return,” Polloni said. “We think that our cry for help, from a city that is dying for the profit of a few, should reach the whole world.”
    

            Despite backlash from some, more cities across Europe are following suit, and some are even looking to expand their tourist charges.
    

            Barcelona’s mayor Jaume Collboni announced recently that he wants to raise the city’s tourist tax for some cruise passengers.
    

            Tourists who visit the city for less than 12 hours typically cause extra crowding at the main attractions of Sagrada Familia cathedral, Las Ramblas pedestrian walkway in the Gothic Quarter and at Gaudi’s hillside Park Guëll, the city’s press office told CNN.
    

            The current tourist tax is Barcelona’s third-largest source of funding, raising about €100 million (about $108 million) last year from cruise passengers – who pay €6.25 (about $6.8) to enter the city – and other visitors who stay in hotels and other tourist lodgings.
    

            Collboni said he also wants to end licenses for around 10,000 apartments currently approved for short-term rentals, the press office said.
    

            It’s not just housing issues that have generated a backlash against tourists, Ramirez said, adding that the disrespectful behavior of some has also played a part.
    

            In Italy’s Florence, a young woman was recently filmed kissing, humping and grinding against a statue of Bacchus, the god of wine and sensuality, with the mayor’s office calling it an act that “mimicked sex.”
    

            And in 2023, a tourist was accused of damaging a statue in the city’s 16th-century Fountain of Neptune, located in the Piazza della Signoria.
    

            The same year, in another part of Italy, a group of tourists were accused of toppling a valuable statue at a villa.
    

            Bad tourist behavior has been a problem across other parts of Europe too, including Barcelona, Mallorca, Magaluf and Benidorm, Ramirez said.
    

            “It seems like they do here what they can’t do in their own countries,” he told CNN. “We feel very insulted.”
    

            Sebastian Zenker, a professor in tourism at Copenhagen Business School, explains how these types of incidents have led to some cities running “de-marketing campaigns,” which aim to discourage certain tourists from visiting.
    

            Zenker points to Amsterdam’s 2023 “Stay Away” campaign, which targeted male visitors between the ages of 18 and 35 with adverts warning them about the consequences of anti-social behavior.
    

            “That was a very tough and strict way of de-marketing,” he told CNN. “It did not stop bachelor parties, but it created an awareness that this city has changed the rules.”
    

            Efforts to attract more cultural tourists can have unintended consequences though, Zenker said.
    

            “If you increase prices and you attract more wealthy people, this solves the crowding effect, but at the same time it increases the inflation and the gentrification problem.”
    

            In Mallorca, prices have gone “super crazy” after many activities for “drinking tourists” were banned, says Zenker.
    

            Much of the money raised won’t make it back into the hands of local communities, he added.
    

            So, what is the solution?
    

            “It’s about seeing the money that is made by tourists, or with tourists, being invested in the place and in jobs so people can afford to live,” he said.
    

            “This [the protests] will go on, until we find a balance again.”

CNN_16,Israel issues fresh evacuation order in Gaza’s Khan Younis after renewed offensive displaces tens of thousands,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/israel-evacuation-order-gaza-khan-younis-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-27 17:32:00,world,"
            Israel’s military issued new evacuation orders for residents in Gaza’s southern city of Khan Younis, warning it would “forcefully operate” in southern neighborhoods as it presses on with an operation that has already displaced tens of thousands.
    

            Khan Younis has faced intensifying bombardment recently, and a fresh Israeli ground assault launched earlier this week has killed dozens of Palestinians. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) warned on Monday it would reduce its so-called humanitarian zone in the eastern part of the city, due to intelligence that militant group Hamas had embedded in the area.
    

            Fighting has been ongoing on Gaza for months, and the renewed offensive shows Israel’s challenges in achieving its goal of eliminating Hamas. Israel said that about 100 militants had been killed during recent fighting.
    

            The United Nations estimated that about 150,000 people fled Khan Younis on Monday alone, intensifying pressure on meager supplies of food and water, and places to seek shelter.

            Signaling another campaign was imminent, the IDF wrote on Telegram it was “about to forcefully operate against the terrorist organizations and therefore calls on the remaining population left in the southern neighborhoods of Khan Yunis to temporarily evacuate to the adjusted Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi.”
    

            An eyewitness in Khan Younis told CNN that she was “woken up by the screams” of people as they fled the area following the evacuation order.
    

            The eyewitness told CNN that she could hear clearly hear the sound of clashes and explosions in Khan Yunis and saw flares in the sky overnight. According to her, people are now fleeing the area.
    

            The designated humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi has come under repeated Israeli attacks, including a strike on July 14 which reportedly killed 90 people and injured 300 more.
    

            The statement said the move was in retaliation to “significant terrorist activity and rocket fire” emanating from southern Khan Younis. It added that the location previously defined as a humanitarian area “will be adjusted.”
    

            Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza on October 7 after Hamas attacked southern Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted, according to Israeli authorities.
    

            Israeli military action in Gaza has since killed 39,090 Palestinians and injured another 90,147, according to the Ministry of Health there. As of early July, nearly 2 million people had been displaced in Gaza – almost the entire population, according to figures from the UN.
    

            The military said on Saturday that “the calls for the temporary evacuation are being communicated to residents through SMS messages, recorded voice messages, phone calls, media broadcasts in Arabic and flyers,” adding that the early warning to civilians was “being made in order to mitigate harm to the civilian population.”
    

            Aid agencies working in Gaza have warned previously that new rounds of evacuation orders are making the delivery of emergency rations even more difficult.
    

            “People in Gaza are exhausted, living in inhumane conditions, with no safety at all,” the UN Relief and Works Agency posted on X on Monday.
    

            On Thursday, the IDF said it had recovered the bodies of five Israeli hostages the previous day from a tunnel in an area of Khan Younis which it had previously designated as a “humanitarian area.”
    

            Despite the fighting, US and Israeli officials expressed optimism this week over the possibility of a ceasefire and hostage deal being reached.
    

            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that the different parties are “inside the 10-yard line and driving toward the goal line.”
    

            Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he would likely dispatch a negotiation team to talks in Rome next week.
    

            Netanyahu was in Washington this week and met with the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, who urged him to seal an agreement.
    

            “As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done,” said Harris. “So to everyone who has been calling for a ceasefire, and to everyone who yearns for peace, I see you and I hear you.”

CNN_17,Blinken meets China’s top diplomat in Laos as global giants keep communication lines open,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/asia/us-china-blinken-wang-meeting-laos-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-27 17:24:00,world,"
            The most senior diplomats from China and the United States began talks in Laos on Saturday as the two global powers try to maintain lines of communication despite their deepening rivalry and regional tensions in Asia.
    

            Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Laos as part of a visit to Asia against the backdrop of a fierce US presidential election campaign, which has renewed regional scrutiny over what the world will look like with a new administration in the White House.
    

            Blinken is meeting his Chinese counterpart Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the ASEAN foreign ministers’ meetings in Laos – the first leg of a week-long trip which also includes stops in Vietnam, Japan, the Philippines, Singapore and Mongolia.
    

            Tension between the US and China has persisted in recent months, even as President Joe Biden’s administration has sought to stabilize rocky relations between the two global rivals.
    

            Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as China’s increasingly assertive moves in the South China Sea and threats toward Taiwan, have in recent years soured the Washington-Beijing relationship.
    

            Earlier this week the North American Aerospace Defense Command intercepted two Russian and two Chinese bombers flying near Alaska in what a US defense official said was the first time the two countries have been intercepted while operating together.
    

            China’s continued support of Russia more than two years into Moscow’s invasion has been a persistent point of tension for the US, its allies and the Ukrainians.
    

            When NATO leaders met earlier this month a joint declaration labeled Beijing a “decisive enabler” of Russia’s war against Ukraine, citing China as giving “large-scale support for Russia’s defense industrial base.”

            The US and the European Union in recent months have accused China of bolstering Russia’s defense sector with the export of dual-use goods, and sanctioned dozens of companies in Hong Kong and mainland China for evading the extensive measures imposed on Russia. Beijing has denied supplying weaponry and maintains it keeps strict controls on such goods.
    

            Beijing has sought to position itself as a neutral peace broker in the conflict, despite its deepening political, economic and military ties with Moscow and Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s openly close friendship with Russia’s Vladimir Putin.
    

            Earlier this week, Wang told visiting Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba that Beijing “supported all efforts that contribute to peace” – the first time China has hosted a top Ukrainian official since Moscow’s invasion began nearly two and half years ago.
    

            In contrast, both Putin and Russia’s top diplomat Sergei Lavrov have been greeted in Beijing multiple times since the invasion.
    

            Kuleba also visited Hong Kong and urged the semi-autonomous Chinese city’s government to prevent Russia from using the Asian financial hub to bypass Western sanctions.
    

            On Thursday, Wang also met with foreign ministers from Southeast Asia, South Korea and Japan, as well as Lavrov.
    

            Wang told Lavrov that, in the face of a turbulent international situation and external interference and resistance, “China is willing to work with Russia… to firmly support each other and safeguard each other’s core interests,” according to a statement from China’s foreign ministry.
    

            Lavrov hailed Russia and China for “jointly upholding a fair and just international order” and “injecting positive energy into the construction of a multipolar world.”
    

            “Russia will work with China to support the central role of ASEAN and prevent sabotage and interference by foreign forces,” Lavrov said, according to the statement.
    

            ASEAN, a grouping of 10 Southeast Asian countries, has increasingly found itself nervously eyeing the growing tensions between China and the US in recent years.
    

            Among the countries Blinken will visit on his trip are the Philippines and Japan, both of which have a mutual defense treaty with Washington.
    

            The Philippines has tacked closer to the US since the election of President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr. against a backdrop of increasingly violent clashes between Manila and Beijing in the South China Sea.
    

            Before speaking with Wang on Saturday, Blinken urged Southeast Asian countries to work together to address challenges – including Beijing’s “escalating and unlawful actions taken against the Philippines in the South China Sea” – at a meeting with ASEAN foreign ministers.
    

            But he also applauded Manila’s diplomacy with Beijing over the contentious issue, noting that the Philippines on Saturday completed unimpeded a resupply trip to troops stationed on a navy ship grounded at the hotly contested Second Thomas Shoal.

            Such resupply missions had been the source of months of escalating tensions between the Philippines and China, which reached an interim deal last week to smooth deliveries.
    

            “We are pleased to take note of the successful resupply today of the Second Thomas Shoal, which is the product of an agreement reached between the Philippines and China,” Blinken said.
    

            “We applaud that and hope and expect to see that it continues going forward.”
    

            During his presidency, Biden has pushed to deepen relations with the Philippines, Japan and South Korea, another mutual treaty ally, with Blinken a mainstay on the diplomatic circuit.
    

            Beijing has bristled at such efforts, seeing it as part of Washington’s campaign to encircle China and contain its rise.
    

            Asia is therefore watching closely for what might come next, especially given recent bombshell developments in the US election campaign.
    

            Republican candidate Donald Trump, who recently survived an assassination attempt, has often viewed Washington’s alliances more transactionally than Biden does. His running mate JD Vance has advocated halting military aid to Ukraine in favor of focusing on Taiwan’s defense.
    

            Meanwhile the Democratic Party’s campaign was upended by Biden’s decision not to seek re-election, and Vice President Kamala Harris becoming the party’s presumptive nominee.

Team USA survives scare in Olympic warmup, scraping past South Sudan 101-100


            So when a new upstart on the block, fresh off a captivating performance at the FIBA World Cup in 2023, pushed LeBron James and co. all the way to the final buzzer in an Olympic warmup game, the basketball world took notice.
    

            South Sudan, the world’s newest country, captured the hearts of spectators at the World Cup en route to a 17th place finish out of 32 teams. While that might not appear to be all that impressive at first glance, the Bright Stars finished top of the pool of teams that did not advance to the knockout stages and left the competition with a winning 3-2 record.
    

            As the best-placed African team, the result secured the squad a spot at the Olympics for the very first time in its history.
    

            Not bad for a country that has only officially existed for 13 years and has no indoor basketball facilities.
    

            Among those making their national team debuts at the tournament was Wenyen Gabriel, who’s had multiple stints in the NBA for the likes of the Los Angles Lakers, Los Angeles Clippers and the New Orleans Pelicans.
    

            Like multiple others on the Olympic roster, Gabriel is a refugee. He was forced to leave South Sudan as a young child, escaping the Second Sudanese Civil War. He and his family moved to Cairo two weeks after he was born before eventually arriving in the United States as refugees two years later.
    

            “Growing up, at first we didn’t have a country, you know?” Gabriel told CNN Sport. “It was just Sudan and we didn’t have South Sudan.”
    

            Gabriel explained that he was unsure whether his nation would ever have a basketball team so when the opportunity arrived, he jumped at it.
    

            “Knowing that, there’s a bunch of kids, a bunch of youth, that are from South Sudan that look up to us, that are inspired by what we do, that think that maybe they can make it next – for me to go represent the country, be one of the first group is just an honor to me,” he said.
    

            After decades of civil war, South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 following a referendum, making it the world’s newest widely recognized state.
    

            The nation descended into a civil war of its own shortly after, with the war officially ending in 2018 - though violence persists to this day. It is listed as one of the least developed countries in the world by the United Nations.
    

            Before becoming an official state, and well before bursting on to the international stage, the country already possessed some NBA pedigree. Manute Bol, one of the tallest players in NBA history at 7 foot 7 inches, gained a reputation as one of the league’s elite shot blockers between 1985 and 1995.
    

            Luol Deng is a two-time All-Star who was born in what is now South Sudan, arriving in London - via Egypt - as a refugee, before moving to the US for his professional career. He now serves as the president of South Sudan’s basketball federation.
    

            Bol’s son Bol Bol, JT Thor and Duop Reath are examples of players currently in the league with South Sudanese heritage, though the country has never truly been recognized as a force in international basketball. The sport is yet to truly take off in the country, which some players, such as Gabriel, have put down to insufficient resources.
    

            “A lot of people play soccer who are maybe 6 foot 8 (inches) because of the availability where you can just go kick a soccer ball around and there’s not a court for X amount of miles,” said the 27-year-old.
    

            “When I went back to South Sudan, to my village, I saw people that were 7 feet tall herding cows!”
    

            The relatively small amount of people getting into basketball in the country does not mean that there is no interest in the sport.
    

            “When we came back from the World Cup, we went back home, we had a parade, and we got to see people dancing in the rain, just a bunch of white teeth, big smiles, like everyone is happy,” Gabriel said. “Just the joy it brings to our country, it can’t be understated.”
    

            “For us to continue to push forward and to wave our flag and give people something to be proud of is something that is really fulfilling for us all. And I’m happy that I get to be part of it.”
    

            The mood among South Sudan supporters is jubilant as they prepare to watch their nation make history in Paris. After the tune-up game against Team USA last Saturday in London, fans celebrated, danced and waved the flag inside the O2 Arena, on the street and on public transport, despite watching their country suffer an agonizing 101-100 defeat.
    

            It has all been about the journey for this nation.
    

            South Sudan recently held its first news conference ahead of a friendly match against Great Britain in London. Something that repeatedly came up was the notion that the Olympic campaign extends beyond just sport.
    

            Putting the nation on the Olympic map and forging a path for the younger generation is at the core of the team.
    

            “For all of us it’s a journey that’s bigger than basketball,” Deng said at the news conference. “Sports can elevate and motivate a nation.
    

            “These guys know what’s more important is what they’re leaving behind.”
    

            “We’re going out there to represent something that’s bigger than ourselves and that’s known at every single point that we’re out there,” Gabriel added.
    

            South Sudan enters the Games bearing the additional responsibility of being the only African men’s basketball team to qualify – Nigeria qualified for the women’s competition. The continent has a rich history of producing NBA talent including MVP winners Hakeem Olajuwon from Nigeria and Joel Embiid, born in Cameroon but playing for Team USA.
    

            The players spoke about the extra motivation, with Gabriel saying that the support the team has received from other African fans has “opened up my eyes to whole new basketball world.
    

            “Even though other [African] teams might not be in the Olympics, they’re still maybe rooting for us,” he said. “So representing that, it shows even more continuity and gave us like a common goal.”
    

            Deng has also spoken of the need to erase harmful stereotypes and perceptions of the country and players. He said on Instagram that he was “disappointed” at “ignorant remarks” made by former NBA All-Stars Paul Pierce and Gilbert Arenas about the squad, calling Arenas’ comments “disrespectful and cruel.” Pierce and Arenas have since apologized.
    

            “Those who are easily misled may make comments that reflect self-hate more than pride.There is nothing about our history that we should run away from,” he wrote.
    

            It is worth remembering that South Sudan has been only been in existence for little more than a decade, while the basketball team did not play its first competitive fixture until 2017. Taking Team USA to the limit is a testament to how far the group has come.
    

            Players and staff have attributed the team’s rapid rise to Deng, who served in various roles – such as player liaison and assistant coach – before becoming president of the federation.
    

            “Luol is the driving force behind this all,” head coach Royal Ivey said at the news conference. “If there was no Luol Deng, we wouldn’t be sitting in front of you all today.”
    

            South Sudan is in Group C at the Olympics and will take on the USA in what is now a highly anticipated rematch. Serbia and Puerto Rico, each boasting NBA players and talent from all over the world, will be the Bright Stars’ other two opponents.
    

            It will be a tall task for South Sudan to get out of the group stage but the players aren’t setting limits on what can be achieved, nor are they getting ahead of themselves, with Gabriel and Ivey putting an emphasis on “competing” in every game.
    

            Whatever happens, though, this is a team that has already made history before even stepping on the court and that understands the significance that representation holds. For players like Gabriel, this is a “dream” that many thought would never come to fruition.
    

            As he puts it: “To be able to compete with my country across my chest is the best thing I could have asked for.”

CNN_19,Big Tobacco’s viral hit may be its biggest success since cigarettes,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/business/zyn-nicotine-philip-morris-tobacco/index.html,2024-07-27 18:30:00,us,"
            Governments around the world have tried to kill the tobacco industry. Zyn, the brand of flavored oral nicotine pouches that comes in small, round containers resembling breath mints, is its latest strategy.
    

            While it’s ultimately owned by tobacco giant Philip Morris International, Zyn is a tobacco-free product. White pouches similar in size to a piece of chewing gum send more nicotine than what’s in a cigarette right into the bloodstream. Unlike traditional chewing tobacco, you don’t have to chew the pouches or spit the build-up of tobacco juice.
    

            Several trends have driven a surge in Zyn’s relatively wild popularity, from what users feel is its convenience and subtlety, to a flood of online advertising positioning Zyn as a healthier, smoke-free alternative to cigarettes. The brand’s success shows how tobacco companies have diversified their business models from cigarettes to tobacco-free products like vapes, snus, nicotine gums and inhalers. Researchers have called this the “pharmaceuticalization” of the tobacco industry.
    

            Zyn’s advertising looks similar to those of many other lifestyle and health products. Advertisements with simple blue and white colors emphasize Zyn’s convenience, variety of flavors and use in many different situations. “Simple. Discreet. Satisfying,” one online ad says showing the cans next to someone typing on a laptop. “You’re free to enjoy it wherever your curiosity leads you.”
    

            Zyn was test marketed in 2014 and went national in 2019. Since then it has become the leading nicotine pouch on the market. And the growth has exploded.
    

            In 2023, Zyn pouch shipments in the United States hit 385 million cans, a 62% increase from the year prior, according to Phillip Morris International, Zyn’s parent company. Zyn shipments this year are expected to grow another 35%.
    

            After a surge in demand for Zyn that led to shortages of the pouches  — fans called it the “Zynpocalypse” —Phillip Morris International announced a $600 million investment last week in a new manufacturing facility in Aurora, Colorado, to increase production.
    

            Zyn users like Danny Whalen, 26, switched to nicotine pouches last year after 10 years of chewing tobacco.
    

            Whalen said that Zyn is cleaner than chewing tobacco, doesn’t hurt his gums as much, and he can pop in a Zyn in more places than he could spitting tobacco, like at work. He also believed it would be better for his health to stop chewing tobacco. Many health experts say nicotine pouches are a safer option than smoking or using chewing tobacco because they don’t contain cancer-causing chemicals, but nicotine pouch use does carry risks, and the long-term health effects are unknown.

            “I like it better than chewing tobacco,” Whalen said. “The thought of chewing grosses me out.”
    

            He now wants to quit Zyn, however, because nicotine is causing him anxiety. But it’s highly addictive and he’s having trouble stopping.
    

            In 2023, Zyn spent $28 million on digital advertising, a 1,300% increase from the year prior, a study led by researchers at the Rutgers Institute for Nicotine and Tobacco Studies found, citing data from ad tracker Vivvix.
    

            Influencers, known as “Zynfluencers,” promoting the pouches and marketing strategies like loyalty rewards programs have also boosted Zyn. Zyn has become subculture, particularly with young men on TikTok, the Rutgers researchers found. In one TikTok video that racked up more than 9 million views, the Nelk Boys — social media personalities — gift right-wing political commentator Tucker Carlson a 10-foot-tall can of Zyn. Joe Rogan and Logan Paul, who host the most popular and 47th most popular podcasts on Spotify, respectively, have also promoted Zyn.
    

            In a statement to CNN, Philip Morris International, which bought Zyn manufacturer Swedish Match in 2022, said that the company doesn’t use social media influencers and rejects all requests for partnerships.
    

            “ZYN advertises online with strict parameters that content be targeted to an audience of legal-age current nicotine consumers,” the company said. Its Instagram and Facebook channels and website are also age-restricted.
    

            Zyn’s rapid rise reflects its aggressive marketing push, the Rutgers researchers found in their study.
    

            Zyn has advertised on mobile apps like ESPN and sponsored events like the Beale Street Music Festival, the National Championships for Pickleball and IndyCar’s Music City Grand Prix. During the solar eclipse in April, Zyn compared its 60-minute pouches to the 4:28 minute eclipse duration. (Philip Morris International told CNN it only advertises at events with an adult audience of over 85%.)
    

            “Zyn has capitalized on having a clean appearance… and this idea that it’s not tobacco, it’s just nicotine, which leads many people to feel it’s different and safer,” said Pamela Ling, the director of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California San Francisco. “But nicotine addiction is not an innocuous and benign thing. It’s extremely distressful and really difficult for people to quit.”
    

Many public health experts say tobacco companies’ harm-reduction initiatives are a way to sustain the profitability of tobacco and nicotine products. Although nicotine pouch products have lower levels of toxicants than cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products, doctors, tobacco researchers and political leaders warn that Zyn’s marketing — which shows the brand in smoke-free environments like at work and in transportation — may perpetuate nicotine addiction among existing users or introduce nicotine to younger people.
    

            A dependency on nicotine causes cravings and withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, headaches, dizziness and fatigue. Researchers have found long-term usage may be connected with heart disease, vascular disease, reproductive disturbances and more, according to the National Cancer Institute. Nicotine does not cause cancer or lung disease, according to the FDA.
    

            Philip Morris International, which split from Phillip Morris USA, does not sell cigarettes in the United States. It said Zyn is not intended or sold as a smoking cessation product.
    

            A better strategy from a public health approach, Ling said, would be to tailor nicotine pouch availability to prescriptions, smoking cessation clinics, quit lines and other programs to help consumers with tobacco and nicotine addiction.
    

            “The mass marketing, especially on digital and social media, is the wrong way to promote health,” Ling said. “It’s driving popularity and driving a large pool of nicotine addicts.”

CNN_20,"At least 30 killed and over 100 injured in an Israeli airstrike on a school in Gaza, Palestinian officials say",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/israel-gaza-deir-al-balah-school-intl/index.html,2024-07-27 19:09:00,world,"
            At least 30 people have been killed and over 100 injured in an Israeli airstrike on a school in Deir-al Balah, central Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.
    

            The Israeli military it had launched the strike in order to destroy a Hamas command and control center inside the compound.
    

            Most of the victims from the school arriving to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the aftermath of the attack were women and children, according to Dr. Khalil Al-Daqran, a spokesperson for the hospital. More than 4,000 displaced people were housed in the school, the Palestinian Civil Defense said.
    

            The strike came soon after Israeli’s military issued fresh evacuation orders further south, in the city of Khan Younis, where Israel launched a fresh offensive earlier in the week which has killed dozens of Palestinians.
    

            Residents in southern neighborhoods were told to leave after being warned that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would “forcefully operate” in the area.
    

            Fighting has been ongoing on Gaza for months, and the renewed offensive shows Israel’s challenges in achieving its goal of eliminating Hamas. Israel said that about 100 militants had been killed during recent fighting.
    

            The United Nations estimated that about 150,000 people fled Khan Younis on Monday alone, intensifying pressure on meager supplies of food and water, and places to seek shelter.

            Signaling another campaign was imminent, the IDF wrote on Telegram it was “about to forcefully operate against the terrorist organizations and therefore calls on the remaining population left in the southern neighborhoods of Khan Yunis to temporarily evacuate to the adjusted Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi.”
    

            The statement said the move was in retaliation to “significant terrorist activity and rocket fire” emanating from southern Khan Younis. It added that the location previously defined as a humanitarian area “will be adjusted.”
    

            Al-Mawasi has come under repeated Israeli attacks, including a strike on July 14 which reportedly killed 90 people and injured 300 more.
    

            An eyewitness in Khan Younis told CNN that she was “woken up by the screams” of people as they fled the area following the evacuation order, saying she heard explosions and saw flares in the sky.
    

            Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza on October 7 after Hamas attacked southern Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted, according to Israeli authorities.
    

            Israeli military action in Gaza has since killed 39,090 Palestinians and injured another 90,147, according to the Ministry of Health there. As of early July, nearly 2 million people had been displaced in Gaza – almost the entire population, according to figures from the UN.
    

            Aid agencies working in Gaza have warned previously that new rounds of evacuation orders are making the delivery of emergency rations even more difficult.
    

            “People in Gaza are exhausted, living in inhumane conditions, with no safety at all,” the UN Relief and Works Agency posted on X on Monday.
    

            On Thursday, the IDF said it had recovered the bodies of five Israeli hostages the previous day from a tunnel in an area of Khan Younis which it had previously designated as a “humanitarian area.”
    

            Despite the fighting, US and Israeli officials expressed optimism this week over the possibility of a ceasefire and hostage deal being reached.
    

            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that the different parties are “inside the 10-yard line and driving toward the goal line.”
    

            Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he would likely dispatch a negotiation team to talks in Rome next week.
    

            Netanyahu was in Washington this week and met with the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, who urged him to seal an agreement.
    

            “As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done,” said Harris. “So to everyone who has been calling for a ceasefire, and to everyone who yearns for peace, I see you and I hear you.”

CNN_21,"Olympic gold in tennis faces tough competition from injuries, illnesses and dreams of Grand Slam glory",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/sport/olympics-tennis-preview/index.html,2024-07-27 19:00:00,world,"
            The first round of Olympic tennis gets underway Saturday, but the red clay of Roland Garros will be missing some of the sport’s biggest stars, including world no. 1 Jannik Sinner.
    

            While some are sidelined by illnesses and injuries, others are abstaining from the Games as a result of the professional circuit’s brutal schedule this summer.
    

            Between the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open, summer is always a busy season for those chasing an elusive Grand Slam title. Though the rest of the sports world sees the Olympics as the ultimate competition, the Games’ anthem falls flat amidst the prestigious yearly summer tournaments in Paris, London and New York.
    

            “In some sports, like athletics and swimming, the pinnacle of their sport is the Olympics,” said Conor Niland, former no. 1 Irish player and author of “The Racket: On Tour with Tennis’s Golden Generation – and the other 99%.”
    

            “In tennis, it’s just not quite there. They all want to win it, of course, but it’s not quite the same as winning a Wimbledon title, for example,” he added.
    

            Niland’s sentiment seems true among the top US players. Of the five US men’s singles players currently ranked in the top 30 globally, only two will represent the nation at the Games, but all five players competed at the French Open and Wimbledon this year.
    

            For American players – who, Niland noted, tend to have less experience on clay compared to European players – returning to Paris’ red clay is disruptive to their preparations for the US Open, which is played on hard courts. The ball moves slower on clay, so players must move differently.
    

            “Getting used to the clay and the sliding requires mental and physical and tactical changes, which at this level, the very highest level, you have to be precise,” said Jeff Greenwald, elite mental coach, former Master’s ITF world No. 1 and author of “The Best Tennis of Your Life.”
    

            Ben Shelton, the rising 21-year-old US star ranked No. 14 in the world, said the Olympics fall at a tough time in the tournament schedule, as he will be coming off a stint in Europe and wants to prepare for the US Open.
    

            “Having to go back to Europe to play on clay, a different surface – it kind of messes up a few lead-up tournaments to the US Open that I would play if I wasn’t playing the Olympics,” Shelton told reporters in the spring.
    

            Shelton isn’t alone in his worries about returning to clay directly after playing on grass courts at Wimbledon. Madison Keys from the United States, Ons Jabeur from Tunisia and Karen Khachanov from Russia – who would have to play as a neutral athlete – all mentioned the challenging surface as a factor in their decisions not to play at the Olympics.
    

            Other players are sitting out after sustaining injuries on tour. This year’s Wimbledon bracket had severe disruptions after nine singles players retired mid-tournament, many abandoning play mid-match, due to injuries.
    

            Hubert Hurkacz, the world no. 7 men’s player from Poland, retired in the fourth set of his second-round Wimbledon match after sustaining a knee injury diving for a ball.
    

            Slated to play singles and mixed doubles with fellow Pole and no. 1 women’s player, Iga Swiatek, at the Olympics, Hurkacz announced his withdrawal from the Games on Monday. He said in an Instagram post that, though rehabilitation was going well, he did not feel healthy enough to play.
    

            “This was a very, very difficult decision because I have always dreamed of representing Poland at the Olympics, being able to win a medal for the national team, but unfortunately my health does not allow it this year,” Hurkacz said in the post.
    

            Fellow top players Holger Rune from Denmark and Marketa Vondoursova, the 2023 Wimbledon ladies’ singles champion from the Czech Republic, have also withdrawn from the Games, both sitting out due to hand and wrist injuries.
    

            Greenwald said players often struggle with their game when recovering from an injury, not only because of the pain but also the mental obstacles of protecting one’s body.
    

            “The fear of reinjury – being tentative, protective and not wanting to run for that ball – and feeling compromised can distract you from being free and executing your strategy,” he said. “It is a definite aspect of mental management to focus on what you can control.”
    

            The most notable withdraw came from Sinner, the top-ranked men’s player from Italy, on Thursday. Announced just two days before the start of competition, Sinner said in an Instagram post that he has tonsilitis and is too sick to play.
    

            Both Sinner and Rybakina expressed that they were disappointed to not represent their countries, with Sinner calling the Games one of his main goals for the season.
    

            The following day, third-seed women’s singles player Elena Rybakina also withdrew from the Games. The Kazakhstani star said she developed acute bronchitis after Wimbledon, and her doctors “have strictly forbidden” playing until she gets better.
    

            With so many of the top seeds out this year, the Olympics are truly a test of endurance, but the high number of withdrawals also speaks to the individuality of the sport.
    

            Ultimately, the Olympics are symbolic, with no prize money or change in ranking. In the tennis world, the glory of an Olympic medal doesn’t rival the prestige – or purse – that comes with a Grand Slam trophy.
    

            “I think they recognize it would be really exciting and an honor to play for their country, but their mindset is really geared toward maintaining the ranking, climbing the rankings, maintaining sponsorships, getting sponsorships,” Greenwald said. “And the Olympics doesn’t offer that.”

CNN_22,What to watch at the gymnastics in Paris,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/sport/what-to-watch-olympics-gymnastics-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-27 18:09:00,world,"
            As competition gets well and truly underway in Paris, all eyes will turn shortly to one of the Olympic Games’ signature sports: Gymnastics.
    

            The sport has created some of the most iconic moments in Olympic history and made household names of its stars.
    

Among the top highlights of the first week, expect a raucous atmosphere at the Bercy Arena. Here’s what to watch:
    

            The leader of the gymnastics’ edition of the “Redeem Team” – originally used to describe the 2008 edition of Team USA’s men’s basketball team – is out for a little redemption herself.
    

Biles’ shocking case of “the twisties” in Tokyo three years ago was the standout story from the 2020 Olympic Games, putting a spotlight on mental health issues and reminding the world that even the sport’s greatest athlete can have a catastrophic moment on the world stage.
    

            Biles comes to Paris aiming to wash away the disappointment of that Games, and has been on an absolute tear heading into Paris. She’ll be debuting a new original element, to be named for her, on the uneven bars, looking for an edge in her weakest event.
    

            While her place as one of the greatest gymnasts in history is cemented, the 27-year-old can become the oldest American gymnast to win an Olympic medal in generations and lock in a legacy that will be hard to surpass.
    

            Biles’ teammate Suni Lee is also looking to do something that’s not been done in decades: Repeat as women’s all-around champion.
    

            When Biles withdrew from competition in Tokyo, Lee stepped up for Team USA and took home the gold with a stunning performance. She returns in Paris looking to match the feat of Czechoslovak gymnast Vera Caslavska in 1964 and 1968.
    

            For the last five Olympics, the all-around champion has been American – an impressive run in one of the Games’ most high-profile events.
    

            Lee, who battled a kidney condition last year that forced her out of competition for a spell, finished in fourth at the US Gymnastics Championships last month, her first time competing in the all-around competition since Tokyo.
    

            While Biles and Lee are competing against each other in Paris, the two will also be teammates in the team competition that gets underway on Tuesday.
    

            The Russian Olympic Committee took home the gold in the women’s all-around final in Tokyo and are usually one of the strongest teams.
    

            But this year no Russian gymnasts will compete as the country has been officially banned from the Paris Games – though a small number of Russians will compete under the banner of the Individual Neutral Athletes. They will not be allowed to wear their country’s colors or have their anthem played, should they win a medal.
    

            The Russian athletes in attendance will be closely watched. Ukrainian authorities have urged their athletes to not shake hands with any Russians and the geopolitics at play will likely affect their interactions with other athletes.
    

            The absence of Russian gymnasts – who decided as a group to not apply for individual neutral places – creates an opening for other nations. The US women’s team will look to capitalize, while Japan’s men’s team will seize an opening without one of their traditional rivals.
    

            In the men’s competition, Japan seeking to claim a fifth straight gold in the individual all-around competition.
    

            Daiki Hashimoto is also aiming to equal his countryman Kohei Uchimura’s accomplishments in London and Rio de Janeiro by winning his second straight all-around gold medal.
    

            The Japanese are enjoying a stretch of success that echoes their heyday in the middle part of the 20th century when they were constants on the podium.
    

            On the team side, Japan will be looking to head off the challenge of China – those two nations, plus Russia, have typically dominated the podium in the last two decades – and reclaim the team gold they narrowly lost in 2020. Japan had won the gold in Rio.
    

            Having swept the 2023 World Championships, Darja Varfolomeev is looking to assert her dominance on the Paris Games in her Olympic debut.
    

            Varfolomeev won five individual titles at last year’s World Championships, but there is only one individual gold up for grabs, the all-around title, in Paris. While the artistic gymnasts take the stage in the first week of the games, Varfolomeev is set to be one of the stars of the second week when the competition begins.
    

            Rhythmic gymnastics begins with qualification on August 8 and the final on August 9.
    

            Artistic gymnastics will take place from July 27 to August 5 in the City of Light, while rhythmic gymnastics will start on August 8.
    

            Gymnastics competitions will air in the US on NBC, USA Network and E! and stream on Peacock and NBC Olympics, with men’s qualification starting at 5 a.m. ET on July 27, and women’s qualification starting 3:30 a.m. ET on July 28.

CNN_23,"After Sonya Massey’s death, Springfield becomes the center of calls for racial justice. It’s not the first time",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/us/sonya-massey-springfield-1908-riot-reaj/index.html,2024-07-27 20:47:00,us,"
            On July 6, at St. John’s Hospital in Springfield, Illinois, Sonya Massey, a 36-year-old Black woman, died after being shot in her home by a White sheriff’s deputy.
    

            Nearly 116 years earlier, an 84-year-old Black man died in the same hospital after being lynched by a White mob.
    

            Both tragedies sparked calls for racial justice and now, as the nation’s attention once again turns to Springfield, local activists and historians say they hope Massey’s death will bring about change, just like the murder of the city’s Black residents did more than a century ago.
    

            Local newspapers captured the chaos that began in Springfield on August 14, 1908, when a mob gathered outside the county jail.
    

            Incensed by reports that a White woman had been raped by a Black man, the mob demanded the sheriff turn over the men accused of the crime.
    

            Earlier that day, The Illinois State Register urged “no effort should be spared to find the black viper and to force appropriate punishment,” and later that night, large parts of the state’s capital had been reduced to smoldering rubble.
    

            “The White community just erupted,” said Kathryn Harris, a retired director of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum who helped organize the centennial commemoration of the riots.
    

            “It started because a White woman cried rape by a Black man. Truth be told, when all the story came out, she had lied, but the riot had already taken place.”
    

            And the mob had left death and destruction in their wake.
    

            “Threats of lynching were heard on every hand,” the State Register reported. When the crowd learned the sheriff had already transported the two men accused of the assault out of the city, they enacted vengeance on its residents.
    

            “Fully 10,000 people gathered in the streets and watched the rioters in their work of destruction,” according to the Illinois State Journal.
    

            One of the rallying cries, Harris said, was, “‘Mr. Lincoln brought you here, and we’re going to run you out.’”
    

            As the White mob rampaged throughout the city, Black residents grabbed what belongings they could and fled on trains. The state’s National Guard was called in to help restore order and Harris said those who couldn’t escape took shelter in the city’s armory.
    

            But despite the presence of the National Guard, the riots continued for days, leaving multiple people dead and dozens injured. In the early hours of Saturday morning, the mob descended on a barbershop owned by a Black man named Scott Burton and lynched him.
    

            “The lynching was illuminated by the flames of the burning building directly opposite,” the Register reported. “Every building in that vicinity with the exception of … one or two others, was burned and the lynching was in the midst of this scene of complete havoc.”
    

            Later that night, the mob set its sights on William Donnegan, a shoemaker in his 80s who was once a conductor on the Underground Railroad, according to Illinois’ Historic Preservation Division.


            Donnegan’s wife was White and “this fact … seemed to carry the members of the mob to a higher pitch of anger,” The Journal of Springfield reported.
    

            The mob unsuccessfully attempted to lynch Donnegan and left him for dead. Police later cut Donnegan down and transported him to the St. John’s hospital, where he died from his injuries.
    

            “Interestingly enough, it was the same hospital where Ms. Massey died,” Harris said. “So, it makes for a very sad, cyclical story.”
    

            Weeks after the riot, Hallam signed a sworn statement that one of the men accused of the assault, “was not her assailant and (requested) his immediate release from Bloomington jail,” the Illinois State Register reported.
    

            William English Walling, a prominent White labor organizer, traveled from Chicago to Springfield to report on the riot. He described what he witnessed in an article titled “The Race War in the North.”
    

            “We have closed our eyes to the whole awful and menacing truth – that a large part of the white population of Lincoln’s home, supported largely by farmers and miners of the neighboring towns, have initiated a permanent warfare with the negro race,” he wrote.
    

            “Either the spirit of the abolitionists of Lincoln … must be revived and we must come to treat the negro on a plane of absolute political and social equality or … (we) will have soon transferred the race war to the North.”
    

            Months later, in response to the Springfield riot, a group of Black and White activists met at Walling’s apartment in New York City to discuss creating an organization that would advocate for the civil and political rights of African Americans across the country.
    

            On Feb. 12, 1909, in honor of Abraham Lincoln’s 100th birthday, the group released a nationwide “call” to address racial justice in the country. The letter was signed by a diverse group of nearly 60 people, including prominent Black leaders like Ida B. Wells and W.E.B. Du Bois.
    

            The Springfield race riot “was the final tipping point” that led to the founding of the NAACP.
    

            “After the 1908 race riots, people said enough is enough, not in our hometown,” said Teresa Haley, a lifelong Springfield resident and the former president of the Springfield chapter of the NAACP.
    

            Haley, who now leads Visions 1908, an organization dedicated to preserving the legacy and artifacts of the race riots, said the group has advocated for a national monument to be created in Springfield, to honor the events.
    

            As a student of history, Harris said when she learned of Massey’s killing, her thoughts quickly turned to the riots in 1908.
    

            It’s ironic, she said, that Springfield – which was the hometown of “The Great Emancipator” Abraham Lincoln – should once again find itself at the center of national conversations around racial justice in America.
    

             “We still have lots of work to do to improve race relations,” Harris said. “But we won’t give up.”
    

            Now, more than a century after the riots, as the nation learns new details about what happened to Sonya Massey in her home, Haley said she hopes the tragedy will renew efforts to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act and spark change, just like events in her city did over a century ago.
    

            “We want whole justice, but a lot of times we realize it’s just us out here fighting,” she said.

CNN_24,Who was behind the sabotage of France’s railway network? Here’s what we know,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/europe/france-train-attacks-explainer-2024-paris-olympics-intl/index.html,2024-07-27 20:24:00,world,"
            France is still facing travel disruption a day after saboteurs targeted high-speed railway lines in an attack coinciding with the start of the Olympics. As operators try to get service back to normal, a key question remains - who was responsible?
    

            Authorities are investigating what outgoing French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal called a “coordinated” effort. He said that intelligence services and internal security forces are involved in inquiries and urged caution over jumping to conclusions.
    

            French police will know “quite quickly who is responsible” for the attacks, the country’s Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said on Saturday. They recovered an “amount of evidence” following the operation, Darmanin told CNN affiliate France 2.
    

            No-one has yet claimed responsibility for the attacks, but given their scale, timing and precision, it is clear they are more than just random acts of vandalism.
    

            There are many possible culprits – the opening day of the Olympic Games is one of the most watched events in the world, a tempting target for anyone seeking to cause chaos and disruption in the limelight.
    

            Here’s what we know.
    

            High-speed trains connecting southwestern, northern and eastern regions of French were all impacted on Friday, in what authorities described as a methodical pattern of attacks hitting key arterial routes.
    

            The perpetrators have extensive knowledge of the network, according to Axel Persson, a leader of the CGT rail union. They must have had access to very “precise information,” he added.
    

            Authorities should not rule out industrial espionage, Persson told CNN on Friday, saying that a railway staffer, or someone who built the tracks including construction workers, could also be to blame.
    

            Employees had implemented a failsafe plan in preparation for the Olympics, allowing some passengers to use alternative lines that would slow down traffic, but at least travelers would get to their destination, Persson added. “France is disrupted but not paralyzed,” he said.
    

            Jean-Pierre Farandou, the CEO of state-owned rail company SNCF, told journalists that cables – which are there to ensure the security of train drivers – were set on fire and taken apart but again stressed authorities “don’t know who is behind it.”
    

            France is no stranger to widespread strikes or political demonstrations that manifest into blocked transport links across the country.
    

            The parliamentary election held just weeks ago attracted large scale protests and rallies. However, such events tend to be announced in advance and those behind them are keen to make their cause known.
    

            Environmental activists have previously blocked traffic to bring attention to the climate crisis. But these groups have mostly staged bold and striking demonstrations focused on fossil-fuel intensive transportation, such as on airports and highways, and also make it known when they are behind such protests.
    

            The attacks could also have been an act of civil disobedience. An intelligence source told CNN that services pointed out “these methods have been used by the far left in the past,” but said that “there is no evidence to tie today’s actions to them.”
    

            The last major act of vandalism on high-speed train lines in France was in 2008, when steel rods were placed on overhead power cables. Police arrested individuals from an alleged anarchist group from Tarnac village but 10 years later, after a lengthy investigation, they were all acquitted and cleared of sabotage.
    

            Recently, France has been one of several countries impacted by a wave of suspected Russian sabotage attacks against infrastructure and other targets.

            French President Emmanuel Macron has remained a staunch ally of Kyiv throughout the fighting. Just in May, he suggested that Ukraine should be allowed to use their weapons against targets inside Russia from which the Kremlin attacks Ukraine.
    

            Earlier this week, French authorities detained a Russian citizen in Paris, accusing him of preparing destabilizing events during the Games. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia did not have any information on the arrest.
    

            Ahead of the Games, Dale Buckner, CEO of the security firm Global Guardian, told CNN France has “a lot of enemies” due to its stance on a wide range of international and domestic issues, singling out cyber attacks as one of the greatest threats.
    

            CNN has previously reported on a host of suspected Russian attacks across Europe. Russia has not admitted to any of them and did not respond to a CNN request for comment.

CNN_25,What we know about the Sinaloa cartel and its leaders,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/us/sinaloa-cartel-history-leaders/index.html,2024-07-27 21:26:00,us,"
            The arrests of two top alleged leaders of Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel are an “enormous blow” to the group accused of being responsible for most drugs “killing Americans from coast to coast”, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration says.
    

            Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, the cartel’s alleged co-founder, and Joaquin Guzman Lopez, son of former boss Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, were arrested Thursday by US authorities in El Paso, Texas.
    

            They face several charges for allegedly leading the criminal operations of what is considered one of world’s most powerful and deadly drug trafficking operations.
    

            Here’s what we know about the Sinaloa cartel’s decades-long operations, impact and key players:
    

            The Sinaloa cartel, named after the Mexican state where it was formed, is one of the oldest and most established drug trafficking groups in Mexico. It has long supplied much of the marijuana, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and fentanyl peddled on US streets, according to a Congressional Research Service report.


            In the early 2010s, estimates indicated the cartel controlled roughly 40% to 60% of Mexico’s drug trade, earning as much as $3 billion annually, the CRS report said.
    

            It was founded in the late 1980s and led by El Chapo, who twice escaped from Mexican prisons before being detained by Mexican authorities in Sinaloa in 2016. He was extradited to the US the following year and is serving a life sentence in US federal prison.
    

            The cartel has been blamed for having a key role in the drug war that plagued Mexico for years, leaving tens of thousands of people dead, as well as contributing to the ongoing high levels of violence across the country.
    

            Since Guzman’s imprisonment in the US, experts believe the cartel has faced several challenges after breaking into factions – including some led by Zambada and Guzman’s sons – and with the rise of rival cartels.
    

            The Sinaloa cartel was formerly led by El Chapo Guzman, who infamously eluded authorities while expanding the organization’s drug trafficking operation across the world. In the process, he became the topic of numerous best-selling books and TV shows.

            El Chapo initially escaped from a Mexican prison in 2001, reportedly hiding in a laundry basket, and again in 2015 through a tunnel. After he was recaptured in 2016, he was extradited to the US, where he was convicted on federal drug conspiracy and various trafficking charges in 2019.
    

            Zambada, 76, is considered the last of the old-school Mexican drug capos. A longtime associate of Guzman, he’s allegedly led transportation operations, employing people to secure “warehouses to import and store narcotics, and ‘sicarios,’ or hit men, to carry out kidnappings and murders in Mexico to retaliate against rivals who threatened the cartel,” according to the Justice Department.
    

            In February, the US charged Zambada with conspiring to manufacture and distribute fentanyl.


            Guzman Lopez and his brothers, known as “Los Chapitos,” have allegedly led one of the three main factions of the cartel since their father’s imprisonment. He and his brother, Ovidio Guzman Lopez, are believed to have inherited relationships and narcotics proceeds after one of their brother’s death, leading them to invest in marijuana, cocaine and ephedrine from Mexico, Colombia and Argentina, according to the Justice Department. At some point, Guzman Lopez oversaw methamphetamine labs, selling wholesale in Sinaloa and to distributors in the US and Canada.
    

            The Sinaloa cartel is known for trafficking wholesale amounts of fentanyl, heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana, according to the DEA. The group has distribution hubs in several cities across the US, controlling the smuggling corridors in Arizona and California. The group also allegedly runs fentanyl labs in Mexico.

            It is one of two cartels that has used its control of the fentanyl trade to develop sophisticated money-laundering techniques that exploit cryptocurrency, according to US officials.
    

            In one case, the cartel laundered more than $869,000 using cryptocurrency between August 2022 and February 2023, according to a US indictment unsealed last year.
    

            The DEA says most of the fentanyl that enters the US comes from ingredients made in China that are then pressed into pills – or packed in powder – and smuggled in from Mexico by drug cartels.
    

            The men boarded a plane in Mexico and were arrested when it landed near El Paso, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN. Zambada believed they were inspecting property in the Mexican side of the US border and was not aware Guzman Lopez was helping US investigators, the official said.
    

            Samuel González, a legal expert and former chief of Mexico’s anti-drug unit, told CNN the potentially deceptive circumstances of the arrest could reflect possible negotiations between Guzman Lopez and his brother Ovidio, who was extradited to the US last year and is facing drug and money laundering charges.
    

            “If Ovidio had not surrendered, Mayo (Zambada) would not have fallen either,” González said.
    

            The arrests on Thursday have raised concerns about what the future of the cartel will be and the potential for increased violence in Mexico.
    

            Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute who covers drug markets and counternarcotic policies, told CNN the arrests will most certainly lead to increased violence since Zambada was known to, at times, broker deals with criminal groups to avoid it.
    

            “Among all the drug bosses, he was the most cool-headed,” Felbab-Brown said.
    

            Some experts say internal fighting may result in the downfall of the Sinaloa cartel, but Felbab-Brown warned that other Mexican cartels stand ready to take their place, including the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG).
    

            “This would have very complicated ripple effects across global drug markets,” Felbab-Brown said of the Sinaloa cartel’s potential downfall, “but as long as there is (CJNG), we will end up with a drug market on our doorstep that’s run by a much more vicious, much nastier, much less restrained group than the current one.”

CNN_26,Missing Henry VIII portrait spotted on X by eagle-eyed art historian,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/style/henry-viii-portrait-spotted-gbr-scli-intl/index.html,2024-07-27 21:17:00,world,"
            An art historian has identified a missing portrait of King Henry VIII after spotting it on social media.
    

            British fine art researcher Adam Busiakiewicz was idly scrolling on X when he was stopped in his tracks by a post from somebody he follows.
    

            The post was a photograph shared by Tim Cox, the Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire – an honorary position representing the British Crown in the central English county. It showed a gathering at a reception in Warwick’s Shire Hall, where Warwickshire County Council is based.
    

            But Busiakiewicz wasn’t interested in the people smiling at the camera. His focus was on the background where, hanging on a wall, was what he suspected was a missing portrait of the Tudor monarch Henry VIII.
    

            In a post published on his blog earlier this month, Busiakiewicz said he had been “scrolling at speed” when he spotted the painting “with a distinctive arched top” on the wall.
    

            He was immediately reminded of a series of 22 portraits commissioned by a local politician and tapestry-maker during the 1590s.
    

            According to Busiakiewicz, Ralph Sheldon commissioned the pictures – which were mostly of kings, queens and “significant contemporary international figures” – to hang in his home, Weston House in Warwickshire. The reason they had arched tops was because they “were once incorporated into an architectural frieze of the Long Gallery at Weston,” Busiakiewicz said.
    

            In a press release sent to CNN, Busiakiewicz said the arched top was a “special feature of the Sheldon set,” while the painting’s frame was “identical to other surviving examples.”
    

            The painting also showed the king holding a sword and wearing a feathered hat – just as he appeared in an engraving of the Long Hall made by antiquarian Henry Shaw in 1839.

            The series of portraits was later dispersed at auction and “the majority remain untraced to this day,” according to Busiakiewicz.
    

            After making his theory public, Busiakiewicz visited Warwick’s Shire Hall together with local historian Aaron Manning to see the painting close up. “The portrait is large, and completely in-line with the other Sheldon portraits,” Busiakiewicz wrote in a later blog post, on July 22.
    

            In a telephone call with CNN, Busiakiewicz revealed that this was not the first discovery he had made thanks to social media. In 2018, he stumbled across a picture a friend had taken at a wedding and posted on Instagram. It featured a portrait that he identified as the work of 17th-century female artist Joan Carlile.
    

            “Social media is a crazy thing,” Busiakiewicz told CNN, “because some people use it to watch cat videos and follow what’s going on in the world, and then people like me just look at what people have hanging on their walls.”

            A spokesperson for Warwickshire County Council told CNN in an email that Busiakiewicz and Manning approached them about the painting and arranged to come and see it.
    

            “Adam and Aaron viewed the painting at Shire Hall, and have confirmed they think it is definitely one of the Ralph Sheldon commissions,” the spokesperson wrote.
    

            “Since this discovery, the painting has been moved into our Museum Collections Centre to allow further research to take place.”
    

            Busiakiewicz told CNN that the identity of the painter is not known, but the creator of the portraits is “sometimes referred to as The Sheldon Master.”
    

            He is now working on trying to establish the painting’s provenance. It was acquired by the council as recently as 1951 but there are gaps in the records.
    

            “Provenance is always such a really tricky thing - it’s very hard sometimes to find, particularly when pictures are sold privately. But there’s no doubt that this is Ralph Sheldon’s painting of Henry VIII,” he said.
    

            “Looking at paintings and pictures of paintings is my life and it’s great fun, particularly when you can in some way right a historic wrong, let’s say. Pictures that are overlooked, pictures that aren’t appreciated as much as they might be.”

CNN_27,Harris’ team rejects Israeli notion that her comments could harm ceasefire talks,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/harris-team-netanyahu-meeting-reaction/index.html,2024-07-27 22:10:00,politics,"
            Vice President Kamala Harris’ office on Friday is rejecting a suggestion from a senior Israeli official that the vice president’s remarks on Thursday that forcefully criticized Israel’s conduct in its war against Hamas could have made a ceasefire deal harder to reach.
    

            “I don’t know what they’re talking about,” a Harris aide told CNN, in response to a senior Israeli official being quoted in The Times of Israel: “Hopefully the remarks Harris made in her press conference won’t be interpreted by Hamas as daylight between the US and Israel, thereby making a deal harder to secure.”
    

            Harris declared that she would “not be silent” about the suffering in Gaza amid the war after her meeting with Netanyahu. She also said that Israel has a right to defend itself but “how it does so matters,” staking out her lane as an empathetic and strong voice for the Palestinian suffering, just days after she became the presumptive Democratic nominee for president.
    

            But the vice president’s office on Friday sought to clarify that her message to Netanyahu behind closed doors mirrored that of Biden.
    

            “President Biden and Vice President Harris delivered the same message in their private meetings to Prime Minister Netanyahu: it is time to get the ceasefire and hostage deal done,” an aide to the vice president told reporters, adding that the meeting was “serious and collegial.”
    

            Harris has already made some public comments about the ongoing Israel-Hamas war that had a similar tone to her remarks after the Netanyahu meeting on Thursday. She emphasized the need for an “immediate ceasefire” in March, taking a long pause before adding the rest of the approved sentence: “for at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table.”
    

            Harris’s office pointed out that her comments on Thursday “tracked with her previous comments on the conflict.”
    

            “She started with rock-solid support for Israel and then she expressed her concern about civilian causalities and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, as she always does,” said the aide, responding to reporters’ questions.
    

            But her comments marked the first time that she spoke about the conflict since becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee as she is faced with the challenge of defining her position on the politically charged issue of the Israel-Hamas war.
    

            Her remarks on Thursday were not a major surprise to some administration officials who have been privy to her team’s views in interagency meetings.
    

            Multiple US officials say that Harris’ team has often advocated for putting more pressure on Israel during interagency conversations over the course of recent months since October 7. For example, Harris’s aides have been advocates for sanctions on violent Israeli settlers in the West Bank, one source said.
    

            Harris’s aides have also opposed the idea of possible low-level engagement with far-right members of Netanyahu’s Cabinet – such as Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir – making the case that engagement would be elevating their views, one official said. So far, the Biden administration has decided against reaching out to them.
    

            Biden administration officials acknowledged that there might be some tension in the coming weeks as Harris develops her voice and her policy on the Israel-Hamas war. She has created that tension within the administration in the past on this issue. But now, they say that the tension could be worth it, given the ultimate goal of trying to draw in voters as she is at the top of the Democratic presidential ticket.
    

            “She’s not substantively different than the president, but she’s tonally different,” one administration source told CNN.
    

            A close friend familiar with Harris’ views expected “zero” chance she would break with Biden on policy, while acknowledging the opportunity for her to introduce more nuance, especially now that she’s the party’s candidate. “She’s allowed to support Israel but also want the war to end.”
    

            Arab American leaders say that throughout the course of the Israel-Hamas war, Harris’ team has been “much more responsive” to the frustrations of their community when it comes to the Biden administration’s policies.
    

            “Harris and her office threw us a lifeline early on,” Dr. James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute. “I spoke with her and she demonstrated compassion and empathy. She wanted to know what she could do to be responsive to our concerns.”

CNN_28,Kamala Harris praised ‘defund the police’ movement in June 2020 radio interview,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/kfile-kamala-harris-praised-defund-the-police-movement-in-june-2020/index.html,2024-07-27 22:15:00,politics,"
            Vice President Kamala Harris voiced support for “defund the police” in a radio interview in June 2020 amidst nationwide protests for police reform, just months before denouncing the movement after she had joined the Biden presidential campaign.
    

            Harris said in the June radio interview the movement “rightly” called out the amount of money spent on police departments instead of community services such as education, housing, and healthcare, emphasizing that more police did not equate to more public safety.
    

            “This whole movement is about rightly saying, we need to take a look at these budgets and figure out whether it reflects the right priorities,” Harris said on a New York-based radio program “Ebro in the Morning” on June 9, 2020, adding that US cities were “militarizing police” but “defunding public schools.”

            Harris made her comments just weeks after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer galvanized the “defund” movement among progressive activists. At the time, Harris was six months removed from ending her own presidential campaign and was still two months away from being tapped as Joe Biden’s vice presidential nominee.
    

            In an interview a day earlier, Harris also lauded Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti for his decision to slash $150 million from the police budget and move it into social services.

The latest on the 2024 campaign


            As Harris works to replace Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee following his decision to drop out of the 2024 race, the newly unearthed interview could complicate her strategy of highlighting her history as a tough on crime prosecutor in a potential matchup against Donald Trump, who is facing numerous legal challenges, including multiple felony convictions.


            Before she was elected to the Senate in 2016, Harris spent seven years as the district attorney in San Francisco before serving as California’s attorney general for six years.
    

            Mitch Landrieu, national co-chair for the Biden-Harris campaign and former mayor of New Orleans, on Friday walked back Harris’ 2020 statements, saying Harris meant that she supports being “tough and smart on crime.”
    

            “Her position has always been that you can both be tough and smart on crime, and it requires funding police, but it also requires funding rehabilitation and things that might criminal justice system safer. You can do both,” Landrieu told CNN’s Pamela Brown on “The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.”
    

            “Our actions indicate that she wants to fund the police, but she wants to do the other things as well,” Landrieu said.
    

            After June 2020, Harris rarely if at all mentioned the “defund the police” movement. The Biden campaign later tried to clarify after adding her to the ticket that she supported funding the police.
    

            But in June 2020, Harris argued the “defund” movement was correct to examine police budgets, and also talked about police departments needing to be demilitarized.
    

            “We need to have this conversation and critically examine and understand this is not working,” Harris said on “Ebro in the Morning.” “It’s not working. So, this is an important conversation and not just a conversation – cause to your earlier point, can’t just be about talk. It has to be about forcing change.”
    

            “And this is why, you know, I was out there with folks and we’ll, any movement, any progress we have gained has been because people took to the streets,” Harris added.
    

            A day before her “Ebro in the Morning” radio interview, Harris appeared on MSNBC where she explicitly called to “demilitarize police departments” and said it was “backward” to think more police officers created more safety.
    

            “Part of what we have to do here is also look at the militarization of police departments and, and the kind of money that is going to that. And we need to demilitarize police departments,” Harris said. “At its core, one of the issues that I think we should all agree on is that it is old thinking. It is outdated and is actually wrong and backward to think that more police officers will create more safety.”
    

            In another interview on “The View” on June 8, 2020, Harris engaged in an exchange on defunding the police where she directly suggested the funding for police could be used in other social programs.
    

            “In many cities in America, over one third of their city budget goes to police. So, we have to have this conversation. What are we doing? What about the money going to social services? What about the money going to helping people with job training? What about helping with the mental health issues that communities are being plagued with for which we’re putting no resources?”
    

            Also on June 8, 2020, Harris praised the mayor of Los Angeles for removing money from police and investing it in social services in an interview on “Good Morning America. “
    

            “I applaud Eric Garcetti for doing what he’s done,” she said.
    

            In the same interview, Harris added she didn’t support “getting rid” of police.
    

            “We have to be practical about this,” she said.
    

            At the time “defund the police” became a rallying cry for protestors, with some arguing that police departments should be abolished altogether. Others, like Harris, framed it as a means of questioning spending on police budgets and investing more in areas like education, mental health services, and affordable housing as essential for creating safer communities.
    

            “Defund the police, the issue behind it is that we need to reimagine how we are creating safety,” Harris said in the June 2020 radio interview. “And when you have many cities that have one third of their entire city budget focused on policing, we know that is not the smart way and the best way or the right way to achieve safety.”
    

            “For too long, the status quo thinking has been, you get more safety by putting more cops on the street,” Harris added. “Well, that’s wrong, because by the way, if you wanna look at upper middle class suburban neighborhoods, they don’t have that patrol car.”

            Harris, citing suburban communities, said that true safety comes from well-funded schools, homeownership, thriving small businesses, and access to health services – not increased police presence.
    

            Despite the nationwide movement, polling showed reducing police budgets remained heavily unpopular, even in 2020. A Pew Research poll found that just 25% of adults supported reducing police budgets that year and, by 2021, that support had decreased to 15%, with 47% of adults supporting more police spending.
    

            After Harris was selected as Biden’s running mate in August 2020, the Biden campaign tried to make it clear she opposed defunding the police – and said she supported increasing police funding.
    

            “Joe Biden and Kamala Harris do not support defunding the police, and it is a lie to suggest otherwise,” Sabrina Singh, Harris’ then-press secretary said in October 2020. “Throughout her career, Sen. Harris has supported increasing funding to police departments and boosting funding for community policing.”
    

            According to a POLITICO-Morning Consult poll published in mid-June 2020, almost 60% of registered voters supported major reforms or a complete overhaul to police departments in 2020, but only 29% backed the “defund the police” movement.
    

            Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee at the time of the protests in the summer of 2020,  made clear repeatedly throughout his campaign that he opposed the “defund” movement – saying he supported increasing spending for both police and social services.
    

            In a joint interview on ABC News from August 2020 featuring both Biden and Harris, Biden answered the question on whether the campaign supported the “defund the police” movement.
    

            “I don’t want to defund police departments. I think they need more help. The vast majority of the police – they’re ashamed of what they saw,” Biden said in reference to the Floyd murder. “But you have to take action and it has to be national.”
    

            Harris’ record as a prosecutor was heavily scrutinized during her failed 2020 presidential campaign. Harris was known for her “smart on crime” approach, initiatives like truancy prosecution, and the creation of the “Back on Track” program for first-time drug offenders.
    

            She also defended the death penalty as California attorney general, opposed a statewide ballot measure to legalize marijuana, and pushed for higher bails for certain gun charges as district attorney.

CNN_29,Why do women’s haircuts cost more than men’s?,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/business/haircut-women-men-more-expensive/index.html,2024-07-27 22:30:00,us,"
            It’s a situation familiar to many women: They go to the hair salon for a cut and spend a small fortune, while their male partners, brothers, uncles, and guy friends spend considerably less in the barbershop, or in the same salon. 


            But are women really paying more for the same service? Can any differences in price be justified? Or is this another example of a “pink tax,” where products and services targeted at women cost more than those targeted at men for no discernible reason?
    

            The available data certainly lends credence to many women’s frustrations.
    

            Last year, the average cost for a standard women’s haircut was $51.71 compared with $34.56 for a men’s haircut across the United States, according to transaction data provided exclusively to CNN by Square, a payment systems provider. The cheapest women’s haircut could be found in South Dakota for $31.43 — almost one and a half times more than the $21.59 paid by men for their cheapest haircut, also in that state.
    

            Across the pond, the data is also pretty, ahem, clear-cut.
    

            In 2020, a survey of UK consumers by YouGov found that women paid an average of £31.99 ($40.80) for a basic haircut, which may include a wash and blow dry. That’s more than twice the average £12.17 (£15.50) paid by men for the same or similar service.
    

            Over the course of a year, women typically pay £135 ($172) for haircuts, while the average man spends £70 ($89), according to YouGov’s calculations. “While women tend to get their hair cut less frequently, this is still not enough to offset the difference in prices paid,” Matthew Smith, head of data journalism at YouGov, wrote at the time.
    

            Still, much like a keratin-conditioned two-tone balayage: it’s complicated.
    

            There are a potentially infinite number of haircuts, colorings and treatments offered by scores of hair salons and barbershops. And these businesses employ people with varying levels of skill and training to work on customers with a huge range of hair textures and lengths.
    

            There is also huge variation in the type of experience customers seek, according to Fred Jones, legal counsel at the Professional Beauty Federation of California, a trade b﻿ody which, since the pandemic, has expanded to represent haircare businesses and workers across all states.
    

            “You have the high-end (service) where it’s a half-day experience and there’s champagne, bubbly, all the way down to just ‘give me a quick cut, I’m in here for 15 minutes then I’m gone,” he told CNN.
    

            That heterogeneity makes it “really difficult to tease out” whether women are paying higher prices simply because of their gender, said Jones.
    

            “Nobody has an interest in our industry to discriminate… if the reputation gets out that your salon discriminates on any basis, it’s going to hurt your bottom line,” he added.  


            Tara Farmer, an editor at Fash, a site connecting consumers with local businesses across the US, cites differences in the typical hair length as a major reason pushing prices for women higher than those for men.
    

            “Women’s haircuts typically take more time than men’s cuts and often involve working with longer hair and using additional styling products, tools, and techniques,” Farmer wrote in a January report into the issue.
    

            That report found the average cost of a women’s haircut ranging between $45 and $75 across the country, while men’s toggled between $25 and $50, though it did not specify whether the typical women’s haircut included extra services such as a blow dry.
    

            Additional services such as coloring can easily push prices into triple digits. The average cost of balayage highlights — a natural-looking style of coloring that concentrates the dye toward the tips — was $175 in 2022, according to Fash data.
    

            Caroline Larissey, chief executive of the National Hair & Beauty Federation (NHBF), a UK trade body, told CNN that women are more likely than men to ask for such additional services. “Ladies generally have shampoo, condition, treatment as well as a cut and blow dry, whereas gents that go into a barbers will often have a dry haircut,” she said.
    

            Even so, in general, women are still being charged about two-and-a-half times more than men for an equivalent haircut, according to Larissey. Yet there are “pockets” of the industry that have started charging customers based on time spent in the chair, she added, rather than delineating by gender — a move the NHBF has actively encouraged.
    

            “We have to adapt as an industry,” Larissey said.
    

            Kristin Rankin, a hairstylist based in New York City, thinks we should scrap gender-based pricing entirely. “When you go to cosmetology school to become a hair stylist, you learn to how to cut hair,” they told CNN. “This fallacy of learning how to cut men’s hair (versus) women’s hair is ridiculous.”
    

            In 2016, Rankin founded the Dresscode Project, a non-profit that trains hairstylists and hair salon owners to create environments that affirm people’s gender identity, which, in many cases, will not fit into the binary categories of “man” or “woman.”
    

            Two ways to do that, they said, is to charge clients based on the length of their hair, or the time it takes to cut. “(Gender-based pricing) creates an atmosphere where it makes it much easier to misgender people” which can have “a huge psychological impact,” Rankin added.
    

            Goldie x Bob is one such hair salon that, five years ago, threw out its gender-based price list. Now, “the client is paying for the time and the expertise, and it has nothing to do with gender,” said Liz Burns, founder of the Denver-based salon.
    

            Cuts for short hair are automatically booked for an hour, “but if it only takes 30 minutes, then (the client) only pays for 30 minutes. There’s no flat rate,” Ashlie Heath, the salon’s manager, told CNN.
    

            Before the switch, Goldie x Bob charged men with short hair an average of $60 for a basic wash and haircut. Women were typically charged $85 for a similar service.
    

            The difference, Burns told CNN, was explained by the fact that her female clients typically had longer hair that required blow drying and took more time to style. Clients with hair sitting close to the head — which are most often men — need less styling and usually don’t mind leaving it to dry naturally, she said.  


            But “it felt stale and old-fashioned to keep going in that direction,” said Burns, adding that the move to gender-neutral pricing was an attempt to “promote inclusivity and fairness.” She has noticed an uptick in the number of men and non-binary customers visiting the salon since the switch, she said.
    

            Rankin, at the Dresscode Project, would surely approve. “Hair has no gender at all,” they said. “It is literally dead cells on the top of your head.”

CNN_30,"At least 30 killed in an Israeli airstrike on a school in Gaza, Palestinian officials say",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/israel-gaza-deir-al-balah-school-intl/index.html,2024-07-27 22:38:00,world,"
            At least 30 people have been killed and over 100 injured in an Israeli airstrike on a school in Deir-al Balah, central Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.
    

            The Israeli military it had launched the strike in order to destroy a Hamas command and control center inside the compound.
    

            Most of the victims from the school arriving to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the aftermath of the attack were women and children, according to Dr. Khalil Al-Daqran, a spokesperson for the hospital. More than 4,000 displaced people were housed in the school, the Palestinian Civil Defense said.
    

            The strike came soon after Israeli’s military issued fresh evacuation orders further south, in the city of Khan Younis, where Israel launched a fresh offensive earlier in the week which has killed dozens of Palestinians.
    

            Residents in southern neighborhoods were told to leave after being warned that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would “forcefully operate” in the area.
    

            Fighting has been ongoing on Gaza for months, and the renewed offensive shows Israel’s challenges in achieving its goal of eliminating Hamas. Israel said that about 100 militants had been killed during recent fighting.
    

            The United Nations estimated that about 150,000 people fled Khan Younis on Monday alone, intensifying pressure on meager supplies of food and water, and places to seek shelter.

            Signaling another campaign was imminent, the IDF wrote on Telegram it was “about to forcefully operate against the terrorist organizations and therefore calls on the remaining population left in the southern neighborhoods of Khan Yunis to temporarily evacuate to the adjusted Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi.”
    

            The statement said the move was in retaliation to “significant terrorist activity and rocket fire” emanating from southern Khan Younis. It added that the location previously defined as a humanitarian area “will be adjusted.”
    

            Al-Mawasi has come under repeated Israeli attacks, including a strike on July 14 which reportedly killed 90 people and injured 300 more.
    

            An eyewitness in Khan Younis told CNN that she was “woken up by the screams” of people as they fled the area following the evacuation order, saying she heard explosions and saw flares in the sky.
    

            Scenes filmed by CNN in Khan Younis show people fleeing by car, motorbike, and donkey cart with all of their belongings. “I am looking for a place to stay. I don’t know where to go,” said one man.
    

            Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza on October 7 after Hamas attacked southern Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted, according to Israeli authorities.
    

            Israeli military action in Gaza has since killed 39,258 Palestinians and injured another 90,589, according to the Ministry of Health there. As of early July, nearly 2 million people had been displaced in Gaza – almost the entire population, according to figures from the UN.
    

            Aid agencies working in Gaza have warned previously that new rounds of evacuation orders are making the delivery of emergency rations even more difficult.
    

            “People in Gaza are exhausted, living in inhumane conditions, with no safety at all,” the UN Relief and Works Agency posted on X on Monday.
    

            On Thursday, the IDF said it had recovered the bodies of five Israeli hostages the previous day from a tunnel in an area of Khan Younis which it had previously designated as a “humanitarian area.”
    

            Despite the fighting, US and Israeli officials expressed optimism this week over the possibility of a ceasefire and hostage deal being reached.
    

            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that the different parties are “inside the 10-yard line and driving toward the goal line.”
    

            Negotiations are set to resume in Rome on Sunday, two sources familiar with the meeting told CNN.
    

            The US team will be led by CIA Director Bill Burns, who will be joined by his counterparts from Qatar, Egypt, and Israel.
    

            Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Washington this week and met with the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, who urged him to seal an agreement.
    

            “As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done,” said Harris. “So to everyone who has been calling for a ceasefire, and to everyone who yearns for peace, I see you and I hear you.”

CNN_32,These bars are making delicious cocktails — with none of the alcohol,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/us/sober-bars-mocktails-alcohol-free-wellness-cec/index.html,2024-07-27 23:30:00,us,"
            Every Friday, when Chris Marshall opens his bar, he gets the same customer request: Alcohol, please.
    

            And every time someone asks for a vodka tonic or another familiar well drink, he has to gently remind them that his bar, Sans Bar, serves no alcohol.
    

            “I can definitely help you with the tonic, not so much the vodka,” he said.
    

            So he’ll hand them a menu, where there are classic cocktail riffs and unlikelier combinations. There’s a “nada colada,” which mimics the tropical taste of a piña colada but with a photogenic infusion of alcohol-free blue curacao syrup. A newer addition of which Marshall is particularly proud, the Burnet lush, samples the garden, combining chlorophyll, asparagus brine, lemon juice and botanicals for something springy.
    

            But at Sans Bar in Austin, Texas, the cocktails aren’t the star. The customers are.
    

            “We make it about the experience and connection, not the drinks,” he said. “I mean, the drinks are amazing. But so much of what it means to be a bar is to be a place where people meet.”
    

            Marshall is a member of a small class of sober bar owners who want to upend the idea that bars are exclusively places where alcohol is served. He and other sober bar impresarios believe bars should be community hubs where you can have fun without imbibing anything alcoholic.
    

            And as the non-alcoholic beverage market steadily grows, so have sober bars. They operate in New York and Los Angeles, in Orlando and Sacramento, Atlanta and Omaha. And they’re steadily growing their base of customers, including those who still drink but are exploring sobriety and people in recovery from substance use, by redefining what a bar can be.
    

            “As much as it’s a bar, I try to treat it like a classroom, where we’re learning how to socialize without alcohol,” Marshall said.
    

            A sober bar usually looks and feels like any other. It might be upscale and minimalist or divey and lived-in. There may be handles lined up behind the bar but these bottles are zero-proof. Sober bars serve beers and wines that are non-alcoholic (though they can sometimes contain up to 0.5% ABV, or alcohol by volume, the Food and Drug Administration’s threshold for a beverage to still be considered non-alcoholic). And then there are the cocktails with all the trimmings but none of the liquor.
    

            Many sober bars also serve coffee or drinks made with CBD or kava, a psychoactive root that, when consumed, can produce some mild sedative effects.
    

            Marshall, though, refuses to serve coffee at Sans Bar, which is only open on Fridays from 6 p.m. to midnight.
    

            “A coffee shop is a place to meet friends,” he said. “A bar is a place where you can meet strangers.”
    

            That social principle is what convinced Abby Ehmann, who already owned a bar in New York’s East Village, to open up a sober joint across the street.
    

            Bars have always been, first and foremost, gathering places. Ehmann’s first bar, Lucky, quickly turned into a beloved neighborhood joint with regulars who started showing up not just to drink, but to enjoy weekly game nights, live music and each other’s company.
    

            Ehmann isn’t sober herself, but she “felt pretty strongly that people who don’t drink alcohol deserve a place to socialize that’s comfortable and welcoming.” Their own Lucky.
    

            So in 2022, Ehmann opened Hekate, a “café and elixir lounge,” which serves both Instagrammable mocktails and casual cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon in a skinny, dimly lit room. Hekate is completely alcohol free (and so is the PBR).
    

            It’s not always easy to convince people to open up to each other without the “social lubricant” of alcohol, Ehmann said. So she built a bar that facilitates intimacy — most of the seating is up at the bar, and customers are encouraged to work with their bartenders to whip up a personalized drink that could end up on the seasonal menu.
    

            “To me, an ideal bar is long and narrow, so you have to walk by everyone in order to go to the bathroom,” Ehmann said. “The foot traffic allows for more mingling.”
    

            At Hekate, she serves all kinds of customers, most of them sober. There are people who are sober for the moment — she’s hosted several baby showers there — or sober for religious reasons. “Sober October” and “Dry January” are busy months, naturally, but many of those temporarily sober folks keep coming back all year.
    

            “It’s easy to come in for a spell,” said Lux Heljardóttir, a rune reader who frequents Hekate. “Three minutes, if you let it, easily becomes three hours and you’ll leave happier than you entered.”
    

            The witchy vibe, eclectic menu and amiable regulars have drawn Dylan Kapit into Hekate around once a week this summer. Though they’re partial to the non-alcoholic beers and wines, their current drink of choice is a liquor-free gin and tonic.
    

            “As a sober person, it is amazing to have a chill place that I can go where I can hang out and order mocktails without any judgment,” Kapit told CNN.
    

            Sober bars are finding their footing in part due to the growing sober-curious movement.
    

            People are becoming increasingly conscious of the deleterious effects that drinking can have on their mental and physical health. Even if they’re not struggling with substance use, they might start limiting their alcohol intake or changing the way they socialize, becoming sober-curious, said author Ruby Warrington, who coined the term in 2016.
    

            “People have realized that you don’t have to have a ‘drinking problem’ for drinking to be a problem for them,” Warrington, who also wrote a book called “Sober Curious,” told CNN.
    

            Not all Americans are drinking less, but alcohol is becoming less popular among young people, around whom many bar owners build their businesses. In a Gallup poll published last August, 62% of adults under 35 said that they drink alcohol — down 10 percentage points from 20 years earlier.
    

            Another Gallup survey from last August found that among the people who choose not to drink, almost one-fourth of them said that they didn’t really have a reason — they just didn’t want to. Other reasons for avoiding alcohol included disliking it, believing it could harm their health and fearing the consequences of consumption, among others.

            “Alcohol is definitely having, and has had, a cigarette moment since at least 2016,” Marshall said. “We’re coming up on a decade of people really evaluating alcohol’s place in our life. And it’s just no longer accepted that people consume a bunch of alcohol to have a good time.”
    

            For many sober-curious people, thinking more critically about their drinking means giving non-alcoholic cocktails and canned beverages a chance.
    

            Many of the people who seek out alcohol alternatives are more sober-curious than strictly sober. In 2022, Nielsen IQ reported that 82% of people who buy non-alcoholic drinks are still buying beverages that contain alcohol.
    

            “This is more of a health movement than it is a sobriety movement,” he said. “And that’s what’s really exciting about it. I think (drinking) has become a public health issue.”
    

            And the service industry is catching on. Even five years ago, it was rare for restaurants or bars to devote a section of their menu to non-alcoholic cocktails, said Ian Blessing, a former sommelier at the Michelin-starred Napa Valley restaurant The French Laundry.
    

            Then, he said “most non-alcoholic cocktails were simple mixtures of fruit juice, soda, and syrup,” he said. Customers unfamiliar with non-alcoholic innovations may still shudder when they hear the word “mocktail,” reminded of the sickeningly sugary Shirley Temples of yore.
    

            That perception is shifting, though, he said, thanks to the increasing availability of — and demand for — non-alcoholic spirits, botanicals, bitters and other essential ingredients. (Blessing and his wife, also a former sommelier, have released their own line of alcohol-free bitters, All the Bitter, marketed to customers sober or otherwise.) Even full-liquor bars are investing in well-crafted mocktails.

Dry January is over, but are ‘sober drinks’ a healthy way to keep it going?


            “This is the best time in history to be sober because there are so many options,” Ehmann said.
    

            When she opened Hekate, she said, she feared she’d have to make all the drink components herself, but she gets free samples of new products now every week.
    

            “There are over a hundred (non-alcoholic) beers alone that are so delicious that you don’t feel like you’re denying yourself anything,” she said.
    

            Still, it can take some convincing for people to try a non-alcoholic drink even at a bar where liquor isn’t served. Mi-Ya Mata of Dry Spokes in Omaha said she still has to try to disprove that “the value of what’s in the glass is defined by its alcohol content.”
    

            Mata and her wife and co-owner, Leah Wright, spend time with each customer explaining the spectrum of non-alcoholic options and that they don’t all taste like juice or soda. They even let customers sample the liquor-free spirits straight-up if they’re doubtful.
    

            Just don’t call Dry Spokes’ drinks “mocktails”: “We don’t want to mock a cocktail,” Mata said. Mata and Wright’s concoctions are delicious enough to stand on their own.
    

            Marshall, who has been sober for 17 years and is also a substance use counselor, built Sans Bar for people in recovery. But most of his customers are sober-curious, not people who have struggled with alcohol use, he said.
    

            “A lot of people in recovery still have a lot of apprehension about being in spaces where there’s non-alcoholic spirits and non-alcoholic beer,” Marshall said. “People have said, ‘Gosh, this really feels like I’m in a bar.’ Yup, you are, but we can recontextualize what ‘bar’ means.”

            Warrington said that while sober bars might be a “great alternative” for sober people, trying to detach from “drinking culture” may drive the sober and sober-curious away from bars altogether.
    

            So Marshall has packed his bar with familiar activities and events that, hopefully, are even more fun with a zero-proof drink in hand.
    

            On any given Friday at Sans Bar, patrons might run into sober karaoke or a trivia night or a panel for fellow sober people about how to date or change their habits to suit their sobriety. Dry Spokes’ events encourage communal fun, too, with queer meetups, comedy and drag shows, crafting events and book clubs — because even though the drinks are delicious, they’re better enjoyed in the company of like-minded people.
    

            “People feel grateful that they can still feel like adults without the negative sides of what an alcoholic bar can bring,” Mata said.
    

            Opening any brick-and-mortar business is a gamble, but sober bars face considerable challenges in staying open, said Marshall, who advises prospective sober bar owners. Non-alcoholic spirits can be expensive. There’s still confusion, even among sober people, about the kinds of drinks and experiences that a bar that doesn’t serve alcohol can offer. Some customers might not understand why the prices of a liquor-less cocktail costs the same as an alcoholic counterpart.
    

            “It is not a business that makes crap-tons of money,” Ehmann said. “There is no well liquor in the NA world yet, so the bottles, even at wholesale, are pretty expensive.”
    

            But Ehmann is lucky, she said. Her rent is quite low for Manhattan, and her bar across the street is still thriving. And now, former patrons of Lucky who quit drinking still have a place where they can hang out with the same crowd, just without alcohol.
    

            “The profit margin isn’t great,” she said. “But I just feel like it’s a social necessity.”

CNN_33,"US operation to capture Sinaloa cartel leaders had the help of one of the captured men: a son of ‘El Chapo,’ official says",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/us/sinaloa-cartel-ismael-zambada-custody-report/index.html,2024-07-27 23:58:00,us,"
            The arrest of two leaders of the Sinaloa cartel in the United States on Thursday was organized by one of the two men arrested, Joaquin Guzman Lopez, the son of infamous cartel boss Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman.
    

            Guzman Lopez organized his arrest along with that of Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, 76, who co-founded the cartel with El Chapo, by luring Zambada on a flight to examine a piece of land he thought was in Mexico, an official familiar with the operation told CNN.
    

            Instead, the plane landed in El Paso, Texas, where federal agents, including from Homeland Security Investigations, arrested the two cartel bosses.
    

            Zambada didn’t know US investigators had exploited a rift in the cartel and Guzman Lopez was helping with Zambada’s capture, the official said. FBI agents arrested both men, in one of the biggest victories for US law enforcement against the cartels.
    

            The cartel, one of the world’s most powerful narcotics trafficking organizations, is thought to be responsible for the trafficking of vast amounts of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and fentanyl into the US. DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said the arrests strike “at the heart of the cartel that is responsible for the majority of drugs, including fentanyl and methamphetamine, killing Americans from coast to coast.”

            Experts have told CNN a power struggle between Zambada and El Chapo’s sons, also known as the Chapitos, has existed for some time in the cartel. With Zambada gone, violence inside the cartel and other criminal organizations in Mexico, is set to ramp up.
    

            The agents from HSI, who have been working the case since earlier this year when Attorney General Merrick Garland announced charges against El Chapo’s three sons, were skeptical when Guzman Lopez first made the offer.
    

            The entire operation, a source told CNN, went off surprisingly smoothly given the gravity of the arrests and the disruption it could cause to Mexican drug trafficking.
    

            Zambada entered a not-guilty plea to all charges at his first federal court appearance Friday morning in El Paso and is being held without bond on seven federal criminal counts, including continuing criminal enterprise and money laundering.
    

            He also agreed to waive his right to personally appear and to ask for bond at a hearing set for July 31.
    

            Guzman Lopez, 38, was flown from El Paso via an FBI jet used for extradition operations and arrived near Chicago early Friday, a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation said. He is currently being held in a Chicago federal prison, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ inmate locator. His father is serving a life sentence in a US prison after he was convicted five years ago on multiple charges.
    

            Both Zambada and Guzman Lopez face several charges in the US for allegedly leading the cartel’s criminal operations, including its “deadly fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking networks,” US Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement after the arrests.
    

            Zambada’s attorney told the Los Angeles Times his client did not voluntarily surrender to law enforcement. He told the paper Zambada “was brought against his will.”
    

            Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Friday said the US government “must give a full report” on the operation that led to the arrests.
    

            “There has to be transparency,” he said during his daily news conference.
    

            AMLO, as the president is known, said the arrests show “important progress in the battle against drug trafficking.” He added, however, the arrests are not “everything,” adding the US must do more “in solving the drug consumption problem by addressing the causes.”
    

            Mexican officials were informed of the arrests during a phone call from the US Embassy in Mexico Thursday afternoon, Mexico’s secretary of security, Rosa Icela Rodriguez, said Friday.
    

            “The Mexican government did not participate in this detention or surrender,” Rodriguez said during AMLO’s daily news conference, adding Mexico is waiting for more information from the US government.
    

            FBI Director Christopher Wray said Zambada and Guzman Lopez had “eluded law enforcement for decades” and “will now face justice in the United States.”
    

            US authorities had sought Zambada’s capture for years and in 2021 raised the reward for information leading to his arrest to $15 million. He was indicted by a northern Illinois grand jury in 2009, according to the US State Department, and faces various criminal charges.

            “Ismael Mario Zambada Garcia is the long-time leader of the Zambada Garcia faction of the Sinaloa Cartel.  Zambada Garcia is unique in that he has spent his entire adult life as a major international drug trafficker, yet he has never spent a day in jail,” according to the US State Department.
    

            Similarly, Guzman Lopez was previously indicted by a federal grand jury in Illinois on narcotics, money laundering and firearms charges, according to a statement last year from prosecutors.
    

            The Sinaloa Cartel, named after the Mexican state where the gang was formed in the late 1980s, is one of the most powerful criminal groups in the world, raking in billions of dollars annually by trafficking drugs into the US and around the globe.
    

            Notorious cartel boss Guzman, better known as “El Chapo,” was arrested in Guatemala in 1993 on homicide and drug charges and extradited to Mexico. But he escaped Mexican prison in 2001, reportedly by bribing prison guards to smuggle him out in a laundry truck. He was arrested again in 2014, but escaped again, this time through a tunnel.
    

            Guzman was arrested for a third time in 2016 and then extradited to the United States.

            In a major trial, he was convicted by a federal jury in Brooklyn in 2018 and sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years, according to the Justice Department.
    

            Guzman was found guilty on 10 federal criminal counts, which included engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiracy to launder narcotics proceeds, international distribution of cocaine, heroin, and marijuana, and use of firearms.
    

            During the trial, Guzman’s lawyers argued Zambada was the real kingpin of the cartel who bribed the Mexican government to frame Guzman and remain free to run the criminal organization.
    

            In the latest in a string of US indictments against him, Zambada was charged in February with conspiring to manufacture and distribute fentanyl, an extremely potent synthetic opioid that has killed tens of thousands of Americans in an epidemic of overdoses.
    

            Fentanyl “was largely unheard of when [Zambada] founded the Sinaloa Cartel more than three decades ago and today is responsible for immeasurable harm,” said Breon Peace, US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, in the indictment.
    

            Since 1989, Zambada has imported and distributed “massive amounts of narcotics,” generating billions of dollars in profits, according to the indictment.

            Federal prosecutors said he employed people to obtain “transportation routes and warehouses” to import and store narcotics, along with hit men, or sicarios, to carry out kidnappings and murders in Mexico “to retaliate against rivals who threatened the cartel.”
    

            Zambada’s son, Vicente Zambada Niebla, admitted during testimony at Guzman’s 2018 trial to passing along orders for murders and kidnappings and was sentenced to 15 years in 2019 by a federal judge in Chicago.
    

            He began cooperating with the US government in 2011, prosecutors said in a May 2019 filing. They said he aided authorities in helping target members of the Sinaloa Cartel and a rival gang, which lead to the “charging of dozens of high-level targets and hundreds of their associates in indictments throughout the country,” CNN previously reported.
    

            The younger Zambada had known “El Chapo” since he was 15 years old, he testified at the kingpin’s trial in 2018. The younger Zambada frequently referred to “El Chapo” as “mi compadre,” or “my buddy,” during his testimony and said the drug lord was godfather to his youngest son.
    

            “El Mayo” Zambada was also indicted by a US federal grand jury in April 2012, in Texas, along with other suspected top Sinaloa leaders and 22 people allegedly connected with the cartel, including Guzman. They were charged with murder and conspiracy connected with drug trafficking, money laundering and organized crime.
    

            At that point, Guzman and Zambada had already been indicted on drug trafficking and organized crime charges in several US federal courts.
    

            The 2012 indictment in western Texas detailed two acts of violence federal prosecutors said were committed by members of the cartel; one took place during a 2010 wedding ceremony in Ciudad Juarez, when an American citizen and two members of his family were kidnapped because of their ties with the rival Juarez cartel.
    

            The target was the groom and a resident of Columbus, New Mexico, whose body was found to be beaten, strangled and whose hands had been “severed above the wrists and placed on his chest,” according to the indictment.
    

            Police found the bodies of the groom, his brother and his uncle three days after the wedding in the bed of a pickup truck, the indictment stated.
    

            Another incident detailed in the indictment related to the kidnapping, killing and mutilation of a Texas resident in 2009 “to answer for the loss of a 670-pound load of marijuana seized by the Border Patrol,” prosecutors said.
    

            CNN’s requests for comment were not immediately returned Friday by Zambada’s attorney, Frank Perez. CNN has reached out to law enforcement for comment.

CNN_34,Apple agrees to first US labor deal,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/business/apple-union-labor-agreement/index.html,2024-07-28 00:53:00,us,"
            Apple and the union representing retail workers at its store in Towson, Maryland, agreed to a tentative labor deal late Friday in the first US labor agreement not only for an Apple store but for any US workers of the tech giant.
    

            Workers at the Apple store in Towson had voted to join the International Association of Machinists union in June 2022 and have since been seeking their first contract. In May, they voted to authorize a strike without providing a deadline.
    

            The labor deal, which needs to be ratified by a vote of the 85 rank-and-file members at the store before it can take effect, is a significant milestone. Other high-profile union organizing efforts, such as those at Starbucks and Amazon, have yet to produce deals for those workers, even though workers at those companies voted to join unions well before the workers at the Apple store in Maryland.
    

            There are not many legal requirements to force a company to reach a labor agreement with a new union once that union has been recognized by the National Labor Relations Board, the government body that oversees labor relations for most US business. But the process can take a long time, as one recent study by Bloomberg Law found the average time for reaching a first contract is 465 days, or roughly 15 months. In many cases, it can take longer. A separate 2023 academic study found 43% of new unions were still seeking their first contract two years after winning a representation election.
    

            The Machinists union said the Apple store deal includes scheduling improvements for a better work-life balance, which was considered a major issue in the talks. The deal also includes pay increases of 10% over the three-year life of the contract, as well as job protections such as guarantees for severance packages for laid-off workers and limits on contract employees.
    

            “By reaching a tentative agreement with Apple, we are giving our members a voice in their futures and a strong first step toward further gains,” the union said a statement. The union added that it will now look to win the right to represent retail workers at other stores.
    

            “Together, we can build on this success in store after store and grow the power (the union) has started here in Maryland,” the union said.
    

            Apple has about 270 Apple stores in the United States, which are all owned by the company. Only one other store, in Oklahoma City, has voted to unionize, joining a different union, the Communications Workers of America. That store is not covered by this tentative labor deal.
    

            An Apple spokesperson declined to comment to CNN on this week’s tentative agreement, other than to point to an earlier statement in which the company said, “We deeply value our team members and we’re proud to provide them with industry leading compensation and exceptional benefits.”

            At least 11 people have been injured after projectiles were reportedly fired from Lebanon into Majdal Shams, Golan Heights on Saturday, according to the Israel Defense Forces and Israel’s national emergency service.
    

            “A short while ago, sirens sounded in the area of Majdal Shams. One projectile was identified crossing from Lebanon toward the area. A hit was identified in the area. Injuries were reported,” the IDF said, adding that “approximately 30 projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory.”
    

            A spokesperson for Magen David Adom (MDA) said that five people are in critical condition and six in serious condition in Majdal Shams, according to initial reports.
    

            Searches of the area continue, the spokesperson said.
    

            A large team from MDA has been sent to the scene. Paramedics are treating victims they say are aged between 10 and 20 years old.
    

            Some are being treated at the scene and others have been transferred to local clinics. Evacuation helicopters, ambulances and intensive care vehicles have also been dispatched to the scene.

CNN_36,Blinken raises concerns over Beijing’s ‘destabilizing actions’ in South China Sea at meeting with Chinese counterpart,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/asia/us-china-blinken-wang-meeting-laos-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-28 00:47:00,world,"
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed concern over Beijing’s “destabilizing actions” in the South China Sea in a meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, as the two sought to keep communications open despite a deepening rivalry.
    

            Blinken met with Wang in Laos during a trip to Asia against the backdrop of a fierce US presidential election campaign, which has renewed regional scrutiny over what the world will look like with a new administration in the White House.
    

            The two leaders discussed bilateral, regional, and global issues, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement, adding: “The Secretary made clear that the United States, together with our allies and partners, will advance our vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific.”
    

            In the meeting, Blinken also discussed China’s support for Russia’s defense industrial base, warning that the US will take “appropriate measures” if China doesn’t end their support, according to Miller.
    

            A statement from the Chinese foreign ministry said that Wang told Blinken the US holds “a wrong perception of China” and urged a return to a “rational and pragmatic China policy.” But the statement added that the two would keep up communication.
    

            The first leg of Blinken’s week-long visit – which includes stops in Vietnam, Japan, the Philippines, Singapore and Mongolia – comes amid persistent tensions between the US and China despite efforts by US President Joe Biden’s administration to stabilize rocky relations between the two.
    

            Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as China’s increasingly assertive moves in the South China Sea and threats toward Taiwan, have in recent years soured the Washington-Beijing relationship.
    

            This week the North American Aerospace Defense Command intercepted two Russian and two Chinese bombers flying near Alaska in what a US defense official said was the first time aircraft from the two countries have been intercepted while operating together.
    

            China’s continued support of Russia more than two years into Moscow’s invasion has been a persistent point of tension for the US, its allies and the Ukrainians.
    

            When NATO leaders met this month, a joint declaration labeled Beijing a “decisive enabler” of Russia’s war against Ukraine, citing China as giving “large-scale support for Russia’s defense industrial base.”

            The US and the European Union in recent months have accused China of bolstering Russia’s defense sector with the export of dual-use goods, and sanctioned dozens of companies in Hong Kong and mainland China for evading the extensive measures imposed on Russia. Beijing has denied supplying weaponry and maintains it keeps strict controls on such goods.
    

            Beijing has sought to position itself as a neutral peace broker in the conflict, despite its deepening political, economic and military ties with Moscow and Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s openly close friendship with Russia’s Vladimir Putin.
    

            Earlier this week, Wang told visiting Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba that Beijing “supported all efforts that contribute to peace” – the first time China has hosted a top Ukrainian official since Moscow’s invasion began nearly two and half years ago.
    

            In contrast, both Putin and Russia’s top diplomat Sergei Lavrov have been greeted in Beijing multiple times since the invasion.
    

            Kuleba also visited Hong Kong and urged the semi-autonomous Chinese city’s government to prevent Russia from using the Asian financial hub to bypass Western sanctions.
    

            Among the countries Blinken will visit on his trip are the Philippines and Japan, both of which have a mutual defense treaty with Washington.
    

            The Philippines has tacked closer to the US since the election of President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr. against a backdrop of increasingly violent clashes between Manila and Beijing in the South China Sea.
    

            Before speaking with Wang on Saturday, Blinken urged Southeast Asian countries to work together to address challenges – including Beijing’s “escalating and unlawful actions taken against the Philippines in the South China Sea” – at a meeting with ASEAN foreign ministers.
    

            But he also applauded Manila’s diplomacy with Beijing over the contentious issue, noting that the Philippines on Saturday completed unimpeded a resupply trip to troops stationed on a navy ship grounded at the hotly contested Second Thomas Shoal.

            Such resupply missions had been the source of months of escalating tensions between the Philippines and China, which reached an interim deal last week to smooth deliveries.
    

            “We are pleased to take note of the successful resupply today of the Second Thomas Shoal, which is the product of an agreement reached between the Philippines and China,” Blinken said.
    

            “We applaud that and hope and expect to see that it continues going forward.”
    

            During his presidency, Biden has pushed to deepen relations with the Philippines, Japan and South Korea, another mutual treaty ally, with Blinken a mainstay on the diplomatic circuit.
    

            Beijing has bristled at such efforts, seeing it as part of Washington’s campaign to encircle China and contain its rise.
    

            Asia is therefore watching closely for what might come next, especially given recent bombshell developments in the US election campaign.
    

            Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump, who recently survived an assassination attempt, has often viewed Washington’s alliances more transactionally than Biden. His running mate JD Vance has advocated halting military aid to Ukraine in favor of focusing on Taiwan’s defense.
    

            Meanwhile the Democratic Party’s campaign was upended by Biden’s decision not to seek re-election, and Vice President Kamala Harris becoming the party’s presumptive nominee.

CNN_37,Novak Djokovic begins his pursuit of career golden slam at the Paris Olympics,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/sport/novak-djokovic-paris-olympics-matthew-ebden-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-28 00:26:00,world,"
            There is a notable absence among Novak Djokovic’s 98 career singles titles, but the Serbian star is hoping to change that over the coming weeks.
    

            Yet to win an Olympic gold medal across his four previous appearances at the Games, Djokovic got his latest campaign off to a strong start, defeating Australia’s Matthew Ebden 6-0 6-1 on a lively Court Philippe-Chatrier in Paris.
    

            The match, played under the roof of the noisy arena amid heavy rain, lasted just 53 minutes. That was hardly a surprise – Ebden, a doubles specialist, last played a singles match two years, and there are few more daunting ways to reacquaint yourself with a different format than against a man who boasts 24 grand slam titles.
    

            In the end, Djokovic progressed with ease, potentially setting up a thrilling second-round match against Rafael Nadal. Should he go all the way at these Olympics, the 37-year-old would join Nadal and Andre Agassi as the third man to win all four grand slams and a gold medal in singles.
    

            It’s a feat, sometimes described as a career golden slam, only achieved by Steffi Graf and Serena Williams in the women’s game.
    

            “Playing in the Olympic Games is very rare for us tennis players,” Djokovic told reporters, ”and of course for anybody, as it comes every four years. Representing your country is always the highest honor. I started off great.”
    

            Djokovic, yet to win a title this year, was playing his first match since losing comfortably against Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final two weeks ago.
    

            Still wearing strapping over his right knee following recent surgery on a torn meniscus, he was dominant throughout against Ebden, converting six of his nine break points while not facing any of his own.
    

            The early stages of the match were particularly one-sided, with Djokovic taking the first set with back-to-back aces in just 24 minutes.
    

            Ebden had earned his spot in the singles draw as an alternate following Holger Rune’s withdrawal, and he joked on social media earlier in the week about facing Djokovic and perhaps Nadal in his opening two matches.
    

            The 36-year-old, currently unranked in singles, even offered his racket to a fan at the start set, such were his struggles against a far superior opponent. An underarm serve also failed to reap any rewards, but Ebden did get on the scoreboard eventually, lifting his shirt over his head in ironic celebration.
    

            The crowd, already in a restless mood and providing vociferous support for both players, responded with a roar of approval, perhaps hopeful that the contest would be extended a little longer.
    

            But it only delayed the inevitable. Djokovic took the next two games, completing the straightforward victory with a backhand winner while Ebden was caught stranded at the net.
    

            The world No. 2 is yet to win a title this calendar year, and prior to the tournament spoke about the honor and privilege of representing Serbia at another Olympics. His best performance at the Games is a bronze medal from all the way back in 2008; since then, two fourth-place finishes – including in Tokyo three years ago – have followed.
    

            Djokovic was photographed offering a prayer next to a display of the Olympic medals at an event on Thursday, though he may have felt that luck was against him upon learning that he could face Nadal as early as the second round.
    

            The Spaniard, who carried the torch during Saturday’s opening ceremony, has won 14 French Open titles at Roland Garros. Playing in his final Olympics, he is scheduled to compete in the men’s doubles alongside Carlos Alcaraz, while fans will also be hoping that a reported thigh injury doesn’t prevent him from facing Hungary’s Marton Fucsovics in the singles draw.
    

            With Nadal still mulling his retirement plans, this tournament could be the final chance to see two of the game’s greatest ever players go against each other. Djokovic will just be hoping that it doesn’t derail his ambitions for a long-awaited Olympic gold medal.
    

            “Playing him is like finals for me,” he told reporters. “In any tournament and particularly here, knowing what he has achieved and what he’s done for our sport, particularly here in Roland Garros, his record speaks for itself.
    

            “So I look forward to it. If we get to face each other, it’s going to be, possibly, the last time we face each other on a big stage, so I’m sure that people would enjoy it. I’m looking forward to it. I’ll be ready for that match-up.”

CNN_38,Israel blames Hezbollah as rocket attack on soccer field injures 11 in Golan Heights,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/lebanon-israel-golan-strikes-intl-latam/index.html,2024-07-28 01:48:00,world,"
            At least 11 people have been injured in a rocket attack on a soccer field in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights on Saturday, according to Israeli authorities.


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) blamed the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah for the attack, which it said had caused “multiple civilian casualties, including children” at a soccer field in the Majdal Shams area.
    

            It claimed the group was behind several rockets fired into the village, and that it had identified “approximately 30 projectiles” crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory on Saturday.
    

            However, Hezbollah said it “firmly denies” firing the rockets.
    

            A spokesperson for Magen David Adom (MDA) said that five people are in critical condition and six in serious condition in Majdal Shams, according to initial reports.
    

            Searches of the area continue, the spokesperson said.
    

            A large team from MDA has been sent to the scene. Paramedics are treating victims they say are aged between 10 and 20 years old.
    

            Some are being treated at the scene and others have been transferred to local clinics. Evacuation helicopters, ambulances and intensive care vehicles have also been dispatched to the scene.

            Idan Avshalom, a senior medic from MDA said, “We arrived at a soccer field and saw destruction and objects on fire. Injured people were lying on the grass and the sights were dire. We immediately began triaging the injured, some of the injured were sent to local clinics and our teams were also directed to the clinics. During the incident there were additional alerts and the medical treatment of the injured is still ongoing.”
    

            Israeli police said that munitions have fallen in “multiple sites in the northern Golan.”
    

            Police are “securing the area and searching for additional remnants to eliminate any further risk to the public,” the Police Spokesperson’s Unit said.
    

            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been updated on the situation and is holding a security consultation with his military secretary General Roman Gofman, his office said in a statement. It added he would hold a security situation assessment with all the heads of the defense establishment later today.
    

            While the IDF has blamed the attack on Hezbollah, which has been involved in an increasing number of cross-border attacks with Israel in recent months, the militant group denied involvement in a statement on Telegram Saturday.
    

            “The Islamic Resistance in Lebanon firmly denies the allegations made by some enemy media outlets and various media platforms regarding the targeting of Majdal Shams,” it said.
    

            “We confirm that the Islamic Resistance has no connection to the incident whatsoever and firmly denies all false claims in this regard,” the statement continued.
    

            The Golan Heights are considered occupied territory under international law and UN Security Council resolutions. Israel seized the narrow strip of land from Syria in 1967 during the Six-Day War and annexed the land in 1981. There are approximately 53,000 people living in the Golan Heights, split almost evenly between Israeli settlers and Syrian Druze, as well as a small population of Alawites.

CNN_39,California’s Park Fire destroys buildings and forces thousands to flee while in Canada a fast-moving blaze ravages tourist town,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/us/california-chico-park-fire-canada-jasper-fire/index.html,2024-07-28 03:50:00,us,"
California’s largest wildfire of the year has burned an area larger than the size of the city of Los Angeles, destroyed dozens of buildings and forced thousands of residents to flee their homes as wildfires wreak havoc in the Western United States. Meanwhile, homes and businesses in a popular Canadian resort town were incinerated as a wildfire continued to roar through the area. Here’s the latest:


            • California’s Park Fire now state’s 8th largest: As the Park Fire exploded across parts of Butte and Tehama counties, north of Sacramento, California, it scorched 134 buildings and threatened another 4,200. The fast moving blaze has burned more than 307,000 acres, or about 480 square miles, making it the eighth largest wildfire in recorded state history. More than 2,400 firefighters are working to slow the fire’s progress as it remains 0% contained, according to Cal Fire.
    

            • California governor declares state of emergency: Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for both counties Friday. The state also secured a federal grant to ensure there are enough resources to fight the blaze. The fire is advancing at 4,000 to 5,000 acres per hour, Billy See, incident commander for Cal Fire, said Friday. With winds forecast to die down overnight and higher humidity moving into the area, See believes firefighters will have a better chance to slow the fire down.
    

            • A man is accused of igniting Park Fire: A 42-year-old man, identified as Ronnie Dean Stout II, was arrested on suspicion of pushing a burning car 60 feet into a gully, “spreading flames that caused the Park Fire,” authorities said. The DA says the man was seen “calmly leaving the area by blending in with the other citizens who were in the area and fleeing the rapidly evolving fire.” Stout, who has not retained an attorney, will likely face an arson charge, the DA’s office told CNN.
    

            • Pilot dies while fighting Oregon fire: A firefighting pilot was found dead in a single-engine air tanker on Friday after going missing the night before while working in the vicinity of the 219-square-mile Falls Fire burning in the Malheur National Forest, according to officials. The fire, which was 55% contained as of Saturday morning, is among a number of large wildfires burning across Oregon. The largest active wildfire in the state is the Durkee Fire, which has scorched about 451 square miles and was 27% contained as of Saturday morning.
    

            • Fire wipes out many of a Canadian town’s buildings: A fast-moving wildfire sent thousands of visitors and residents fleeing the town of Jasper in Alberta, where flames devastated an estimated 30% of the town’s structures. Officials say the losses are significant, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has deployed federal support to help battle the blaze. Cool temperatures are expected to calm fire behavior, which will help the 154 firefighters in Jasper fight the blaze, Jasper National Park said on Facebook Friday night. High winds, however, could increase fire activity.
    

            • 96 large wildfires burning nationwide: Triple-digit heat and dry conditions across the West this week have made conditions poor for firefighters actively fighting to contain the dozens of wildfires burning nationwide, including 37 in Oregon and 14 in California. “Elevated to critical fire weather conditions will persist through the weekend across the Western U.S. Isolated dry thunderstorms could lead to new fire starts over portions of the northern Rockies,” the National Weather Service said. Smoke from wildfires will also result in continued unhealthy air quality.
    

            The Park Fire, which began Wednesday in the Chico area, has forced about 4,000 people to evacuate in Butte County, where the state’s deadliest wildfire, the Camp Fire, killed more than 85 people and destroyed thousands of homes in 2018.
    

            A heavy plume of smoke once again looms over the county as crews battle thick flames that are torching everything in their path. The Park Fire has left graveyards of burned cars and charred, hallowed out structures, video from the Chico area shows.
    

            For Butte County residents, the advancing flames bring with them painful memories of the losses they endured from the Camp Fire six years ago.
    

            One evacuee, Tim Ferguson, told CNN affiliate KOVR he had lost his father in the Camp Fire, and it’s painful thinking about having to experience more loss this time around.
    

            “We’ve got our home, and we’ve been working on it a lot lately, fixing it up, and it’s just we’re at the verge of maybe losing all that,” Ferguson said.
    

            Lauri Schwein, who lost her home in the Camp Fire, told CNN affiliate KCRA she’s on high alert. “I’m packing up, my dog, my cat,” she said. “All I can do is wait and watch.”
    

            In the town of Paradise, the smoke is enough to bring back the horrors the Camp Fire unleashed when it incinerated much of the town.
    

            “It was very impactful, every once in a while we smell smoke or see smoke like that, it does trigger us. It triggers the people here in Paradise. When you go through trauma, that’s what happens,” Ron Lassonde, the mayor of Paradise, told KCRA.
    

            Paradise is under an evacuation warning, according to the town web site. “An EVACUATION WARNING means prepare to evacuate and await additional instructions, under a warning those who need additional time to evacuate should begin evacuating now,” officials cautioned.
    

            The Park Fire is burning just three weeks after the Thomspon Fire in Butte County burned more than 3,700 acres, forced people from their homes, and destroyed more than two dozen structures, including houses.
    

            Local officials cautioned it would take some time before people would be allowed back in their homes.
    

            “We are no strangers to evacuations in Butte County,” said Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea at a news conference Friday. “We are constantly looking for the earliest opportunity to get people back in.”
    

            The North Valley Animal Disaster Group has rescued 88 animals from the blaze as its members dealt with losses of their own. In 2018, the group managed to shelter over 4,000 animals during the Camp Fire.
    

            “When you’ve been through a big fire and you’ve lost everything, sometimes the only thing you have left to give is to go help the animals,” Vice President Norm Rosene told CNN.
    

            Triple-digit temperatures and high wind gusts have fueled the explosive growth of the Park Fire amid an active fire season in California. An estimated 626,600 acres have burned across the state so far in 2024, compared to 25,254 acres burned by this time last year, according to Cal Fire.
    

            “It’s been nothing but challenging,” Cal Fire Captain Dan Collins told CNN. “If we see fires behave like this in July, they may behave even more radically come the fall when the fields are even drier.”
    

            In Jasper, a popular tourist town in Alberta, 25,000 residents and visitors were forced to evacuate from a fast-moving blaze that has destroyed 30% of the town’s structures, officials said.
    

            Two wildfires converged in the Jasper National Park area, becoming what authorities are referring to as the Jasper Wildfire Complex. It remains difficult to measure exactly how big the complex – which also includes a third nearby fire – is due to extreme fire behavior and thick smoke cover. Together, the fires have swallowed an estimated 89,000 acres, the Jasper National Park said.
    

            An evacuation order remains in effect for Jasper and Jasper National Park, with the vast majority of evacuees being visitors, officials said. Along with about 4,100 residents – and thousands of seasonal workers – who live in the town, 2.48 million people visited Jasper National Park last year.
    

            Out of a total of 1,113 structures in the town, 358 have been destroyed, according to a Facebook post from Jasper National Park.
    

            The owner of Maligne Lodge in Jasper told CNN news partner CTV News that she was shocked when she saw a photo of the 98-room hotel up in flames. It had been in the family since 1961 after her father purchased the property, and she had been working there since she was a child.
    

            “As soon as we’re given the go-ahead, we’ll be in there rebuilding our hotel,” Karyn Decore said.
    

            Jasper Mayor Richard Ireland lost the home that his family had moved into around his second birthday, according to CTV News.
    

            On a tour of the wreckage in Jasper, Ireland said that the loss of his home of 67 years “is shattering.”
    

            “Now it’s memories of family and fire,” Ireland told CNN news partner CBC. “So many others are going to go through this same thing.”
    

            But he said “when I stood back and looked, and saw what remains, I know that the community is still there.”

CNN_40,How ‘cat lady’ became an insult for women of a certain age,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/us/cat-lady-explained-cec/index.html,2024-07-28 03:23:00,us,"
            The stereotypical “cat lady” is one of pop culture’s most bizarre characters — and easiest punching bags.
    

            She’s “The Simpsons” recurring character Eleanor Abernathy, a reclusive resident of Springfield who speaks in gibberish and hurls her cats at passersby. She’s bedridden “Big Edie” Beale, tucked inside Grey Gardens, cuddling kittens while raccoons, rats and nature eat away at her decrepit mansion. She’s even Robert DeNiro in a 2004 sketch from “Saturday Night Live,” in which he plays a eccentric woman who lives with 80 cats.
    

            She’s … Vice President Kamala Harris?
    

            So said former President Donald Trump’s current running mate, Sen. JD Vance, in a recently resurfaced 2021 interview with Tucker Carlson. “Cat lady” is an insult usually reserved for women without children who share their homes with cats, but here, he used it to describe Harris and other politicians who don’t have biological children.
    

            “We’re effectively run in this country, via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made,” Vance said. “And so they wanna make the rest of the country miserable, too.”
    

            “You look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC — the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,” he went on. “And how does it make any sense that we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?” (Buttigieg and his husband announced that they adopted twins the month following Vance’s interview.)
    

            Vance’s using “cat lady” as a dig at Harris “expresses hostility for women in public office by implying they should be at home” with children, said Fiona Probyn-Rapsey, a professor at the University of Wollongong in Australia who authored a chapter about “crazy cat ladies” in the nonfiction book “Animaladies.”
    

            But Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, doesn’t fit the part of the stereotypical “cat lady.” She’s married, for one, and has two stepchildren. She’s a politician and therefore a public figure, not a shut-in. And as far as we know, she doesn’t own any cats.
    

            “It’s a sexist framing for child-free women, but more importantly, it doesn’t seem to matter if she has children or not,” Probyn-Rapsey told CNN. “It’s a tool in the misogynist’s tool box — an attempt to exclude women from the public sphere and imply that her contributions to political life come at the cost of family, or, as Vance is implying, the whole nation.”
    

            The stereotypical “cat lady” we know today is typically depicted as haggard, mentally unstable and willfully isolated save for her abundance of cats. And though Vance’s description of “cat lady” didn’t include “crazy,” madness has been associated with “cat ladies” for over a century.
    

            In ancient Egypt, cats were symbolic of femininity, personified in the goddess Bastet, who was frequently portrayed as a cat or a woman with a feline head. The “felinization of women” in ancient society “reflected women’s power,” wrote Corey Wrenn, a sociologist from the University of Kent in a 2018 analysis of gendered feline imagery. But sometimes, Wrenn said, that power was perceived as “threatening and necessary to suppress.”
    

            The reputation of cats grew more dangerous in medieval Europe, as did “deviant” women who didn’t adhere to the norms of childbearing and domesticity. Cats became associated with disobedient women like Agnes Waterhouse, thought to be the first woman executed for witchcraft in England upon her death in 1566. She apparently confessed that her pet cat, reportedly called Satan, had killed local livestock at her behest and had previously killed humans under the cat’s previous owner, also a purported witch.
    

            “There is something about the independence of cats, something I like about them, which can be linked with a suspicion of independent women,” said Alice Madicott, whose book “Cat Women” prods the “crazy cat lady” stereotype. “A woman that chooses an animal that is arguably never entirely tamed is to be suspected of being untameable herself.”
    

            The spinster stereotype was born in the 18th century, wrote Linda Rodriguez McRobbie in a 2017 piece for the Boston Globe. Women who couldn’t marry became “dependents in their relatives’ households,” Rodriguez McRobbie wrote, draining their finances and besmirching their social standings.
    

            The great spinsters of literature were often portrayed as, if not monstrous, then ugly, cruel and unwanted. Miss Havisham of Charles Dickens’ “Great Expectations” goes mad with heartbreak and vengeance, never removing the wedding dress she wore when she was spurned at the altar. (Plus, Rodriguez McRobbie wrote, Havisham was said to be based on a real-life spinster who nursed her two cats and bulldog like children.)
    

            Even beloved novelist Jane Austen, who was herself unmarried, wrote unflatteringly of spinsters: Miss Bates in “Emma” is, Austen writes, “neither young, handsome, rich, nor married” and often annoys her young heroine.
    

            Cats once again became associated with spinsters gone mad. In the 1881 edition of the magazine Potter’s American Monthly, writer Hart Ayrault described unmarried women as “having failed in the prime object of existence” — marriage, in his view. He dispenses several stereotypes that we’ve come to associate with the “crazy cat lady,” including isolation, social rejection and a lack of maternal instinct for all creatures but her pets.
    

            “Tradition associates her with cats and parrots, on which she is supposed to lavish all that is left of affection in her withered heart,” he wrote of spinsters.
    

            Opponents of women’s suffrage used images of cats to attack the movement in the 19th century, too. In anti-suffragist cartoons published in the US, men were portrayed as the homemakers tasked with caring for children, cleaning the home and spending time with house cats while their formerly disenfranchised wives voted and emasculated them. Cats even stood in for women in anti-suffragist ads in the UK, which portrayed giving the right to vote to women as absurd as granting suffrage to cats.
    

            Out of the spinster and the dangerously independent suffragettes grew the stereotypical cat lady we think of today. Real-life cat owners living in squalor like Big Edie in “Grey Gardens” and those seen in distressing episodes of the reality series “Hoarders” only shaded in the image that the term “cat lady” brings to mind.
    

            But reducing people to the pets they own diminishes everything else about them, said Susan Michals, founder of the popular cat-centric convention CatCon.
    

            “Anyone who is using ‘cat lady’ in a negative way is assuming a woman who loves her cat does not also have a rich, full life that includes friendships, career, and meaningful interests,” Michals told CNN.
    

            So-called cat ladies have been reclaiming the term for more than a century. Women’s suffragists took back the image of the cat in pro-suffrage advertisements, portraying themselves as hardscrabble fighters devoted to their cause. On a cross-country tour of the US, suffragists Nell Richardson and Alice Burke even adopted a black cat that became the “unofficial mascot” of their movement.
    

            Today’s cat ladies are owning the term regardless of marital status. It’s emblazoned on T-shirts and books, and self-proclaimed cat ladies are using it to name their blogs and their cat-oriented businesses. And since Vance’s comments resurfaced this week, “childless cat lady” is now appearing on new merchandise including bumper stickers and yard signs.
    

            Michals proudly wears the term “cat lady” because she’s unashamed of her love for cats — though she prefers “cat woman,” which brings to mind the various sexy iterations of the Batman antihero Catwoman, played with panache by the likes of Michelle Pfeiffer, Zoë Kravitz and Halle Berry.
    

            “So go ahead, call me a cat lady,” she wrote in a 2019 essay for Glamour. “I run a cat convention! But it’s all about perception and reformatting what that means.”
    

            Catwoman is the rare “cat lady” who’s seen as desirable despite her affection for cats. (Pfeiffer and Kravitz’s Catwomen both open up their small apartments to several strays.) Holly Golightly of “Breakfast at Tiffany’s,” too, is portrayed as a vivacious and attractive woman who also happens to own cats. Even billionaire superstar Taylor Swift is a cat person, with three cats of her own, and her pets haven’t dimmed her appeal.
    

            “It seems cat-like aspects as a young woman are to be applauded, but owning a cat, especially once you approach middle-age and even worse if you are single, is a sign that something is wrong with you,” Madicott said.
    

            The “crazy cat lady” taboo remains. Vance used it to insult Harris and other politicians who don’t have biological children. Even Swift expressed fear about becoming a cat lady in a 2015 interview with the Telegraph.
    

            But Vance’s remarks against Harris and other politicians without biological children aren’t going unchecked. Kerstin Emhoff, the mother of Harris’ stepchildren, and Harris’ stepdaughter, Ella Emhoff, both said this week that Harris is a present and supportive parent. Jennifer Aniston, who has spoken about her own challenges with fertility, expressed disbelief that a “potential VP of the United States” would discuss women without children in a degrading way.
    

            The insult has even inspired self-identified “childless cat ladies” and allies to rally around Harris and embracing the moniker. Even “childless dog ladies” and women who have both children and cats are expressing their support for the presidential candidate and cat lovers everywhere.
    

            “’Childless’ — that’s often a choice,” Michals told CNN. “And ‘crazy’ can mean passionate and enthusiastic. It all comes down to context, and who’s delivering the message.”
    

            The legion of cat and cat lady supporters is strong: Cats are second only to dogs as America’s most popular pet — over 37 million US households own a cat, according to 2022 statistics from the American Veterinary Medical Association. And one can never underestimate the power of loyal Swifties who align to defend their idol and her furry loves.
    

            “Lots of people like cats and won’t stomach their affection being made a target for misogyny, so Vance will have to reckon with that!” Probyn-Rapsey said.

CNN_41,How sober bars are redefining nightlife,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/us/sober-bars-mocktails-alcohol-free-wellness-cec/index.html,2024-07-28 03:22:00,us,"
            Every Friday, when Chris Marshall opens his bar, he gets the same customer request: Alcohol, please.
    

            And every time someone asks for a vodka tonic or another familiar well drink, he has to gently remind them that his bar, Sans Bar, serves no alcohol.
    

            “I can definitely help you with the tonic, not so much the vodka,” he said.
    

            So he’ll hand them a menu, where there are classic cocktail riffs and unlikelier combinations. There’s a “nada colada,” which mimics the tropical taste of a piña colada but with a photogenic infusion of alcohol-free blue curacao syrup. A newer addition of which Marshall is particularly proud, the Burnet lush, samples the garden, combining chlorophyll, asparagus brine, lemon juice and botanicals for something springy.
    

            But at Sans Bar in Austin, Texas, the cocktails aren’t the star. The customers are.
    

            “We make it about the experience and connection, not the drinks,” he said. “I mean, the drinks are amazing. But so much of what it means to be a bar is to be a place where people meet.”
    

            Marshall is a member of a small class of sober bar owners who want to upend the idea that bars are exclusively places where alcohol is served. He and other sober bar impresarios believe bars should be community hubs where you can have fun without imbibing anything alcoholic.
    

            And as the non-alcoholic beverage market steadily grows, so have sober bars. They operate in New York and Los Angeles, in Orlando and Sacramento, Atlanta and Omaha. And they’re steadily growing their base of customers, including those who still drink but are exploring sobriety and people in recovery from substance use, by redefining what a bar can be.
    

            “As much as it’s a bar, I try to treat it like a classroom, where we’re learning how to socialize without alcohol,” Marshall said.
    

            A sober bar usually looks and feels like any other. It might be upscale and minimalist or divey and lived-in. There may be handles lined up behind the bar but these bottles are zero-proof. Sober bars serve beers and wines that are non-alcoholic (though they can sometimes contain up to 0.5% ABV, or alcohol by volume, the Food and Drug Administration’s threshold for a beverage to still be considered non-alcoholic). And then there are the cocktails with all the trimmings but none of the liquor.
    

            Many sober bars also serve coffee or drinks made with CBD or kava, a psychoactive root that, when consumed, can produce some mild sedative effects.
    

            Marshall, though, refuses to serve coffee at Sans Bar, which is only open on Fridays from 6 p.m. to midnight.
    

            “A coffee shop is a place to meet friends,” he said. “A bar is a place where you can meet strangers.”
    

            That social principle is what convinced Abby Ehmann, who already owned a bar in New York’s East Village, to open up a sober joint across the street.
    

            Bars have always been, first and foremost, gathering places. Ehmann’s first bar, Lucky, quickly turned into a beloved neighborhood joint with regulars who started showing up not just to drink, but to enjoy weekly game nights, live music and each other’s company.
    

            Ehmann isn’t sober herself, but she “felt pretty strongly that people who don’t drink alcohol deserve a place to socialize that’s comfortable and welcoming.” Their own Lucky.
    

            So in 2022, Ehmann opened Hekate, a “café and elixir lounge,” which serves both Instagrammable mocktails and casual cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon in a skinny, dimly lit room. Hekate is completely alcohol free (and so is the PBR).
    

            It’s not always easy to convince people to open up to each other without the “social lubricant” of alcohol, Ehmann said. So she built a bar that facilitates intimacy — most of the seating is up at the bar, and customers are encouraged to work with their bartenders to whip up a personalized drink that could end up on the seasonal menu.
    

            “To me, an ideal bar is long and narrow, so you have to walk by everyone in order to go to the bathroom,” Ehmann said. “The foot traffic allows for more mingling.”
    

            At Hekate, she serves all kinds of customers, most of them sober. There are people who are sober for the moment — she’s hosted several baby showers there — or sober for religious reasons. “Sober October” and “Dry January” are busy months, naturally, but many of those temporarily sober folks keep coming back all year.
    

            “It’s easy to come in for a spell,” said Lux Heljardóttir, a rune reader who frequents Hekate. “Three minutes, if you let it, easily becomes three hours and you’ll leave happier than you entered.”
    

            The witchy vibe, eclectic menu and amiable regulars have drawn Dylan Kapit into Hekate around once a week this summer. Though they’re partial to the non-alcoholic beers and wines, their current drink of choice is a liquor-free gin and tonic.
    

            “As a sober person, it is amazing to have a chill place that I can go where I can hang out and order mocktails without any judgment,” Kapit told CNN.
    

            Sober bars are finding their footing in part due to the growing sober-curious movement.
    

            People are becoming increasingly conscious of the deleterious effects that drinking can have on their mental and physical health. Even if they’re not struggling with substance use, they might start limiting their alcohol intake or changing the way they socialize, becoming sober-curious, said author Ruby Warrington, who coined the term in 2016.
    

            “People have realized that you don’t have to have a ‘drinking problem’ for drinking to be a problem for them,” Warrington, who also wrote a book called “Sober Curious,” told CNN.
    

            Not all Americans are drinking less, but alcohol is becoming less popular among young people, around whom many bar owners build their businesses. In a Gallup poll published last August, 62% of adults under 35 said that they drink alcohol — down 10 percentage points from 20 years earlier.
    

            Another Gallup survey from last August found that among the people who choose not to drink, almost one-fourth of them said that they didn’t really have a reason — they just didn’t want to. Other reasons for avoiding alcohol included disliking it, believing it could harm their health and fearing the consequences of consumption, among others.

The rise of the non-alcoholic cocktail


            “Alcohol is definitely having, and has had, a cigarette moment since at least 2016,” Marshall said. “We’re coming up on a decade of people really evaluating alcohol’s place in our life. And it’s just no longer accepted that people consume a bunch of alcohol to have a good time.”
    

            For many sober-curious people, thinking more critically about their drinking means giving non-alcoholic cocktails and canned beverages a chance.
    

            Many of the people who seek out alcohol alternatives are more sober-curious than strictly sober. In 2022, Nielsen IQ reported that 82% of people who buy non-alcoholic drinks are still buying beverages that contain alcohol.
    

            “This is more of a health movement than it is a sobriety movement,” he said. “And that’s what’s really exciting about it. I think (drinking) has become a public health issue.”
    

            And the service industry is catching on. Even five years ago, it was rare for restaurants or bars to devote a section of their menu to non-alcoholic cocktails, said Ian Blessing, a former sommelier at the Michelin-starred Napa Valley restaurant The French Laundry.
    

            Then, he said “most non-alcoholic cocktails were simple mixtures of fruit juice, soda, and syrup,” he said. Customers unfamiliar with non-alcoholic innovations may still shudder when they hear the word “mocktail,” reminded of the sickeningly sugary Shirley Temples of yore.
    

            That perception is shifting, though, he said, thanks to the increasing availability of — and demand for — non-alcoholic spirits, botanicals, bitters and other essential ingredients. (Blessing and his wife, also a former sommelier, have released their own line of alcohol-free bitters, All the Bitter, marketed to customers sober or otherwise.) Even full-liquor bars are investing in well-crafted mocktails.

Dry January is over, but are ‘sober drinks’ a healthy way to keep it going?


            “This is the best time in history to be sober because there are so many options,” Ehmann said.
    

            When she opened Hekate, she said, she feared she’d have to make all the drink components herself, but she gets free samples of new products now every week.
    

            “There are over a hundred (non-alcoholic) beers alone that are so delicious that you don’t feel like you’re denying yourself anything,” she said.
    

            Still, it can take some convincing for people to try a non-alcoholic drink even at a bar where liquor isn’t served. Mi-Ya Mata of Dry Spokes in Omaha said she still has to try to disprove that “the value of what’s in the glass is defined by its alcohol content.”
    

            Mata and her wife and co-owner, Leah Wright, spend time with each customer explaining the spectrum of non-alcoholic options and that they don’t all taste like juice or soda. They even let customers sample the liquor-free spirits straight-up if they’re doubtful.
    

            Just don’t call Dry Spokes’ drinks “mocktails”: “We don’t want to mock a cocktail,” Mata said. Mata and Wright’s concoctions are delicious enough to stand on their own.
    

            Marshall, who has been sober for 17 years and is also a substance use counselor, built Sans Bar for people in recovery. But most of his customers are sober-curious, not people who have struggled with alcohol use, he said.
    

            “A lot of people in recovery still have a lot of apprehension about being in spaces where there’s non-alcoholic spirits and non-alcoholic beer,” Marshall said. “People have said, ‘Gosh, this really feels like I’m in a bar.’ Yup, you are, but we can recontextualize what ‘bar’ means.”

            Warrington said that while sober bars might be a “great alternative” for sober people, trying to detach from “drinking culture” may drive the sober and sober-curious away from bars altogether.
    

            So Marshall has packed his bar with familiar activities and events that, hopefully, are even more fun with a zero-proof drink in hand.
    

            On any given Friday at Sans Bar, patrons might run into sober karaoke or a trivia night or a panel for fellow sober people about how to date or change their habits to suit their sobriety. Dry Spokes’ events encourage communal fun, too, with queer meetups, comedy and drag shows, crafting events and book clubs — because even though the drinks are delicious, they’re better enjoyed in the company of like-minded people.
    

            “People feel grateful that they can still feel like adults without the negative sides of what an alcoholic bar can bring,” Mata said.
    

            Opening any brick-and-mortar business is a gamble, but sober bars face considerable challenges in staying open, said Marshall, who advises prospective sober bar owners. Non-alcoholic spirits can be expensive. There’s still confusion, even among sober people, about the kinds of drinks and experiences that a bar that doesn’t serve alcohol can offer. Some customers might not understand why the prices of a liquor-less cocktail costs the same as an alcoholic counterpart.
    

            “It is not a business that makes crap-tons of money,” Ehmann said. “There is no well liquor in the NA world yet, so the bottles, even at wholesale, are pretty expensive.”
    

            But Ehmann is lucky, she said. Her rent is quite low for Manhattan, and her bar across the street is still thriving. And now, former patrons of Lucky who quit drinking still have a place where they can hang out with the same crowd, just without alcohol.
    

            “The profit margin isn’t great,” she said. “But I just feel like it’s a social necessity.”

            A group of 13 hikers were rescued from an Arizona trail Friday morning amid scorching heat, with a helicopter used to airlift one 10-year-old to the hospital, according to authorities.
    

            An 18-month-old and 12-month-old were also treated at a hospital for heat exhaustion, officials said.
    

            Friday saw extreme temperatures in Arizona, with Scottsdale reaching a high of 108°F.
    

            The hikers, who were in town for a family reunion, set off on the Gateway Loop Trail at around 7:30 a.m. The fire department was dispatched at around 10 a.m. for the rescue.
    

            The group was found hunkered down under a tree several miles away from the trail head in the McDowell Sonoran Preserve, the Scottsdale Fire Department said in a news release.
    

            The decision to use the helicopter in the rescue operation underscored the seriousness of the event, according to Scottsdale Fire Capt. Dave Folio.

            “That’s a low frequency/high risk event for us,” Folio told CNN affiliate KNXV. “If we make a decision to fly somebody off the mountain, they need to get off the mountain, so we’ve done that successfully,” he added.
    

            The rescue teams also used a “big wheel operation” to transport one of the adult hikers to the hospital, using a gurney with one large wheel and a mountain bike-style tire.
    

            The family had run out of water and their phones were out of charge at the time of the rescue, according to KNXV.
    

            Folio told KNXV Scottsdale officials choose not to close the trails during extreme heat, instead opting to educate hikers and tourists about proper preparation for using the trail system.
    

            The McDowell Sonoran Preserve is more than 30,500 contiguous acres, about 15 miles northeast of Scottsdale.

CNN_43,The state with the largest school district in the nation bans realistic active shooter drills,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/us/new-york-realistic-active-shooter-drills/index.html,2024-07-28 02:12:00,us,"
            New York, home of the nation’s largest school district, is banning realistic active shooter drills, following years of activism by parents and lawmakers who say the drills traumatize children, normalize violence and do little to prepare students for the unlikely possibility of a school shooting.
    

            New rules outlined and approved unanimously by the New York State Board of Regents this month will require schools to use “trauma informed” and “age appropriate” methods in drills and bans the use of any actors, props, or tactics depicting violence when school is in session.
    

            The change follows a multiyear effort by parents, advocates and lawmakers to make school drills less traumatic for students, as well as an effort to balance parents’ need to feel like their children will be prepared to respond if exposed to America’s ongoing epidemic of gun violence.
    

            Lockdown drills have become commonplace in schools across the nation. Forty states require the practice, according to data collected by Everytown for Gun Safety. While there is not enough data to show how many schools perform realistic drills by using actors and props, some parents in New York believe the state requires too many drills starting at a young age, resulting in children who are anxious, traumatized and afraid they will become victims of a shooting.

‘Petrifying’: Families weigh in on school lockdown drills


            Robert Murtfeld, of Manhattan, a father of two elementary school age children, told CNN he became alarmed when he learned young children were drilling for active shooter scenarios. He became even more concerned after hearing from a parent whose child had come home and started locking windows and doors, thinking a bad person was going to come inside the house.
    

            “About a month later, that same five-year-old asked their parents what would happen if a bullet entered their body,” Murtfeld said. “So why is a five-year-old thinking about this instead of thinking about learning math and English?”
    

            In a major win for parents and proponents of the change, the rules approved by the Board of Regents also will now require schools to notify school staff and students about planned drills ahead of time, in addition to notifying parents a week in advance. The Regents set educational policy for the state’s school districts, including New York City Public Schools, the largest in the US with over 1 million students.
    

            While Murtfeld understands concern around the issue of gun violence, especially in places where gun laws are not as strict as they are in New York, he says data shows the likelihood of a child being in a school shooting is quite low.
    

            “Since Columbine 25 years ago, three generations of students have been subjected to this,” Murtfeld said.
    

            Experts like Sarah Burd-Sharps, senior director of research at Everytown For Gun Safety, agree. She says a deep culture of fear began to develop in the post Columbine High School shooting era, forcing parents, students and teachers to feel like they needed to “take action” in the absence of significant gun control.
    

            Burd-Sharps said there is not enough research yet to confirm the value of drills involving students or evidence to show they help protect the school community. However, evidence is mounting the drills can have lasting harm on young people, leaving them to deal with anxiety and trauma as well as the normalization of gun violence.
    

            “As a parent I absolutely share the desire to keep a school safe, but what I would say is even though the number of incidents is extremely low, we are raising a generation of school children who are shaped by our gun violence epidemic, and drills are just one more reminder of this crisis,” Burd-Sharps said.

            According to data collected by Everytown for Gun Safety, there have been at least 118 instances involving gunfire on school grounds in 2024, on track to double what it was 10 years ago. But despite the increase in gun violence across the country, school shootings are still relatively rare and account for less than 1% of the more than 44,000 annual US gun deaths, according to the data.
    

            “There is absolutely no reason for those types of drills,” Burd-Sharps said. “The drills do not make it more likely that they will understand or respond better to anything. It only makes it more likely that it will traumatize them.”
    

            Focusing on training staff on how to respond and adding other safety measures such as locks on doors and windows is a better way to respond, in addition to ensuring schools know how to implement crisis intervention and provide help and resources to students who may be isolated, according to Burd-Sharps.
    

            Stella Kaye, 17, a gun violence survivor of two school shootings at her high school in Denver, said the active shooter drills she’s experienced didn’t actually prepare her for the real thing.
    

            “This is us just simply sitting in a corner pretending like something is happening and pretending like this is going to do something in the event of an actual emergency,” said Kaye, a member of the Students Demand Action National Organizing Board and vice president of the Denver East High School Students Demand Action chapter. “For a lot of people in the actual emergency, that is not what occurs.”
    

            The new rules will go into effect in the upcoming school year. All New York schools, including nonpublic schools, will still be required to conduct a minimum of eight evacuation drills and four lockdown drills every school year.
    

            The push to limit the number of lockdown drills is expected to continue in the upcoming legislative session in Albany, where parents are hopeful a bill to reduce the minimum number of drills from four to two will be passed into the law, further limiting students’ exposure to active shooter drills, and creating momentum for similar rule changes around the country.
    

            Democratic state Sen. Andrew Gounardes, who is sponsoring the legislation, said he is hopeful the bill and the recent rule changes will create momentum for similar changes in schools around the country.
    

            “Four is still too many,” said Gounardes, who represents parts of Brooklyn. “It normalizes a culture of violence and school shootings that we should not be normalizing.”

CNN_44,At least 10 dead including children as Israel blames Hezbollah for rocket attack in Golan Heights,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/lebanon-israel-golan-strikes-intl-latam/index.html,2024-07-28 03:53:00,world,"
            At least 10 people, including children, were killed when multiple rockets hit a village in the Golan Heights Saturday – in what Israel described as the deadliest attack against it since October 7.
    

            Israel said it had identified “approximately 30 projectiles” crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory and blamed the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah for the barrage. Hezbollah rejected the accusation, saying it “firmly denied” firing the rockets.
    

            At least 29 people were injured in the attack in Majdal Shams, a village in the Israeli-controlled northern Golan Heights that is home to a large Druze community.
    

            Some 20,000 Druze Arabs live in the Golan Heights, an area Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 war and which is considered occupied territory under international law and UN Security Council resolutions. Most Druze there identify as Syrian and have rejected offers of Israeli citizenship.
    

            Among the sites hit was a soccer field where children and teenagers had been playing, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari said. He described the attack as “the deadliest attack on Israeli civilians since October 7.”
    

            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he was cutting short his visit to the United States and returning to Israel because of the attack, the Israeli Government Press Office announced.
    

            Israeli President Isaac Herzog decried the attack as a “terrible and shocking disaster” and vowed Israel would “defend” its citizens.
    

            “Hezbollah terrorists brutally attacked and murdered children today, whose only crime was going out to play soccer. They did not return,” he said in a post on X.
    

            “The world cannot continue to sit in silence in the face of (Hezbollah leader Hassan) Nasrallah’s terror attacks, which come at the behest of the empire of evil in Iran. The State of Israel will firmly defend its citizens and its sovereignty.”
    

            Israel’s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service reported that the fatalities included “teenagers and young adults” whose ages ranged from 10 to 20 years old. It said a further 29 people were injured, six of whom were in a serious condition.
    

            The Lebanese government said it condemned “all acts of violence and attacks against all civilians,” after the rocket attack, Lebanese state news agency NNA reported.
    

            The government also called for “an immediate cessation of hostilities on all fronts” and said that “targeting civilians constitutes a blatant violation of international law and is contrary to the principles of humanity,” NNA reported.
    

            Adeeb Safadi, a resident of Majdal Shams, told CNN that those killed in the rocket attack on the soccer field were all Druze children from local villages, boys between the ages of eight and 15.
    

            “They were attending a football training class with a coach whose fate is still unknown. Ten of the killed have been identified, but there are more who were torn apart and are still unidentified,” said Safadi, who lives some 600 meters from the site of the attack.
    

            He said he saw black smoke and heard an explosion. About four seconds after the explosion, he heard sirens warning people about an imminent attack.
    

            Evacuation helicopters, ambulances and intensive care vehicles have been dispatched to the scene.

            Idan Avshalom, a senior medic from MDA said, “We arrived at a soccer field and saw destruction and objects on fire. Injured people were lying on the grass and the sights were dire. We immediately began triaging the injured, some of the injured were sent to local clinics and our teams were also directed to the clinics. During the incident there were additional alerts and the medical treatment of the injured is still ongoing.”
    

            Ziv Medical Center in the northern Israeli city of Safed said it had received 26 injured people, five of whom were admitted to the trauma center. Rambam Hospital in Haifa has also opened an information center to help people get information about their loved ones.
    

            Israeli police said that munitions have fallen in “multiple sites in the northern Golan.”
    

            Police are “securing the area and searching for additional remnants to eliminate any further risk to the public,” the Police Spokesperson’s Unit said.
    

            Netanyahu was being updated on the situation and is holding a security consultation with his military secretary General Roman Gofman, his office said in a statement. It added he would hold a security situation assessment with all the heads of the defense establishment later on Saturday.
    

            While the IDF has blamed the attack on Hezbollah, which has been involved in an increasing number of cross-border attacks with Israel in recent months, the militant group denied involvement in a statement on Telegram Saturday.
    

            “The Islamic Resistance in Lebanon firmly denies the allegations made by some enemy media outlets and various media platforms regarding the targeting of Majdal Shams,” it said.
    

            “We confirm that the Islamic Resistance has no connection to the incident whatsoever and firmly denies all false claims in this regard,” the statement continued.
    

            Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 during the Six-Day War and annexed the land in 1981. There are approximately 53,000 people living in the narrow strip of land, split almost evenly between Israeli settlers and Syrian Druze, as well as a small population of Alawites.
    

This is a developing story. More to come.

CNN_45,"Like ‘little bombs,’ soda cans are exploding on Southwest flights. Here’s why",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/weather/southwest-airlines-soda-cans-heat-climate/index.html,2024-07-28 03:00:00,world,"
            A routine part of the job for Southwest Airlines flight attendants is turning into a dangerous mess as a searing summer heat and the airline’s beverage management practices have made soda cans volatile mid-flight.
    

            There were more than 100 reports of soda cans exploding on flights in June, Southwest flight attendant union president Bill Bernal told CNN, some of which have injured flight attendants. Bernal predicted nearly three times as many reports of exploding cans by the end of July.
    

            The issue has been happening “for years,” but this year has had more incidents than normal, he added.
    

            Southwest Airlines wouldn’t comment on the number of incidents and injuries or their nature, but confirmed to CNN the issue is occurring.
    

            The hazard is unique to Southwest because the airline doesn’t serve perishable items and so it isn’t required to have refrigerated trucks or storage, CBS News reported. This can expose the cans to extreme conditions heat at several airports in the hottest parts of the country: Las Vegas, Phoenix, Houston and Dallas.
    

            The cans containing carbonated beverages are under such immense heat-driven pressure they are like “little bombs” capable of rupturing with the slightest movement, even when they aren’t being opened, according to Kate Biberdorf, a chemistry professor at the University of Texas at Austin.
    

            “I don’t want to say that to scare people, but that’s really what you should think of them as,” Biberdorf cautioned.
    

            “We’re aware of the issue and have been taking steps to keep onboard beverages cooler, especially in our airports experiencing extreme temperatures,” a Southwest spokesperson said in a written statement.
    

            Extreme heat has been plentiful this year as fossil fuel pollution drives more frequent and intense heat waves. Around 100 cities in the US are experiencing their hottest summer on record so far, including Southwest hubs Phoenix and Las Vegas.
    

            Southwest and the union representing its flight attendants told CNN they were working together on efforts to mitigate the issue.
    

            Those efforts include using refrigerated provisioning trucks and trailers for transportation and storage of carbonated beverages and using temperature guns to measure cans and determine if they can be loaded onto an aircraft safely.
    

            “Both the short term and long term fixes are actual engineered fixes that should eventually all but eradicate the exploding can issue at Southwest Airlines,” Bernal said.
    

            Extreme heat and carbonation don’t mix. Even if the issue goes away at Southwest, it can happen anywhere.
    

            The carbonation in a soda or sparkling water is produced by adding carbon dioxide gas to a liquid base, mixing it together and sealing it up.
    

            The carbon dioxide fights to return to its original gas state, which is why soda and other carbonated beverages are bubbly. It’s also why any carbonated drink goes flat when left open for a considerable time – all the carbon dioxide gas leaves the liquid and escapes into the air.
    

            When a can of soda is exposed to heat, the carbon dioxide gas in the mixture separates and expands, exerting pressure on the can from the inside, Kate Biberdorf told CNN.
    

            Soda cans are engineered and designed to handle reaching a pressure level between three to six times the can’s normal pressure, according to Biberdorf.
    

            But if that pressure level is exceeded or if there’s any small flaw in the manufacturing of the can, it could become a “little bomb,” Biberdorf explained.
    

            During beverage service, if a Southwest flight attendant handles or opens a can where the pressure has built up close to its literal breaking point, it could easily rupture, Biberdorf said.
    

            Altitude likely isn’t a factor, as the cabins of aircraft are pressurized to match conditions on Earth’s surface.
    

            But what’s happening with Southwest’s cans is the same thing that could happen to any unopened carbonated beverage can left in a hot car.
    

            “In the summer, people will store (cans) in the car and it’s usually ok, but as soon as you start moving, you’ve added a little bit of extra force – maybe it slams against the side (of the car) – and then it explodes,” Biberdorf explained.

CNN_46,How the Harris 2024 shake-up could affect House and Senate races,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/politics/harris-house-senate-what-matters/index.html,2024-07-28 05:00:00,politics,"
A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.


            Democrats’ substitution of Vice President Kamala Harris for President Joe Biden on the ballot in November obviously resets the presidential race.

            It could also have a major impact on House and Senate races. Both chambers of Congress are narrowly divided at the moment; Republicans hold a slim advantage in the House and Democrats narrowly control the Senate. Either chamber could go either way in November.
    

            I went to Simone Pathe, a senior Washington editor for CNN Politics and the author of an occasional series, “The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip.” Read the most recent version here.
    

            We talked by email about the state of play for the House and Senate and how the shake-up in the presidential race might change things.
    

WOLF: The presidential race got a total reset when President Biden dropped out. Does that reset anything in the battle for the Senate?


PATHE: The extent to which the change at the top of the ticket shifts Senate races will be one of the most interesting things to watch over the coming months.
    

            Remember that a big part of the pressure on Biden to step aside was the warning from Democratic lawmakers about his drag on down-ballot races. So now the big question is whether the Democratic brand itself is toxic or whether that was a particular vulnerability attached to Biden.
    

            It’s still early days of this new political reality, but there are some early signals of how Harris as the nominee could be giving Democratic incumbents a sense of relief.
    

            For starters, the new CNN poll released Wednesday shows Harris doing better against former President Donald Trump than Biden did with some key demographic groups — young voters, female voters and Black voters. (The topline showed no clear leader between Harris and Trump, but that in itself could be good news for Democrats given that the margin-of-error finding was closer than some earlier CNN polling of the Biden-Trump matchup.)
    

            You can also look at candidates’ behavior.
    

            Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who’s running for reelection in a key battleground, didn’t attend Biden’s first post-debate rally in Madison. But she was very publicly with Harris on Tuesday — greeting her as she boarded Air Force Two and delivering remarks at her rally in Milwaukee.
    

            I was covering Baldwin in Wisconsin in the days before Biden announced he was dropping out of the race, and she was clearly in a bind. Unlike some of her fellow vulnerable colleagues, Baldwin had not called for Biden to step aside, but reiterated that she’d heard concerns from her constituents. After Biden exited, she quickly endorsed Harris and called Biden’s decision “an incredible act of patriotism.”
    

            Not everyone has publicly endorsed Harris, though — and that’s telling too.
    

Sen. Jon Tester, the most vulnerable incumbent up for reelection, has not. He’s running in a very different state from Baldwin. (Wisconsin is No. 8 on CNN’s list of seats most likely to flip, whereas Montana is No. 2.)
    

            Given Trump’s strength in Montana, Tester was always going to have a tough race regardless of who the party nominates for president, and it’s not necessarily clear that the voter groups among whom Harris is doing better than Biden will help Democrats all that much in a conservative state like Montana, where she’ll be tarred as a California liberal.
    

            The Senate GOP campaign arm put out a memo this week in which it acknowledged that attacks on Biden’s mental fitness didn’t necessarily translate to down-ballot races. For that reason, the NRSC (National Republican Senatorial Committee) argued, Harris may be a bigger drag on Senate Democrats because they can paint her policies as extreme. (Calling her a “border czar,” which, as our colleague Priscilla Alvarez noted, hasn’t actually been her role, fits right into the biggest themes of GOP attack ads — the border and immigration.)
    

            Even in a more evenly divided state like Pennsylvania, the GOP Senate nominee is already digging up 2019 footage of Harris to cast her as “the most liberal (presidential) nominee in US history.”
    

WOLF: If the Senate map this year favors Republicans, is it fair to say that the House map favors one party or the other this year?


PATHE: The House playing field is very different from the Senate’s. The Senate map favors the GOP because the seats that are up for reelection are either in Trump states or closely contested battlegrounds.
    

            But in the House, where there are many fewer competitive districts than there used to be, much of the playing field is concentrated in two traditionally blue states — New York and California. (There are others scattered around in Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Michigan, North Carolina and New Mexico, among other places.)
    

            The low-hanging fruit for both parties are the races in so-called crossover districts – where a Republican represents a district Biden won or a Democrat represents a district Trump won.
    

            And because Republicans are on defense in more of those crossover seats — and there are so many of them in California and New York during a presidential year — there’s an argument to be made that Democrats could pick up the net gain of four seats they need right there.
    

            But of course, it’s more complicated than that because Democrats also represent crossover districts that they have to defend. So even if they pick up seats in California, for example, they could also lose seats in Maine or Alaska districts, for example, where Trump is likely to win.
    

WOLF: The House is just as closely divided as the Senate. What are the dynamics that will affect control of the House? 


PATHE: House races are typically more nationalized than Senate races because the candidates are lesser known; therefore, it’s harder for them to separate themselves from their party and the top of the ticket.
    

            But partisanship isn’t everything — that’s how we got to the current situation, where Republicans won some New York and California districts in 2022 that voted for Biden in 2020.
    

            Still, the dynamics that affect control of the House are likely to be shaped by the national environment in the fall — what does the presidential race look like? Are economic concerns still top of mind? Is there some new foreign crisis making voters feel uneasy? A lot can happen in three-and-a-half months.
    

            But, of course, candidate quality and fundraising also matter. A bad candidate without money will have a harder time taking advantage of favorable national winds. And on the flip side, strong candidates with independent brands can withstand headwinds.
    

WOLF: Senate races in Ohio and Montana feature sitting Democratic senators running in states that go reliably red in presidential elections. Is there any indication voters are interested in ticket-splitting this year?


PATHE: Yes, there are lots of indications, with the caveat that there hasn’t been much Senate polling that meets CNN standards that captures the tumultuous past month in American politics.
    

            But even before Biden dropped out of the race, Democratic senators were consistently outperforming the top of the ticket. In an era of increasingly nationalized elections, that separation has been one of the most fascinating dynamics of the 2024 election, and there are a few explanations for what could be going on.
    

            Many of these incumbents, particularly Tester and Ohio’s Sherrod Brown, are very well known in their states.
    

            In Ohio, for example, Brown’s campaign is running an ad that features voters imitating the senator’s gravelly voice — it speaks to just how familiar he is there. And in Montana, Tester doesn’t hesitate to portray himself as a seven-fingered dirt farmer.
    

            Those strong brands are the theory of the case for how Democrats think they can hold on in those states — especially against GOP recruits that they view as flawed.
    

            And this is where money comes in. Democrats’ significant fundraising advantage has allowed them to define themselves and their opponents early in the race. Brown, for example, spent a whopping $18 million in the last quarter (which ended June 30).
    

            In fact, as our ace campaign finance team has noted, four of the party’s most endangered incumbents — Tester, Baldwin, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Jacky Rosen of Nevada – spent at least $10 million during that three-month period.
    

            That could change as Republican recruits —– many of whom are wealthy businessmen — put more of their own money into these races and become better known.
    

            There’s also a theory, which would fly in the face of the trend away from ticket-splitting, that some voters who are planning to vote for Trump may be looking for a check on the executive branch and are therefore entertaining voting for Democratic senators. But that’s just a theory, and it’ll have to be tested now that there’s a new presidential matchup.
    

WOLF: The presidential primary process is over, but we’re still in the thick of statewide primaries for House and Senate races. What are the looming questions that will be answered in the key states where primaries remain?


PATHE: The top Senate matchups are effectively set, even if there are a few outstanding primaries in Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin.
    

            The biggest-name Republicans in each of those races, for example, has the backing of the national GOP and, more importantly for a primary, Trump.
    

            Remaining House primaries should be a bit more consequential because not all matchups in competitive seats are settled yet.
    

WOLF: Democrats are expected to lose one Senate seat, in West Virginia, no matter what happens. Is there any race where they are on offense and could conceivably make up for that likely loss?


PATHE: Democrats are really only on offense in two places — Texas and Florida. Both had been at the bottom of CNN’s list of seats most likely to flip until April, when Maryland (another GOP target) was added to the list and Florida fell off.
    

            Florida isn’t necessarily off the table for Democrats — GOP Sen. Rick Scott, despite his millions, has never won election by more than about a point. And Democrats hope that an abortion measure on the ballot could help former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell defeat him.
    

            But the party’s better prospect is in Texas, where Rep. Colin Allred is putting up a formidable challenge to GOP Sen. Ted Cruz. Allred’s campaign has repeatedly raised more than Cruz’s principal campaign account, and there’s been some polling that shows a close contest for a state that votes red. Cruz led by just 3 points, for example, in a recent University of Houston/YouGov poll.
    

            However, we’ve seen Democratic challenges in red states generate enormous fundraising and energy before — and then fall short at the ballot box. Beto O’Rourke’s 2018 race against Cruz and Jaime Harrison’s 2020 race against South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham come to mind.
    

            Democrats argue that Allred — who first came to Congress by flipping a GOP-held seat — is a different kind of candidate, but it’ll be worth watching to see whether that momentum can translate to votes.
    

WOLF: If there’s one Senate race that could be a bellwether for the country as a whole, which one is it and why?


PATHE: That’s a great question — I’d say maybe Michigan. It’s one of the so-called “blue wall” states that Trump won in 2016 and Biden won back for Democrats in 2020.
    

            And it’s also an open seat this year because Sen. Debbie Stabenow is retiring. That means there isn’t an incumbent who starts with the clear advantage because of statewide name ID, which I think makes the race a better sample of how the national winds are blowing down ballot.
    

            Still, neither candidate is unfamiliar either — it’s likely to be a matchup between Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin and former House Intelligence Chairman Mike Rogers.

CNN_47,"‘Deadpool & Wolverine’ fuels an already-hot summer box office, opens at $96 million",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/business/deadpool-and-wolverine-box-office-opening-weekend/index.html,2024-07-28 04:35:00,us,"
            One of the year’s most hotly anticipated movies, “Deadpool & Wolverine,” is so far delivering on its promised hype with $96 million in domestic sales in its opening night, according to Comscore data.
    

            The summer blockbuster is on track to exceed $200 million domestically for the weekend, say industry analysts. It would be a record-breaking feat for the franchise.
    

            “It is a major industry benchmark for an R-rated movie to open (at) $200 million, literally unheard of until this title,” said Daniel Loria, editorial director at Box Office Pro.
    

            The first Deadpool movie set the record for the highest grossing opening weekend when it was released in 2016 with roughly $132 million, and “Deadpool 2” cinched the second-place spot with $125 million in domestic sales in 2018. But even adjusted for inflation, both films pale in comparison with the third installation’s anticipated $200 to $220 million, according to Loria.
    

            An opening weekend of this magnitude would cement “Deadpool & Wolverine” alongside some of Marvel’s highest-grossing flagship films, including 2012’s “The Avengers” ($207 million) and 2018’s “Black Panther” ($202 million).
    

            “This would rank among the top 10 openings of all-time and marks the sixth-highest Friday ever reported at the box office,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. “This also marks the highest opening weekend for Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman and (director) Shawn Levy.”
    

            Dergarabedian added the promotional efforts behind the film, its critical success and audience enthusiasm have “made this a late July weekend for the cinematic history books.”
    

            According to Box Office Pro data, the excitement surrounding “Deadpool & Wolverine” has propelled demand for theater showings, increasing the number of times the movie is being screened at movie theaters across the country. It currently holds 43% of the showtime market share across the United States.
    

            The movie has received a 97% Audience Score on Rotten Tomatoes, the second highest for a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie behind “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” and secured an ‘A’ CinemaScore, a mark on par with its two predecessors.
    

            Although the summer box office was off to a sputtering start after a tepid spring, there have been several blockbusters invigorating the industry.
    

            “Since June, there has been a nonstop parade of over-performing blockbusters starting with ‘Bad Boys: Ride Or Die,’ and continuing with ‘Inside Out 2,’ ‘A Quiet Place: Day One,’ ‘Despicable Me 4,’ ‘Twisters,’ and now ‘Deadpool & Wolverine,’ making for one of the most notable string of hits in summer movie history,” said Dergarabedian.
    

            Last week, Disney announced “Inside Out 2” has become the highest grossing animated film of all time, raking in $1.46 billion at the global box office and dethroning former record holder, 2019’s “Frozen 2.”
    

            Until the film’s release on June 16, domestic sales had been lagging more than 25% behind 2023’s performance, according to Comscore data. But less than three weeks after its release, the year-over-year domestic box office revenue deficit shrunk from 27% to 19%.
    

            Now, the deficit stands at 16.9% and it could keep shrinking depending on how “Deadpool & Wolverine” performs. This time last year, “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” was the top film with a domestic gross of more than $574 million. Meanwhile, the enduring success of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” — both released on July 21 — helped to push the cumulative 2023 domestic box office revenue past $9 billion, the highest it’s been since the pandemic.
    

            Although analysts are predicting a more lukewarm total for 2024, the successful summer movie slate is positioning the industry to further close the gap.
    

            “This weekend’s performance certainly makes us more optimistic for the box office prospects for 2024, but we have a long way to go before the end of the year and year-over-year comparisons will keep us on a seesaw of ups and downs,” said Dergarabedian, estimating the full-year box office will land between $8.2 and $8.7 billion. “The fact that we will likely wind up at $8 billion plus, considering how weak first quarter and April were in terms of revenue, is quite impressive.”

CNN_48,Children and teenagers among 11 dead in Golan Heights rocket attack that Israel blames on Hezbollah,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/lebanon-israel-golan-strikes-intl-latam/index.html,2024-07-28 04:50:00,world,"
            At least 11 people, including children, were killed when multiple rockets hit a village in the Golan Heights Saturday – in what Israel described as the deadliest attack against it since October 7.
    

            Israel said it had identified “approximately 30 projectiles” crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory and blamed the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah for the barrage. Hezbollah rejected the accusation, saying it “firmly denied” firing the rockets.
    

            At least 29 people were injured in the attack in Majdal Shams, a village in the Israeli-controlled northern Golan Heights that is home to a large Druze community.
    

            Some 20,000 Druze Arabs live in the Golan Heights, an area Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 war and which is considered occupied territory under international law and UN Security Council resolutions. Most Druze there identify as Syrian and have rejected offers of Israeli citizenship.

            Among the sites hit in the attack was a soccer field where children and teenagers had been playing, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari said. He described the attack as “the deadliest attack on Israeli civilians since October 7.”
    

            “This is a very serious incident and we will act accordingly,” he said.
    

            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he was cutting short his visit to the United States and returning to Israel because of the attack, the Israeli Government Press Office announced, adding he would convene a security cabinet meeting immediately upon his return. Netanyahu was originally meant to fly back later on Saturday.
    

            Israeli President Isaac Herzog decried the attack as a “terrible and shocking disaster” and vowed Israel would “defend” its citizens.
    

            “Hezbollah terrorists brutally attacked and murdered children today, whose only crime was going out to play soccer. They did not return,” he said in a post on X.
    

            “The world cannot continue to sit in silence in the face of (Hezbollah leader Hassan) Nasrallah’s terror attacks, which come at the behest of the empire of evil in Iran. The State of Israel will firmly defend its citizens and its sovereignty.”
    

            The attack on Saturday is a major escalation in what has been an extremely volatile period in the border area. Israel and Hezbollah have been trading fire across the border for almost 10 months and regional leaders have been warning the conflict is reaching a boiling point.
    

            Officially, Lebanon and Israel are – and have been for decades – in a state of war, but the recent tensions have so far not escalated into a full-blown conflict.

            The situation escalated further in the past few weeks when Israel killed two high-ranking Hezbollah commanders – Sami Taleb Abdullah in May and Muhammed Neamah Naser in June – blaming them for directing terror attacks both before and after Hamas’ October 7 attacks from Gaza. Hezbollah retaliated by firing hundreds of missiles into Israel.
    

            The strikes have become more frequen in recent weeks and both Hezbollah and Israel are targeting sites deeper and deeper into each other’s territory.
    

            It is unclear how Israel will respond. The Government Press Office said Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant was conducting a situation assessment together with the IDF Chief of the General Staff and senior defense officials.
    

            Meanwhile, Netanyahu held a security consultation with his military secretary General Roman Gofman, and will hold a security situation assessment with all the heads of the defense establishment later on Saturday, his office said.
    

            The Lebanese government said after the attack that it condemned “all acts of violence and attacks against all civilians,” after the rocket attack, Lebanese state news agency NNA reported.
    

            The government also called for “an immediate cessation of hostilities on all fronts” and said that “targeting civilians constitutes a blatant violation of international law and is contrary to the principles of humanity,” NNA reported.
    

            Adeeb Safadi, a resident of Majdal Shams, told CNN that those killed in the rocket attack on the soccer field were all Druze children from local villages, boys between the ages of eight and 15.
    

            “They were attending a football training class with a coach whose fate is still unknown. Ten of the killed have been identified, but there are more who were torn apart and are still unidentified,” said Safadi, who lives some 600 meters from the site of the attack.
    

            He said he saw black smoke and heard an explosion. About four seconds after the explosion, he heard sirens warning people about an imminent attack.
    

            Evacuation helicopters, ambulances and intensive care vehicles have been dispatched to the scene.
    

            Israel’s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service reported that the fatalities included “teenagers and young adults” whose ages ranged from 10 to 20 years old. It said a further 29 people were injured, six of whom were in a serious condition.

            Idan Avshalom, a senior medic from MDA, said the team saw destruction and fire when arriving at the scene.
    

            “Injured people were lying on the grass and the sights were dire. We immediately began triaging the injured, some of the injured were sent to local clinics and our teams were also directed to the clinics,” he said, adding that there were additional alerts as they worked to save the injured.
    

            Ziv Medical Center in the northern Israeli city of Safed said it had received 26 injured people, five of whom were admitted to the trauma center. Rambam Hospital in Haifa has also opened an information center to help people get information about their loved ones.
    

            Israeli police said that munitions have fallen in “multiple sites in the northern Golan.”
    

            Police are “securing the area and searching for additional remnants to eliminate any further risk to the public,” the Police Spokesperson’s Unit said.
    

            While the IDF has blamed the attack on Hezbollah, the militant group denied involvement in a statement on Telegram Saturday.
    

            “The Islamic Resistance in Lebanon firmly denies the allegations made by some enemy media outlets and various media platforms regarding the targeting of Majdal Shams,” it said.
    

            “We confirm that the Islamic Resistance has no connection to the incident whatsoever and firmly denies all false claims in this regard,” the statement continued.
    

            The IDF said its analysis showed the rocket launched at Majdal Shams was “carried out from an area located north of the village of Chebaa in southern Lebanon.”
    

            Hagari, the IDF spokesperson, said Hezbollah was lying when denying it was behind the attack. “Our intelligence is clear – Hezbollah is responsible for killing innocent children. Ten-year-old children and once again, the brutality of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization was exposed,” he said.
    

            Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 during the Six-Day War and annexed the land in 1981. There are approximately 53,000 people living in the narrow strip of land, split almost evenly between Israeli settlers and Syrian Druze, as well as a small population of Alawites.
    

This is a developing story. More to come.

CNN_49,The showdown that wasn’t: Ariarne Titmus easily bests Katie Ledecky in hotly anticipated rematch,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/sport/katie-ledecky-ariarne-titmus-swimming-paris-olympics/index.html,2024-07-28 04:50:00,world,"
            The race that everyone turned out to see never really got going.
    

            The women’s 400-meter freestyle race, billed as a rematch between rivals Ariarne Titmus of Australia and Katie Ledecky of the US, was one of the most hotly anticipated contests of the first full day of competition in the Paris Games. Titmus had defeated Ledecky three years ago in Tokyo, handing the American her first ever individual Olympic defeat.
    

            While the 400m is not Ledecky’s best race, she finished ahead of Titmus in a semifinal heat. American hopes were raised as anticipation built in La Défense Arena, just outside of Paris.
    

            But the matchup wasn’t really much of a contest at all. Titmus ended Ledecky’s hopes of revenge, dominating the race and finishing almost a full second ahead of Canada’s Summer McIntosh, who took silver.
    

            Ledecky finished a distant third, about three seconds off the pace.
    

            “I’m just happy to get the result for myself, and I’m so honored to be part of the race and be alongside legends like Katie,” Titmus told reporters post-race. “I look up to her so much as an athlete, and it is certainly not a rivalry beyond the races. I really respect her as a person, her longevity in the sport. It’s nice to catch up and have a chat.”
    

            “It’s fun racing the best in the world. It gets the best out of me; it gets the best out of them. I really hope all the hype lived up to the expectation. I really hope that I put on a good show tonight and everyone enjoyed it.”
    

            The Australian led from the initial buzzer to the final touch of the wall. Ledecky, meanwhile, seemed to be slow out of the blocks, lagging in fourth for much of the first half of the race.
    

            As the crowd roared, it seemed like Ledecky was just unable to kick it into the next gear she needed to catch Titmus and McIntosh.
    

            “I mean, probably the top three, we probably all would say that we would have liked to have been a little faster,” Ledecky said after the race.
    

            “Everyone in that that field put up a great race,” she added. “Ariarne and Summer swam really, really well. I haven’t looked at how the whole race broke down. You know, I could only see it from my lane, but yeah, kudos on some great races, and I’m looking forward to the rest of the week.”
    

            Titmus said in the mixed zone that she felt herself fading toward the end of the race, but she showed no real signs of fatigue as she stretched her hand toward the wall.
    

            “I felt pretty good the whole way. I’ve no idea what my splits were, I started to feel it in the last hundred (meters),” she said. “But I left everything out there, I gave it everything I could. It’s probably not the time I was capable of, but living in the Village makes it hard for high performance. It’s not made for high performance. It’s about who can keep it together in the mind.”
    

            The result seems to put an end to the rivalry between the two swimmers for now. They will face off again in the 800-meter freestyle later on in the Games, but that race is one of Ledecky’s specialties and she’ll be favored. Titmus, meanwhile, will race in the 200-meter freestyle and Ledecky will also compete in the 1,500-meter freestyle – another one of her top events.
    

            Ledecky doesn’t see it as a rivalry anyhow.
    

            “I wouldn’t consider it a rivalry. I mean, I think it’s a friendship, if anything,” she said.
    

            “You know, we have a lot of respect for each other, and we love competing against each other. It brings the best out of each of us, and I’m sure, you know, pushes each of us in training, knowing that we have each other to race at these kinds of meets. So, yeah, it’s just competing against the best in the world.”

CNN_50,"Olympic moment of the day: Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz, tennis’ new favorite double act",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/sport/rafael-nadal-carlos-alcaraz-paris-olympics-tennis-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-28 04:30:00,world,"
            After all these years, Rafael Nadal is still finding new ways to win matches on his favorite tennis court.
    

            His latest victory on the French clay came alongside Carlos Alcaraz at the Paris Olympics, and together they formed a dream pairing – a two-for-the-price-of-one ticket for tennis fans and a moment that could only really happen at the Olympics.
    

            For close to two hours on Court Philippe-Chatrier – the site of Nadal’s 14 French Open titles and Alcaraz’s first just last month – the crowd fell hard for “Nadalcaraz,” providing frenzied support during the Spanish duo’s 7-6(7-4) 6-4 victory over Argentina’s Máximo González and Andrés Molteni.
    

            Saturday’s match was a rare opportunity to see two of the game’s biggest names, each at opposite ends of their career, on the same side of the net: Nadal with all the experience and sparkle of his 22 grand slam titles, and Alcaraz with his flourishing career and high-octane style of play.
    

            The victory against two seasoned doubles players was by no means easy, likely a sign of the limited time that Nadal and Alcaraz have spent training and playing together. But it was nonetheless an entertaining introduction to tennis’ new favorite double act.
    

            “It’s been an emotional night, an electrifying night, an amazing crowd,” Nadal told reporters. “Playing with Carlos on this court has been so special. We’re just super happy about the victory, that it’s given us the chance to keep going.”
    

            Nadal had already taken center stage at this year’s Olympics, chosen as one of the final torchbearers for Friday night’s opening ceremony.
    

            Less than 24 hours later, he was out on court putting on a different kind of show alongside Alcaraz, displaying sharpness and a deft touch at the net. The crowd in Philippe-Chatrier chanted his name throughout the contest, and one of the loudest roars came when he celebrated winning match point by pumping a ball into the stands.
    

            “Yesterday was a super emotional moment for me too and I can’t thank Paris and France enough for giving me that honor,” said Nadal. “The emotion’s still very high, so just enjoying every single moment.”
    

            The teams traded breaks of serve at the start of the Saturday’s match before becoming locked in a tight and lengthy first set. It wasn’t until midway through the first-set tie-break, following chants of “allez Les Blues” with the news that France had won gold in the rugby seven, that Nadal and Alcaraz edged ahead.
    

            Three straight points gave them a 6-3 lead, and Nadal seized the opening with a powerful backhand return down the line to conclude the set.
    

            That advantage looked to be disappearing as González and Molteni broke Nadal’s serve to take a 3-0 lead, but the Spaniards responded in style, reeling off the next 12 points in a row to get back on level terms at 3-3.
    

            Another break of serve followed two games later, which Alcaraz had engineered with a powerful cross-court backhand, before Nadal was able to serve out for the match.
    

            The 21-year-old Alcaraz, playing alongside his childhood idol, is on a stunning run of form having won titles at the French Open and Wimbledon in the past two months. He kicked off his Olympics singles campaign by defeating Lebanon’s Hady Habib 6-3 6-1 earlier on Saturday.
    

            That was his first taste of competing at the Olympics, while Nadal is hoping to add to the two golds he has won previously – singles in 2008 and doubles in 2016. Now entering the final stage of his career, it’s as much about enjoying the experience as it is winning titles for the 38-year-old.
    

            His all-star partnership with Alcaraz has only been a couple of weeks in the making, while González and Molteni, who have played and won titles together multiple times in their long careers, provided a difficult early test.
    

            “You see Rafa with his experience and charisma,” Nadal’s coach, Carlos Moyá, said before Saturday’s match. “And then you see Carlos, kind of like Rafa was aged 20 or 21, very expressive and effusive … hopefully they can keep going because it’s a partnership that tennis fans can fall in love with.”
    

            Nadal is still scheduled to play against Hungary’s Márton Fucsovics on Sunday, despite uncertainty around whether he will compete in the singles draw. If he does, he could face Novak Djokovic in the second round of the draw, and had a quick response when asked if he was ready for a last dance against his great rival.
    

            “Who said last dance?” was his response. And who can blame him when he’s still winning on his favorite court, all to the applause of thousands of fans?

CNN_51,Simone Biles ‘in a really good place’ as she prepares to further her extraordinary legacy at the Paris Olympics,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/sport/simone-biles-profile-paris-olympics-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-28 04:30:00,world,"
            Back in 2021, Simone Biles got a new tattoo inked across her collarbone: “And still I rise,” it reads, a nod to the poetry of Maya Angelou.
    

            Those four short words fittingly encapsulate the trajectory of Biles’ life and career, particularly as she took time away from gymnastics following the tumult of the Tokyo Olympics. There, a mental block known as “the twisties” forced her to withdraw from multiple events, including the women’s team final.
    

            “‘And still I rise’ is perfect,” Biles explains in her recently released Netflix documentary. “I feel like that’s kind of the epitome of my career and life story. I always rise to the occasion; even after all of the traumas and the downfalls, I’ve always risen.”
    

            Indeed, in the months leading up to the Paris Olympics, Biles has risen like never before. Not long ago, she had come close to walking away from gymnastics, but is now on the cusp of enhancing her status as the greatest athlete her sport has ever seen.
    

            This will be Biles’ third Olympics having won seven medals – four gold, one silver, and two bronze – in Rio and Tokyo. With 37 medals across the Olympics and world championships, Biles is already the most decorated gymnast – male or female – of all time.
    

            That medal haul could grow in Paris, where Biles is likely to compete in the women’s team event on Tuesday. Sunday marks her first appearance at the Games in qualifying for team and individual events.
    

            “Simone has been doing great. … She’s been in a really good place, and she’s been a great leader for this team,” Chellsie Memmel, the technical lead of the USA women’s gymnastics team, told reporters earlier this week.
    

            “Together as a team, they’re all really looking forward to the competition. It is kind of the redemption tour for four of the five from the previous Olympic Games. So they’re excited. They’re all coming together for it, and Simone has been a big part of that.”
    

            Memmel was alluding to Biles’ withdrawal from the team event in Tokyo three years after experiencing “the twisties” – a phenomenon which causes gymnasts to lose track of their body positions while twisting in mid-air.
    

            For athletes competing at such a high level of difficulty, the consequences can be catastrophic. At the time, Biles told her teammates that she didn’t want to “do something stupid” by continuing to compete in her current state. Earlier, she bailed out of her Amanar – a backward flipping vault supposed to have two and a half twists – having completed only one and a half twists.
    

            “If I could have run out of that stadium, I would have,” Biles says in her Netflix documentary, entitled “Simone Biles: Rising.” She describes the sensation as like a “mental block” and being “in jail with my own brain and body.”
    

            She went on to compete in the balance beam final in Tokyo – winning a bronze after swapping her twisting dismount for a flipping one due to the ongoing impact of the twisties – and later spoke openly about prioritizing her mental health. That would become a theme in the next part of Biles’ career, as she has often highlighted the benefits of regular therapy sessions.
    

            “I do admire what she’s done,” former Team USA gymnast Dominique Dawes, a gold medalist in the team event at the 1996 Olympics, recently told CNN’s Sanjay Gupta. “I think it’s wonderful that she listened to her inner voice in 2021.
    

            “A lot of people attacked her, but gymnasts normally, we don’t hear our inner voice. It’s usually drowned out by our coaches or by the national governing body, where they tell us, ‘You are doing this, no matter what.’”
    

            Biles’ return to competitive gymnastics has been long and painstaking. She was in and out of the gym for a year and a half after the Tokyo Olympics as she continued to grapple with the twisties, starting with gentle exercises on a trampoline.
    

            The 27-year-old took part in her first event since Tokyo in August last year, winning the Core Hydration Classic, and then won five medals at the world championships in Antwerp, Belgium, several weeks later.
    

            With that, she surpassed Belarusian Vitaly Scherbo’s record of 33 overall medals across the Olympics and the world championships, while also becoming the first woman to land the Yurchenko double pike vault at an international competition. Now named the Biles II, it was the fifth skill to be named in her honor.
    

            She has submitted another original element on the uneven bars, traditionally Biles’ weakest event, at these Olympics: a clear hip circle forward with one-and-a-half turns to handstand, according to the International Gymnastics Federation, a variation of a skill named after former Canadian gymnast Wilhelm Weiler.
    

            More success has come this year, with Biles winning a record-extending ninth national title last month. The Olympics have arrived at an intriguing chapter in her career, and in Paris Biles will have the opportunity to complete an extraordinary arc of redemption.
    

            “She didn’t have that quitter’s mentality that a lot of people said she had,” added Dawes. “She’s now persevered, she’s coming back, and more than likely, she’s going to lead this team to gold.”
    

            With so much attention on her return to the sport, it’s easy to lose focus from some of the bigger challenges that Biles has had to face.
    

            She has testified that she was one of more than 140 female athletes sexually abused by former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar – later convicted and sentenced in a Michigan state court to up to 175 years in prison – and in “Simone Biles: Rising,” she speaks candidly about race, her biological mother’s substance abuse and spending time in foster care.
    

            A senior member of the US team, Biles is a role model for young athletes both in and out of the gym. Her focus now is on adding to her legacy in Paris, and at 27, she is already set to be the oldest female American gymnast to compete at a Games in more than 70 years.
    

            Above all, these Olympics are perhaps a timely reminder to enjoy the grace and genius of Simone Biles while you can. And if her recent performances are anything to go by, then she will only continue to rise in Paris.

CNN_53,One of the biggest cartel busts in recent memory began with an act of betrayal,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/us/el-mayo-sinaloa-cartel-mexico-enterprise/index.html,2024-07-28 05:47:00,us,"
            How did an alleged cartel kingpin who evaded capture for more than half a century end up in the hands of US federal agents?
    

            According to officials, it started with an act of betrayal.
    

            Details are still emerging about what led last week to one of the most significant and stunning cartel busts in recent memory.
    

            US officials who’ve spoken with CNN say a key player in the operation to arrest Sinaloa cartel co-founder Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada was another major cartel figure who was arrested beside him.
    

            Joaquín Guzmán López, one of the sons of convicted cartel boss Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, duped Zambada and orchestrated their arrest, officials told CNN.
    

            Zambada, 76, thought he and Guzmán López were flying to northern Mexico to look at real estate, officials said. But instead, their small private plane landed north of the border near El Paso, Texas, where US authorities were waiting on the tarmac.
    

            But how was Guzmán López able to pull off the act of deception officials have described? And why did he turn on Zambada?
    

            So far, we haven’t heard either man’s account of what happened. Zambada pleaded not guilty to all charges in his first federal court appearance Friday. His attorney hasn’t responded to CNN’s request for comment, but he did share one detail with the Los Angeles Times.
    

            “I have no comment except to state that he did not surrender voluntarily,” attorney Frank Perez said. He went on to the tell the newspaper that Zambada was “brought against his will.”
    

            Guzmán López, 38, is expected to appear in federal court Tuesday in Chicago, his attorney, Jeffrey Lichtman, told CNN.
    

            Lichtman said in an email that he’d appear in court with Guzmán López and added, “I’m looking forward to seeing Joaquin and working on the case with him.” He declined further comment.
    

            One cartel expert told CNN he’s dubious of some details officials have shared.
    

            “It would not surprise me at all if the story changes from today to tomorrow, or next week,” said InSight Crime’s Steven Dudley, who’s spent more than a decade investigating drug trafficking and organized crime.
    

            And as reporters pressed for answers in a contentious press conference Friday, Mexico’s president suggested he, too, has many questions about what occurred.
    

            “The government of the United States has to give a complete report. It can’t be just general statements,” President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said. “There has to be transparency.”
    

            This much is clear: The arrests of Zambada and Guzmán López mark a major development in decades-long efforts to capture and prosecute alleged cartel bosses. And the details revealed so far about what led to this dramatic moment offer a telling glimpse into the inner workings of what authorities describe as one of the world’s most notorious and nefarious criminal enterprises.
    

            It wasn’t the first time authorities had Zambada in their sights.
    

            In a 2010 interview with the Mexican magazine Proceso, Zambada said Mexico’s military had come close to capturing him at least four times before.
    

            “I fled through the highlands, where I know the branches, the streams, the rocks, everything. They catch me if I am still or if I am careless, like El Chapo,” he said.
    

            At the time, Zambada told Proceso that fear about being captured weighed on him constantly.
    

            “I’m terrified that they’ll lock me up,” he said.
    

            That 2010 interview was one of his last known public appearances for the notably lower-profile Zambada. His name surged into international headlines in 2018 and 2019 during the high-profile trial of Guzmán, whose lawyer argued that Zambada was the cartel’s true leader.
    

            Lichtman, the defense attorney, also represented the elder Guzmán and alleged at the time that Zambada had bribed the Mexican government to frame El Chapo and remain free to run the cartel.
    

            In 2021, US authorities raised the reward for information leading to Zambada’s arrest to $15 million.
    

            Over the years, Zambada’s storied ability to evade capture was referenced in narcocorrido ballads about him. The 2022 corrido “Señor Zambada,” performed by El Fantasma and Enigma Norteño from Zambada’s perspective, includes the lines: “I know very well that they want to catch me, that the government wanted to lock me up. But they are going to keep wanting that, because no matter how much they look, they are not going to find me.”
    

            His elusive reputation also caught the attention of his enemies, former Drug Enforcement Administration agent Mike Vigil told CNN.
    

            “Mayo Zambada, prior to (Thursday) and over 50 years of involvement in the drug trade had never been captured, never served any time,” Vigil said, “so he is highly respected even by his rivals.”
    

            Dudley of InSight Crime pointed to this aspect of Zambada’s past when he told CNN en Español he was skeptical of accounts that painted the Sinaloa cartel leader as an unwitting victim who was tricked into being captured.
    

            “I’m not 100% convinced that’s what happened. I see in El Mayo Zambada a person who’s older. He’s 76. I see a person who’s also experienced, a person who knows exactly when and from where any deception is coming,” Dudley said. “That’s why he’s never stepped foot in a jail until yesterday. So I have my doubts. That is to say, I think that we’re still missing information.”
    

            Officials who spoke with CNN said Zambada boarded a plane with Guzmán López Thursday thinking they’d be inspecting property together near the border. Zambada didn’t realize US investigators had exploited a rift in the Sinaloa cartel, one official said, and that Guzmán López was in fact helping with Zambada’s capture.
    

            A long-simmering power struggle between Zambada and El Chapo’s sons, also known as the Chapitos, was about to boil over.
    

            Agents from Homeland Security Investigations, which led the operation, were skeptical at first when Guzmán López made the offer, an official familiar with the operation told CNN.
    

            But as the plane they were flying in landed at the Santa Teresa airport near El Paso, Texas, on Thursday, federal agents were waiting.
    

            One worker at the airport told Reuters that he saw a Beechcraft King Air land Thursday afternoon on the runway, where federal agents were already waiting.
    

            “Two individuals got off the plane… and were calmly taken into custody,” said the man, who declined to share his name out of concern for his safety.
    

            “It seemed like a pretty calm, arranged thing,” he added.
    

            The entire operation, one source told CNN, went off surprisingly smoothly given the gravity of the arrests and the disruption it could cause to drug trafficking from Mexico.

What we know about the Sinaloa cartel and its leaders


            Now that Zambada and Guzmán López are in US custody, authorities are ready to make the case against them.
    

            Both Zambada and Guzmán López face charges in the US for allegedly leading the cartel’s criminal operations, including its “deadly fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking networks,” US Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement after the arrests.
    

            Top US officials trumpeted the arrests as a major victory. But some analysts were more measured in their assessment of the potential impact.
    

            “It’s a historic capture, of course, and symbolic. But is it going to create a collateral effect or have an impact on drug trafficking? I really doubt that,” Dudley said. “As much because El Mayo had pulled back already from the day-to-day operations, and the world of drug trafficking is really now a different world from when he started. It’s much more decentralized. It’s much more like a franchise. There are contractors, subcontractors, other contractors. There are many parts that can be easily replaced.”
    

            Speculating on what could happen next, Mexico’s president pointed to Zambada’s own words in the 2010 Proceso interview. If he were captured or killed, Zambada said that effectively nothing would happen. In the world of drug trafficking, he said, whether capos are “locked up, dead, or extradited, their replacements are already out there.”
    

            Experts say there’s little doubt that these arrests, like past high-profile kingpin takedowns, will spur a new wave of violence as rival groups vie for territory and power.
    

            And no matter what new details emerge about how they happened, the surprising and dramatic arrests won’t soon be forgotten.

CNN_54,Children and teenagers among 12 dead in Golan Heights rocket attack that Israel blames on Hezbollah in a major escalation,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/lebanon-israel-golan-strikes-intl-latam/index.html,2024-07-28 06:48:00,world,"
            At least 12 people, including children, were killed when multiple rockets hit a village in the Golan Heights Saturday in an attack described by Israel as the deadliest against it since October 7.
    

            Israel said it had identified “approximately 30 projectiles” crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory and blamed the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah for the barrage. The incident has raised fears of a major escalation in the long-running conflict along the Israel-Lebanon border, even though Hezbollah has said it “firmly denies” firing the rockets.
    

            At least 29 people were injured in the attack in Majdal Shams, a village in the Israeli-controlled northern Golan Heights that is home to a large Druze community.
    

            Some 20,000 Druze Arabs live in the Golan Heights, an area Israel seized from Syria in 1967 during the Six-Day War and annexed in 1981. Considered occupied territory under international law and UN Security Council resolutions, the area is home to about 50,000 Israeli Jewish settlers and Druze. Most Druze there identify as Syrian and have rejected offers of Israeli citizenship.

            Among the sites hit in the attack was a soccer field where children and teenagers had been playing, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari said. He described the attack as “the deadliest attack on Israeli civilians since October 7.”
    

            “This is a very serious incident and we will act accordingly,” he said.
    

            Hagari said the rocket that hit the soccer field was a “Falaq 1 Iranian rocket carrying a 50kg warhead.” “This is a model that is owned exclusively by Hezbollah, and tonight it caused the deaths of 12 young boys and girls,” he added.
    

            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he was cutting short by several hours his visit to the United States and returning to Israel because of the attack and said he would convene a security cabinet meeting immediately upon his return.
    

            The prime minister said he was “shocked” by the attack. “I can say that the State of Israel will not go be silent about this. We will not put this off the agenda,” he said.
    

            In a separate statement earlier, Netanyahu’s office said the prime minister “made it clear” that “Hezbollah will pay a heavy price for (the attack) that it has not paid so far.”
    

            Israeli President Isaac Herzog decried the attack as a “terrible and shocking disaster” and vowed Israel would “defend” its citizens.
    

            “Hezbollah terrorists brutally attacked and murdered children today, whose only crime was going out to play soccer. They did not return,” he said in a post on X.
    

            “The world cannot continue to sit in silence in the face of (Hezbollah leader Hassan) Nasrallah’s terror attacks, which come at the behest of the empire of evil in Iran. The State of Israel will firmly defend its citizens and its sovereignty.”
    

            The attack on Saturday is a major escalation in what has been an extremely volatile period in the border area. Israel and Hezbollah have been trading fire across the demarcation line for almost 10 months and regional leaders have been warning the conflict is reaching a boiling point.
    

            Officially, Lebanon and Israel are – and have been for decades – in a state of war, but the recent tensions have so far not escalated into a full-blown conflict.

            The strikes have become more frequent in recent weeks and both Hezbollah and Israel are targeting sites deeper and deeper into each other’s territory.
    

            The tensions increased further in the past few weeks when Israel killed two high-ranking Hezbollah commanders – Sami Taleb Abdullah in May and Muhammed Neamah Naser in June – blaming them for directing terror attacks both before and after Hamas’ October 7 attacks from Gaza. Hezbollah retaliated by firing hundreds of missiles into Israel.
    

            It is unclear how Israel will respond to Saturday’s deadly attack. The Government Press Office said Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant was conducting a situation assessment together with the IDF Chief of the General Staff and senior defense officials.
    

            Speaking later on Saturday, Gallant said Israel will hit back at the enemy harshly.”
    

            Meanwhile, Netanyahu held a security consultation with his military secretary General Roman Gofman, and will hold a security situation assessment with all the heads of the defense establishment later on Saturday, his office said.
    

            Israeli opposition leader Benny Gantz traveled to Majdal Shams on Saturday, calling on Netanyahu to increase IDF presence in the area.
    

            Some IDF units previously stationed along the country’s northern border have been redeployed to southern Israel following the October 7 terror attack by Hamas and the subsequent Israeli ground invasion of Gaza.
    

            “We have a moral obligation in the south to return the hostages home, and we have a strategic obligation to return security to the north and the people to their homes. This has gone on for too long. I told the prime minister that he must turn the resources to the north at the same time as the work in the south for the return of the hostages – this is the main task.”
    

            The Lebanese government said after the attack that it condemned “all acts of violence and attacks against all civilians,” Lebanese state news agency NNA reported.
    

            The government also called for “an immediate cessation of hostilities on all fronts” and said that “targeting civilians constitutes a blatant violation of international law and is contrary to the principles of humanity,” NNA reported.
    

            Adeeb Safadi, a resident of Majdal Shams, told CNN that those killed in the rocket attack on the soccer field were all Druze children from local villages, boys between the ages of eight and 15.
    

            “They were attending a football training class with a coach whose fate is still unknown. Ten of the killed have been identified, but there are more who were torn apart and are still unidentified,” said Safadi, who lives some 600 meters from the site of the attack.
    

            He said he saw black smoke and heard an explosion. About four seconds after the explosion, he heard sirens warning people about an imminent attack.
    

            Evacuation helicopters, ambulances and intensive care vehicles have been dispatched to the scene.
    

            Israel’s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service reported that the fatalities included “teenagers and young adults” whose ages ranged from 10 to 20 years old. It said a further 29 people were injured, six of whom were in a serious condition.

Golan Regional Council head urges Israel to respond ‘with force’ after Hezbollah rocket fire kills two


            Idan Avshalom, a senior medic from MDA, said the team saw destruction and fire when arriving at the scene.
    

            “Injured people were lying on the grass and the sights were dire. We immediately began triaging the injured, some of the injured were sent to local clinics and our teams were also directed to the clinics,” he said, adding that there were additional alerts as they worked to save the injured.
    

            Ziv Medical Center in the northern Israeli city of Safed said it had received 26 injured people, five of whom were admitted to the trauma center. Rambam Hospital in Haifa has also opened an information center to help people get information about their loved ones.
    

            Israeli police said that munitions have fallen in “multiple sites in the northern Golan.”
    

            Police are “securing the area and searching for additional remnants to eliminate any further risk to the public,” the Police Spokesperson’s Unit said.
    

            While the IDF has blamed the attack on Hezbollah, the militant group denied involvement in a statement on Telegram Saturday.
    

            “The Islamic Resistance in Lebanon firmly denies the allegations made by some enemy media outlets and various media platforms regarding the targeting of Majdal Shams,” it said.
    

            “We confirm that the Islamic Resistance has no connection to the incident whatsoever and firmly denies all false claims in this regard,” the statement continued.
    

            Earlier on Saturday, Hezbollah had said it targeted an Israeli military site in a different part of the occupied Golan Heights.
    

            But the IDF said its analysis showed the rocket launched at Majdal Shams was “carried out from an area located north of the village of Chebaa in southern Lebanon.”
    

            Hagari, the IDF spokesperson, said Hezbollah was lying when denying it was behind the attack. “Our intelligence is clear – Hezbollah is responsible for killing innocent children. Ten-year-old children and once again, the brutality of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization was exposed,” he said.
    

            The White House on Saturday condemned the attack and reiterated its “iron-clad” support fro Israel.
    

            “Israel continues to face severe threats to its security, as the world saw today, and the United States will continue to support efforts to end these terrible attacks along the Blue Line, which must be a top priority,” a National Security Council Spokesperson said in a written statement to CNN, referring to the demarcation line between Israel and Lebanon.
    

            “Our support for Israel’s security is iron-clad and unwavering against all Iranian backed terrorist groups, including Lebanese Hezbollah,” the spokesperson added.
    

            Meanwhile, the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called for an independent international investigation into the attacks and urged restraint.
    

            “Shocking images from the soccer field in the Druze town of Majdal Shams. I strongly condemn this bloodbath. We urge all parties to exercise utmost restraint and avoid further escalation,” he said in a statement posted on X.

WaPo_1,D.C.'s Friday weather seemed special for being ordinary,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/26/washington-weather-warm-summer-heat/,2024-07-27 08:47:02.888228,,"D.C. may take pride in its reputation for sultry summertime swelter, but Friday seemed the sort of day for wondering what all the fuss was about and whether the reputation was deserved.It was true that Friday seemed obviously a summer day. Its high temperature of 85 degrees seemed clearly consistent with general expectations of summertime.But Friday failed to inflict on the District the harsh meteorological extremism of many days earlier this month — including the four with temperatures above 100 degrees.However, if averages mean much, they may suggest that days such as Friday cannot readily be relied on to appear here always or often in July.The average temperature in Washington on Friday’s date now stands at 90 degrees. So it would seem that part of Friday’s allure lay in the five-degree gap between its temperature and the District’s average July 26 temperature.Possibly Friday’s sense that summer had a benign side, might have been earned physiologically. The many days of extreme and above average temperatures this summer have likely caused acclimatization and a process of adjustment.But cloudy skies also played an obvious part in moderating Friday’s conditions.For much of the day, clouds shielded the city from the wilting effects of the summertime sun. It is just a little more than five weeks since the sun was at its absolute annual acme.Feeling its full late-July strength for protracted periods in the glare of streets without shade, with solar rays reflected from concrete and marble would have made Friday seem far less comfortable than it did.A major contributor to Friday’s welcome as a well-behaved emissary of summer was the humidity. Or the relative absence thereof.When summer seems to be at its most intolerable it is ascribed to the joint effect of severe heat and oppressive humidity. Friday was neither too hot nor too humid.To know the absolute temperature was to know the “feels-like” temperature. Through the day, they were close to identical, meaning that humidity declined to make an 85-degree day seem worse than it was.This was reflected in the day’s dew points, which were confined to the 50s, a location regarded as comfortable."
WaPo_2,"A bullet — or bullet fragment — hit Trump during assassination attempt, FBI says",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/26/trump-bullet-shot-assassination-attempt/,2024-07-27 08:30:02.888228,,"Former president Donald Trump was shot in the ear by a bullet or a bullet fragment during the assassination attempt at one of his campaign rallies, the FBI said Friday, responding to an outcry sparked when FBI Director Christopher A. Wray testified Wednesday that the former president and Republican nominee was wounded by either a bullet or shrapnel.For nearly two weeks, there had been speculation about whether Trump had been grazed by a bullet (or fragments of one) or nicked by other debris during his July 13 campaign rally in which 20-year-old gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire at Trump and into the crowd in Butler, Pa. Wray maintained in congressional testimony Wednesday that investigators hadn’t reached a definitive conclusion while Trump and his Republican allies insisted he had been shot.The FBI on Friday said the Republican presidential nominee was hit with a bullet.“What struck former President Trump in the ear was a bullet, whether whole or fragmented into smaller pieces, fired from the deceased subject’s rifle,” the agency said in a statement.A Washington Post analysis of photos and videos of the shooting found that former president Trump’s injury appears to be consistent with the attributes of a graze wound from a bullet and not that of bullet fragments, according to two trauma surgeons, Babak Sarani, director of trauma and acute care surgery at George Washington University Hospital, and Joseph Sakran, director of emergency general surgery at Johns Hopkins. The physicians reviewed the Post’s analysis.“Usually shrapnel flies in random patterns. Because it’s shrapnel, right? It doesn’t go in a straight line. This really looks like a linear laceration is how I would describe,” Sarani told The Post. “So it’s something, it’s going in a straight line which makes you think it’s more the projectile itself, not shrapnel.”High-velocity rounds, such as those likely fired by Crooks, impart energy, or a blast effect when striking a body. A graze wound like that of the former president would not, Sarani said.“The bullet literally just grazes you and so very little energy is imparted into you. The rest of it is just dissipated into the air.” he added. “That’s how you, if you are, quote unquote, lucky. The bullet just grazed you.”Just hours after the assassination attempt, Trump started insisting he had been hit with a bullet.“I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear,” he wrote in a Truth Social post that published at 8:42 p.m. on July 13, less than three hours after the shooting. “I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening.”Wray testified to the House Judiciary Committee that the exact nature of Trump’s injury remained uncertain. “I think with respect to former president Trump, there’s some question about whether or not it’s a bullet or shrapnel that, you know, hit his ear,” he told lawmakers Wednesday.Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Tex.), the former White House doctor who has been monitoring Trump’s health since the assassination attempt, criticized Wray’s comments.“There is absolutely no evidence that it was anything other than a bullet,” Jackson wrote in an update on Trump’s health. “Congress should correct the record as confirmed by both the hospital and myself. Director Wray is wrong and inappropriate to suggest anything else.”On Friday, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) sent a letter to Wray, urging him to “correct your testimony before Congress on Wednesday when you indicated it is uncertain whether President Donald J. Trump was hit by a bullet, glass, or shrapnel.”“It is clear to everyone that President Trump survived an assassination attempt by millimeters, as the attempted assassin’s bullet ripped the upper part of his ear,” Graham wrote in a letter that Trump published Friday in a Truth Social post.It was one of several posts Trump wrote criticizing Wray’s testimony over the past two days.He posted another late Friday after the release of the FBI statement confirming he had been shot.“I assume that’s the best apology that we’ll get from Director Wray,” he said of the FBI’s conclusion, “but it is fully accepted!”"
WaPo_3,Jerry Falwell Jr. and Liberty University reach settlement,https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/07/26/falwell-liberty-university-settlement/,2024-07-27 08:13:02.888228,,"Jerry Falwell Jr. and Liberty University announced Friday they had reached a settlement, nearly four years after Falwell resigned as president of the influential Christian school amid personal scandals.In a remarkable turnaround, Liberty, a private university in Virginia that has national political and evangelical clout, announced it had reached an agreement with Falwell on “all outstanding disputes on both legal and personal matters.”Falwell resigned in 2020 from the school his father, a pastor and prominent televangelist, co-founded.Falwell, a lawyer and real estate developer, transformed the school over the years of his leadership, lifting it out of debt, dramatically increasing its enrollment and building a beautiful campus in Lynchburg, Va., that became a powerful center for conservative Christians. In 2016, Falwell was one of the first prominent evangelical leaders to endorse Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.He also generated considerable controversy, with some alumni, students and others concerned that the school had strayed too far from its mission of “Training Champions for Christ.”In the summer of 2020, Falwell was suspended with pay after posting on social media — then deleting — a photo of himself with his wife’s young assistant with their zippers partially unzipped. Soon afterward, a young man, Giancarlo Granda, publicly claimed he had had an affair with Falwell’s wife and that Falwell sometimes watched them have sex. Becki Falwell acknowledged the affair, but both she and her husband denied that Falwell was involved.Falwell resigned from Liberty in August 2020, and told The Post at the time that his contract entitled him to a $10.5 million severance package, in part because he left without being formally accused of, or admitting to, wrongdoing.He sued the university that fall, claiming Liberty had damaged his reputation, and while he later dropped that suit, in 2023 he accused the school of misappropriating his father’s image for promotion.After years of bitter contention, Liberty announced Friday that it had reached an agreement with Falwell on an undisclosed amount it will pay him in retirement and severance payments, and on the conditions under which the school will use the name, image and likeness of his father, Jerry Falwell Sr.Liberty released a statement Friday expressing “appreciation” of Falwell, and said he was instrumental in building the school “into the world-class Christian institution it is today.”Falwell apologized for errors in judgment and mistakes made during his time of leadership, according to the school. “The Board of Trustees acknowledge and apologize for the errors and mistakes made on their part as well,” Liberty added.Both parties expressed regret for the litigation, “and each take responsibility for their part in the disputes,” according to the university.Falwell said Friday he could not comment on the settlement.But, he said, “It’s an extremely happy day for everyone.”Save71, an alumni group that has called for a restoration of the school’s Christian mission, wrote on X that the settlement announcement “is an extremely rare occurrence of Liberty formally apologizing for something, and an even rarer implication that Falwell wants to apologize …”Dustin Wahl, a founder of Save71, said a Christian approach to the “catastrophe” of Jerry Falwell Jr.’s tenure would be repentance backed up by transparent action. “But this is an attempt to bury the past,” he said.A spokesman for the university did not immediately respond to request for comment Friday.In 2023, retired Maj. Gen. Dondi E. Costin became president of Liberty. In an email to the campus community Friday, he wrote, “Every thought, word, and deed should flow through the grid of how we believe Jesus might respond in similar circumstances. That’s easier said than done, of course, and we don’t always get it right,” but he urged people to strive to live at peace with everyone.He also advised employees that a previous restriction on communication with Falwell and his wife about Liberty business and operations had been lifted.“The time has come,” he wrote, “for our former president and his wife to be welcomed back to our campus.”"
WaPo_4,"The Olympics won’t cure the world, but Paris offered a spark of hope",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/26/paris-olympics-opening-ceremonies-/,2024-07-27 08:40:02.888228,,"PARIS — The rain kept falling, from drizzle to drench, an annoying patter as the host city tried to delight. The weather didn’t ruin the grand plans that Paris had to introduce its first Olympics in a century, but it didn’t yield to grandeur, either. And so, despite all the artistry and beauty, an ambitious endeavor succumbed to unintended symbolism.The bold imagery and soaring optimism — the sense that we can match French creativity and reimagine our world — the rain lashed it all, a persistent foil indicative of an inflamed society. Every Olympics attempts to create an idyllic, if temporary, world. There’s no better place to dream than this wondrous metropolis. But as the rain illustrated, it is a challenge to get cooperation, whether from the skies or the rest of the world.Paris wanted to unlock a closed world. It wanted to open its doors and open all minds with an Opening Ceremonies that boasted the city’s architectural character, shocked with a beheaded, singing Marie Antoinette character and incorporated a drag performance. During a sprawling and sometimes disjointed presentation, nations of Olympic athletes glided down the Seine on boats, sending us all on a journey that combined French history with art, culture and sport.It could have been bewitching if it weren’t so soggy.Paris 2024 organizers made the impossible seem effortless, at least during the show. There was plenty of reason to worry beforehand. In this world climate, with so many countries feuding and so little human decency, staging a novel open-air event on a river that runs through the middle of a city is an extreme security nuisance. It took tens of thousands of police, military personnel and private security, not the mention the intelligence expertise of multiple nations, to ensure safety.It’s much easier to secure a stadium of 90,000 spectators as people enter the confined space. But that wouldn’t have fit the “Games Wide Open” theme for these Olympics. Paris wanted a massive crowd of more than 300,000, in the streets and along the bank of the river. In these times, it amounted to an incredible statement about how powerful it is when people unite around sports.It is unfortunate it takes an entire town’s worth of gun-toting people to ensure such a good feeling, but hey, let’s not nitpick a serene night. After the boat parade, Tony Estanguet, the head of the Paris 2024 organizing committee and a former French canoeist, spoke about unity to the athletes who braved the rain and stayed in the Trocadero area for the remainder of the ceremony. The Eiffel Tower sparkled in the background as Estanguet made an inspiring argument for unity.“Even though the Games cannot solve every problem, even though discrimination and conflicts are not about to disappear, tonight you have reminded us how beautiful humanity is when we come together,” Estanguet said. “And when you return to the Olympic Village, you will be sending a message of hope to the whole world: that there is a place where people of every nationality, every culture and every religion can live together. You’ll be reminding us of what’s possible.”You want his words to linger in the air. You worry they drifted as easily as the rain fell.Despite the majesty of this curtain-raiser, these Games already are burdened by the spying sins of the Canada women’s soccer team, a dressage abuse scandal and a petty feud between two anti-doping agencies, the USADA and WADA. The next 16 days will be both exasperating and thrilling, but perhaps the tension is a gift. Two weeks of incessant conflict resolution provide a greater lesson than the convenience of hope.“When you love the Games, first of all, don’t let a few drops of rain bother you,” Estanguet said. “Thank you to all those lovers of the Games who are with us, a little soggy, tonight.”He continued: “When you love the Games, you are ready to court the Games for 100 years for the chance to bring them back to Paris. And loving the Games passionately has meant we wanted to share everything that is most precious to us.”Paris succeeded in making the ancient Olympic tradition more accessible. Some will like the inclusivity. Some will hate it. The culture wars will rage, in America and beyond. But the Games are officially wide open, and for a few scattered moments, the graying Olympics shined along with the Eiffel Tower. Old turned dignified. Old turned classic. There is a simple elegance to fashioning timelessness, and Paris wears it well.During the French broadcast, a color commentator was so moved by the event that she cried. The camera stayed with her as the show went to a commercial break.It wasn’t a perfect night, but Paris didn’t need to be perfect. It just needed to be Paris. Maybe only Paris could have pulled off such a show: a roving Opening Ceremonies progressing through a city for the first time in Olympic history, an event that felt similar to a championship parade, mixed with a telethon-length concert and an interactive movie that broke the wall between cinema and live performance.I’ll admit to feeling grumpy while watching portions in the rain and defeated when forced to retreat inside. But the show continued. By the end, it seemed appropriate that the Olympic cauldron went floating into the sky on a hot-air balloon.It seemed destined that Paris would make a grand gesture by lighting the top of the Eiffel Tower, its most iconic structure. True to form, the organizers went for something different. As that cauldron soared higher and higher, it looked like it was going after the rain. Maybe we should consider that symbolism, too.In the right light, glowing against the night sky, a timeless treasure flaunted its appeal."

United topped Atlanta in a shootout, 6-5 after a 3-3 draw, to open its Leagues Cup campaign with a win Friday night at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.Jared Stroud scored twice for a D.C. team that bolted to a 3-1 first-half lead before settling for the draw through 90 minutes. Per the Leagues Cup’s group-stage format, United earned two points for the shootout win while Atlanta walked away with one for the loss.Christian Benteke also found the net for United. Daniel Ríos scored twice for Atlanta — including the 81st-minute equalizer from the penalty spot — while sandwiching his tallies around a Saba Lobzhanidze strike.Alex Bono denied Bartosz Slisz to clinch the shootout win after Gabriel Pirani had put United ahead. Bono also stopped a Slisz penalty kick in the 65th minute to preserve United’s lead at the time.Earlier on Friday, D.C. United’s Leagues Cup match against Mexican club Santos Laguna on Wednesday will be relocated to Subaru Park in Chester, Pa., after the Audi Field playing surface was deemed unplayable.The pitch has been less than pristine since the United Football League’s D.C. Defenders concluded their season June 2. But concerns around the surface’s viability escalated after a July 12 rugby match between the United States and Scotland left it visibly rough and patchy for two high-profile games: the send-off match for the U.S. women’s Olympic soccer team July 16 and D.C. United’s friendly against Scottish power Celtic on July 20.MLS and Liga MX announced the decision Friday night after the Leagues Cup organizing committee assessed the field. United, which was hit with an undisclosed fine, plans to offer refunds or credits to ticket holders and provide buses for fans who want to travel to Chester.The field will endure more wear and tear this weekend when the Buzzard Point venue will host the Megan Thee Stallion-headlined Broccoli City Festival. United plans to install a new grass pitch Wednesday, 3½ weeks before its MLS schedule resumes with a home match against FC Dallas.D.C. avoided similar issues last year by replacing the pitch soon after the Defenders’ season concluded. But a person with knowledge of the club’s thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters, said the team decided not to swap out the field during an early June layoff because the Lionel Messi-led Argentine national team wanted it available for training ahead of its June 14 friendly against Guatemala at FedEx Field. By the time Argentina ultimately decided not to train at Audi Field, United had committed to replacing the pitch later in the summer.United also looked into swapping home dates with Atlanta in the Leagues Cup group stage, the person said, so that United would have faced Santos Laguna on Aug. 4 on the new field. But a switch wasn’t possible because English power Chelsea is facing Mexico’s Club América on Wednesday at Atlanta’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium."
WaPo_6,Charges dropped against 11 anti-Netanyahu protesters arrested in D.C.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/26/dc-netanyahu-protests-dropped-charges/,2024-07-27 08:01:02.888228,,"Prosecutors have dropped charges against nearly half of the 25 people arrested in Washington on Wednesday during various protests over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Congress, according to court records and officials.The arrests by police from three law enforcement agencies occurred at a number of points and under different circumstances on a day when thousands marched through Washington, voicing their displeasure over the prime minister’s visit and Israel’s actions in Gaza.At times, the demonstrations grew tense — particularly outside of Union Station, where protesters clashed with police, took down and burned an American flag and spray-painted the Christopher Columbus fountain and adjacent Liberty Bell reproduction with messages like “Free Gaza,” “All zionists are bastards,” and “Hamas is Comin’.”Police union officials said they were frustrated to see prosecutors walk away from the cases — or, in some instances, reduce the charges — and concerned that their own staffing levels did not allow them to detain as many people as they would have liked. Officials with the D.C. attorney general’s office and the D.C. U.S. attorney’s office, which handle such prosecutions, declined to comment on the matter, citing the ongoing investigation.It is possible that some of the dropped cases could be revived, or that others could be tracked down and charged later.Not all of those arrested were alleged to have been involved in taking down American flags or violent confrontations with police; the group also included six relatives of hostages being held in Gaza. Brianna Burch, a Capitol Police spokeswoman, said one or two of those protesters, who wore yellow shirts emblazoned with “Seal the Deal” to indicate they want Netanyahu to negotiate the return of hostages, stood up during the prime minister’s speech in “an act coordinated with other protestors who were wearing the same expressive t-shirts.”Those protesters appeared to be in the group that had their cases dropped; there were no court records Friday reflecting their charges, though prosecutors declined to say specifically what happened after their arrests. The D.C. attorney general’s office would only confirm that it dropped 11 of the 25 cases, which had charged offenders with misdemeanor crimes including crossing police lines and disorderly conduct.“It’s a slap in the face to law enforcement who are doing their jobs and these prosecutors throw these charges out,” said Gus Papathanasiou, chairman of the U.S. Capitol Police labor committee. “Shame on them for … giving free passes to criminals.”Court records show 13 people are currently charged with various crimes. Eight appeared in D.C. Superior Court and five were issued criminal citations and released and ordered to appear for a future court date.Police arrested one juvenile, a 15-year-old from Ohio who is charged with assaulting a police officer. The status of that case could not be determined because of juvenile privacy rules.Ten people were arrested by U.S. Park Police at Columbus Circle in front of Union Station. Court records show people in that group were hit with the most serious charges over trying to take down an American flag and assaulting police officers.But two of those who police said were arrested appeared to have had their cases dropped, as court records did not show any pending charges against them.Documents filed in D.C. Superior Court revealed new allegations from Park Police about the volatile clashes in front of Union Station with members of a protest group police identified as the ANSWER Coalition, an antiwar organization that frequently organizes protests in the District and has disputed that Wednesday’s demonstrations were violent.In arrest affidavits, Park Police officers said that around 3 p.m., they saw people climbing the Christopher Columbus statue and spray-painting pro-Hamas slogans on it. Other officers saw people spray-painting a bell. Then, police said they saw two people climb the base of a statue and flagpole, including at least two who were 10 to 15 feet off the ground “manipulating the rope and unraveling it from the pole.”The affidavit says Sonia Krishan, 21, of Kensington, was about 15 feet up the flagpole and “pulling on the flag line.” Two Park Police officers pulled her down, the affidavit states, and handcuffed her. They said she resisted and had to be carried out of the crowd. Martine Kaplan, an attorney representing Krishan, declined to comment.Meanwhile, police alleged in the arrest affidavit that Nathanial Lawrence, 19, was at the base of the flagpole “helping to tear down the American flag.” Police said Lawrence ran as officers approached him, and they tackled and arrested him. As they handcuffed Lawrence, police alleged, officers were “assaulted by members of the crowd who were attempting to help Lawrence escape police custody.”In an interview Friday, Lawrence said he spent about 24 hours in jail before being released. Lawrence said he saw people in the crowd waving Palestinian flags and thought “it didn’t seem right” that the American flag was flying higher. He said those protesting on Wednesday were fighting for those suffering in Gaza while the U.S. government “just stands there and lets it happen.”So, Lawrence said, he climbed up the flagpole and began trying to take down the flag as another protester climbed up to help him. Then, Lawrence said, he saw several police officers heading toward him and ran.“I’d do it again in a heartbeat,” he said.A third person at the flagpole, Roger Miller, 43, of Baltimore, was also arrested, and police alleged demonstrators sought to interfere with officers taking him into custody. Mark Goldstone, an attorney representing him, declined to comment.Park Police initially charged Krishan, Lawrence and Miller with several criminal counts including defacing public property, fighting and disorderly conduct. But prosecutors with the U.S. attorney’s office for D.C. filed a single charge against each of the three: attempted theft, alleging they attempted to wrongfully obtain and use property belonging to the U.S. government: the American flag. They were not alleged to have been involved in the flag burning, which occurred after their arrests.Following those arrests, the Park Police said, “multiple protesters refused our commands to back up,” and officers moved to the northeast side of the park while the crowd followed.Police said Essa Elies Ejelat, 33, of Yonkers, N.Y., pointed at an officer with his right hand and threatened him. He was arrested and charged with threatening to do bodily harm to a police officer. His attorney declined to comment Friday.About 3:45 p.m., in a separate part of the Columbus Circle park, police said they arrested three people carrying weapons, including bats, batons, shields and a dart gun typically used for hunting. Frederick Coates, 25, of Bowie, Momamome Crow, 23, of D.C. and Antonio Somerville, 23, of Bowie, were each charged with one count of carrying concealed weapons. Coates and his attorney could not be immediately reached for comment. An attorney representing Momamome declined to comment.Park Police also arrested Zachary Kam, 34, of Chicago, charging him with two counts of assaulting police officers. Police allege he pulled on the back of two officers’ protective vests, forcing them to the ground and injuring one. Reached on Friday, Kam’s wife declined to comment and said Kam was unavailable.Kenneth Spencer, chairman of the U.S. Park Police Fraternal Order of Police, said the officers “did everything they could” to protect property, but had only 29 officers available, with additional help from the Interior Department.“A small unit of 29 officers arrested 10 individuals while being assaulted by a mob of thousands,” Spencer said in a statement. “We simply did not have the staffing or resources to accomplish a mass arrest operation.”It is not uncommon for prosecutors to initially decline to press charges against individuals arrested during protests, especially those that turn violent, said Rizwan Qureshi, former assistant U.S. attorney for the District.“Police on the street are making a decision that is in a much shorter defined period of time and make a decision quickly, especially when dealing with riotous behavior in order to get some order quickly,” Qureshi said. “But when prosecutors bring cases, they have an obligation to look at the evidence individually and determine if they can present these facts and prove beyond a reasonable doubt the offense here.”But Qureshi — who was involved in prosecuting those arrested amid violent demonstrations during President Donald Trump’s inauguration, a case that ended with a large number of dismissals — added that prosecutors could refile cases if more evidence emerges.The demonstrations in the D.C. area have continued after Netanyahu’s speech. On Friday, Virginia Department of Transportation officials cleared a months-long pro-Palestinian demonstration outside the Arlington home of Secretary of State Antony Blinken. A small group of protesters calling for a cease-fire in Gaza had camped outside his house — erecting tents, chanting and waving flags since the winter.Ellen Kamilakis, a spokeswoman for VDOT, said officials had determined that “the present condition” of the road, including “people, as well as concrete barriers, tents, flags, and other items occupying VDOT’s right-of-way — is unsafe for motorists, bikers, and pedestrians and blocks access to emergency vehicles and personnel.”Two demonstrators present at the site left voluntarily after being asked to do so by Virginia State Police officers also present at the removal, officials said."

WaPo_8,Olympic Ceremonies on the Seine were a daring feat. Paris stuck the landing.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/26/olympics-opening-ceremony-2024-paris-seine/,2024-07-27 08:00:02.888228,,"PARIS — France’s audacious plan to open the Paris Olympic Games on the Seine raised plenty of eyebrows before Friday night’s ceremonies.Detractors worried about security, about crowd management, about the logistics of moving 85 boats carrying 6,800 athletes down the Seine. Coordinated arson attacks on France’s high-speed rail network Thursday night further raised anxieties about unwelcome disruptions.But in the end, Paris transformed itself into a spectacular stage — and demonstrated that bold thinking could bring a certain shine back to a global sporting event that has seen its popularity slump in recent years.A century after the 1924 Paris Olympics, the Opening Ceremonies on Friday represented a return to the host’s seat for France. And after two pandemic Olympics, muted and virtually spectator-less, they marked a triumphant revival of the spectacle of the Games: colorful, convivial, flashy and weird — a dynamic blend of ardent patriotism and glitzy internationalism.When France bid to host this Olympics in 2016, it envisioned a traditional ceremony in the Stade de France. But in the years that followed, organizers began brainstorming creative ways to weave the Games throughout the city — and for the Opening Ceremonies, there was no site more iconic and special than the Seine.Thomas Jolly, the ceremonies’ artistic director, wrote that his vision aimed to showcase the Parisian river’s “power to grant wishes and its power to heal” at a time of global conflict and after local tragedy, including the 2019 fire that severely damaged Notre Dame Cathedral. The famous church, a symbol of France to many, featured prominently at the start of the ceremonies, when performers hung from scaffolding and rang the bells for the first time since the fire.“Paris is back on its feet, jubilant, flamboyant, creative and open. Free,” Jolly wrote.For more than four hours Friday night, it was all of that.Eschewing the timeworn choreography of a show followed by an athletes’ parade, Paris interspersed performances with the delegations’ river procession. The program progressed through 12 “artistic tableaux,” with themes such as “liberty,” “sisterhood” and “darkness,” each showcasing aspects of French history, culture and craftsmanship. Moulin Rouge dancers and the Mona Lisa made an appearance — as did acrobats, fashion models and a scene from “Les Misérables.”It was a star-studded event: Lady Gaga, wearing pink feathers, sang the cabaret classic “Mon Truc en Plumes.” The metal band Gojira and pop star Aya Nakamura brought French flavor. Céline Dion closed out the ceremonies with a stirring rendition of “Hymn to Love” after an epic Eiffel Tower light show.The decision to hold the Opening Ceremonies on the river represented a bold — and risky — divergence from the norm.“Hubris is the word which can come to mind,” political analyst François Heisbourg said. “It’s a big organizational challenge, a big security challenge and big reputational challenge if you don’t play it safe. The French decided not to play it safe.”Friday got off to an ignominious start. The arson attacks caused severe disruptions to travel just hours before the Opening Ceremonies were slated to begin. Gabriel Attal, the French caretaker prime minister, said Friday that “acts of sabotage” were carried out in a “prepared and coordinated manner,” hitting lines running east, west and north of Paris. But local transport in the Paris region wasn’t affected. (It still isn’t clear who was behind the attack; the public prosecutor’s office has opened an investigation.)Literal rain clouds also gathered overhead, leaving questions throughout the day about whether the outdoor ceremony would lose its promised luster.At the Trocadero esplanade Friday night, spectators sheltered from the downpour under ponchos and umbrellas. Technical staff spoke frantically into their intercoms when two of the six big screens — including one that French President Emmanuel Macron and other world leaders were watching — briefly went black.Some journalists left early to search for drier filing spaces. But many spectators, some of whom had paid thousands of dollars for the coveted Trocadero seats, remained undeterred and enthusiastic.There was no dramatic sunset over the Seine. But the performances — spanning riverbanks, bridges, watercraft and rooftops — went off without a hitch.Much could have gone wrong with an open-air, miles-long boat procession. Paris has been a frequent target of terrorism; attacks by Islamist extremists in November 2015 killed 130 people and wounded more than 400 others. Israel’s war in Gaza and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have stoked geopolitical tensions. The 1972 Munich Olympics, in which Palestinian militants killed 11 Israeli athletes and coaches, loomed large as a worst-case scenario.Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said Friday that more than 50,000 security officers had been deployed for the Opening Ceremonies, including French police and soldiers, private contractors and foreign security personnel loaned from about 50 countries. Israeli athletes, some of whom received threats in the lead-up to the Olympics, were under extra protection.An AI-powered surveillance center was also engaged to detect sudden crowd movements, abandoned objects or people lying on the ground — an endeavor designed to thwart an attack like the bombing at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.French authorities were clearly on edge, evacuating multiple sites around Paris throughout the day Friday due to bomb scares.Drones represented another possible threat. French authorities closed the airspace within around 100 miles of Paris at 6:30 p.m. local time (12:30 p.m. Eastern time), a “historic” move that shut down air traffic from Paris-area airports until midnight local time. The French military coordinated anti-drone operations from a base southwest of Paris, deploying dozens of teams with anti-drone equipment.To secure the parade route, authorities took the dramatic step of locking down the Seine with a system of barricades that cut off access to the river for many locals. Workers began installing the chain-link fences and closing off bridges along the river last Thursday, eight days before the ceremonies. Joggers taking early morning runs on the riverbanks had to scramble back through checkpoints. Bicyclists saw their routes suddenly cut off. Traffic near the river backed up, and roads became impassable.France did everything right from a security perspective, Heisbourg said. But the fortresslike perimeter around the Seine flew in the face of Paris’s “Games Wide Open” pledge to make the Olympics accessible, and particularly for Parisians, he added.Many Parisians with the means headed out of town before the Opening Ceremonies began, an exodus that was complicated by the arson attacks on train lines. But others stayed to take in the show in their hometown.At Parc Clichy Batignolles Martin Luther King, a small plot of grass in northern Paris, the epic Opening Ceremonies became a community festival. Fans sat in folding chairs and on blankets in front of a stage and a large screen. Families played cards around picnic tables. A man waved a Chilean flag. One woman had Norway’s colors painted on her face. The rain did not dampen the spirits of a group sporting Swiss-flag bucket hats, who began dancing and singing along to “It’s Raining Men.”Jeffrey Juilly, 45, and Nadia Got, 39, were among the Parisians standing in line at a beer tent at the park. Juilly acknowledged that city residents were divided on the benefits of the Olympics.“A lot of people complained,” Got said. But they counted themselves among the excited half of the city, taking pride in the audacity of using the Seine.What did they hope the Opening Ceremonies would show the world? “The wonder of Paris,” Juilly said.In addition to making better use of existing infrastructure than previous host cities had, Paris 2024 organizers pledged to ensure the Games would benefit residents of marginalized neighborhoods in the region.At a watch party in Saint-Denis, the low-income French suburb where the Stade de France — a major Olympic venue — is located, residents cheered when Lady Gaga appeared on screen. At a cafe down the street, Mounia Seddiki, 23, was trying to get into the Olympic spirit. She bemoaned the heavy traffic the Opening Ceremonies had caused, and how complicated she’d found it to buy tickets to the competitions. But as officials have invested more in Saint-Denis to prepare for the Olympics, the streets have become safer, she said.Some eight miles away, as the parade of Olympic delegations continued down the Seine toward the Eiffel Tower, athletes on board the boats looked progressively wetter. By the time Team USA came into view, the rain had soaked through the athletes’ hair and Ralph Lauren blazers. But they still smiled wide and snapped selfies as night descended over the river.Notably absent from the boats: teams from Russia and Belarus. The International Olympic Committee imposed sanctions in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the Russian Olympic federation was suspended for trying to claim athletes in seized Ukrainian territories as their own. Some Russian and Belarusian athletes will be allowed in the Paris Games, but only as what the IOC calls “independent neutral athletes.” They weren’t allowed to join the Opening Ceremonies.Despite the IOC’s official commitment to neutrality, the Olympics are always political — and these Games, particularly so, with calls for Israeli athletes to be excluded in light of Israel’s destructive war in Gaza.At the conclusion of the Ceremonies, framed by the arch of the Eiffel Tower, and shielded by an umbrella, Tony Estanguet, a former French canoeist and the head of the Paris 2024 organizing committee, offered a message of unity to the athletes gathered before him.“Even though the Games cannot solve every problem, even though discrimination and conflicts are not about to disappear, tonight you have reminded us how beautiful humanity is when we come together,” he said. “And when you return to the Olympic Village, you will be sending a message of hope to the whole world: That there is a place where people of every nationality, every culture and every religion can live together. You’ll be reminding us of what’s possible.”Adam Kilgore, Les Carpenter, Candace Buckner, Barry Svrluga and Emily Giambalvo in Paris contributed to this report."
WaPo_9,Justice Dept. settles with ex-FBI officials over leak of anti-Trump texts,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/26/strzok-page-fbi-settlement-trump-text-leak/,2024-07-27 08:46:02.888228,,"The Justice Department has agreed to settle claims by former senior FBI special agent Peter P. Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who had filed lawsuits accusing the government of violating their privacy rights by leaking their politically charged text messages criticizing Donald Trump.Strzok will receive a $1.2 million settlement and Page $800,000, according to their attorneys and settlement agreements released by the department.Strzok and Page said they were illegally targeted for retribution by the Trump administration after the FBI investigated Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election.Strzok, a former top counterintelligence expert, was fired by the FBI in 2018 after news reports surfaced of his politically charged text messages with Page, in which the pair criticized Trump while having an affair.“This outcome is a critical step forward in addressing the government’s unfair and highly politicized treatment of Pete,” lead Strzok attorney Aitan D. Goelman said in a statement. Goelman said Strzok will continue to seek reinstatement and back pay in ongoing litigation over claims that removing him from the FBI violated his free speech and due process rights.“We will continue to litigate Pete’s constitutional claims to ensure that, in the future, public servants are protected from adverse employment actions motivated by partisan politics,” Goelman said.In a statement released by her attorneys, Page said, “While I have been vindicated by this result, my fervent hope remains that our institutions of justice will never again play politics with the lives of their employees.”Page’s Arnold & Porter law firm team, led by Amy Jeffress, added, “As Attorney General [Merrick] Garland recently testified in response to questions about this settlement, the Department settles cases based on the litigators’ assessment of the chances of success and the potential costs of losing the case. Here, the evidence was overwhelming that the release of text messages to the press in December 2017 was for partisan political purposes and was against the law. As the Attorney General explained: ‘It’s a question of the government paying for violating the law.’”A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment outside of court filings.Separate agreements signed by the respective plaintiffs and senior trial counsel Bradley P. Humphreys with the Justice Department’s federal programs branch stated that they were entered “solely for the purposes of compromising disputed claims without further legal proceedings and avoiding the expense and risk of litigation,” and were not an admission by either party. The text exchanges between Strzok and Page, which came to light in December 2017, fueled Republican allegations that FBI bias against Trump drove the Russia investigation, and became fodder for scores of angry tweets and public statements by the then-president and his supporters.Page left the FBI in 2018, and Strzok was fired that August. Both were assigned before the 2016 election to investigate Russian interference into Trump’s campaign and whether former secretary of state Hillary Clinton broke the law by using a private email server.An inspector general’s investigation found no evidence that their opinions affected their work; a special counsel appointed by Trump was more critical of the FBI but agreed that investigating Russian interference was warranted.Strzok filed suit in August 2019, claiming he was unfairly terminated for criticizing the president. Page filed suit that December, accusing the FBI and the Justice Department of violating the Privacy Act by showing reporters a document containing nearly 400 texts between her and Strzok, in which the pair discussed their intense dislike of Trump and their fear that he might win the presidency.The settlement came after attorneys for the two former employees won court approval to question Trump and FBI Director Christopher A. Wray separately under oath.Trump was deposed in October 2023, after publicly bragging about firing FBI officials.On “The Hugh Hewitt Show” in February 2023, Trump stood by pushing out former FBI director James B. Comey, former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, and Strzok and Page, calling them “scum” who were “trying to do an overthrow.”Trump added, “They spied on my campaign, and I got rid of them all. … But … it was more than them, and you know that.”Strzok and Page used work phones to exchange messages critical of numerous politicians, especially Trump, whom Strzok derided as “abysmal” and a “disaster.”In August 2016, after Page wrote that Trump was “not ever going to become president, right? Right?!” Strzok responded: “No. No he’s not. We’ll stop it.”Trump has vowed to seek revenge if he wins election again and regains control of the Justice Department, according to people who have talked to him, The Washington Post has reported. He has privately discussed using the government to punish critics and opponents, including prosecuting officials at the FBI and the Justice Department, and mused publicly about weaponizing the department.House Republicans challenged Garland at a June 4 hearing over reports that a tentative deal with Strzok and Page had been reached. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) quoted from text messages the pair sent criticizing Trump.“They are getting money from the taxpayers because you decided that is the right thing to do?” Jordan said. “You go after the president and you are rewarded?”"
WaPo_10,Mexico wasn’t told of cartel arrests until kingpins were in U.S. custody,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/26/sinaloa-cartel-arrests-zambada-guzman/,2024-07-27 08:00:02.888228,,"MEXICO CITY — Mexico was not informed of the secret U.S. operation to whisk two Sinaloa cartel leaders to the United States until after the men were taken into custody, one of the country’s top security officials said Friday.The arrests of Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada and Joaquín Guzmán López on Thursday were a historic coup for U.S. agents pursuing a drug syndicate that has flooded the United States with fentanyl and trafficked tons of heroin, cocaine and methamphetamines worldwide. The operation unfolded like a Hollywood thriller, with Zambada duped into boarding a U.S.-bound plane, a plan even American agents initially doubted could work, officials said.A day after the operation, details remained murky. Security Minister Rosa Icela Rodríguez told reporters Friday that a small Cessna airplane piloted by an American took off from the Hermosillo airport in the northern Mexican state of Sonora just before 8 a.m. Thursday and landed around 10 a.m. at the airport in Santa Teresa, N.M., near El Paso. Zambada, 76, a co-founder of the Sinaloa cartel, and Guzmán, 38, a son of the notorious drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera, were arrested by agents for the Drug Enforcement Administration and FBI  when the aircraft landed.But a Justice Department official said the plane was a Beechcraft King Air and that the name of the pilot given by Rodríguez was incorrect.The U.S. Embassy did not notify Rodríguez of the operation until 3:30 p.m. local time, she said. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador was not informed until 4:14 p.m.U.S. authorities have not said why they kept the plan from their Mexican counterparts. But U.S. anti-drug operations have been foiled in recent years by leaks from Mexican officials, leaving Washington wary.“We are awaiting official communication on whether what happened yesterday was a capture or surrender,” Rodríguez said during López Obrador’s daily news conference.U.S. officials offered differing accounts of how Zambada was captured. Some said he surrendered. An official from the Department of Homeland Security and a former Justice Department official said Zambada was told he was boarding the flight with the younger Guzmán to go look at investment properties.U.S. agents scrambled to get to the Santa Teresa airport because they hadn’t expected the ruse to work, the officials said. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive case.Zambada’s attorney, Frank Perez, told The Washington Post his client “was not brought voluntarily” to Texas. He declined further comment.Joaquín Guzmán cooperated in the operation, the officials said. He’s one of the “Chapitos,” the four sons who took over their father’s business after El Chapo was arrested in 2016. Another of those sons, Ovidio, 34, was captured by the Mexican army in 2023 and extradited to the United States.Homeland Security Investigations agents played a leading role in the secret operation, persuading Ovidio Guzmán to reach out to his brother, and then working with Joaquín to get Zambada on the plane, the DHS official said. Joaquín Guzmán has been willing to “do a lot” to help Ovidio, who is awaiting trial on drug and money-laundering charges and could face a life sentence, the official said. Joaquín’s cooperation could win him significant concessions, according to the former Justice Department official.Zambada and El Chapo, who is serving a sentence of life plus 30 years in the federal supermax prison in Florence, Colo., jointly led one of the world’s most prolific drug cartels, a multibillion-dollar business. The Biden administration has targeted the cartel as it tries to combat the most deadly drug epidemic in history, fueled by the rise of fentanyl.U.S. authorities from President Biden on down described the operation as a resounding success. But analysts said the arrests were unlikely to cripple the narcotics business and could escalate violence in Mexico.“When we look at organized crime from the outside, we like to talk about the big cartels,” said Falko Ernst, senior Mexico analyst at the International Crisis Group. “But behind that, there is a very large number of other operators that never give themselves a name, that never pop up in media reporting,” he said, such as logistics experts and those who bribe state and local officials. “And that is the real backbone of this economy.”Synthetic substances such as fentanyl are easy to manufacture in small, clandestine labs. The business involves so many players that it will continue to operate with little or no disruption, said Cecilia Farfán-Méndez, a specialist in drug policy and organized crime at the University of California Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation.Even if the Sinaloa cartel was weakened, analysts said, its chief rival, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, would probably fill any gaps in the fentanyl trade. That group will increasingly challenge Sinaloa for dominance, said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies Mexican criminal organizations.“The whole of Mexico can be inflamed,” she said.Zambada was less well known than El Chapo, who inspired movies and books with his flashy lifestyle and uncanny ability to tunnel out of prisons. Yet the low-key Zambada was equally important or perhaps even more significant in cartel operations, Mexican officials say. (His nickname, “El Mayo,” refers to his middle name, Mario, according to Mexican media reports.)Zambada pleaded not guilty to all charges Friday in federal court in El Paso, according to court records.Zambada and El Chapo were indicted in El Paso in 2012 for their alleged roles in a conspiracy to traffic cocaine and marijuana into the United States, launder money and murder perceived enemies.The younger Guzmán on Friday was heading to Chicago, where he was set to make his first court appearance on Tuesday, U.S. officials said. “I’ve got no comment other than to confirm I represent Joaquín and will be in court for him at his initial appearance,” defense attorney Jeffrey Lichtman said.The “Chapitos” were among the U.S. government’s most-sought-after drug-trafficking targets; Washington has offered a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction of the two oldest brothers, Iván and Jesús Alfredo. Joaquín was the least involved in drug trafficking of the brothers, authorities said.Rodríguez was peppered by reporters Friday on why Mexico was not told in advance about such a critical operation. Zambada also faces arrest warrants in Mexico. Rodríguez dismissed the concerns.“We are going to continue cooperating with the U.S. government, as we have done up until this event,” she said.Zambada was seen as a sophisticated operator who had cultivated extensive ties to politicians over the years, analysts said. He could name corrupt Mexican officials who might face U.S. charges themselves.“Getting the list of corrupt officials and going after them is the real prize” in Zambada’s arrest, said Peter Reuter, a criminologist at the University of Maryland who studies fentanyl trafficking.“I’m sure a lot of political actors and government officials did not sleep a wink last night,” Felbab-Brown said. “He knows where all the bodies are buried over many administrations.”Miroff reported from Washington, and Ovalle reported from Miami.

WaPo_12,D.C.’s Friday weather seemed special for being ordinary,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/26/washington-weather-warm-summer-heat/,2024-07-27 09:00:02.801451,,"D.C. may take pride in its reputation for sultry summertime swelter, but Friday seemed the sort of day for wondering what all the fuss was about and whether the reputation was deserved.It was true that Friday seemed obviously a summer day. Its high temperature of 85 degrees seemed clearly consistent with general expectations of summertime.But Friday failed to inflict on the District the harsh meteorological extremism of many days earlier this month — including the four with temperatures above 100 degrees.However, if averages mean much, they may suggest that days such as Friday cannot readily be relied on to appear here always or often in July.The average temperature in Washington on Friday’s date now stands at 90 degrees. So it would seem that part of Friday’s allure lay in the five-degree gap between its temperature and the District’s average July 26 temperature.Possibly Friday’s sense that summer had a benign side, might have been earned physiologically. The many days of extreme and above average temperatures this summer have likely caused acclimatization and a process of adjustment.But cloudy skies also played an obvious part in moderating Friday’s conditions.For much of the day, clouds shielded the city from the wilting effects of the summertime sun. It is just a little more than five weeks since the sun was at its absolute annual acme.Feeling its full late-July strength for protracted periods in the glare of streets without shade, with solar rays reflected from concrete and marble would have made Friday seem far less comfortable than it did.A major contributor to Friday’s welcome as a well-behaved emissary of summer was the humidity. Or the relative absence thereof.When summer seems to be at its most intolerable it is ascribed to the joint effect of severe heat and oppressive humidity. Friday was neither too hot nor too humid.To know the absolute temperature was to know the “feels-like” temperature. Through the day, they were close to identical, meaning that humidity declined to make an 85-degree day seem worse than it was.This was reflected in the day’s dew points, which were confined to the 50s, a location regarded as comfortable."

The production company for Love’s agents also confirmed the agreement on social media.The $55 million average annual value of Love’s extension matches the $55 million-per-year extensions previously signed by Joe Burrow with the Cincinnati Bengals and Trevor Lawrence with the Jacksonville Jaguars. They are, by that measure, the highest-paid players in NFL history.Love’s deal includes a record $75 million signing bonus, according to the people with knowledge of the contract terms, and $155 million in fully guaranteed money. He reported to the Packers’ training camp but would not practice until the extension was completed.Love threw for 4,159 yards and 32 touchdowns during the 2023 regular season. The Packers went 9-8 and reached the playoffs as a wild card, then upset the Dallas Cowboys in an opening-round NFC game before losing to the San Francisco 49ers in a conference semifinal. Love spent his first three seasons backing up Aaron Rodgers after being chosen, controversially, by the Packers in the first round of the 2020 draft.Earlier Friday, quarterback Tua Tagovailoa agreed to a four-year, $212.4 million extension with the Miami Dolphins. The $53.1 million average annual value of Tagovailoa’s extension puts him behind only Love, Burrow and Lawrence."
WaPo_15,"Trump calls Harris a ‘bum,’ complains about Biden’s withdrawal",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/26/trump-turning-point-speech-vance/,2024-07-27 10:13:02.649273,,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Donald Trump honed his attacks on Vice President Harris, the likely Democratic nominee, in a speech at the Turning Point USA Believers’ Summit in West Palm Beach Friday night, calling her “the most incompetent, unpopular and far-left vice president in American history,” blaming her for high numbers of migrant apprehensions at the southern border and calling her a “bum.”“She was a bum three weeks ago,” Trump said. “She was a bum, a failed vice president.”The former president urged attendees at the faith-themed event to vote — “Vote early. Vote absentee. Vote on Election Day. I don’t care how, but you have to get out and vote,” he said — and promised that in four years, “we’ll have it fixed so good you’re not going to have to vote.”Trump and other Republicans have long sought to blame Harris for illegal immigration, characterizing her as President Biden’s “border czar.” Though Biden asked Harris to negotiate with three Central American countries to help address the root causes of migration, he never put her in charge of overall border policy.That and other attacks Friday night continued Trump’s efforts to paint Harris as deeply liberal. Earlier Friday, during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump described Harris as a “radical left person” who “destroyed San Francisco.”But Harris, who served as the top prosecutor in San Francisco and was later elected California attorney general, has a more complicated political story. She won her first race for district attorney by running to the right of the incumbent, her former boss, whom she criticized as too soft on crime.Trump zeroed in on Harris’s past comments about the “defund the police” movement. In 2020, amid mass racial justice protests, Harris said the movement was “rightly saying, we need to take a look at these budgets and figure out whether it reflects the right priorities.”Trump’s campaign attacked Harris on the issue after she joined Biden on the Democratic ticket that year. But a spokesperson for Harris soon disavowed her earlier comments, saying Biden and Harris “do not support defunding the police, and it is a lie to suggest otherwise.” As president, Biden called for increasing police funding to put more police officers on the street.“America can do better than the bitter, bizarre, and backward looking delusions of criminal Donald Trump,” James Singer, a spokesperson for Harris’s campaign, said in a statement Friday night.Trump also continued to complain about Biden’s withdrawal from the race, repeating claims that Democrats replacing Biden on the ticket amounts to a “coup.”Harris has already secured the pledged support of the majority of the delegates she needs to win the Democratic nomination at the party’s convention in Chicago next month. On Friday morning, she got an extra boost from the endorsements of Barack and Michelle Obama, the former president and first lady, the latest nationally prominent Democratic leaders to publicly embrace her candidacy.Recent polls have shown some positive signs for Harris, and a rush of new money and volunteers has flooded into what was once the Biden-Harris campaign. Her head-to-head numbers against Trump are better than Biden’s were.Trump spoke extensively about Harris, whom he hammered in a speech at a rally earlier this week, at the Turning Point USA event. But he has also continued to rail against Biden this week, arguing that the Democratic switcheroo was unfair.“So, we are forced to spend time and money on fighting Crooked Joe Biden, he polls badly after having a terrible debate, and quits the race. Now we have to start all over again,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform earlier this week, asking whether the GOP should be “reimbursed for fraud.”In West Palm Beach, Trump appeared without the bandage he wore on his ear after a gunman attempted to assassinate him at his Butler, Pa., rally. “As I think you can see, I’ve recovered well and in fact just took off — the last bandage off of my ear,” Trump said, making an “ughhh” sound.Trump, who has a habit of inventing derogatory nicknames for his political opponents, again mispronounced Harris’s first name, claiming, incorrectly, that there are “numerous ways” to say it and saying he doesn’t care if he mispronounces it.He also criticized Harris for declining to attend Netanyahu’s recent address to Congress — and claimed she “doesn’t like Jewish people,” though her husband Doug Emhoff is Jewish.He repeated his false claims the 2020 election was rigged and said, “we’re not going to allow them to rig the presidential election in 2024.”The crowd began to chant: “Fight! Fight! Fight!”Offstage, Trump’s campaign was contending with attacks on his running mate, Sen. JD Vance (Ohio). Vance has faced intense criticism in recent days for comments he made in 2021, when he said that Democrats without children, whom he characterized as “childless cat ladies who are miserable,” should not control government. (He included Harris in his characterization, even though she has two stepchildren.)In an interview with Megyn Kelly on Friday, Vance said he has no gripe with women who have struggled to have children and supports efforts to get pregnant through in vitro fertilization, but defended his criticism of those who decide not to have children.“Obviously, it was a sarcastic comment. I’ve got nothing against cats. I’ve got nothing against dogs. I’ve got one dog at home, and I love him,” Vance said. But he added: “It is true that we’ve become anti-family. It is true that the left has become anti-child.”The Harris campaign announced that she would travel to Atlanta on Tuesday for an event, her sixth visit to the swing state of Georgia this year and her first since Biden dropped out of the race and she launched her presidential campaign. She’s in the midst of an all-out push to identify a running mate ahead of the Democratic National Convention.Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), a possible Harris running mate, made plans for an event Saturday in his battleground state. Harris’s campaign said Shapiro will “kick off a weekend of action in Pennsylvania to mark 100 days until the election.”Despite the Turning Point USA summit’s location, just down the road from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, much of the crowd was more focused on religion than on politics. Only a handful of attendees wore red MAGA ball caps; more people wore T-shirts with Bible verses and psalm numbers on them than anything political.But Charlie Kirk, the Trump ally and Turning Point USA president, reminded attendees why they were there. “Our mission is very simple. We exist to kick wokeism out of the American church.”The audience booed, briefly, when Kirk mentioned Harris. “It’s easy to boo. It’s harder to register voters,” Kirk said.Harris “stands against everything that we as Christians believe,” Kirk said.Rozsa reported from West Palm Beach, Fla.

It has forced thousands of residents to evacuate and has destroyed numerous homes, authorities said. Navigating brutal temperatures, strong winds and rugged terrain, crews have yet to contain any part of the blaze.Around 1:40 a.m. Thursday, Crystal Parker had just gotten back to her trailer when she noticed flashing police lights outside the spot six doors down from her. Unable to sleep because of how close the Park Fire was to her home, she’d wanted to check and see if it had switched directions. She had no idea they were arresting the man suspected of starting the fire.Parker didn’t know Stout that well, but would see him often and wave when he said hello to her on his walks. He’d lived there “for quite some time” since getting out of jail and said he seemed “like a decent guy,” but “lonely,” she told The Washington Post. She said she’d heard Stout was excited about recently buying a car for $7,500 — the same one he is accused of mysteriously setting on fire.A TikToker named Elizabeth Fox was one of the first to report seeing Stout, dressed in a red shirt and shorts, acting strangely shortly after she arrived at the swimming hole. In one video, she recalled hearing a car door shut, looked over, saw a man standing in front of his car “and all the sudden it starts bursting into flames.”Stunned, she called 9/11 as Stout was getting back into the burning car. He then exited the vehicle, pushed it down the gully and “walked away like nothing happened,” she cried. The 28-year-old immediately started running to warn families at the swimming holes, she said in her video statement, warning them that there was a fire. As she was sounding the alarm, Fox said she saw Stout again, walking casually back toward the main park.“He was calm. He was holding his phone and that was all he had,” she said. “He didn’t seem urgent to get out of there at all.”The fire spread so fast that she barely got out, said Fox, who also lived through the Camp Fire and still has PTSD from watching it devastate the nearby town of Paradise in 2018. She gave the police the photos she took of the car and the man, calling the experience “horrific” especially because the man “didn’t even have the heart to tell people there was a fire.”Three other young women told CBS that they had been enjoying the swimming hole when a man in his 40s walked up and started making strange remarks, slurring his words. He left them alone once a bystander came up, the group of friends said. Shortly after that is when they saw flames.The Butte County district attorney and other authorities said that around 3 p.m., Stout lit a 2007 Toyota Yaris on fire. He then put it into neutral and pushed it 60 feet into the lush wildland area, the district attorney said. The fire erupted and quickly outmatched the firefighters who were called to respond.Stout has two other felony convictions: He was convicted of child molestation in Butte County in 2001 and robbery with great bodily injury in Kern County in 2002. Stout was in prison for 19 years after the second conviction, records from Kern County show.When officials arrested him this week, Stout was still on probation for a DUI, the district attorney’s office said. While officials said he has not yet been charged, they plan to book him on suspicion of intentional arson once they finish reviewing the evidence. He is now in the Butte County Jail, and the arraignment is set for Monday, according to the district attorney.Back at the Chico Mobile Home Park, residents are processing the prospect that someone who lived there may have started a fire that could have destroyed them.Amanda Brown, who has lived in the park for about seven years, said she recognized Stout and couldn’t believe that someone, especially one of her neighbors, would “deliberately do this knowing how many lives are at stake.” She said this was especially true after what her community went through after losing Paradise.Brown is still terrified of fire because of what she saw. Her brother lost everything he owned, including his long-term boyfriend. He did not have fire insurance for his double-wide, and has never recovered. She had many friends lose their businesses and others who became homeless.“The trauma of the Paradise Fire, they — we — haven’t gotten over it,” she said. “Losing a whole town, all those people who died.”Anxiously watching the Park Fire grow, she can’t help but think of what could happen to her and her 80-year-old aunt, who just moved in with her, if a similar fire were to roar into their community.“In these mobile home parks, we are packed in like sardines. This thing will go up in 10 minutes,” she said. “Everything we own is in this single-wide mobile home.”"
WaPo_17,Miss Manners: I’m uncomfortable donating to crowdfunding sites for funerals,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/07/27/miss-manners-donating-funds-funerals/,2024-07-27 11:59:02.728096,,"Dear Miss Manners: Three times in the past year, friends have sent me links to crowdfunding sites where family members were soliciting funds to bury a relative. I am uncomfortable adding myself to the list of donor names followed by a dollar amount (the “top donor” and their donation is highlighted).Now I have received an online notice to pay for a 70-year-old cousin's death-related expenses. These included cremation, biodegradable urns, jewelry made from the ashes for the five (adult) children, a future “celebration of life” ceremony, and money to purchase a “tribute grove” of five to 15 trees.This person went a little far, in my opinion, but my main struggle is with the optics of such a list. It appears that people are expressing condolences with money. Most crowdfunding sites have an option to donate anonymously, and I usually do so, because my name is still visible to the organizer.There are those who legitimately need help to finance a memorial service. If a family deems such extras necessary, they can pay for them themselves.Miss Manners' advice will not be popular, but she would tell you to refrain from donating except in the most dire of cases — and to do it anonymously. The competitive aspect of this is unseemly, and best avoided. A condolence letter and offer of help by way of food or transportation is generous.Dear Miss Manners: Is it inappropriate to take someone’s glasses right off of their face and clean them? This happened to me, and I found it insulting. It was not a stranger, but it was at a social event.It’s just weird. Perhaps this person thought they would be doing you a favor. Miss Manners hopes your stunned look conveyed otherwise.Dear Miss Manners: As a teenager in her first job, I have a good workplace, for the most part. The manager is friendly, and the co-workers are amusing and cooperative. Except one. She is the kind of person who always has SOMETHING wrong: her finger (cut while she was under the influence), her hand (scraped by an approaching car), her hip (nerve pain, which the manager also has), etc.Her complaints sometimes differ, but they all have one thing in common — making others pick up her slack. One employee demanded she never get scheduled on the same shift with her. People trade pained smiles when we get stuck with her during rush hours and closing. Multiple people have approached the manager, and he always says he’ll do something (like cut her hours or talk to her), but it never happens.How can I elegantly handle this? Or should I keep my nose out of it and deal with it?Perhaps, Miss Manners suggests, you can keep your nose out of it AND deal with it by saying, “I’m so sorry that you’re hurt, but unfortunately, I only have time to do my own job today. Perhaps you can speak to the manager about cutting back if you’re not feeling up to working this week.”New Miss Manners columns are posted Monday through Saturday on washingtonpost.com/advice.

I have been recently told by my son that his wife does not want anyone at the hospital, except for my son.I am devastated. My parents, sister and husband are all gone. It was family time in the hospital when my son was born. I cannot comprehend the fact my daughter-in-law will not allow me to be part of this joyful time.To be clear, I have no desire to participate in the birth process, only to be able to hold my first grandchild during their stay at the hospital before they go home, and the chaos begins. Any suggestions?— Heartbroken Hospital VisitorVisitor: This special moment, with its firsts and its unknowns, is naturally stirring up a lot of emotions. It sounds like some of those happy and nervous emotions are bringing up your grief. That is also natural.Try not to put all of your emotional expectations on this hospital visit. Your daughter-in-law is not specifically excluding you. Notably her parents are also not on the invite list. This is how your son and daughter-in-law have chosen to navigate this transition, which is also exciting and nerve-racking for them.Focus on the parts of this new life stage that feel hopeful. Perhaps you and your daughter's parents can lend a hand to get the house ready for the return. Perhaps you'll be a welcome antidote to the coming chaos. You will have so many chances to hold your new grandchild. If you can gently release this aspect of your plan, I think you'll find relief, and beyond that — joyful excitement.Dear Eric: I met someone in real life, and I asked — via Messenger — if she would like to hang out. The icons on Messenger say she has not seen the message. Although that may mean she saw the preview of the message as a push notification but didn’t read the whole thing. The part that shows up in the preview should get the idea across.I share a community with this person, and we are in a large chat group in another messaging app, so I could get in touch with her through that app. If I contacted her, I might say that I had sent a message through Messenger, and she didn’t appear to have seen it, and if she hasn’t seen it, she might want to look, and if she has seen it, then I’m sorry for this superfluous second message, which she can ignore. Or maybe that’s pushing too much?Regardless of how this resolves, this person and I are likely to be in the same space as each other a few times per month going forward. And I would like to be friends, or — if that possibility has been squandered — not make things untenably awkward or unpleasant for either of us.— Messenger Missive MessinessMessenger: It seems like there are more unspoken rules around social media-based relationships than there are around face-to-face ones. The anxiety produced can be enough to make one long for a less advanced time. Give me the pastoral life of a letter-writing Jane Austen heroine, waiting weeks for news. Or, better yet, set me up with a cave wall and let me paint all of my correspondence on there.For better or worse, here we are in the present, where our devices will beep and boop and notify us of far too many things. The information you're getting from Facebook is all relatively benign, but it's prompting you to put together a story in your head. That story is causing you unnecessary worry.I'm reminded of a quote from a book titled “IRL: Finding Our Real Selves in a Digital World” by Chris Stedman. “Social media is a kind of funhouse mirror of society, in that it warps some things and reveals others, which makes it confusing to navigate but also fertile ground for the work of trying to better understand ourselves and the world around us.”It's good to have healthy boundaries with potential friends, but you don't have to be as concerned about making a misstep with this particular person.You write that you share space with this person a few times a month. If you mean you’ll actually be in the same room, try starting over the next time you see her. Strike up a conversation. Ask about shared interests or hobbies. If the conversation is going well, you may choose to say, “I’m not sure if you saw, but I sent you a message about the possibility of hanging out. No pressure: but if it sounds appealing to you, I’m still game.”Don’t worry too much about squandered possibilities.

WaPo_19,Carolyn Hax: Fiancé secretly tracks ‘gold digger’s’ contribution to shared home,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/07/27/carolyn-hax-fiance-gold-digger-spreadsheet/,2024-07-27 11:59:02.728096,,"Adapted from an online discussion.Dear Carolyn: My fiancé and I bought a house late last year, with help from his parents. Though we both make good salaries, he comes from a rich family, and I was raised by a single mom. His parents insisted on giving us the money for our down payment and closing costs, and my mom gave us a dishwasher, which was very generous of all of them and also appreciated.We have been working like mad on fixing the house up to get it ready for our wedding. Neither of us is very experienced with DIY, so it’s been a difficult, stressful process and caused some tension between us. We were discussing what kind of flooring to get for the front hall, and I wanted the more expensive but easier-to-work-with stuff. We got into a fight that escalated to the point of him accusing me of being a gold digger who was after his money. I was in shock and asked him why he would think that, and he said, “Because you told me about how you grew up poor,” and he’s had the thought in the back of his head since we bought the house. He told me he has a spreadsheet where he keeps track of how much he’s spent on me versus how much I’ve spent on him and he has spent thousands more on me, not even counting the money his parents gave us.I told him that didn’t sound right since we split all costs 50/50, and he admitted it included my engagement ring. It is a family heirloom his great-aunt gave him, but he was counting the value of it.Later he apologized, but I’m still hurt and angry. I feel paranoid that maybe his family said something. I’m really sad that all this time I’ve been loving him and thinking he was wonderful, and he’s been thinking this way about me and even documenting it so he could throw it in my face.He’s said the spreadsheet is just an “anxiety thing” and he loves me and wants us to work on fixing things. I think I do, too, but then I think of what he said and I get overwhelmed. How can I get over this?— “Gold Digger”“Gold Digger”: Whoo. I don’t know. I don’t know that I could.Or that you should.He not only has kept the thought in the back of his mind for months? years? that you have poor values and ulterior motives and can’t be trusted, but kept records in the event he needs to prove it.I wish I had a more hopeful answer for you. But he either lashed out impulsively and didn’t mean it, or accidentally told the truth — those are the only two choices — and the first is a stretch when there’s a spreadsheet as evidence of the second.Plus, the first is so vicious in its own right.He says he loves you, okay. But trusts? Respects? Believes in?Does he feel lucky every day to be the person you chose?Best case, “just an ‘anxiety thing,’” still casts you as a threat to be controlled. So the “work on fixing things” doesn’t sound like DIY, but instead couples counseling at the least.The family paranoia, by the way, is wasted stress — each of you stands on your own authority in choosing your partner, 100 percent, or you’re not ready to be anyone’s partner. If he’s that susceptible to their influence, then the problem is still between the two of you, so that’s where your attention belongs."
WaPo_20,"Russia, adapting tactics, advances in Donetsk and takes more Ukrainian land",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/27/russia-adapting-tactics-advances-donetsk-takes-more-ukrainian-land/,2024-07-27 12:59:02.720319,,"POKROVSK, Ukraine — Russian forces have mounted an arc of attack in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, pushing through intense summer heat in a bid to extend Moscow’s steady territorial gains and capture the city of Pokrovsk, a key transit junction.The offensive is underway as Ukraine continues to suffer from a shortage of soldiers and as election turmoil in the United States has set off new speculation that Kyiv may soon be forced to negotiate a surrender of lands.After an influx of American weapons and money helped Ukraine blunt a renewed invasion of the northeast Kharkiv region in May, preventing a major breakthrough and dashing Moscow’s hopes of surrounding Ukraine’s second-largest city, Russian commanders have refocused their attention on the Donetsk region, perhaps Russian President Vladimir Putin’s top territorial goal.The reinvasion of the Kharkiv region, while yielding limited gains, nonetheless diverted Ukrainian resources. Oleksandr, 30, a battalion commander of the 47th brigade, fighting near Ocheretyne, said that Ukrainian forces are struggling and that Putin’s prize increasingly seems within Russia’s reach.“This strategy is clever: You try to concentrate the strength of your enemy in one direction and then distract them at another,” said Oleksandr, whose call sign is “Genius” and who is being identified only by first name in keeping with Ukrainian military protocol.“Their first objective is to destroy us,” he said. “The second is to push us so that they can get more leverage for peace talks and get more from us. They are almost at the point of capturing the Donetsk region.”Putin’s troops are now pressing along an arc of three key points: Chasiv Yar, just west of the city of Bakhmut, which Russia captured in spring 2023; the small industrial city of Toretsk; and in rural terrain west of Ocheretyne, a village on strategic high ground seized in May after Russian forces advanced northwest from Avdiivka, which they occupied in February.While there is intense fighting elsewhere, including in Kupyansk in the northeast and on some spots along the southern front, the offensive in Donetsk represents a notable shift in tactics by Russian commanders who appear to have learned from past mistakes and are now achieving steady gains for the Kremlin, also threatening the Ukrainian city of Kostiantynivka, which sits on a strategic highway.This week, the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, reported that Ukraine halted a large mechanized assault by Russian forces near Kostiantynivka, resulting in a significant loss of Russian equipment. On Friday, Ukraine’s General Staff reported that the “hottest situation” remained near Pokrovsk.“This new push in the Donetsk region is very interesting as it indicates that there is wider operational planning change,” said Karolina Hird, an analyst at ISW. “Meaningful advance was previously inhibited by Russian tactical blunders and they’ve struggled to strategize in the last few years.”“Having previously just thrown men at prolonged, high casualty efforts,” she continued, “Russian operational commanders are now learning how to do simultaneous and mutual reinforcing offensive efforts and maintain constant pressure on Ukrainian resources.”Ukraine’s depleted forces are feeling the pressure, worsened by the sweltering summer heat, with temperatures spiking earlier this month to more than 104 degrees in some areas of the front.Ukrainian commanders and soldiers interviewed by The Post cited exhaustion and dwindling resources, including a severe lack of troops. A new mobilization law adopted by Ukraine’s parliament has yet to provide desperately needed reinforcements, as new conscripts are still undergoing training, and some draft-eligible men have fled the country or are hiding at home to avoid conscription.One sergeant, 56, who goes by the call sign “Bart,” described the situation as “critical” and said there was “serious chaos” on the front lines. He blamed failures in leadership decisions, including cases of Ukrainian and Russian forces mixing up their positions.Mikhail, 46, the commander of a mortar battery fighting in Krasnogorivka, who goes by the call sign “Brain,” said that reconnaissance had shown that Russia recently “raised the bar” around Ocheretyne and committed significant resources, including more troops and tanks.Last week, Russian forces managed to advance four miles west from Ocheretyne, forcing the retreat of a Ukrainian infantry brigade holding the line in the village of Prohres.Ukraine’s 47th Mechanized Brigade was forced into a “chaotic retreat” due to a lack of soldiers.Some of the most intense fighting of the summer is now underway around the industrial city of Toretsk, where Russia has made significant tactical gains.Commanders and military analysts said the purpose of that fighting, and Russian assaults on the nearby city of Niu-York, was to put pressure on Ukraine’s fatigued infantry units, with the aim of breaking through to Kostiantynivka.Ukrainian soldiers said the Russian forces near Toretsk appeared to be using the same strategy used to capture Avdiivka in February after months of heavy fighting. There, the Russians enveloped the Ukrainians from three sides, while simultaneously exhausting them by relentlessly dropping glide bombs from above.Now, in addition to incessant bombing and drone attacks, extreme heat is depleting soldiers living in trenches in Ukraine’s forests and wide-open fields. And clear blue skies mean that soldiers are even more exposed to reconnaissance and attack drones.Some Russian forces are also moving west and north through the town of Kurakhove. If they capture Toretsk, Pokrovsk and Kostiantynivka, the entire Donetsk region would be in peril.Several Ukrainian commanders cited an acceleration in drone warfare as one of the principal challenges on the battlefield, with Russia having significantly increased its electronic jamming capabilities to erase Ukraine’s previous advantage using first-person view, or FPV, drones.“What has changed tremendously is their drone tactics and their use of electronic warfare. We used to have the upper hand and were more efficient, but now this is not the case,” Mikhail said.Serhii, 29, the commander of a drone unit working in Niu-York, who goes by the call sign “Shelby,” said that Ukraine is also re-engineering drones to carry out demining and new kinds of assaults. For example, he said, engineers had attached antitank mines to heavy duty Kazhan drones.Many vehicles in Donbas are now fitted with antennas, indicating they carry drone-jamming equipment. Soldiers also use small black boxes known as “sugars,” radars that identify and warn of circling drones. Sugars didn’t exist in Ukraine a year ago but are now common.Ukrainian soldiers also noted an increase in the use of aviation bombs, especially Soviet-era glide bombs, around Chasiv Yar and Niu-York, which they said was causing significant damage and affecting morale. Some weigh 6,600 pounds and can destroy infantry positions and buildings with catastrophic effect.Eugene, 41, a drone pilot working in Niu-York, said that while Russian commanders were still relying on “meat assault” tactics — sending waves of often underprepared, recent conscripts at a target — they also are applying new “scorched earth” tactics to obliterate entire towns.“The Russians are hitting Niu-York with aviation bombs and artillery to completely obliterate entire quadrants of the city so that they can move troops in,” Serhii, the drone commander, said.Pasha, 34, a drone commander fighting with the 105th brigade, described the situation in Niu-York as “really hard.”“They are using Niu-York to encircle Toretsk — and I think they have a real chance now of encircling it, it’s just a question of resources and timing,” Pasha said. The glide bombs are so powerful, they can incapacitate entire infantry units with concussions, he said.Hird, of the Institute for the Study of War, said that Russia was unlikely to succeed despite its recent gains.“Russia has not demonstrated that it can effectively perform mechanized advances and take large swaths of territory, so it is unlikely they’d be able to take the whole of Donbas by force,” she said. Still, she said, a slow, grinding, attritional conflict was more beneficial to Moscow as Ukrainian morale flags and future Western support is called into doubt.Siobhán O’Grady in Kyiv contributed to this report."
WaPo_21,"Juan Yepez stays hot, Jacob Young delivers late to lift Nats over Cardinals",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/27/nationals-cardinals-juan-yepez-jacob-young/,2024-07-27 12:43:02.720319,,"ST. LOUIS — Good things came in threes for the Washington Nationals in a 10-8 come-from-behind win Friday night against the St. Louis Cardinals.Jacob Young’s three-run 10th-inning triple was the difference on a night Juan Yepez came back to the stadium he first called home and lashed three hits.His offense helped the Nationals overcome a 6-3 deficit to send the game into extra innings, where Young’s triple proved decisive. Young then scored on a single by CJ Abrams, and the Nationals (48-56) withstood Paul Goldschmidt’s two-run homer in the bottom of the inning to snap a three-game losing streak.Yepez finished 3 for 4, drove in a pair of runs and scored two more as the Nationals bounced back with 11 hits after going hitless the previous day. Before Yepez scored the game’s first run in the second inning, the Nationals had not scored in 18 innings.“He’s been awesome since he’s been called up,” Manager Dave Martinez said. “He’s doing his job. He’s not trying to do too much. He’s hitting the ball everywhere, driving in big runs for us. He’s playing really well.”The Nationals called up Yepez hoping to find some more consistent production in their order after Joey Meneses faltered. And that’s exactly what they have gotten — Yepez has a .375 batting average with a 1.032 OPS and 11 extra base hits in 17 games.“You go up there thinking he’s going to get a hit, honestly,” Young said. “He’s done a great job coming from AAA to here. It’s not an easy thing to do to get off to a start like this.”Meneses, the team’s best hitter after the Juan Soto trade two years ago, was unable to recapture his form from 2022. And Yepez, a once-touted prospect who was non-tendered by St. Louis after last season, is proving to be exactly what rebuilding teams desire — productive players with team control that cost them little. He signed a minor league deal with Washington is December.Washington’s first basemen combined for a .610 OPS before Yepez was called up — 27th in MLB. Yepez has played every game at first since being called up, and entering Friday, his OPS was .992; only the Rockies’ first basemen have a higher OPS in that span.Yepez’s signature moment as a big leaguer came in 2022 at the same park in which he played in Friday night — a go-ahead two-run homer in Game 1 of the Cardinals’ first-round series against the Philadelphia Phillies. But the moment was forgotten as the Phillies won that game and the series en route to a World Series appearance. Yepez, meanwhile, spent most of the 2023 season in the minors. When he was recalled, he struggled, batting just .183 in 28 games.“It’s always fun to come here,” Yepez said. “The fans here are great and I think they were very good to me and to my family.”With Washington, he spent the first three months at Class AAA Rochester waiting again for a chance. But he has seized this opportunity since. Yepez’s three-week hot stretch doesn’t guarantee that he will be long-term answer at first base; the Nationals will need to upgrade that position this offseason if they truly believe they can contend soon. But if Yepez keeps performing well, he could play himself into the conversation to stick around next season in some capacity.After being no-hit Thursday by the Padres’ Dylan Cease, Yepez delivered the team’s first hit in more than 48 hours with a second-inning single. Three batters later, Luis García Jr. hit a two-run double that put the Nationals ahead 2-0.That lead wouldn’t last long as MacKenzie Gore allowed five runs in the ensuing frame. Gore fell behind to five straight hitters to open the third. The results of those at-bats: walk, two-run homer, single, single, three-run homer.The Nationals hoped this year would be a breakout campaign for their 26-year-old left-hander. He started the season strong, pitching to a 3.24 ERA after striking out 10 hitters June 14. But in the seven starts since, Gore has allowed four runs or more in four of those outings. On Friday, he allowed six as his ERA ballooned to 4.51.But Washington was able to mount a comeback against Cardinals starter Sonny Gray despite Gore’s struggles. Yepez’s fourth-inning single was followed by García’s run-scoring single three batters later to cut Washington’s deficit to 5-3. After the Cardinals scored a run in the fourth off Gore, Yepez produced an RBI double before James Wood added an RBI groundout to cut the lead to 6-5. And in the seventh, Yepez came up with two runners in scoring position and hit a sacrifice fly to tie the game.It stayed 6-6 into the 10th, with Yepez starting the inning as the automatic runner on second. He would be lifted for the speedier Nasim Nuñez, who came around to score on Young’s two-out triple that carried over the glove of right fielder Dylan Carlson, scoring Garcia and Trey Lipscomb.“That was a grind,” Martinez said. “The boys hung in there. We had some good at-bats late. From getting no-hit to scoring ten runs, I can say it everyday, 1,000 times a day — these guys have fight in them. They really do.”Note: The Nationals placed right-handed reliever Jordan Weems on the 15-day injured list with right shin splints, retroactive to July 25, and recalled Eduardo Salazar from Rochester. Weems, who was one of the Nationals best relievers a season ago, allowed five runs Wednesday to raise his ERA to 6.59 in 40 appearances.Weems, 31, said he has been dealing with shin splints for the past year, but the injury was bothering him more than usual after his previous outing. Weems will still throw but hopes that rest will allow his shin to heal. Salazar, 26, pitched two scoreless frames and struck out four in his only appearance with the Nationals."

So far it has continued to grow unabated, burning at a rate of 4,000 to 5,000 acres per hour and scorching rugged, difficult terrain filled with grass, brush, timber and dead vegetation, officials said Friday.The fire is currently 0 percent contained, according to Cal Fire, and has prompted evacuation orders in Butte, Tehama and Shasta counties as it moves rapidly on its northern and eastern flanks. The blaze has been progressing north toward the city of Redding, crossing Highway 36 and threatening small towns such as Shingletown and Manton, according to fire mapping and experts.California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) on Friday declared a state of emergency in Butte and Tehama counties in response to the fire, saying in a statement that “we are using every available tool to protect lives and property as our fire and emergency response teams work around the clock to combat these challenging fires.”Due to erratic winds and high temperatures, firefighters have been struggling to mount any sort of offense, using most of their resources to try to defend communities in the wildfire’s path. Crews had containment at 3 percent earlier Friday but that then fell back to zero.“This fire has fingers that are growing in different directions depending on which way the wind is blowing,” Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said at a news conference Friday afternoon.Thousands of people in Butte County, where the fire started, Tehama and Shasta counties have had to evacuate. CalFire said in an update Friday that 4,200 structures are threatened and 134 have been destroyed.On Friday evening, the town of Paradise, which was devastated by the Camp Fire in 2018, issued an evacuation warning due to “fire behavior and predicted winds” and urged residents to prepare to evacuate and await further information.Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA, described the wildfire’s spread as “astonishing” in a post on social media and said it is “re-writing the record books.”“This is California in the Pyrocene,” Swain wrote, referring to an era characterized by human-caused fire activity, “and a couple of mild fire years (2022/3) don’t alter that long-term trajectory.”"

WaPo_28,Even Richard Schiff thinks we’re living in ‘The West Wing’,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/2024/07/27/west-wing-biden-harris-election/,2024-07-27 16:59:02.751608,,"NEW YORK — As clips of “Veep” began circulating Sunday afternoon in the wake of President Biden’s exit from the 2024 race and Vice President Harris’s ascendance in his place, the group chat of another political show beloved among Washington’s goverati was on fire.“Our ‘West Wing’ thread lit up,” says Richard Schiff, who spent seven years playing White House communications director Toby Ziegler on the venerated network TV show — and actively campaigned for President Biden during his unsuccessful 2008 run for the White House. He’s been a Biden supporter and friendly with the family ever since.“Everywhere I look, there’s a ‘West Wing’ episode apparently relevant to whatever the news is that day,” he says over the phone, a few days after meeting in person in what felt like a different life, dominated by the assassination attempt against Donald Trump and the fallout from Biden’s abysmal debate performance.“But one thing someone on that text thread said is that Aaron Sorkin could never have thought this one up,” Schiff says. “This is beyond what we were capable of imagining.”Actually, Sorkin, who created “The West Wing,” did attempt to imagine an alternate plotline. Sunday morning, he’d published an op-ed in the New York Times proposing that Democrats make a radical move and nominate Republican Mitt Romney (R-Utah) at the convention. Then when the Biden news broke, he reversed tack, in an email posted on X by Joshua Malina, who’d played deputy communications director Will Bailey on the series. “I take it all back,” Sorkin wrote. “Harris for America!”“I’m stumped by why he would write that [Times piece], and it’s certainly not anything I agree with, but we’re all capable of mind blips,” Schiff says.Personally, though, Schiff was a mess of emotions. “I was shocked and at the same time excited, and so sad for the President, who I’ve had a relationship with,” he says, adding, “I do think he fits the ‘West Wing’ profile of someone who wants to leave the world a better place.”Schiff is an independent, but he’s almost always voted blue and has attended every Democratic National Convention since 2000. “The West Wing” was an instantaneous hit when it debuted in October 1999 toward the end of the Clinton administration, and immediately embraced by Washington, with politicians clamoring to hobnob with their fictional counterparts and Democrats clinging to this depiction of their ideal White House during the George W. Bush years. He’s already planning a trip to the Democratic National Convention in August and may go with friends from the “West Wing” cast.Schiff says he tends to “cringe” when actors talk about politics; he only agreed to this interview after the urging of a mutual friend. But he’s also embraced the idea that if you’re one of the people who gets put in the spotlight, for whatever reason, that’s an opportunity to shine it on someone more deserving.He says he didn’t cringe, though, when George Clooney wrote his editorial calling for Biden to drop out of the race — “I often don’t cringe when people who devote their lives to activism speak out,” he says. “I only cringe when actors says stupid things, like I’m probably saying right now.”Despite his protestations, Schiff does have political relevance. Every day, he hears from idealists in Washington who say they were inspired to start their careers because of “The West Wing,” as new generations have found the show on Netflix and now Max.He’s agreed to be part of a podcast series in which actors read short stories imagining a world profoundly altered by the rights and freedoms the conservative blueprint Project 2025 proposes stripping away. And he’s already been on Zoom calls conscripting him to head to Michigan and Wisconsin, and, presumably, be on the campaign trail for Harris and down-ballot Democrats all the way through November.The last time Schiff was in the White House was May, accompanying his stepfather, the 93 year-old civil rights attorney Clarence B. Jones, who helped Martin Luther King draft his “I Have a Dream” speech, as President Biden gave Jones the Medal of Freedom.Growing up in New York, Schiff, 69, was in the streets protesting the Vietnam War as a teenager, and on the dais, at 13, when students took over Columbia University. He was, he believes, the only White person at the first Black Panther meeting in New York, taken there by civil rights lawyer Flo Kennedy, who was a friend of the family. “That was my influence,” he says. “Mainstream politics seemed ridiculous to me” — especially when Watergate broke just as he earned the right to vote.He’d worked in theater on and off in his 20s but didn’t get into acting seriously until he was 31, after a string of blue-collar jobs, including driving a taxi, laying cable and cleaning Greyhound buses on the night shift at the Port Authority. Then “The West Wing” happened. D.C. opened its arms to the cast, the writers, the consultants, Sorkin. He found himself in Congress lobbying for unions, which was easy, since he’d been a member of “seven or eight.”Everyone in politics wanted to talk to him about politics, and cared about his opinion — which was pretty informed since he was spending all his time learning the inner workings of the White House and how to craft messaging from consultants including Lawrence O’Donnell (a former Senate aide), former White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers and pollsters Patrick Caddell and Frank Luntz. “I got indoctrinated into the mainstream through the show,” says Schiff, who now spends part of the year living in Montana with his wife, actress Sheila Kelley, talking with neighbors who have MAGA signs on their lawns.He’s since campaigned for Al Gore and Barack Obama, and went to every battleground state with Hillary Clinton in 2016 — he was at the Javits Center when she lost.Biden is the one politician he’s had a true relationship with, though. They first met just before Biden gave a not-so-great speech at the 2004 convention. And then after a debate in Charleston in July 2007, through Luntz, he met Biden again. They had pizza and Cokes at a Courtyard Inn and Biden asked the actor to come to Iowa in the middle of winter with him.Schiff thought Biden was personable, had integrity and needed his help. Plus, he felt Biden’s presence in the race kept Clinton and Obama honest. The actor would pile into one of two SUVs containing Biden, his wife, Jill, sons Beau and Hunter and a few staff members, and they’d show up to a Pizza Hut or library. He spent four or five days in the cold with them, and was ready to head to New Hampshire and South Carolina, before Biden came in fifth and dropped out. “I think I was the only one of us that knew he had no chance,” Schiff says.Maybe that idealism is why his exit from this race took so long. “But I never felt the arrogance or narcissism people were accusing him of,” Schiff says. “What I got from him was just enthusiasm.”In the weeks since the debate, certain story arcs of “The West Wing” have been brought up again and again.Notably, an assassination attempt and a presidential health crisis in which President Bartlet (Martin Sheen) revealed that he had multiple sclerosis and had been hiding his health issues from the American public in an election year. Bartlet ended up staying in the race, killing it at a debate and winning in a landslide. It wasn’t meant to be a moral victory, Schiff says.“We love how Martin portrayed it, but I think Aaron Sorkin saw this as a real problem of not following the fundamental requirements of governance, such as transparency,” Schiff says. “Without transparency, you’re withholding information and you’re betraying your staff and it’s just the tip-top of the iceberg.”But the episode Schiff has been thinking of most in recent days is Season 1’s “A Proportional Response.” In the episode, President Bartlet learned that his personal physician had been killed on a U.S. military transport that got shot down by Syrian terrorists. Bartlet’s immediate reaction was utter destruction. “I will blow them off the face of the earth with the fury of God’s own thunder,” he says, calmly, without a moment’s hesitation.What came next, though, was a high-wire dance, in which Bartlet’s staff and military advisers tried to talk him down. As the public, Schiff says, we see the speech only at the end of that process. In other words, we don’t know what happened in this very personal stretch for Biden, beyond news reports that Schiff doesn’t believe tell the whole story. We don’t know what happened in the Harris household, except that Ella Emhoff was organizing her knitting studio “before my Sunday became extremely not chill,” as she put it on Instagram.That episode showed the humanity of the president, and how important it is to have advisers who are willing to speak the truth in uncomfortable and dangerous situations. “And all of those things, we know, will not exist in a Trump presidency and did not exist in the last one,” says Schiff.The choice over the next few months, Schiff says, is really what kind of television show we want to be living in.“If we’re a combination of ‘West Wing’ and ‘Veep,’ I think we’ll survive,” he says. “If we’re a combination of ‘House of Cards’ and ‘Veep,’ then we won’t.”"

WaPo_30,Le1f made queer rap history. He’s back as Kalifa after nearly a decade.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/2024/07/27/le1f-kalifa-queer-rapper/,2024-07-27 16:59:02.751608,,"Brooklyn-based musician Kalifa dispatched a carpe-diem ditty called “Right Now” at the end of May, just in time for summer. The song’s rubbery synths give way to a propulsive dance-pop-rock hybrid as he sings, “What if I break my chains and escape? / I’ll be my own creation / Tired of waiting.”For Kalifa (born Khalif Diouf), the wait has been more than eight years since his last proper project, an album released in 2015, when he was known as the rapper Le1f. That’s a long hiatus in a pop music career, especially as social media algorithms whittle down Andy Warhol’s 15 minutes into smaller increments of fame. So while Diouf is a step ahead of musicians just getting in the game, he knows not to take for granted any fans waiting for the return of the artist formerly known as Le1f.“I know that a lot of them were not looking for an up-tempo song with a synth guitar in it,” he admits with a laugh over Zoom.What those listeners were probably expecting sounded more like “Wut,” his signature track as Le1f, and one that blasted the musician onto the upper echelons of the underground music world in the previous decade. The song, with its sparse horn samples and sub-bass production, introduced the world to a rapper-producer equally adept at shrugged-off sneers and double-time, multisyllabic attacks.Perhaps most notably, amid still-resonant couplets (“Toss my gems up, raise the bar, Yung Phenomenon / I make a neo-Nazi kamikaze wanna firebomb”) were the kind of out-and-proud come-ons that are still extremely rare in mainstream rap: “The fever in his eyes, he wanna suckle on my muscle / He wanna burst my bubble and see what’s up in my jungle.”“Wut” quickly became part of the legacy of queer music. But it also led to press coverage that pigeonholed Le1f as a “queer rapper” — not just a rapper — alongside peers such as Cakes da Killa, Mykki Blanco and Zebra Katz. In retrospect, he’s able to see both negative and positive. Defining Le1f and his peers in terms of a social identity rather than a musical one might have blocked them from mainstream conversations, but it also provided a service for a nascent culture.“I have like 100 daughters and Cakes has 100 daughters,” he says of his musical descendants. “It is a legacy of freedom and a path that was given to a lot of younger queer artists.”Diouf spent a few years building buzz and releasing a steady stream of music, culminating with a debut album, “Riot Boi,” released via XL Recordings and Terrible Records. Then it all stopped, and while he says it was “fun while it lasted,” his experience as Le1f was disheartening.“Working with a major label at the time was a bit tricky for me,” he says. “My hype train dwindled before I was able to really navigate and understand all the back-end business and set my team up properly.”As his buzz evaporated, Diouf hoped to step back, regroup and come back more prepared, possibly rebranding under a moniker closer to his birth name. Then, in a now familiar twist, the onset of the pandemic put those plans on hold. Not all was lost: He was able to use the socially distanced time to learn about music theory and composition. Diouf’s research into a range of musical topics helped him understand his own intentions as a musician, and how the music he makes relates to everything from prehistoric sub-Saharan instruments to Little Richard.“Having this wealth of material and inspiration has really fueled me to make exactly what I want to make, how I want to make it and shoot for the stars,” he says.In the period between Le1f and Kalifa, Diouf found it challenging to access the mental and physical space he needed to execute his vision. He worked with both operatic and R&B vocal trainers to sharpen his skills, and is now more comfortable experimenting and executing as a vocalist (even if he finds calling himself a singer “a little cringe”).In the past few years, he has been able to trace his music back to its inspiration points, accumulating songs for cohesive records that pay tribute to the genres of mainstream music with Black roots, such as rock and disco. He knows what he wants to do for the next “three and a half albums,” and — after the long hiatus — he knows he has to get started ASAP.“The material that I’ve been making is so much better than anything I’ve ever put out before. … It’s so much more relatable and refined than anything I’ve ever released,” he says. “When I listen to them side by side, it’s just night and day.”"

WaPo_33,"U.S., Japan to unveil first steps towards enhanced military alliance",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/07/27/japan-us-joint-command-china/,2024-07-27 18:00:02.725430,,"Washington and Tokyo are set to announce Sunday the first concrete steps to modernize the command of their respective armed forces in Japan, a milestone toward a more robust military partnership.The deepening strategic alliance comes as the two allies are increasingly concerned by the linked threats facing Europe and Asia, with China and North Korea fueling Russia’s war in Ukraine — and the fear that Moscow’s defiance of the west could embolden Beijing to invade Taiwan.Japan has recently embraced a leadership role in the region, loosening traditional military constraints and beefing up its defense capabilities, both to shield itself and help the United States maintain stability in the western Pacific. It has announced a plan to set up a joint operational command by next March to better coordinate its sailors, airmen, soldiers and marines.To align with Japan’s new command, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Sunday is expected to announce an upgrade of the current U.S. Forces Japan headquarters, which is largely an administrative office, to an all-service or “Joint Force” headquarters led by a three-star commander.“It is really historic as it relates to the alliance and our military ties to Japan,” said a senior defense official, who like other U.S. and Japanese officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the announcement has not yet been made.Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken will be in Tokyo this weekend to meet with their counterparts, Defense Minister Minoru Kihara and Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa, respectively. The officials will advance agreements — including increased co-production of weapons and greater defense industrial cooperation — reached between Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and President Biden at the state visit in Washington this April.The deepening defense relationship is part of the Biden administration’s Indo-Pacific strategy that seeks a counterweight to rising Chinese aggression by strengthening relationships with like-minded countries.“This is a strategy predicated on building collective capacity with allies and partners, encouraging them to step up in innovative ways,” said Mira Rapp-Hooper, White House senior director for East Asia, at a discussion at the American Enterprise Institute this week, citing Japan’s partnership with the United States as a prime example of the strategy.The upgrading of U.S. Forces Japan, based at Yokota Air Force Base outside Tokyo, is aimed at giving it powers similar to Japan’s new joint operational command. Unlike U.S. Forces Korea, where a four-star U.S. commander oversees both South Korean and American troops, the U.S. Joint Force headquarters in Japan will remain in charge of only U.S. forces, though the goal is for “our two militaries to operate together seamlessly,” the defense official said.Under the plan, put forth by the head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, Adm. Samuel Paparo, the commander of U.S. Forces Japan will eventually have increased authorities and staff to expand operational cooperation with Japan’s new joint command.“It’s the eventual transformation of the U.S.-Japan relationship into a true military partnership,” said Christopher Johnstone, Japan chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former White House director for East Asia.Details of the modernized command are still to be worked out, said defense officials, who noted they are doing so in consultation with Tokyo and Capitol Hill. Follow-on working groups will address questions such as the command’s area of responsibility and operational authorities.“The fact of the matter is the Japanese see that China is not their only problem — they also have North Korea and Russia on their flanks,” said retired Rear Adm. Michael Studeman, former commander of the Office of Naval Intelligence. “It’s very clear that they have a multination problem, with the biggest bully being China. That’s the reason they’re trying to strengthen the alliance.”The tighter the integration between the allies, the faster and more efficiently they can react in a crisis, say, in the Taiwan strait, experts said. Japan has also agreed to allow U.S. Marines to repurpose a regiment based in Okinawa so it can more rapidly disperse to fight in austere, remote islands.Japan’s drive to modernize its military command structure comes alongside a commitment to surge long-stagnant defense spending and a new national security strategy that calls for long-range strike capability that could reach targets in mainland China. It’s a remarkable transformation of a country that for decades was constrained by postwar pacifist sentiment.U.S. and Japanese officials will discuss co-production of certain weapons, in particular air defenses such as Patriot missiles that are badly needed in Ukraine. Future co-production projects may also include medium-range air-to-air missiles, officials said.Japan’s strict defense export guidelines prohibit transfer of lethal arms to countries at war. But recent revisions enable it to sell arms built under U.S. license to the United States, according to Japanese officials. Washington would then be able to pass along similar weapons to an ally, U.S. officials said.With air defenses in Ukraine in short supply, Japan has agreed to sell the United States 10 Patriot interceptors to restock its inventory, U.S. officials said. Washington had hoped for dozens more interceptors, but that effort fell through due to incompatibility with U.S. stocks, the officials said.A trilateral meeting of the defense ministers of the United States, Japan and South Korea will also take place in Tokyo this weekend. It will mark the first trip a South Korean defense minister has made to Japan in 15 years, a sign of the rapprochement between Seoul and Tokyo, which have managed over the last year to set aside decades of animosity rooted in Japan’s harsh 35-year occupation of the Korean Peninsula. The leaders of the two Asian states and Biden met at a historic summit at Camp David last August, and they signed a formal “commitment to consult,” meaning that they would treat a security threat to one as a threat to all.At the end of the trilateral, the defense ministers will sign a new framework of cooperation that sets up a regular calendar of ministerial meetings that will rotate among the three capitals, an annual trilateral exercise known as Freedom Edge (the first one was held this summer), and real-time missile threat warnings among the three partners.Blinken also will join his counterparts from South Korea, India and Australia in Tokyo this weekend for a meeting of the “Quad” foreign ministers to discuss shared security, economic and other concerns.All this activity — upgrading the military alliance, building diplomatic bonds — has “clearly caught China’s attention,” U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel said. And that’s “exactly the party you want to see it.”During their meetings this weekend, U.S. and Japanese officials are expected to discuss for the first time at the ministerial level Washington’s commitment to defend Japan in case of an attack, including the potential use of nuclear weapons, Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun reported.“As the security environment around our country becomes more severe, it is extremely meaningful to discuss bilateral cooperation among ministers to strengthen U.S. extended deterrence,” Kamikawa said in a news conference this week.Officials in Washington and Tokyo said that they expect advances in the alliance to endure no matter the outcome of November’s U.S. presidential election.“It is our view that most of what we have done in the Indo-Pacific is and will continue to be bipartisan in its support,” a senior administration official said.“We won’t change our course,” a senior Japanese official said. “If you objectively, cool-headedly assess the benefits that this cooperation brings the two countries, you have to conclude that this cooperation will definitely continue.”Lee reported from Seoul. Julia Mio Inuma in Tokyo contributed to this report."
WaPo_34,25-ton sculpture honoring World War I soldiers comes to Washington,https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2024/07/27/world-war-i-memorial-washington/,2024-07-27 18:00:02.725430,,"Soldiers, nurses and children appear on a battlefield landscape littered with debris. Their faces show anguish, determination and pride. Everything seems to be in motion as the figures advance through scenes from World War I.But the story is frozen in bronze.The dramatic 58-foot-long sculpture “A Soldier’s Journey” is the centerpiece and final element of Washington’s National World War I Memorial, located in the former Pershing Park just four blocks from the White House.The 25-ton sculpture is expected to arrive in Washington on Saturday, and once installed over the next few weeks, will be the largest free-standing high-relief bronze in the Western Hemisphere, according to the World War I Centennial Commission.“It’s magnificent,” Daniel S. Dayton, executive director of the commission, said Wednesday. “It’s just stunning.”The official unveiling, or “first illumination,” is scheduled for the evening of Sept. 13.The sculpture joins the 90-year-old D.C. War Memorial as a modern tribute to those who served and fell in World War I. It consists of 38 larger-than-life figures that illustrate the American soldier’s journey through the crucible of the Great War, as it was known.It begins with a departure scene, in which a soldier’s daughter hands him his helmet. It proceeds from left to right through depictions of the horror of battle, the shock of its aftermath, the homecoming parade and then, as the soldier gives his helmet back to his daughter, the hint of another war.Soldiers appear to shout, scream and stumble. One, apparently shell shocked, stares out at the viewer, stunned. Nurses help the wounded and dying. The elements suggest the tremendous noise of warfare.The sculpture has been more than a decade in the making and arrives almost six years after the centennial of the end of the war. But it has been a large, complex undertaking that weathered many debates about its location, nature and size.“It’s been an amazing journey, but sometimes a roller coaster,” said Joe Weishaar, the Atlanta architect who created the piece along with New Jersey sculptor Sabin Howard. “To be at the end is really great.”There were many changes along the way.The original idea was for a mammoth sculpture that was 324 feet long, he said in an earlier interview. That was cut down to 116 feet, and then to 58 feet. One version featured a horse, which was scrapped.“I think where we’ve ended up is so much better because we were forced to edit so many times,” he said.The sculpting, initially in clay, took place in Howard’s studio in Englewood, N.J. Using period clothing, high-tech measuring equipment, and members of his family and staff as models, he spent four years creating the figures.Once finished, they were shipped to the Pangolin Editions sculpture foundry in Stroud, England, about 100 miles west of London, to be cast. They were transported to Baltimore earlier this month and, tied down and wrapped in black plastic, will make their way to Washington by truck.“It morphed a lot,” Howard said in a telephone interview Monday.He and Weishaar said they studied many images from the war, including paintings like John Singer Sargent’s “Gassed,” a portrait of soldiers blinded by poison gas.“Some of my earlier iterations showed the soldiers … traumatized and wounded by mustard gas,” Howard said. “But I was asked to take it out because it was too much, too much pain.”“When I started looking at images online, historical images, I saw how the soldiers and wives and fiancées and girlfriends were human beings,” he said.“The reference to those photos had a huge impact on me because I saw this was a memorial where you need to remember the humans that partook in this,” he said. “I like to say it’s for humans, by humans, about humans.”Meanwhile, the Smithsonian Institution lent historical uniforms of nurses in which Howard clothed his models.Howard found military equipment and soldier uniforms from dealers in World War I paraphernalia in Pennsylvania and Montana.Howard said he was stunned when he saw the sculpture finally cast in bronze. “This foundry was so good that we even got fingerprints in the metal,” he said. “My fingerprints are in the metal from the actual sculpting.”The World War I Centennial Commission was authorized by Congress to erect the national memorial. The entire project cost about $44 million, according to Edwin L. Fountain, general counsel for the American Battle Monuments Commission. He said two-thirds of the cost came from private donors. The sculpture cost about $8 million.The 1.76-acre Pershing Park site, which dates back to the 1980s, was extensively refurbished with new landscaping, water features and inscriptions in 2020 and 2021.The new memorial is designed to honor the sacrifice of the U.S. forces, which came late to the war in 1917. But the arrival of American “doughboys,” as the soldiers were called, along with the armies of France and Britain defeated Germany and its allies after four years of killing on an industrial scale.Britain lost about 900,000 men and women, France about 1.3 million and Russia about 2 million. Germany also lost about 2 million.Almost 117,000 Americans were killed. Twenty-six thousand alone perished in the 47-day-long Meuse-Argonne offensive in 1918. According to the National Archives, it was the deadliest battle in U.S. history."
WaPo_35,"Crypto fanatics flock to Trump, hoping to ‘make bitcoin great again’",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/27/trump-bitcoin-support-2024-cryptocurrency/,2024-07-27 18:00:02.725430,,"NASHVILLE — There were stacks upon stacks of orange-and-gold coins, a crypto-themed stock car, a plethora of miniature rockets and spacemen meant to embody the hope that prices might someday shoot “to the moon.”It was all standard fare for an annual conference that bills itself as the world’s largest gathering of bitcoin enthusiasts. But the usual trappings accompanied something more political: klaxon-red hats emblazoned with the slogan “Make bitcoin Great Again.”Many of the nation’s leading cryptocurrency companies, executives, investors and fanatics are beginning to unite around former president Donald Trump’s bid for the White House, hoping that their public embrace — and increasingly generous campaign checks — might entice and elect a candidate who will spare the industry from federal regulation.Under President Biden, the U.S. government has aggressively cracked down on crypto, seeking to protect average Americans from scams and ensure the largely anonymous tokens do not enable illicit activities. But the fierce oversight has chafed crypto advocates and angered wealthy political benefactors in Silicon Valley. To ward off new federal probes, environmental protections and financial safeguards, they have gravitated toward Trump — even if they don’t always like him — in the hopes he can win and deliver them relief in Washington.“I think what people are excited about is, if Trump comes in with a new circle, and Cabinet members, and people, that it’s going to change, and change for the better,” said Marshall Beard, the chief operating officer at Gemini, a crypto trading platform and banking service. He described himself as apolitical, but his company’s founders, billionaire investors Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, have donated heavily in support of Trump.Trump has gladly accepted the entreaties: Newly awash in crypto cash, he has celebrated bitcoin and other digital tokens, marking a stunning shift from his time in office, when Trump proclaimed he was “not a fan” of bitcoin and linked such assets to drug sales. The early uptick in fundraising support has troubled some Democrats, who have scrambled to show they are not hostile to the industry.But Trump’s conversion will be on stark display Saturday, when he speaks directly to the thousands of bitcoin owners, traders and investors who have descended this year on Nashville. Many in attendance expect the former president to announce he wants the U.S. government to stockpile its own reserves of the currency, a radical idea that is bound to send the price of bitcoin skyrocketing — just hours after Trump holds a high-dollar fundraiser with the nation’s crypto elite.Even before Trump arrived, there were hints of his growing support across the sprawling Music City Center, the site of this year’s bitcoin Conference. A smattering of “Make bitcoin Great Again” hats — some in Trump’s signature style, others in bitcoin orange — dotted the rows of booths where crypto entrepreneurs hawked new tokens, investing tips and “tax avoidance strategies,” in the words of one firm, which parked near its kiosk a ruby-red motorcycle adorned with the play on Trump’s slogan. (Staff there declined to be interviewed.)Outside, a digital sign truck periodically circled, flashing photos of Trump and his new running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), a longtime crypto advocate who has reported owning as much as $250,000 in bitcoin. The vehicle pitched passersby on “MAGA VP,” a type of “memecoin” — unaffiliated with the campaign — that aims to help the former president’s most fervent supporters earn money. It teased that customers who purchased $50 of the token would “win a special prize.”“At this party, today, it seems like there’s a leaning toward Trump, and I think it’s an appreciation for the first major presidential candidate to come along and say this might be actually a really good idea,” said Mike Belshe, the chief executive of BitGo, which offers a crypto wallet service. He plans to host a fundraiser reception for Vance in Palo Alto, Calif., next week, according to an invite later obtained by The Washington Post.The support for Trump underscored the rapid political awakening underway in the crypto industry. Stung by a series of major scandals — and facing the prospect of tough regulation in Washington — crypto companies, executives and investors have shelled out $121 million this election in a bid to defeat potential foes and elect new friends in Washington, according to the money-in-politics watchdog OpenSecrets.“We’ve seen tens of millions of dollars pouring in, in an attempt to make sure anti-regulation politicians are the ones who take power,” said Lisa Gilbert, co-president of Public Citizen, a left-leaning watchdog group.For many crypto titans, the catalyst for action came two years ago, after the downfall of FTX, previously the world’s third-largest crypto marketplace. Many Democrats, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), immediately demanded stringent new rules, while the Securities and Exchange Commission, led by Chairman Gary Gensler, filed a battery of lawsuits alleging the best-known crypto firms had failed to follow basic federal investor protections.Often, the targets of SEC scrutiny — including Coinbase, a digital asset marketplace, and Ripple, which offers the popular XRP token — blasted the cases as evidence of Gensler’s bias against the industry. They coupled their court battles with an expensive lobbying campaign designed to neuter the SEC and stave off other regulations, including rules meant to prevent terrorist groups from trafficking in crypto. And crypto executives and investors began pouring money into the 2024 election, launching three super PACs that have run ads targeting congressional candidates who oppose digital currencies.This year, David Bailey — the chief executive of BTC Inc., which organized the conference in Nashville — personally approached Trump in the hopes he might reverse his views on crypto. Major Silicon Valley donors, including investors David Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya, hosted lucrative fundraisers for the former president in June. Elon Musk, a crypto booster and owner of X, formerly Twitter, endorsed Trump after the former president’s near-assassination in July; the venture capital duo Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz soon revealed their support, too.With every check and endorsement, Trump appeared to grow more receptive. On his social media site, Truth Social, he described himself in May as “VERY POSITIVE AND OPEN MINDED TO CRYPTOCURRENCY COMPANIES.” Two months later, he touted crypto as an official part of the 2024 GOP platform, which declared the party would “end Democrats’ unlawful and un-American Crypto crackdown.”“If there’s a politician that sees the potential of the industry, and wants it to thrive, generally the voters and donations are going to go in that direction,” said Brian Morgenstern, who oversees policy for the crypto giant Riot Platforms.Riot is a bitcoin miner: It manages the vast, energy-intensive machines running complex calculations to generate individual tokens. The industry has warred with the Biden administration, and Riot successfully sued the Energy Department after it demanded bitcoin miners turn over data about their energy usage.Executives from Riot and other companies directly appealed to Trump in June, who told them that “he understands quite clearly why people are looking for alternatives to legacy financial systems,” Morgenstern recalled in Nashville this week. He previously served under Trump at the Treasury Department, back when the then-president had been critical of crypto.After the meeting, Trump commemorated the gathering on Truth Social: “VOTE FOR TRUMP!” he began. “Biden’s hatred of bitcoin only helps China, Russia, and the Radical Communist Left. We want all the remaining bitcoin to be MADE IN THE USA!!!”Despite his earlier opposition, some crypto devotees seemed to welcome Trump’s attention.At an unattended expo booth on Friday, the image of a bloodied Trump pumping his fist after this month’s assassination attempt had been altered so that it appeared he was holding up a bitcoin. Gawkers stopped to snap photos of the rotating illustration, which was superimposed atop the usual rocket logo for Moonshot, a company that manufactures key components for bitcoin mining.“Hopefully we’re starting to see winds change in the United States, and maybe we’ll get some change with a new president,” mused Ray Kamrath, the chief commercial officer at Bakkt, a crypto trading platform, during a panel discussion later about the future of regulation.Kamrath expressed hope that the next year might finally resolve the issue of whether some cryptocurrencies are securities, and in the process, shield more of the industry from the SEC.“Let’s just enjoy for a moment that crypto, bitcoin, is a bona fide election year issue in the United States,” responded Bobby Zagotta, the U.S. chief executive officer of Bitstamp, a crypto marketplace, to a smattering of applause. In an interview afterward, Zagotta said he sensed the “Trump mania just walking the floor.”A crowd of a few hundred had erupted in celebration a day earlier, when Luke Rudkowski, the founder of the group We Are Change, noted on a panel that Trump had publicly promised to release Ross Ulbricht from prison. A longtime darling of the crypto community, Ulbricht faces a life sentence for convictions related to his creation and operation of Silk Road, a dark web marketplace often used to buy and sell illicit goods.“It’s happening with Donald Trump; he’s speaking up for it,” said Rudkowski, whose group has been faulted by the Southern Poverty Law Center for spreading conspiracy theories.Eager to reap the financial benefits of his new, growing base of support, the Trump campaign plans to hold at least two fundraisers in Nashville. To attend the Saturday reception, take a photo with Trump and join his policy roundtable, donors must write checks for $844,600 to his reelection and other Republican campaign committees, according to an invitation obtained by The Post. Already, Trump’s aides have boasted about raising roughly $4 million in various cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin.Sensing Trump’s fundraising edge, other politicians have looked to court crypto’s cash: On street corners outside the convention hall, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.) stationed trucks with digital signs that pitched her as a “bitcoin champion” — and directed viewers to a donation website (in dollars or cryptocurrency). Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who is running as an independent in the 2024 presidential race, made his own appeal Friday, telling a packed auditorium he would unveil a host of policies that would see the U.S. government purchase and warehouse bitcoin.“I’m very happy to learn I’m not the only one talking about bitcoin in this year’s election,” said Kennedy, who appeared at the same conference last year. He later added: “I hope President Trump’s commitment is about more than political expediency.”But Trump’s inroads in particular have spooked some national Democrats, who do not want to be seen as wholly opposed to crypto. A small group of party officials even huddled privately earlier this month to discuss how to better engage with the politically ascendant industry, having spent years cultivating relationships — and cashing checks — from the broader, liberal-leaning Silicon Valley tech set.“The challenge the Democrats have is name[d] Gary Gensler,” Mark Cuban, a prominent tech investor, said in an email. “He is pushing a new technology out of the USA. That is not a strong position for a party looking to win.”Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who represents a slice of the Bay Area, convened the gathering with senior aides to Biden and top tech investors including Cuban and Anthony Scaramucci, who served briefly under Trump but since has defected to support Biden and now Vice President Harris. Scaramucci later said that some participants specifically called for firing Gensler and blocking the renomination of Caroline Crenshaw for another term as an SEC commissioner, arguing they have stuck an unfairly defiant tone against crypto. Spokespeople for the White House, as well as Gensler and Crenshaw, did not comment for this story.“I’ll put it simply: After years in the desert, and in a regulatory drought in the Biden administration, I think they see an advocate,” Scaramucci said of Trump.The outreach has only intensified after Harris replaced Biden as the party’s presumptive nominee, elevating a longtime California politico with deep roots in the tech sector. Some fervent crypto supporters tried to make a last-minute pitch for Harris to appear alongside Trump in Nashville, but she ultimately did not. Her campaign did not respond to a request for comment.“With the changing of the top of the ticket, it’s an opportunity to reevaluate, reset,” said Brad Garlinghouse, the chief executive of Ripple.Garlinghouse said he had not yet endorsed or donated to either candidate, but he signaled that many in his industry had supported Trump primarily out of necessity.“I don’t think this is about choosing one party over another,” he continued. “I think the Republicans, led by Donald Trump, are playing chess, and I think the Democrats are playing checkers.”"
WaPo_36,These cheap loans are becoming a hit with home buyers. But there are catches.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/27/assumable-mortgages-cheap-rates/,2024-07-27 20:00:02.669076,,"Pressed by soaring mortgage rates and record-high home prices, home buyers are looking for a break.More and more buyers are discovering cheap financing through a once-obscure workaround — assumable mortgages. These loans let borrowers take over, or assume, their sellers’ mortgage. But there’s a caveat: This option is available only for loans backed by government agencies such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Veterans Affairs Department (VA).The number of sales closed with this financing, although still small overall, has skyrocketed. In 2023, 3,825 FHA loans were assumed, compared with 2,221 in 2022. In just the first five months of 2024, an additional 3,477 FHA assumable loans were recorded, putting borrowers on track to more than double last year’s total.VA loan assumptions recorded an even steeper spike, from 308 in 2022 to 2,244 in 2023. This category looks set to more than double that total this year, with 1,457 assumptions recorded in the first three months of 2024.Assumable mortgages are government-backed loans that the seller can transfer to the new owner when a property is sold.That means the new owner is on the hook for the remaining mortgage payments, the loan balance, the payment schedule, the interest rate and the escrow account under the same conditions, said Kelly Zitlow, executive vice president of sales and marketing and a senior mortgage adviser at Cornerstone Home Lending.Chris Birk, vice president of mortgage insight at Veterans United Home Loans in Columbia, Mo., said he hears that more “home sellers and buyers are talking about assumable loans” and that roughly 4 in 5 active VA mortgages have an interest rate below 5 percent.That’s still a tiny share of overall home sales. In 2023, more than 4 million existing homes were sold nationwide, according to the National Association of Realtors. But the uptick in assumable mortgages shows increasing interest among home buyers looking for deals.Assuming a mortgage requires steps similar to the ones for a traditional mortgage. The buyer needs to meet the credit, debt and income requirements set by VA or the FHA and by the lender or servicer that holds the loan.But there’s one key difference: The loan can be financed only through the seller’s existing lender, with approval from the lender, Zitlow said.In other words, you can’t shop around when you’re assuming someone else’s mortgage.In addition, the buyer needs to make up the difference between the sales price and the loan balance. Since buyers can’t increase the balance on an assumable loan, they typically will need to pay the rest of the purchase price in cash. However, some buyers may be able to secure a second loan, Birk noted.For example, if you purchase a home for $500,000 and the remaining balance on the seller’s assumable loan is $400,000, you’ll need to pay $100,000 in cash unless you can qualify for a second loan.The first question to ask is whether the seller has an FHA or VA loan. These actually make up a significant share of the market: About 13 percent of all mortgages are FHA loans, while about 11 percent are VA loans. These loans are insured by the federal government, which means that if the borrower defaults, the lender will be reimbursed. Lenders that issue these loans may be a little more lenient in their requirements as a result of this backing.The second question is whether the buyer can meet the specific requirements to take over the loan.In the case of FHA loans, the property must be the seller’s primary residence and the buyer must meet the qualifications set by the FHA and the lender, Zitlow noted.For VA loans, a regional VA loan office has to approve the transaction, but the borrower doesn’t have to be a veteran, she added.In addition, the seller has to sign off on the buyer assuming the loan and provide authorization to the lender. Once the loan is approved and the sale goes through closing, the loan servicer replaces the original borrower with the new owner on the loan documents, Zitlow said.The main advantage of an assumable mortgage is that it can lock in a cheaper interest rate — meaning lower monthly payments and less interest over the life of the loan. In addition, the settlement may go more quickly than a traditional loan closing (sometimes with no appraisal required), and closing costs are often lower, Zitlow said. The one big hurdle in many cases, as noted above, is that the person assuming the loan generally needs a lot of cash on hand to pay for the property — often more than a typical down payment.“However, some lenders … can help a potential buyer cover this gap by offering a second loan,” she said.Depending on the credit qualifications of the buyer, a lender might allow the combined balance of the assumable loan and the second loan to go up to 80 percent or 85 percent of the home value, which would need a down payment of 15 percent or 20 percent, she added.For sellers who are military veterans, a potential drawback with assumable loans is that they could lose their VA loan benefit, Birk said.Typically, when a home is sold, the VA loan is paid in full, and the veteran can still get the VA discount on interest rates. But when a loan is assumed, it continues to be serviced by someone else who is making the payments — so whatever portion of the veteran’s benefit that was used to buy that house stays tied up in the property until the loan is paid off, he noted.“In some cases, veterans would have diminished VA loan entitlement for their next purchase, which would likely mean they would have to make a down payment,” he added. “In other cases, veterans wouldn’t have enough of their benefit remaining to get another VA loan at all.”To avoid this, a veteran could choose to sell only to other veterans, which would essentially substitute the buyer’s VA loan benefit for the seller’s, Birk said. That way, the seller could regain full access to the VA loan benefit."
WaPo_37,"In Miami, Venezuelan diaspora anxiously watches an election it can’t participate in",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/27/venezuela-diaspora-miami-vote-opposition/,2024-07-27 20:00:02.669076,,"MIAMI — Vilma Petrash taught politics in Venezuela, fled to Miami after state prosecutors accused her of being a “civil rebel,” and is a regular at gatherings to support opposition leaders back home.But she won’t be casting a ballot when Venezuela opens its polls on Sunday in an election widely considered the biggest electoral challenge to Nicolás Maduro, the country’s president, since he rose to power in 2013.The vast majority of Venezuelans in this city — where arepa joints fill strip malls — will not be able to participate in the election. Venezuela’s consulates in the United States are shuttered. The only way to vote would be to return to Venezuela, something that Petrash and many others say they’re not able to do.They aren’t alone. There are nearly 8 million Venezuelans now dispersed around the world, and election experts estimate just 69,000 will be able to vote. For Petrash and others, not being able to participate in what could be one of the nation’s most consequential elections in recent history is infuriating.“Venezuela for us is like an open wound,” she said. “The pain is always there. And we desperately want to heal ourselves.”Voting from the United States hasn’t been easy for years. Miami’s consulate closed in 2012 after the State Department ousted the consul general following reports she participated in talks about a possible cyberattack against the United States. But Venezuelans living in South Florida still found ways to express their frustration at the polls, traveling by bus to New Orleans in 2016 to cast ballots for Maduro’s opponent.Since then, voting from abroad has only gotten harder. Maduro ordered all U.S. consulates closed in 2019 after then-president Donald Trump recognized Juan Guaidó as the nation’s rightful leader. Meanwhile, the number of Venezuelans living in the United States has exploded. Over 800,000 Venezuelans now reside somewhere in the United States, according to U.S. census figures, with the largest number concentrated in South Florida. That’s an increase of nearly 50 percent compared to 2019.“Everybody here would have been involved in voting,” said Eduardo Gamarra, a political science professor at Florida International University. “They’re fully engaged, but they, in the end, don’t count because the regime has made it impossible for them to vote.”Even in countries like Colombia where Venezuela still has a consulate, registering to vote has proven to be nothing short of a mind-bending odyssey. Diplomatic staff in many cities were unprepared for the long lines of expats. And then there was the paperwork. Venezuelans had to show proof of residency in the country where they now reside — a difficult task for many new immigrants — and present a valid passport, something many no longer have.Guillermo Zubillaga, senior director of public policy programs at the Americas Society/Council of the Americas, said the desire to vote hasn’t been this high in years, adding to many Venezuelans’ frustration.“We left because of this government and yet we find ourselves unable to express our frustration, to channel it,” said Zubillaga, who is Venezuelan.Still, Venezuelans in Miami haven’t been sitting idly by. Many are sending money back to relatives and friends to help ensure they find transportation to their voting center. They are also serving as de facto WhatsApp chat group monitors, flagging fake news and sharing independent news reports with those back home.The opposition campaign has also cemented a presence in South Florida. Leaders organized a primary vote at a local college last fall. And on Sunday, many Venezuelans will gather at a “comandito” in Miami. The opposition’s “tiny command” groups have proliferated throughout Venezuela to help disseminate information and mobilize voters. There are also numerous “comanditos” abroad.On Sunday, Petrash will be at the Miami “comandito” to monitor the election from afar and flag any signs of fraud.“We are thinking people are going to participate actively and massively and that it will be more difficult for the government to actually commit fraud,” the political science professor said. “But at the same time, we are realistic.”It’s that sort of tempered optimism that Venezuelans have been wrestling with. Polling shows Edmundo González — the opposition candidate — is projected to win. He is being propelled by María Corina Machado, who was prohibited from running but is the force behind his candidacy. Part of the pair’s campaign promise is to reunite Venezuelan families torn apart by the nation’s massive exodus.Among those who will be vigilantly watching the results is opposition leader Guaidó, who himself once drew thousands of supporters to the streets. He arrived in the United States last year after covertly crossing into Colombia. Now living in South Florida, Guaidó said he considered returning to cast his ballot but ultimately decided against it, fearing not just his possible arrest but also that he’d create an unnecessary distraction.“It’s bittersweet,” he said of watching the opposition from afar. “Exile is a daily paradox.”On the one hand, Guaidó said he feels free. At the same time, he is nostalgic, not for the past, but for a present he is not able to live. He would like to be in the thick of mobilizing voters and credentialing independent observers. But instead he will be in Washington, ready to help mobilize the international community.Nonetheless, the swell of support for the opposition has inspired hope. When he thinks about what might happen if they win, Guaidó briefly switches from Spanish to English: “Happy thought,” he says with a laugh. He dreams of taking his daughters back to Venezuela to visit his hometown, seaside La Guaira.“My greatest aspiration is to be a Venezuelans citizen — in Venezuela,” he said.Those are the sorts of dreams that have been percolating around Miami. As they waited for lunch at El Arepazo, friends Amarilis Zozaya and Regina Semprun began imagining what they would do if Venezeula’s opposition wins. There were places they hadn’t seen in years. But also, jokingly perhaps, grander ideas.“I want to be minister of tourism!” Zozaya, 68, exclaimed.The pair have been anxiously watching every development from Venezuela. Zozaya gets a daily update from Machado’s team, advising readers of all her activities. Both women, who run a public relations firm together, have also been sending money back to friends and relatives so they can afford to take a bus or drive to the polls.“My husband tells me I spend all my time glued to Venezuela,” Zozaya said. “It’s my way of supporting. If I’m not there and I can’t vote, what else can I do?”For all the talk of return, the reality is probably more complex. The earliest waves of Venezuelan migrants have now been in the United States more than two decades. Their children speak fluent English and identify as American. Like older waves of Cuban immigrants, the idea of return is now too foreign for some to contemplate.“From the ’60s until the early ’80s, the Cubans basically had an open suitcase,” said Gamarra, the political science professor. “In other words, they were simply waiting for Fidel to fall. Many just closed their doors and thought, ‘I’ll be back in three weeks.’”But by the mid-1980s, Cubans had closed that suitcase, he said, deciding to join the U.S. political system to influence change on the island.“We’re seeing a similar trend among Venezuelans,” he said. “They’re now closing the suitcase. And a lot of them are doing so because their kids have grown up here.”But, he added, in Venezuela, elections have “always sort of kept that suitcase open.”More recent waves of Venezuelan immigrants might be more compelled to return if the opposition wins — and if there is a true transfer of power. Many have higher education degrees and have been forced to take jobs they are vastly overqualified for. But they, too, might think twice about returning.Yoselin Barrios, 28, arrived in the United States three years ago. Like many, she applied for political asylum. Returning to Venezuela would jeopardize that claim. The former architecture student works “Monday to Monday” at an arepa restaurant and delivering Amazon purchases and says she sees her future here.Though she is hopeful the opposition candidate may win on Sunday, Barrios is simultaneously terrified. She fled Venezuela after being harassed by state police for helping provide protesters food and water during a previous wave of tumult. At one point, she said, they followed her to her house, encircled her and physically assaulted her. Her father begged her to leave.She worries that if the opposition doesn’t win, people will take to the streets, and once again, there will be bloodshed in Venezuela. She urged her mother to leave before the election, but she refused. Her mother is determined to vote.Instead, Barrios sent her mother money so that she could stock up on necessities and not have to leave the house if the country turns chaotic.On Sunday, she’ll be working behind the counter as the results come in. The restaurant in the heart of Doral — affectionately known in Miami as Doralzuela — will air the news on a giant television outside. She said it gives her some comfort to know she’ll be surrounded by people just as hopeful and anguished as she is.“It’s the only thing we can do — be together,” she said. “And for those who believe in God — pray.”"
WaPo_38,‘Pure adrenaline’: Campaign reporters energized by remade 2024 race,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/07/27/campaign-reporters-2024-energy/,2024-07-27 20:00:02.669076,,"For most of the spring, this presidential campaign lacked the high-wattage, earth-shattering storylines that energize the reporters who chronicle them. The presumptive nominees were the same as in 2020. The American people seemed deeply uninterested in news about the race.Then came Donald Trump’s felony convictions. A month later, President Biden’s shockingly halting debate performance. Then Trump’s survival of an assassination attempt. Finally, last weekend, Biden’s exit from the campaign and his endorsement of Vice President Harris as his replacement.Thus, a campaign cycle that has long seemed a bit sleepy is now anything but. And reporters are “chomping at the bit,” as one put it, to cover the expected Trump vs. Harris contest.“A month ago, there was a sense that this campaign was very static,” NBC News chief White House correspondent Peter Alexander said. “I don’t think anybody could feel that way anymore.”“It’s a whole different universe,” said ABC News chief White House correspondent Mary Bruce. “It’s a whole new ballgame, and now we’re off to the races.”In some ways, the campaign was historic from the start. Only four other former presidents have run for nonconsecutive terms. And none of these matchups included someone who spent a long swath of the campaign cycle facing criminal prosecution on charges of falsifying business records.“I can’t even begin to count the number of times I’ve said ‘unprecedented’ or ‘something we’ve never seen before’ in this election cycle,” ABC News correspondent Rachel Scott said in early June, when things were relatively quiet.But things have been turbocharged since then. “It has been bonkers,” Scott said this week. “I am running on pure adrenaline and caffeine at this point. It has been a nonstop flood of news for the last 25 days.”Before a New York jury convicted Trump of all charges on May 31, many of the nation’s top campaign reporters had spent about a month and a half holed up in Lower Manhattan, chronicling the candidate’s courtroom drowsiness and wild after-court statements to the press, rather than on the road with him at county fairs and diner drop-ins.At the time, the courtroom was the campaign, CBS News correspondent Robert Costa said. “It’s highly unusual as a longtime political reporter to conceptualize your job as almost a legal reporter,” he said in early May.But things really ramped up after the first debate of the presidential cycle, on June 27.“Suddenly it’s a really, really interesting election and has ton of things hinging on an outcome,” said Columbia University journalism professor Bill Grueskin. “It has all the elements that any reporter would love to cover.”Grueskin said he was initially compelled by the media coverage of the Republican candidates challenging Trump, but that faded quickly, when Nikki Haley ended her bid in March.1/5Some of the old tent poles of campaign coverage have regained salience in recent weeks. While reporters who spoke with The Post in the spring doubted the significance of this year’s party conventions, that changed when Trump was shot just two days before the Republican National Convention began. Instead of covering a party snoozefest, reporters were on hand to chronicle Trump’s triumphant reemergence.There also are signs that a Harris-led ticket will be more accessible and hold more of the barnstorming events that have been staples of past campaign coverage, as opposed to the fairly controlled and restrained Biden White House and political operation.“I certainly am expecting to be out on the road much more than I was expecting a week ago,” said ABC News’s Bruce, who is covering the Harris campaign. With less than four months before the election, “I think the clip and pace of this is going to feel like being shot out of a cannon.”Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy recalled an interview he conducted with Harris in Iowa in the fall of 2019, when she was just one of several candidates chasing the 2020 Democratic nomination. Now that she’s the likely presidential nominee, “she’s invited back anytime!” he said.If the public’s interest in the race was low at the outset, correspondents said, it was because Americans had already made up their minds about Trump and Biden. Now that dynamic has changed. “I do think Americans are engaged in a different kind of way,” Bruce said, citing the energy level at a Harris rally she attended in Milwaukee.“To those of us who are political junkies and love covering campaigns, this is really fun.”"
WaPo_39,Israel orders more evacuations; deadly strike hits school housing displaced,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/27/israel-gaza-hamas-evacuation-mawasi/,2024-07-27 19:50:02.669076,,"The Israeli military ordered Palestinians to evacuate from southern areas of Khan Younis on Saturday, as local authorities said that dozens of people had been killed in strikes on a school to the north.“Due to significant terrorist activity and rocket fire toward the State of Israel from the southern area of Khan Younis, remaining in this area has become dangerous,” the Israel Defense Forces said on X, warning it was “about to forcefully operate” there and was adjusting the area it considered a humanitarian zone.It is the second time in less than a week that Israel has ordered the evacuation of a former safe area. On Monday, the IDF ordered the evacuation of an eastern sector of the city of Khan Younis, including an area in the Mawasi neighborhood that was previously within the boundaries of a designated safe zone for displaced people. Israel said it was targeting Hamas militants who had been firing rockets from the area.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been sheltering in the safe zone area, having been displaced multiple times since the war began. “It keeps happening over and over and over,” Louise Wateridge, a spokeswoman for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency in Gaza, said earlier this week. “They are forced from place to place, promised safety where there is none.”Central Gaza was hit by heavy fighting Saturday, as Israeli forces struck a school-turned-shelter in the Deir al-Balah area, which Gaza’s civil defense workers said had been housing 4,000 displaced people. The Gaza Health Ministry said 30 people were killed and more than 100 injured in the Israeli airstrike.In a statement, the IDF said that it hit “terrorists operating a Hamas command and control center embedded inside the Khadija School in central Gaza” and that precautions were taken to “mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of appropriate munitions, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence.”Yazan Ahmed, 33, whose tent is near the school, told The Washington Post that the school was targeted with four successive missiles at around noon local time. He said he went to help rescue people from the school, and “the scene cannot be described. The limbs were torn everywhere. They were all women and children whose bodies were torn apart.”The Israel Defense Forces said one of its navy ships intercepted a drone flying close to the offshore Karish gas field. The Saturday statement noted that a drone flew in from Lebanese territory, but added that it was not immediately clear if the drone was for reconnaissance purposes or equipped with explosives. Hezbollah, which has not commented on the claims, has previously threatened to hit Israeli oil platforms in the event of an all-out war.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Friday with former president Donald Trump, the latest stop on a whirlwind trip for the Israeli leader, who addressed a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday and met with President Biden and Vice President Harris on Thursday. Trump has been openly critical of Netanyahu’s management of the war in Gaza, but both men downplayed past antagonisms Friday, with Trump saying “we’ve always had a very good relationship.”At least 39,258 people have been killed and 90,589 injured in Gaza since the war started, the Gaza Health Ministry said Saturday. It does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack, including more than 300 soldiers, and it says 328 soldiers have been killed since the start of its military operations in Gaza.Alon Rom contributed to this report."
WaPo_40,"As wildfires rage, forecasters test new way to warn people near flames",https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/27/fire-warnings-test-west/,2024-07-27 19:01:02.669076,,"Days before a historic spate of wildfires in the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma in February, local meteorologists had been training on a new way to warn people about fast-spreading fires — with a system that can quickly detect emerging threats and tell people where the flames are headed. During that outbreak, 41 wildfires tore through 1.4 million acres in less than two days, including the Smokehouse Creek Fire, which grew into the largest in Texas history.As relentless winds spread flames through tinder-dry grass and brush, the National Weather Service issued 20 “Fire Warnings,” alerts meant to let people know about fires’ locations and where they were moving. More than 400 structures were destroyed and two people were killed in those fires, though the warnings may have helped prevent further impact.This week, massive wildfires are burning across the West, forcing quick evacuations as danger grows and as the most intense stretch of fire season still lies ahead. With a changing climate driving more aggressive fires, weather officials have been working to find new ways to warn people when those intensifying flames are nearing.The new system used in the February fires is only available in parts of Texas and Oklahoma, though it’s one the National Weather Service hopes to expand across the country. It gives forecasters a central role in alerting people that fires have ignited and may be nearby, whereas existing alerts mostly warn people about the weather that can spread a fire. The warnings are being evaluated by the Weather Service, however, and it could be some time before they are available in regions like the fire-prone West.Still, the hope is that they will deliver lifesaving information about rapidly evolving blazes in real time — something that has been absent during recent, repeated wildfire disasters in the United States.“From my own experience as a Weather Service forecaster, I would want to have an option of being able to alert people,” said Zach Tolby, director and lead scientist at NOAA’s Fire Weather Testbed. “In the past, we just didn’t have the right product.”The warnings are meant to provide quick notification of a dangerous wildfire that might require people to soon evacuate and are reserved for the most threatening, high-end fire weather days.“It fills an important gap between when a newly emerging wildfire starts and the time it takes to get an evacuation [order] out,” Tolby said.Advances in satellite technology, which can detect wildfires before 911 calls come in, are giving forecasters a birds-eye view of unfolding blazes and their intensity.On dangerous fire weather days, meteorologists monitor satellite data and notify fire analysts on the ground if a potentially serious wildfire is detected. If the fire agency considers a fire a threat, it will give a green light for a warning. Information about the fire’s location and movement is then broadcast to the public and emergency officials, along with any evacuation instructions that may follow from local authorities.Meteorologists still can’t issue fire warnings unilaterally — the go-ahead must come from agencies on the ground. And only certain local officials — like a sheriff’s office — have the authority to issue evacuation orders. So, the new warnings require close coordination between meteorologists, emergency officials, and state and local fire agencies in what’s called an “Integrated Warning Team.”In June, NOAA’s new Fire Weather Testbed looked closely at the agency’s fire detection and warning capabilities and tested how the new system performed during simulated fire scenarios, like Colorado’s destructive Marshall Fire in December 2021. It brought together meteorologists and fire officials from several states to coordinate plans, as well as social scientists to advise on how the warnings should be communicated. And they evaluated how well NOAA’s satellite-based detection software — called the Next Generation Fire System — tracks a fire’s movement over the landscape.“It’s a very challenging time frame when you have a dangerous fire moving into a neighborhood, threatening lives and property,” Tolby said. “We need to make sure that this process is well established before we start using it.”The new warnings originated in the southern Plains and have been tested and updated there since 2022. But they aren’t yet available outside of Texas and Oklahoma.“Just like everywhere else, the fire threat has been escalating here over the last two decades or so,” said Todd Lindley, the science and operations officer at the National Weather Service in Norman, Okla., who worked to develop the warnings. “In fact, [the Smokehouse Creek Fire] was the third fire episode that we’ve had in the last two decades that has burned over a million acres in shortly over 24 hours.”After the 2018 Camp Fire in California — the deadliest in state history — meteorologists in Oklahoma decided that if a similar fire happened in their region, they wanted to be able to quickly alert the public and emergency responders.Although an older product called a “fire warning” has been available since 2006, it was not used in recent devastating wildfires, including the Camp Fire, the Marshall Fire or last summer’s deadly fire in Maui. Yet such alerts are needed more than ever, as climate change-fueled wildfire disasters are striking year-round and in unusual places, with residents fleeing the flames with little notice.Improved warnings are important but could also create a false sense of security among emergency responders, said Sarah McCaffrey, a retired research social scientist with the U.S. Forest Service.“Most of the fires that are deadly — they’re deadly because from the moment of ignition to when they affect a lot of people is a very short time period,” she said. “There can be an underlying assumption that time will be on the side of the people making the warnings.”There is also no guarantee people will receive a warning, even if one is issued quickly.“Odds are pretty good that people won’t get a warning for a lot of different reasons,” she said. “Particularly with fires, they often burn through cellphone towers or burn down the telephone lines or the electricity goes out.”Still, McCaffrey said providing information on where a fire is moving is critical, and the improved coordination between meteorologists, fire agencies and local officials is also valuable.McCaffrey said she is not surprised the updated warnings are coming out of the Plains states, where grass fires move quickly but population density is relatively low.“That’s somewhere you could have the lead time to make all of this make sense and be worthwhile,” she said.There are real questions about whether the warnings will translate to other regions of the country, like California, Hawaii and the Eastern U.S., where terrain, vegetation and population patterns are much different. That will require more research and scientific vetting, Lindley and Tolby said, as well as training for meteorologists and officials.“That takes time because it’s been a long time since the National Weather Service issued a really new warning product like this,” Tolby said."
WaPo_41,Their acne medications set off a rare chain reaction that killed them,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/07/27/fatal-drug-reaction-acne-dress/,2024-07-27 19:00:02.669076,,"Izzy McKinney was a healthy teenager who wrote poetry, played the mandolin and took pride in her flair with an eyeliner pencil. She also had acne.She tried topical medications and then antibiotics. Two weeks after starting a doctor-prescribed antibiotic — trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole — Izzy came down with a mild fever.Less than three months later, one month after her 16th birthday, Izzy’s heart failed, and she died.An autopsy revealed the cause was DRESS — drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. It’s a rare but deadly condition triggered by medications often used to treat acne, seizures and gout.Subtle at first and then terrifyingly intense, the syndrome isn’t well known. That makes it particularly dangerous.“If you know what it is, you can diagnose and treat it,” says Izzy’s mother, Tasha Tolliver. “But it’s so uncommon that many physicians are confused.”Ever since Izzy’s death nine years ago, Tolliver has been on a mission to warn other parents and doctors about DRESS, which affects as many as 1 in 1,000 people exposed to several commonly prescribed antibiotics and anti-seizure medications, including vancomycin, minocycline, lamotrigine, phenytoin and carbamazepine, as well as allopurinol, used to treat gout. DRESS is fatal in up to 1 in 10 cases.Tolliver is haunted by two things: Her daughter’s death began with treatment for acne, something relatively benign. She also believes that clinicians’ misunderstanding of DRESS resulted in an avoidable delay in her daughter’s treatment.“Losing my child continues to be a living hell that never gets easier,” she says.Experts agree that DRESS can fly under the radar — until it’s too late.“There have definitely been cases where the diagnosis was missed,” says Steven Chen, who as director of inpatient dermatology consultation at Massachusetts General Hospital says his team sees patients referred to them with DRESS once every couple of weeks. He recalls one patient who said she had been hospitalized elsewhere for a “virus” after taking medication for acne. “She was one of the lucky ones,” Chen says. “She stopped the medication, and it went away on its own.”1/3
“Most doctors should have learned about DRESS in medical school, but it can easily be overlooked if you’re not thinking about it frequently, especially since it’s relatively rare,” Chen adds. “It can get lost in the mix with all the other facts and information you are supposed to master.”
DRESS is one of several severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), the most well-known of which is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). But SJS primarily affects the skin, while DRESS involves internal organs, making it harder to quickly identify.
At Vanderbilt Medical Center, Elizabeth Phillips, the director of the Center for Drug Safety and Immunology, estimates that more than 7,000 people in the United States are suffering from DRESS at any time, and that up to 10 percent of those who experience the syndrome die within six months.
While most DRESS cases are mild, some survivors later develop autoimmune conditions including thyroid disease, lupus or diabetes. There is limited research about these risks, however.“We desperately need long-term follow-up studies in the United States,” Phillips says. “Unfortunately, clinical trials are hard to do with DRESS because patients are so spread out. Patients need to be adequately followed to look for these complications,” she adds. “When a patient is diagnosed with an autoimmune disease after DRESS, the provider may not make the association between the DRESS and the autoimmune disease.”Older people with preexisting medical problems are the most vulnerable, Phillips says, while women also seem to be slightly more prone to the syndrome than men, for reasons that are unclear. “One explanation may be because the severity of DRESS can depend on the dose,” she says, “and drugs are often prescribed in a one-size-fits-all mode that leads to over-dosing in some women.”Minority group members appear to be more vulnerable to bad outcomes from DRESS, Phillips says, again for unclear reasons, although lack of access to high-quality medical care and specialists’ support might play a part.
“We do know that at least 20 percent of patients who have experienced DRESS do not have the culprit drug documented as an allergy on their record, and that minority groups may be at higher risk not to have DRESS documented as an allergy,” Phillips says. “This is a drug safety concern — particularly in that patients move from system to system in the U.S.”
Phillips is looking into hereditary factors that might make some people, including members of minority groups, more vulnerable to allergic reactions to medications. She hopes doctors may soon be able to offer genetic tests to screen patients for potential reactions to medications before they take the first pill.
In 2019, Tolliver co-founded the DRESS Syndrome Foundation, which she runs out of her home, with Nancy Szakacsy, whose daughter also died of DRESS-related heart failure.
Hannah Szakacsy, 17, had helped create an anti-bullying program and aspired to be a nurse practitioner. Like Izzy McKinney, Hannah also took an antibiotic to treat acne — in her case, minocycline.
Nancy Szakacsy, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Woodland Hills, Calif., describes Hannah’s subsequent 102-day ordeal in critical care, which included two open-heart surgeries, fasciotomies — cutting into the fascia, or connective tissue — in her legs, and the loss of her colon and part of her pancreas before her death, in a 2014 book called: “Hannah Was Here: DRESS, an Alarm That Must Be Heard.” Hannah wasn’t diagnosed with DRESS until after she died. Initially, doctors suspected she had mononucleosis before treating her for a drug reaction, according to her mother.
Tolliver and Szakacsy have assembled an archive of 640 patients, registered a National DRESS Syndrome Day (July 16, Hannah’s birthday), established a network of medical experts, created a video of interviews with survivors, helped fund and organize the first global DRESS Conference, and lobbied for more instruction about DRESS in medical schools. They regularly counsel people through their website, fielding one to three emails or calls a day, according to Tolliver.
“They’re like an international lifeline to so many patients, and they’re so spot on in what they do,” says Phillips, the foundation’s pro bono scientific adviser.
DRESS was reportedly first described in the 1950s, when it was caused by anti-tuberculosis medications and referred to as anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome. Its name changed a few more times over the years until DRESS was coined in 1996. Today, it’s also known as drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome.
DRESS is a delayed reaction, experts warn, with symptoms appearing as much as two weeks after the first dose of medication.
Over his 12-year medical career, dermatologist Kyle Cheng, an attending physician at UCLA Health, says he has seen two patients die of the syndrome because they arrived in his care with their livers, lungs and hearts already failing.“Patients shouldn’t be scared of taking these common medications, but if they develop rash or fever, they should stop the medication promptly,” he says.They should also immediately seek care from their primary care physician, Phillips says. They may have a mild case, which can be treated with topical or oral steroids, or need more aggressive treatment.“Communication between doctors is definitely important, so ideally one doctor, the primary care physician, is coordinating things,” she says.Tolliver says she believes gaps in knowledge about the symptoms of DRESS led to differing opinions about her daughter’s treatment at VCU Health in Richmond, delaying critical treatment.
During her daughter’s first of two emergency room consultations, a dermatologist raised the possibility of DRESS, noting it in her records, Tolliver says. But a doctor later handling the case ruled out DRESS because Izzy didn’t appear to have eosinophilia — abnormally high levels of a type of white blood cell that is a common marker of DRESS, according to Tolliver. She said eosinophilia was detected only after Izzy’s death. Doctors treated Izzy for a Type-3 drug reaction, which is less severe than DRESS, Tolliver said.
A VCU Health spokesman declined to comment on the case, citing a confidentiality agreement related to a legal settlement. In court documents related to the settlement, the medical group associated with VCU Health denied “any and all negligence” in Izzy McKinney’s death.
Late last year, the parents of a teenage girl who died of heart failure connected with DRESS after taking the anti-seizure drug lamotrigine sued Seattle Children’s Hospital for negligence and malpractice. Their lawsuit says hospital staff delayed treatment and downplayed the risks faced by their daughter, who was of South Asian descent, because of racism.
In legal filings, the defendants countered that the girl’s condition was “appropriately managed.”
“She was cared for and closely followed by multiple physicians,” their lawyers wrote. In an email, the family’s attorney, Martin McLean, said the case is set for trial in February 2025.
Treating DRESS may require steroid treatments for as long as a year, Tolliver says. In addition, experts warn that the heart should be closely monitored in all DRESS patients.
Heart issues “may go under the radar or only manifest upon cutting back steroids,” Phillips wrote in an email. “The only way to monitor this is to make sure to do careful follow-up of patients and be proactive about doing the electrocardiogram, echo [ultrasound of the heart] and measuring cardiac enzymes.”
In 2020, warnings about DRESS first appeared on labels for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, according to an FDA spokesperson. Izzy McKinney had been prescribed the drug five years earlier. As of 2024, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) no longer recommends the drug for acne.
The AAD’s 2024 guidelines “make an effort to more strongly recommend against its use given the risks of acute respiratory failure and severe drug reactions,” says John S. Barbieri, a dermatologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital who co-chaired the AAD’s acne guidelines working group.The drug “may be associated with severe adverse reactions,” the AAD says, recommending further study.AAD guidelines still recommend minocycline, the drug Hannah Szakacsy took, with advice that physicians should balance the benefits and risks.“Acne is a very stigmatizing disease,” and treating it remains important, Barbieri says.But, he adds, he feels minocycline is used too frequently, both because of a lack of convincing evidence of its effectiveness compared with other treatments and the risks of side effects including DRESS.“These reactions are rare, but when they happen, they can be devastating,” Barbieri says. “That’s why in my practice I almost never use minocycline for acne.”"
WaPo_42,"At Manny’s cafe, group therapy for newly hopeful Democrats",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/27/mannys-cafe-san-francisco-kamala-harris/,2024-07-27 19:00:02.669076,,"SAN FRANCISCO — They filed in tentatively, taking seats on plush couches and folding chairs arranged in a semicircle in the cafe’s gently lit backroom. Here would be safe to share their deepest feelings, they were assured, to unspool their still-fresh emotions.And the Democrats gathered at Manny’s — for what looked and sounded a lot like group therapy — had a lot to unpack.In one of America’s most liberal cities, this is where San Franciscans come when they need a place to process the latest political bombshell. So they did Monday, gathering after President Biden ended his reelection campaign and ceded the spotlight to one of the Bay Area’s own. In confessional tones, person after person reported how their mood had changed overnight: from depression to delight, anxiety to excitement.The preceding weeks had been traumatizing, the previous 24 hours life-affirming.“I think for the first time in months I feel so optimistic,” said Chandru Murthi, a 77-year-old resident who was the first in the circle to share.Manny Yekutiel imagined exactly this type of discussion when he founded his hybrid coffee shop, bar, bookstore and event space in the Mission district in 2018. The 34-year-old political science major is a longtime Democratic fundraiser and strategist, and he decided to open shop after Donald Trump’s election.Since then, Manny’s has become a pillar of the city’s political scene, a physical retreat for like-minded souls to talk at a time when so much discourse is chronically online. The back of the cafe is decorated like a living room, with floor lamps, house plants, even a red vintage rug from Yekutiel’s childhood home in Los Angeles.California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and first lady Jill Biden are among the prominent Democrats who have all stopped in. Vice President Harris, now the party’s likely ticket-topper in the November election, is also a fan. “You’re amazing,” she told Yekutiel during one of her visits.For anyone looking to do a wellness check on the psyche of a deeply blue stronghold at this historic moment, Manny’s is where to go.Responding to Biden’s news, Yekutiel reworked the week’s schedule, starting with Monday’s session. He kicked things off as discussion leader. “Let’s ground this in how we feel right now,” he told the crowd of about three dozen people. “How are we feeling as Democrats, as San Franciscans, as people who have a lot at stake in this election?”“I feel excited, I feel hopeful,” said Angelina Polselli, 24. “It feels like everyone finally woke up from a long, long nap.”As Manny’s resident Gen Z expert, she noted that young people have some concerns with Harris, particularly her record as a prosecutor. But there’s also the “brat” factor, which Polselli had to explain to an audience who appeared largely unfamiliar with the catalogue of Charli XCX.“It feels exciting to have a young candidate who is energized and youthful and who is also talking to young people and using the language we use,” she added.Soon, however, that familiar fear crept back in.“I’m a little bit worried about a San Francisco liberal carrying the battleground states,” said Dan Rink, 81 and himself a liberal from the Bay Area.“I’m not sure she’s a liberal, I view her as more moderate,” David Anderson, 55, a film industry veteran, chimed in.Yekutiel took a poll: “How many of you, if you’re willing to raise your hand, are worried about her ability to win?” About half the circle responded, though several acknowledged they were “more hopeful than 24 hours ago.”Hope has been in short supply all year for this crowd. Enthusiasm, even shorter.“The last few weeks were really difficult because people have just felt this dread, that there’s no point,” Yekutiel said. “And now I have all these ideas, my mind has been racing, people are reaching out to me, asking how they can help. That was not happening 24 hours ago.”Two nights later, Manny’s hosted a watch party for Biden’s Oval Office address, his first since exiting the campaign. Despite the new themed drinks — “Kamalattes,” sweetened with coconut syrup, of course — the affair was solemn.As the president’s speech played on a small TV opposite the barista station, some 20 people fell silent and clustered around the screen. Passersby stopped to watch through the cafe’s open front windows. A woman named Lydia walked in to order a mocha and wound up staying for the whole thing.The elated embrace of Harris expanded to a tearful appreciation of Biden.“I felt in his voice and his speech and his words so much love for this country,” Michelle Jeong said, choking up. “The hope, unity and the lack of ego.”For Mike Madison, who had also attended the Monday gathering, the sentiment was overdue. Lost in the memes and the Harris hullabaloo was the fact that Biden had just made a tremendous sacrifice, he said.“I wanted people to remember what he’s done, his real accomplishments,” Madison said.If night one’s theme was relief and celebration and night two’s was gratitude, a third event Thursday was something of a reality check. It was also the largest gathering of the week, squeezing about 175 people into Manny’s backroom for a panel featuring two journalists dissecting the upcoming campaign and Harris’s prospects for victory.“It’s not going to be easy, let’s be clear. It’s not going to be easy to win in November,” said Scott Shafer, politics editor at KQED, a Bay Area public radio station.The evening served as a call to action: “This is our hometown candidate, she’s one of us,” Yekutiel said. “So we are going to be needed to propel her to this highest office.”For those interested in getting involved, he announced a very San Francisco option: A “disco for democracy” party, with proceeds going to get-out-the-vote efforts in neighboring Nevada. Only days earlier, when Biden was still heading the Democratic ticket, such festivities were a harder sell, Yekutiel said. But now there was something to dance about.Lalita Abhyankar, a physician, was ready to volunteer. “I want to knock on doors,” she said. “I’ve never felt this way about a candidate, not even Obama. … I can vote for her instead of just voting against Trump. It feels amazing.”Thursday was her first time at a Manny’s discussion, she said. A friend told her it was the place to be this week, and she wanted company as she reveled in her new enthusiasm. Sometimes even those who didn’t know they cared leave Manny’s fired up — like the woman who happened to walk in just before Biden’s address.“She came in for a mocha and participated in a major historic moment,” Yekutiel said. “That was my vision for this place — you trap people with beer and coffee so they don’t even realize they’re walking into a political space. And then, they’re in.”"
WaPo_43,Scientists delve into the give-and-take of chimp conversations,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2024/07/27/chimp-communication-gestures-humans/,2024-07-27 19:00:02.669076,,"Human conversations follow an almost universal beat: rapid-fire speech, turn-taking, the occasional interruption. Chimpanzees communicate that way, too, a new study suggests — shedding new light on behavior patterns that humans and primates appear to share.The analysis, published in Current Biology, focused on video footage of five wild communities of East African chimpanzees in Uganda and Tanzania.Researchers used video of chimps interacting with one another, isolating instances of communication between chimps and collecting data on which one initiated the exchange and how the primates responded to one another with gestures and other behaviors. Overall, the researchers looked at more than 8,500 gestures from 252 chimpanzees.In analyzing “conversational” patterns, the researchers found that 14 percent of all interactions involved an exchange of gestures between interacting chimps. The vast majority of gestural interactions (83 percent) involved a two-part exchange of gesture for gesture. The chimps’ response timing was similar to that of humans, but it took longer for the animals to respond to gestures with other behaviors.“We did see a little variation among different chimp communities, which again matches what we see in people where there are slight cultural variations in conversation pace: some cultures have slower or faster talkers,” Gal Badihi, the paper’s first author and a research fellow at the University of St. Andrews, says in a news release.Though timing did vary slightly by community, the researchers write that the similarities with human conversation suggest “shared mechanisms” between human and chimpanzees. Conversational turn-taking could have evolved to strengthen social bonds and align both members of the exchange, they write.They call for future research on conversational patterns of other animals in a bid to understand why and how such norms evolved."

WaPo_47,Hackers race to win millions in contest to thwart cyberattacks with AI,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/27/pentagon-cybersecurity-ai-hackathon-darpa-challenge/,2024-07-27 19:00:02.669076,,"BREA, Calif. — The front line in the battle to protect U.S. critical infrastructure ran this month through a rental house in Orange County.More than a dozen hackers from Arizona State University, the University of California-Santa Barbara and Purdue University tapped on laptops  spread among tables, couches and the kitchen counter, looking over one another’s shoulders and sometimes asking peers or professors for help.The mission of the hackathon: to write a program that can scan millions of lines of open-source code, identify security flaws and fix them, all without human intervention. Success would mean winning millions of dollars in a two-year contest sponsored by DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.The contest is one of the clearest signs to date that the government sees flaws in open-source software as one of the country’s biggest security risks, and considers artificial intelligence vital to addressing it.Free open-source programs, such as the Linux operating system, help run everything from websites to power stations. The code isn’t inherently worse than what’s in proprietary programs from companies like Microsoft and Oracle, but there aren’t enough skilled engineers tasked with testing it.As a result, poorly maintained free code has been at the root of some of the most expensive cybersecurity breaches of all time, including the 2017 Equifax disaster that exposed the personal information of half of all Americans. The incident, which led to the largest-ever data breach settlement, cost the company more than $1 billion in improvements and penalties.If people can’t keep up with all the code being woven into every industrial sector, DARPA hopes machines can.“The goal is having an end-to-end ‘cyber reasoning system’ that leverages large language models to find vulnerabilities, prove that they are vulnerabilities, and patch them,” explained one of the advising professors, Arizona State’s Yan Shoshitaishvili.To get there, the team is grappling with the often grim reality behind lofty AI aspirations. The students are doing things like imposing “sanity checks” to catch hallucinations, verifying that patches actually solve the issues they are supposed to, and having two AI systems debate each other over the best fixes — with a third AI deciding the winner.“AI is a like a 3-year-old with infinite knowledge,” said UC-Santa Barbara graduate student and team co-captain Lukas Dresel. “You have to give it actionable feedback.”Team Shellphish is one of about 40 contestants in a competition known as AIxCC, for artificial intelligence cyber challenge, and run by DARPA, the Pentagon research arm charged with developing secret weapons and defending against them.“We want to redefine how we secure widely used, critical codebases, because of how ubiquitous open-source is across the critical infrastructure sectors,” said Andrew Carney, DARPA project manager for the contest.Though DARPA helped birth the internet to survive communication failures, it has become painfully obvious that the net also introduced enormous weaknesses.With no built-in security, the vast interconnections allow anyone or anything to start from anywhere and look for ways into machines that power the modern world. Once inside, users can pose as employees or system administrators, steal national or trade secrets, and shut the place down or hold it up for ransom.Hackers are claiming more victims than ever: The number of data breaches reported to the FBI-run U.S. Internet Crime Complaint Center tripled between 2021 and 2023. Government agents burrow into rival nations’ power and water plants. Crime gangs engorged by illicit profit think nothing of knocking out hospitals and sending desperate patients elsewhere.Open-source software, whether written by students or farseeing geniuses, is almost as ubiquitous as the internet itself, by some estimates nestling inside 90% of commercial software.Like all software, it has bugs, some of which can be exploited to seize control of a machine.Some large open-source projects are run by near-Wikipedia-size armies of volunteers and are generally in good shape. Some have maintainers who are given grants by big corporate users that turn it into a job.And then there is everything else, including programs written as homework assignments by authors who barely remember them.“Open source has always been ‘Use at your own risk,’” said Brian Behlendorf, who started the Open Source Security Foundation after decades of maintaining a pioneering free server software, Apache, and other projects at the Apache Software Foundation.“It’s not free as in speech, or even free as in beer,” he said. “It’s free as in puppy, and it needs care and feeding.”The risks have been underscored recently by two very different incidents.The first was a vulnerability in a small program for keeping track of system activity, known as Log4j, used by thousands of software developers and installed on millions of machines.In 2013, a user proposed adding some code to Log4j, and the small Apache Foundation team maintaining Log4j approved it. In November 2021, a Chinese engineer saw that the added section contained a massive design flaw that would allow system takeovers, and he flagged the issue to the Apache group.While Apache was working on a patch to fix the problem, an unidentified researcher discovered the pending changes and developed a malicious tool to grab control of computers running Log4j. Apache rushed out the patch, setting off a race between thousands of defenders and those trying to exploit the flaw before it was fixed.Many Log4j instances have still not been fixed. On Thursday, the National Security Agency and others warned that North Korean spies were still breaking into U.S. web servers running old versions.The White House’s Cyber Safety Review Board concluded that only better coding and thorough audits could have stopped the Log4j flaw’s distribution, and that open-source efforts like Apache’s “would need sustained financial support and expertise.”The Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has responded with small grants to start-ups  and has been pushing companies to declare what’s inside their software. But those are slow-moving initiatives.The most recent reminder of the vulnerability came in March. That’s when a Microsoft engineer traced a slight increase in processor use to open-source tools for Linux that had just been updated. He found that a back door for spying had been inserted by the tools’ official maintainer, and blew the whistle in time to stop it from shipping in the most popular versions of Linux.In a nightmare scenario for security professionals, the anonymous maintainer had won control of the project after contributing for years, aided by secret allies who lobbied the previous manager to cede control.As open-source security was rising to become a top priority for CISA and the national security establishment, OpenAI and Microsoft loosed ChatGPT and generative artificial intelligence on the world.By democratizing programming, the new tools allowed non-coders to create software. AI also aided existing programmers, including criminal hackers who could more quickly incorporate tricks to take advantage of vulnerabilities and deliver more convincing lures, such as emails that appeared to come from regular contacts with shared interests.AI is also boosting defensive endeavors, such as analyzing reams of logs for unusual behavior and summarizing security incidents. It can also flag security missteps in programs as they are written.But figuring out where the holes in open-source programs are before attackers find them is a holy grail for DARPA and the contestants of AIxxCC.DARPA ran a cyber challenge at the 2016 Def Con hacker convention, where programs competed in a “capture the flag” contest to hack into one another in an artificial environment.In this year’s contest, the teams use their AI-enhanced programs to digest and improve millions of lines of real code.Shellphish is one of seven teams that wrote papers outlining their approach well enough to get $1 million in funding for the steps that will climax at the semifinals in August at Def Con, which attracted 40 entries. The winner will get another $2 million in 2025.Some of Shellphish’s first million dollars went for the Airbnb-listed home in Brea, which housed hackers for three weeks in June and another two in July. More went for a huge testing environment that used 5,000 central processing unit cores.Shellphish is no random group of hackers. Though strongly associated with two public universities with changing populations, the team has been around for 20 years, and its founders are still involved.Italian native Giovanni Vigna was teaching computer security at UC-Santa Barbara, including techniques for attacking and defending, when he founded a capture-the-flag team in 2003 to get students more interested and stretch their capabilities. It won the Def Con competition in 2005, and a spinoff of the team hosted the contest later for a four-year stretch.As his students graduated and spread to Arizona and elsewhere, some stayed involved, or got their own students into it.Shellphish competed in the original 2016 Cyber Grand Challenge, but got knocked out in the finals.“We had all these cool tools but ran out of time to integrate them,”  Shoshitaishvili recalled. “So ‘Don’t get nerd-sniped’ was my No. 1 piece of advice.” (Nerd-sniping refers to distracting someone technical with an interesting problem.)Core to the effort are tools known in security as “fuzzers.” These fire all manner of data at a program to see how it handles the unexpected.Even souped-up fuzzers are unlikely to find the most obscure flaws or deliberate back doors, the team members admit. At its best, Shellphish’s master program and the others will be able to find a lot of low-hanging fruit, quickly, and get rid of it before malicious hackers can exploit them.“AI will be able to solve things that take humans months,” Dresel said.Under the terms of the DARPA contest, all finalists must release their programs as open source, so that software vendors and consumers will be able to run them.Yan compared the expected advance to security milestones like forced software updates and browser “sandboxes” that keep web programs from escaping the browser and executing elsewhere on a user’s device.AI won’t be able to make all software safe, he said. But it will give the humans more time to try.After a final, near-sleepless night of debugging and panicked last-minute fixes, Shellphish submitted its program at the 9 a.m. deadline. In a few weeks, at the next Def Con in Las Vegas, they will find out if they’re finalists. Win or lose, their AI-aided code will be available for others to build on, improving security for everyone.An earlier version of this article incorrectly said Shellphish was eliminated before the finals in 2016; it was eliminated in the finals. Also, it was a spinoff of the team, not the team itself, that sponsored the Def Con competition for four years. "
WaPo_48,Pennsylvania presidential election results could again take days to count,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/27/pennsylvania-election-results-mail-ballots/,2024-07-27 18:00:02.669076,,"When the polls closed on election night in 2020, President Donald Trump appeared to be winning Pennsylvania. But over the next several days, as officials counted mail-in ballots, his lead shrunk and then disappeared. By Saturday, Joe Biden was the clear winner of Pennsylvania — and, with it, the presidency.The protracted counting process left a days-long vacuum that Trump filled with demands to stop counting the ballots while he was still ahead, declaring victory in Pennsylvania and building the false narrative that the mail-in votes were fraudulent. It became a core part of the false narrative that helped propel Trump’s “Stop the Steal” crusade and spurred election denialism among his allies and supporters that has continued to this day.The delay was caused by a quirk of Pennsylvania’s election law, which forbids the opening of mail-in ballots until 7 a.m. on the day of the election. The narrow Election Day vote margins in 2020 coupled with the unprecedented number of people voting by mail because of the pandemic created a massive backlog and left election officials racing to finish the count. Pennsylvania, one of the most hotly contested battleground states, is one of only seven states, including another battleground, Wisconsin, that doesn’t allow pre-canvassing — the act of opening and processing mail ballots ahead of Election Day. In 2020, 27 states allowed pre-canvassing. Since then, 16 more states have passed laws permitting it.But not Pennsylvania. Despite widespread calls for change, Pennsylvania is likely to again take several days to announce this year’s winner, alarming state election officials who worry the delay will cause confusion, deteriorate trust in the process and make election workers targets for harassment.“If the electoral college comes down to Pennsylvania or Wisconsin, we might still face a long period where we don’t know the winner,” said Rachel Orey, an elections expert at the Bipartisan Policy Center.Pennsylvania state lawmakers had four years to change the law and allow pre-canvassing, but the legislative session ended this month without them doing so. The Democratic-led Pennsylvania House of Representatives passed a bill in May that would have allowed county officials to begin pre-canvassing mail ballots seven days before Election Day, as was recommended by a bipartisan panel. But the Republican-controlled State Senate never brought it for a vote, with some Republicans arguing that the change wasn’t needed or that it should include other changes to election laws.“It’s reprehensible that they didn’t get it done,” said Kathy Boockvar, a Democrat who was Pennsylvania’s secretary of state during the 2020 election. “This is not rocket science. The reality is that not passing this bill will mean that ballots will take longer to count, which means it will be longer until we have the results of the election.”State Rep. Scott Conklin, a Democrat who sponsored the pre-canvassing bill, said that when he asked county commissioners across the state to name one wish for administering elections, the answer was resoundingly to allow them to start processing mail ballots early.Conklin said refusal to do so could once again allow election deniers to baselessly claim that the mail ballots counted after Election Day are fraudulent. Ahead of the 2020 presidential election, Trump and his allies began to cast doubts on the integrity of mail ballots and urged his supporters to vote in person, creating what became known as the “red mirage.” Initially leading, Trump declared victory in Pennsylvania the day after the election, less than 24 hours after polls had closed. His campaign sued to stop the count even though nearly 1 million mail ballots statewide had not yet been tallied. Then-Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani and other Trump backers alleged widespread fraud in the mail ballots without evidence.“This is a perfect case of where the elected officials are purposely causing a delay, causing an atmosphere of conspiracy and doing it on the backs of good citizens who trust them,” Conklin said, referring to the Republican legislators who blocked the legislation.Seth Bluestein, a Republican city commissioner in Philadelphia, was a deputy commissioner during the prolonged vote count in 2020. He and his colleagues worked around-the-clock for days to process roughly 375,000 mail ballots in the city’s convention center as pro-Trump protesters raged outside. Bluestein and his colleagues said they received death threats. Near the site, police arrested two armed men who drove from Virginia, allegedly in search of fake ballots.“That larger window of time when the final result is not known — that is where a lot of this harassment and threat environment can come about,” Bluestein said. “If we had pre-canvassing, it would really limit that window of opportunity for the spread of mis- and disinformation.”Some Republicans refused to vote for the pre-canvassing bill because they said it didn’t include any of their election priorities, like stricter rules for the identification voters must provide. Others claimed that most counties have recently invested in automated machines to open the mail ballot envelopes, sufficiently speeding up the process.“Pre-canvassing is a solution in search of a problem,” said state Rep. Brad Roae (R), who represents a deeply Republican area in the northwestern corner of the state. “If counties manually opened each envelope one by one with a letter opener like it was 100 years ago it would be an issue, but nobody does that.”Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa (D) said he regrets not pushing harder for pre-canvassing immediately after the 2020 election. “We should have fixed it then,” he said.Costa pointed to the work of a bipartisan panel created by the legislature in 2020 for the specific purpose of reviewing the state’s election system and recommending improvements. The panel described pre-canvassing as the “highest priority” for many of its members in its first report to lawmakers.“The consensus,” the panel wrote in June 2021, “is that advance mail-in ballot processing could resolve many of the problems that contributed to concerns about the validity of votes in Pennsylvania.”That year, state lawmakers passed a bipartisan bill that made significant changes to Pennsylvania election law, including allowing county officials to begin processing mail ballots five days before Election Day. But it contained other Republican-based priorities, including tighter rules for voter identification and limits to ballot drop boxes. Then-Gov. Tom Wolf (D) vetoed the legislation, saying it would create barriers to voting.Even a few days of lead time to process mail ballots would help shield Philadelphia — and other parts of the state — against a potential repeat of 2020, Bluestein said. Without it, he said, election deniers will again have an opening to bully election officials and spread lies about the result before the race is called.While election officials in Philadelphia say they are better prepared to handle the volume of mail ballots they are anticipating this year, they say it is still likely to take a day or more to get the results if the race is tight.“Do you want the results on election night? Or do you want to wait a day or two?” said Lisa Deeley, a Democratic city commissioner in Philadelphia. “If you want to wait, then wait you will, because we can’t open those ballots until 7 a.m. on Election Day.”"
WaPo_49,"Olympics site was once center of Paris fashion, duels and prostitution",https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2024/07/27/bois-de-boulogne-paris-olympics-tennis/,2024-07-27 18:00:02.669076,,"Beginning Saturday, tens of thousands of spectators from around the world will pour into Roland Garros Stadium in western Paris each day to watch tennis Olympians whack forehands and overheads on the courts where the French Open is played every year.The stadium complex occupies the southeast corner of the Bois de Boulogne, a vast pleasure garden that was the throbbing heart of mid-19th-century Paris. Nearly triple the size of Central Park in New York, the 2,100-acre Bois (pronounced bwah) for nearly a century stood as the epicenter of Paris society and the talk of the world press, its colorful scenes captured in paintings and novels.“The Bois de Boulogne was an important part of the Parisian lifestyle, providing a theater of appearances and a daily show,” said Jean-Michel Derex, author of a book on the park’s history. “It was very inspiring for Baudelaire, Zola, Maupassant, Balzac, Proust and many others.”Officially inaugurated by French Emperor Napoleon III with the filling of its man-made lakes in 1854, the Bois triggered a social revolution. It was the first major public green space in the crowded, filthy and disease-ridden capital, and it expanded the range of leisure pursuits available to Parisians and brought a new mixing of the classes.Denizens flocked there, strolling its meandering nature trails, rowing across ponds, taking in concerts, savoring the grandstand views at the Longchamp racetrack, exploring the new zoo and dining at elegant chalet restaurants. But the main attraction was simply parading around its lakes and gardens, showing off haute-couture fashions, handsome horses and liveried carriages.“It was the place to see and be seen,” Derex said.The daily promenade of horse-drawn carriages was such a riveting event that it caused major traffic jams into the park and topped must-see lists in tourist guides. Each afternoon, thousands of spectators took in the flashy get-ups of the royals, bankers, playwrights, famous courtesans and visiting VIPs. Even the emperor frequently made the rounds.“The drive into the Bois is a splendid spectacle,” wrote the Dublin Times.“What a stream of open carriages, overflowing with voluminous gay [outfits], occupied the Parisian woods today,” reported London’s Penny Illustrated Paper, marveling over the “cosmopolitan world” Paris had become.Inspired by London’s Hyde Park, the Bois outdid it in splendor. “The French beat us in parks,” lamented a British writer for the Glasgow Evening Citizen.Artists including Édouard Manet and Berthe Morisot set up their easels to capture the racetracks, footbridges, aviaries and grottoes, while the panoramic beauty moved Mark Twain to write in “The Innocents Abroad”: “I will not describe the Bois de Boulogne. I cannot do it. It is simply a beautiful, cultivated, endless, wonderful wilderness. It is an enchanting place.”The creation of the park was also a brilliant PR move by the new French emperor, Napoleon III, the plucky nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte.A felon who had twice attempted to overthrow the king — after the second attempt, he was sentenced to life in prison, from which he escaped after six years — Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte became the first elected French president in 1848, when King Louis-Philippe fled the country after that year’s revolution.However, continually blocked in his plans to extensively modernize Paris, President Bonaparte tossed his own government in December 1851, announcing the next year that, like his uncle, he would wear the imperial crown. He promised to bring order and prosperity to his subjects and to make Paris “the capital of all capitals” during this Second French Empire. Napoleon III’s first major move was to donate the Bois de Boulogne — a walled, private forest that for centuries had been the royal hunting grounds for French kings — to the city, with the condition that officials use municipal funds to renovate it.And renovate they did, accomplishing engineering feats and landscaping marvels little known at the time. They created two artificial lakes connected by waterfalls, numerous ponds and miles of twisting trails, as well as glass pavilions, gazebos, amusement parks and enclosed botanical gardens. Even those who protested Napoleon III’s seizure of power, dubious financial practices and ridiculous wars — as well as his razing of old Paris to create wide, tree-lined boulevards designed by Georges-Eugène Haussmann — mostly applauded the opening of the Bois.“Paris was then a medieval city, dank, without light, and there was no circulation of air,” said French urban designer Stéphane Malek, pointing to the epidemics that often swept through. After a cholera outbreak killed 19,000 people in six months in 1832, public health experts demanded that the cramped city be opened up, but until Napoleon III, little had been accomplished. The Bois de Boulogne, along with the subsequent Bois de Vincennes, Malek said, gave residents access to fresh, clean air. The two parks became known as the lungs of Paris.Despite the picnics, boats, flowers, kids’ rides and theatrical productions, however, not all at the Bois de Boulogne was wholesome.For one thing, the daily promenades put leaders in proximity to the public — as evidenced in 1867, when a disgruntled Polish immigrant shot at visiting Russian czar Alexander II as he traveled in a regal carriage alongside the French emperor.For another, the Bois was a favored site for nobles and politicians, armed with swords or pistols, to meet for duels, which, despite having been outlawed, remained a popular way to resolve disputes throughout the 19th century. Even women were known to partake in the potentially lethal pursuit in the Bois de Boulogne.What’s more, the secluded groves throughout the park attracted prostitutes — as hinted at in Manet’s painting “Le Dejeuner sur l’Herbe.” Art historian Peter Gärtner writes in his book “Art and Architecture: Musée D’Orsay” that the painting “is not of a picnic in an urban forest, as the French title suggests. Instead, it highlights the prostitution that was widespread in the Bois de Boulogne, which was common knowledge in Paris, but which was a taboo subject.”Nevertheless, for three-quarters of a century, the Bois remained one of Paris’s star attractions. The thrill of the daily promenade has long since faded, erased by the car. But the lush park that sparked a new opening-up of Parisian society is still adored for its beauty, restaurants, horse racetracks, running and biking trails, and Shakespeare Garden, which re-creates scenes from the Bard’s plays.The Bois has retained nearly all of its natural holdings, save for the 21-acre strip where Roland Garros Stadium was built in 1928. In 2019, the stadium was expanded to include the 5,000-seat Simonne Mathieu Court, stretching into the Serres d’Auteuil botanical garden of the Bois de Boulogne. The move was first met with outrage, until the design incorporated greenhouses, which wrap the new court on all four sides.The stadium complex will showcase Olympian tennis from Saturday through Aug. 4. Boxing finals will be staged there from Aug. 6 to Aug. 10. And the Paralympics’ wheelchair tennis event will be there from Aug. 30 to Sept. 7.Melissa Rossi is the author of six books about geopolitics.

WaPo_50,Anthony Edwards is the Gen Z star USA Basketball craved,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/27/anthony-edwards-olympics-basketball/,2024-07-27 18:00:02.669076,,"LAS VEGAS — Anthony Edwards stood silently behind a crescent of reporters as his Olympic teammate Anthony Davis monotoned through a news conference. A high-pitched staccato interrupted.“Let me get in that, nephew!”Heads turned, and the crowd parted to let Edwards stroll into the scrum, his 6-foot-4 frame built more like a running back’s than a shooting guard’s. Davis’s tone brightened.“The real Ant is here!” said Davis, breaking into a smile, dapping up Edwards and handing over the microphone.“The real Ant!” Edwards echoed.The U.S. men’s basketball team convened here for training camp a few weeks before the Olympic tournament. Edwards, who will turn 23 in early August, is the team’s youngest player. He’s also the youngest of four siblings, an experienced little brother, perceptive and curious and comfortable scrapping for attention.He scanned the faces staring back at him. Perched on a stool, he leaned forward, tilting his ear toward the first question, which sputtered. The reporter apologized for his nerves.“It’s all good,” Edwards said, holding eye contact. “Take your time, man.”He said it with gentility, unlike his jocular exchange with Davis. Edwards doesn’t code switch, but he senses deeply, displaying empathy that has forged lasting bonds everywhere he goes.“His emotional intelligence is off the charts,” said Tysor Anderson, his high school coach at Holy Spirit Prep in Atlanta. “It stood out to me far more than his athletic ability.”Expanding his audience of admirers, Edwards has leaped onto the NBA’s main stage as the league sails through a period of growing cultural relevance and financial success. His oldest Olympic teammates — including 35-year-old Kevin Durant, 36-year-old Stephen Curry and 39-year-old LeBron James — lifted the sport to new heights and now anchor the national program’s push to win its fifth straight Olympic gold medal.But the path to the podium gets more competitive every year. While the aging U.S. team is again heavily favored to win gold and most NBA players are still American, the sport’s best young stars in recent years have hailed from elsewhere. An American-born player hasn’t won the NBA’s MVP award since 2018, and the top four vote getters this year were from Serbia, Canada, Slovenia and Greece. The top pick in each of the past two NBA drafts was from France, as were three other top-seven selections.Edwards, at these Olympics and for years to come, looks poised to carry the next chapter of America’s basketball tradition. He capped off his fourth NBA season this past spring by leading the Minnesota Timberwolves on a deep playoff run that marked his ascent “from being an all-star to superstar,” as Timberwolves veteran point guard Mike Conley put it. Four-time all-star teammate Karl-Anthony Towns has called Edwards the new face of the NBA: a charismatic showstopper with a playful humor pitch-perfect for sneaker commercials and a skill set that blesses fans’ group chats with must-share clips of gravity-defying dunks and blocks.“He plays with a joy,” said Steve Kerr, coach of the Olympic team and the Golden State Warriors. “He never seems to be under any kind of strain or stress.”His competitive intensity, silky midrange game and ample trash talk have drawn comparisons to the greatest who have played his position. But those who have witnessed his journey up close are quick to point out where the resemblances to Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan fall short and how Edwards reflects the values of a new generation disillusioned by the emotionally abusive motivational tactics long venerated across the sports world.“He has that killer instinct, but his reputation with teammates is different from what Kobe and Michael were known for, how they almost struck fear in their teammates,” said Mike Grady, the Timberwolves’ play-by-play announcer. “Everybody loves Ant. He empowers his teammates in a way that is not confrontational. He celebrates his teammates.”The rising stature comes with heightened scrutiny that Edwards doesn’t duck with cautious aphorisms. Asked how he intends to adjust to sharing a court with fellow Olympic stars, he appeared resolute.“I’m still the No. 1 option,” he said with a widening smirk that hinted at irony but dared everyone to believe him. “I just go out there and be myself. Shoot my shots. Play defense. And they got to fit in and play around me.”THREE DAYS LATER, WHEN EDWARDS came off the bench in the opening exhibition game, Team USA was down eight points to Canada, a team considered a threat to halt the Americans’ march to gold. He snatched a rebound on his first play and, over the next few minutes, plunged down the lane for a reverse layup, sliced a pass through a double-team for an easy bucket, then caught a shooting rhythm, draining a pair of jumpers. By the time he subbed out, the team was down just one.When the United States took its first lead, Edwards was the sole player to rise from the bench, and when Canada called a timeout to slow the momentum, Edwards was the first to greet his teammates. His “youthful exuberance” energizes those around him, said Erik Spoelstra, a U.S. assistant coach and coach of the Miami Heat. “His personality is not going to change just because he’s on a team of this caliber.”Edwards swished a three that beat the third-quarter buzzer, snatched a steal that led to a fast-break and punched in a jam that etched him as the team’s leading scorer. He capped off big plays with a fiery scowl, nodding at the roaring crowd, howling affirmations. No less animated at practice, Edwards once complimented the team’s eldest statesman with “Good pass, boy!” before quickly revising to “Good pass, ’Bron!”“He’s authentically himself,” U.S. teammate Bam Adebayo said. “He’s going to be the same person every day on the court, off the court.”Growing up in a tightknit family in southwest Atlanta, Edwards inherited these traits from his mother, Yvette, and grandmother Shirley. They attended every football and basketball game, the loudest in the crowd and “always happy,” recalled DeAndre Brown, his teammate from second to 12th grade.“That’s what they left me here with, being happy all the time,” Edwards said in a news conference before his rookie season. “There’s nothing that can tear me down.”
In 2015, when Edwards was 14, his grandmother and mother both died of cancer, eight months apart. He wears No. 5 because they each died on the fifth day of a month. The trauma burned into him perspective he still carries.
“I’ve been through the worst,” he said in May after the Timberwolves dropped the first three games of the Western Conference finals. “So the sky is never falling on me.”
After their mother’s funeral, he and his older brother Bubba processed their pain on a basketball court, where they shot hoops late into the night. As Edwards finished middle school, he shifted his focus from football, where his exploits as a running back were legendary, to the sport his brother starred in. “Ant wanted to be just like Bubba in basketball,” Brown said.
He attacked the craft with devotion, a tireless perfectionist who studied Durant and Allen Iverson highlights. He kept any signs of his grief within the confines of his family. All his teammates saw was the resilience of his charisma.
“Every day, Ant comes into the gym with a smile on his face,” Brown said. “You would never even know what he went through.”
On their Atlanta Xpress travel team, Edwards was the ceremonial leader of their road-trip bonding tradition. Brown was in charge of filming as Edwards filled a trash bin with water and ice, tiptoed into a hotel room, then dumped the cold surprise on a sleeping teammate to a chorus of teenage giggles that soon erupted into rib-busting howls. When other teammates executed the prank, Brown said, they would lay the blame on Edwards, on the theory that it was impossible for anybody to be mad at him.
From afar, Edwards exuded brashness that could intimidate. Buka Peikrishvili was nervous before meeting Edwards in ninth grade, when Edwards was a promising guard and Bubba was a senior captain at their public high school. Peikrishvili was a sharpshooting forward at Holy Spirit Prep, a private academy. He and Anderson, the Holy Spirit coach, came to watch  Edwards play and convince him to enroll at their school across town.
Peikrishvili had arrived in Atlanta from the country Georgia less than a year earlier, after visa troubles blocked his efforts to sign with a professional basketball team in Italy. He was still learning English.
Edwards put him at ease. He told him he loved his accent, laughed at his jokes and asked whether he could teach him some Georgian words.
“He said, ‘You’re the funniest person I’ve ever met,’” Peikrishvili recalled. “You need one of those people in your life.”
Edwards transferred to Holy Spirit the following fall. Financial aid covered his tuition. His first two years on campus, he helped the team win back-to-back state titles.
Peikrishvili and Edwards became close, bonded by the challenge of navigating an upper-crust campus that felt far from the worlds they had grown up in. The Atlanta apartment Edwards shared with his siblings was an hour’s drive from Holy Spirit’s suburban campus nestled beside mansions and golf courses. His sister, Antoinette, was his legal guardian but only 20 herself and stretched thin from taking care of her younger siblings.
Edwards didn’t own a car, so he got rides from a constellation of adults who contributed to his support system.
“Everyone loves him, so he just naturally attracts people to support him,” said Rachel Little, his guidance counselor at Holy Spirit Prep. “His siblings were dealing with a lot, so we all just tried to fill the gap.”
Peikrishvili and two other European-born teammates lived with Little, who offered to host them through their high school years. Edwards often joined them after practice for spaghetti dinners and late-night Fortnite sessions. Soon he was spending the night so regularly that he began leaving a spare school uniform there. When Peikrishvili FaceTimed his parents, he would pass the phone to Edwards, who was eager to show off the Georgian he had learned. When Peikrishvili spiraled into homesickness, Edwards pulled him out of it.
“He just brings you all the positive energy,” Peikrishvili said. “He’s going to uplift you.”
It was one part of a long trail of goodwill that Edwards left as a teenager. Another, Little recalls, was the friendship he developed with a classmate in study hall who struggled with social anxiety.
“Not all of her peers were super nice to her and willing to interact with her,” Little said. “She learned a lot from him just practicing those casual conversations.”
As a longtime high school and college coach, Anderson has seen resentment fester on teams when a singular player rises above the rest. That wasn’t the case with Edwards, he said, “because of how easy it was to love Ant.”
When esteemed college coaches visited Holy Spirit to woo Edwards, he would introduce them to his teammates. When the University of Georgia invited Edwards on a recruiting trip in December of his senior year, he asked Coach Tom Crean whether he could bring one of his European teammates who wasn’t able to fly back home for the holidays. “He wanted to share that with them,” Anderson said.TWO WEEKS INTO THE NBA PLAYOFFS, Mike Conley Jr. had a revelation.Over a six-game stretch, the Timberwolves’ 36-year-old point guard watched Edwards scorch a path of iconic performances that shook the basketball universe, leading a sweep of Durant’s Phoenix Suns and snatching two games against the defending NBA champion Denver Nuggets and league MVP Nikola Jokic. Pausing to reflect after a May practice, Conley savored the thought that cautiously bloomed in his mind.“Am I playing with a guy who is going to be mentioned with these guys in the future and before his time is done he will be that guy and I’ve actually had the chance to be his teammate?” Conley said. “You start thinking about all the moments.”Over his single season with Edwards, Conley counted several moments that recalibrated his understanding of what his teammate might be capable of. In the final seconds against the Indiana Pacers, playing through a hurt ankle, Edwards jumped so high to block a potential game-tying layup that he hit the back of his head on the rim — a play voted NBA block of the year in a poll of fans.WHAT A BLOCK 😱ANT EDWARDS SKIES FOR THE REJECTION TO WIN THE GAME ‼️ pic.twitter.com/W0lqPOkTzTAgainst the Utah Jazz, Edwards soared for a tomahawk posterization so ferocious that he dislocated a finger on the defender’s face — a play voted NBA dunk of the year.ANTHONY EDWARDS OH MY GOD!DUNK OF THE YEAR? pic.twitter.com/ARJ2CwMMKuWhile the arena buzzed, Edwards ran to the locker room to pop the finger back into place, then led the team to a comeback victory with 25 second-half points. “I’ll be telling my kids about that when they get older,” Conley said.In the fierce and fickle NBA universe, ascents are ephemeral. Just two years ago, Ja Morant was the must-see predecessor to Edwards before he drifted into a series of off-court issues. Through it all, Morant projected defiance.Edwards hasn’t avoided stumbling into trouble. On a September 2022 Instagram story he filmed while riding in a car, he described a group of shirtless men on the sidewalk as “queer,” then added, “Look what the world done came to.” Shortly thereafter, he apologized. “What I said was immature, hurtful, and disrespectful, and I’m incredibly sorry,” he wrote in a social media post, adding: “I was raised better than that!”In December 2023, a woman posted screenshots of text messages showing Edwards encouraging her to terminate her pregnancy, offering to pay for it, and asking her to send him a video of her taking the abortion pills. In response, Edwards released a statement disavowing his actions. “All women should be supported and empowered to make their own decisions about their bodies and what is best for them,” he stated.The Timberwolves signed Conley before the start of last season in part to mentor Edwards. The veteran point guard was familiar with Edwards’s cameo as a sharp-tongued antagonist in the movie “Hustle” and caught glimpses of his silly side in viral news conference clips. But meeting Edwards for the first time as a teammate, “I didn’t know what to expect,” Conley said.His first impression was of a youngster who “just talks a lot, nonstop talking, funny, cracks jokes on everybody,” Conley said. “He makes fun of my haircut sometimes. He makes fun of my beard. Makes fun of your features. He’s constantly pointing out different things.”Observant of his teammates on the court, too, Edwards encourages those on a cold streak to keep shooting. He organizes off-the-clock group workout sessions. He diverted from news conference questions about himself to highlight other performances. “He always wants to see you succeed,” Timberwolves teammate Jaden McDaniels said. When Towns received the league’s social justice award before a playoff game, Edwards was the first player to pause his warmup and start clapping, spurring other teammates to join the applause.“After getting to know him, you realize how much he cares about how the other guys are feeling,” Conley said. “You don’t find that too much in guys that early in their career.”THREE DOZEN FANS WAITED FOR EDWARDS outside the Las Vegas gym.Many had been here for more than four hours, hoping to snap photos, plead for autographs or just catch a brief glimpse of the hoop heroes.On the first day of camp, with the temperature at 117 degrees, one person in the crowd fainted. The second day reached 118. By the third day, many fans brought coolers filled with bottled water and placed towels over the scorching steel barricades to keep their forearms from burning.By the time practice ended around 2, the sun had swallowed every sliver of shade, shut down phones and drained the fans of noise, movement, anything that might waste the energy they had saved for the moment they had waited for. And when the towering figures finally burst through the doors, the fans howled the names coiled at the tips of their tongues.The crowd tracked the players boarding the bus, which departed and left behind two players inside the gym, putting up shots on separate hoops.One was Curry. Stepping out of the gym in front of Curry a few minutes before 4, his longtime bodyguard announced to the crowd, “Ladies and gentleman, we are going to sign as much as we can until people get unruly.” Curry made his way down the line, eyes shaded beneath a bucket hat, rarely looking up, signing jerseys, balls and trading cards with a mechanical precision as rhythmic and dependable as his jumper.“We appreciate you, Steph!” a fan shouted as Curry made his way into a waiting Escalade. “That’s what legends do right there!”When the vehicle departed, another filled its place on the curb, driver at the wheel, engine running, air conditioner blasting. The crowd stayed put. Each time the gym doors opened, the crowd rustled to attention, only to be met with the disappointing sight of a USA Basketball staffer rolling out some equipment. Behind those doors, Edwards kept shooting.“He has an indomitable spirit,” said Kareem Maddox, a player development associate for the Timberwolves. “An unshakable self-confidence that’s backed up by how hard he works, and people just can’t help but gravitate to that.”Edwards has described his Olympic experience as an opportunity to learn from accomplished colleagues. He polishes pivot moves with Davis, warms up with James, talks tactics with Jrue Holiday and sits beside Spoelstra for a meandering post-practice conversation while his phone charges in an outlet by the baseline.“He’s around so much talent,” Davis said, “and he’s looking at us like, ‘How can I get better?’”A year ago, Edwards said, he wasn’t sure he would earn a spot on the 2024 Olympic team. Last summer, he was the leading scorer for Team USA in the FIBA World Cup. With few other all-stars on that roster of up-and-comers, Edwards controlled the ball so frequently that after losing to Lithuania in their fifth game, some of his teammates asked him to pass more. The United States finished fourth.For better and worse, Edwards has embodied the prototypical track of the American youth basketball system. Adapting to a rotating set of teammates across AAU tournaments and two high schools, he honed a thrilling skill set well suited to shine at summer camps and on social media.In high school, he would train with his personal coach before 6 a.m. practice, then again after practice in the evening, often returning home close to midnight, when he would take care of whatever homework he hadn’t completed in study hall. His name surged up recruiting rankings after an impressive showing at an Under Armour basketball camp for elite prospects.The next checkpoint on Edwards’s rise to the top of his peer group was to be named a McDonald’s all-American for his senior year of high school. The problem, Edwards learned, was that he wasn’t eligible for selection because he switched from the graduating class of 2019 to 2020 upon transferring to Holy Spirit to give him an extra year to catch up on the school’s mandatory credits. An all-American selection required that he graduate with his original class. So in fall 2018, seeking to graduate the following spring, he loaded his schedule with 10 classes.“It was a ridiculous amount of classes for a 17-year-old,” Little said. “On top of recruiting, on top of camps, on top of everything.”On the days he was most exhausted, he spent his lunch break in Little’s office.“He’d not say a word, put his backpack on the floor, put his arms inside his hoodie and sleep for an hour,” she said. “Toward the end, it was not fun. He was just like, ‘I just want to be done.’”Entering the NBA in 2020 after a year at Georgia, Edwards embodied the style of play that has become America’s basketball trademark: an athletic slasher with defensive tenacity and a deep bag of offensive tricks to create space for a shot.After getting past Durant and Jokic in this year’s playoffs, Edwards faced off against Luka Doncic, the Slovenian star who signed with Real Madrid when he was 13 and competed for years against and alongside older players who restricted his dominance, challenging him to expand his repertoire and create shots for teammates. Defenses that double him pay the price as he rifles the ball through open passing lanes. Doncic dominated the series, while Edwards struggled to catch a rhythm against a blitzing defense.Following the Timberwolves’ elimination, Edwards reflected that he was working hard to improve his ability to defeat defenses with guile rather than force.“Just being able to read the floor,” he said. “Not get as mad when teams double me and put two on me ’cause I know my guys out there are going to knock it down.”In the delicate space between expectations raised and fulfilled, Edwards offers his supporters the possibility of a rare joy: cheering on greatness as it soars toward its apex. It’s a possibility that compels parents and children to push through the heat for a glittering memory of Edwards leaving the gym long after the rest of his teammates.He exited the Las Vegas gym around 4:30, Atlanta Braves cap tilted upward, towel around his neck, skin glistening with sweat, phone in one hand, backpack on his shoulders, only to encounter the devoted crowd, calling his name, waving jerseys for him to sign.But his exhaustion was obvious from the way he dragged his legs. Plus, he had an appointment to rush to, part of a schedule that has gotten busier in recent months.Edwards flashed a peace sign, pushed out a smile, then waved his hand apologetically to indicate he could not pause for autographs. He climbed into the Escalade, and the fans watched him ride off into the desert horizon.Ben Golliver contributed to this report."
WaPo_51,"Netanyahu’s U.S. visit revealed ‘no workable plan’ for peace, critics say",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/07/27/netanyahu-gaza-peace-plan/,2024-07-27 18:00:02.669076,,"The applause was loudest at the beginning, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared to a joint meeting of Congress that Israel “will win” in its fight against Hamas. They applauded, too, when he spotlighted the resilience of those who remain hostages in Gaza and lauded the bravery of the Jewish state’s front-line soldiers.Far fewer stood and cheered when he spoke of his “vision” for the Palestinian territory’s future.To many Democrats who’ve been critical of Netanyahu, the Israeli leader merely confirmed what they already knew.“In fact, [he] doubled down,” said Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), who watched Wednesday’s address from the back of the House chamber. It’s “absurd … to think that doing more of the same is going to deliver a different result,” he said.Nearly 10 months into Israel’s Gaza offensive, amid deepening frustration from the Biden administration and isolation on the world stage, Netanyahu made no gestures toward compromise. There was no talk of Palestinian autonomy. No discussion of Palestinian rights to life and freedom. No attempt to address the grievances that have fueled Palestinians’ decades-old anger toward Israel.Instead, he spoke of a “demilitarized and deradicalized” Gaza; a Gaza under Israeli control “for the foreseeable future.”“This is the moment for the leader of Israel to lay out a vision for the future,” Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) recalled thinking as he watched the speech on a TV in his office, one of more than 50 Democratic lawmakers who boycotted the address. But “he didn’t. He offered no road map.” He hadn’t changed a bit, Welch said.The Biden administration has for months sought to negotiate an ambitious, three-phase peace agreement to end Israel’s war in Gaza, with the White House asserting amid Netanyahu’s Washington visit that the negotiating parties were closer “than we’ve ever been before” to agreeing on a short-term cease-fire and initial hostage release. The next step, according to Biden, would involve negotiations over a permanent end to the fighting and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, along with the release of all remaining hostages.It’s phase three of the plan, which would culminate in new Palestinian governance, security, rebuilding and a path to statehood, that is the most essential ingredient to the success of any long-term peace, experts say.But if the concept of a viable Palestinian future wasn’t one of Netanyahu’s considerations before the war, which began with October’s deadly Hamas attack into Israel, his remarks in recent days left little reason to believe that anything in his thinking has changed.“Obviously he didn’t talk at all about a long-term plan for the Palestinians because Netanyahu has effectively renounced a Palestinian state,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who chairs a Senate subcommittee focused on the Middle East. “I think his plan for a while has been to have no workable plan.”Liberal Democrats on Capitol Hill who have grown more frustrated with Israel’s conduct over the course of the war have begun to acknowledge that the Israeli government has largely foreclosed on phase two of the peace plan as well.Satellite imagery, witness testimony and the comments of military commanders have shown for months that preparations are underway for a long-term Israeli presence in Gaza. In recent months, Israel fortified a strategic route, known as the Netzarim Corridor, that carves Gaza into two and allows for the quick deployment of Israeli troops throughout the territory.Israeli forces have razed homes and bulldozed acres of farmland to create and expand buffer zones along their strategic corridor, and along Gaza’s borders with Israel and Egypt. Israeli commanders have talked about a plan for “full freedom of operation” for their forces. They have churned earth and rubble into defensive berms. And they have begun building military bases and transforming seized buildings for other military purposes.Even as Biden administration officials insisted this week that they are close to securing a deal between Israel and Hamas, officials also quietly acknowledged that Netanyahu has continued to put demands on the table.After meeting with the prime minister Thursday, Vice President Harris, who is set to replace President Biden atop the Democratic presidential ticket, urged the warring parties to “get the deal done” so that negotiators can move on to subsequent parts of the peace plan and “we can get a cease-fire to end the war.”Netanyahu’s national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who along with Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, opposes a cease-fire deal and has called for building Jewish settlements in Gaza, responded to Harris on social media. “There will be no truce,” he proclaimed.Observers say Netanyahu’s political survival depends on both men.The split screen between the administration’s projected optimism about an agreement and the reality in Gaza has both frustrated and baffled some Washington analysts.In recent months, as the Israeli government has defied Biden in Gaza, and as Smotrich and far-right allies have accelerated Israeli settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank, administration officials have alluded to a willingness by Israel’s Arab neighbors to play a role in Gaza’s future governance and security. Some have suggested that a revitalized Palestinian Authority — the weak, corrupt and deeply unpopular governing apparatus in the West Bank — might even run Gaza.“With a deal, a rebuilding of Gaza will begin [with] Arab nations and the international community, along with Palestinian and Israeli leaders, to get it done in a manner that does not allow Hamas to rearm,” Biden said in the May address, when he laid out his three-phase peace plan.“This question of what comes next, what comes after this conflict, is one that we have discussed extensively with our Arab partners, with the Palestinians, with the Israeli government over the course of the last four or five months,” Barbara Leaf, the assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs told lawmakers in June. Leaf acknowledged that the Palestinian Authority was facing a “severe financial crisis” because Israel controls its revenue flow and had largely restricted it since Oct. 7.“The Arab world is horrified by what’s going on,” Yousef Munayyer, an expert on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the Arab Center Washington DC, a think tank, said in a recent interview casting doubt on the path advocated by the president. “The idea that they’re going to somehow flip a switch and think that there’s going to be some sort of transformational deal — I don’t know what planet you’re looking at this from.”Loveluck reported from Jerusalem."
WaPo_52,A trinity of greatness will splash into the Paris women’s 400 freestyle,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/27/ariarne-titmus-summer-mcintosh-katie-ledecky-paris-olympics/,2024-07-27 18:00:02.669076,,"NANTERRE, France — A few minutes before 9 p.m. Paris time Saturday at La Défense Arena, across the surface of the 50-meter-long competition pool constructed atop a rugby field, there will come a mighty surge of chlorinated water, almost certainly emanating from the center three lanes, as the leaders of the women’s 400-meter freestyle final of the 2024 Paris Olympics thrash toward the final wall.If all goes according to form, the names of those three swimmers — the United States’ Katie Ledecky, Canada’s Summer McIntosh, Australia’s Ariarne Titmus, in one order or another — will have been all but preordained. All three have held the world record in the 400 freestyle within the past 27 months, and all still hold at least one world record in additional events. All three can make a case as the dominant female swimmer in the world at this moment.But what transpires over those eight furious lengths of the pool — as well as the athletes’ ability to summon their optimum performances at the optimum time — will determine whether this 400 freestyle, the most anticipated event of the opening night of the nine-day swim meet, fulfills its race-of-the-century billing or becomes just another overcooked bit of wishful hype.“My guess is it will take a world record to win that race,” said Anthony Nesty, men’s coach for the United States and Ledecky’s coach with Gator Swim Club in Gainesville, Fla.If so, that makes the target time something below 3 minutes 55.38 seconds, Titmus’s current mark from the 2023 world championships.The three protagonists have different temperaments, swimming styles and even specialties.Ledecky, 27, is a four-time Olympian, a seven-time Olympic gold medalist and the greatest distance freestyler in history, as evidenced by the world records she still holds at 800 and 1,500 meters. Her baseline personality, she likes to say, is “quiet and happy.” She plays the piano, loves Bruce Springsteen and, as of last month, can call herself a published author.McIntosh, at 17 already a two-time Olympian, is a versatile phenom best known for her individual medley prowess; she holds the world record in the 400 individual medley. She is a bubbly teenager whose mother was a 1984 Olympic swimmer and whose sister is on the Canadian national team as a figure skater. She loves TikTok, shopping malls and Drake.Titmus, 23, is a middle-distance freestyle legend, the world record holder at 200 and 400 meters and the answer to the question: Who handed Ledecky the first individual defeat in her international career? Titmus is graceful and composed, in contrast to her almost-as-famous coach, Dean Boxall, who gained notoriety during the Tokyo Games for his maniacal, fist-pumping, hips-thrusting celebrations of Titmus’s victories.“I have a lot more experience now,’’ Titmus told reporters in Brisbane last month. “ … But at the same time, there’s a lot more eyes on me. People outside of swimming are expecting me to win now, which is a whole different thing to manage, but I think I’m pretty good at letting that go.”Outside of the pool, they profess their undying respect for each other. Titmus, drawn to the sport in part by watching Ledecky win four gold medals at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games when she was a teenager in Tasmania, credits Ledecky with recalibrating what is humanly possible in the longer freestyle races. McIntosh grew up in Toronto with a poster of Ledecky on the wall, along with a quote attributed to her: “Every race is a sprint. Some are just longer than others.”“I hope that I’m part of the reason why [the event] is so competitive now,” Ledecky said. “I hope I’ve opened peoples’ eyes in terms of how you can swim certain races, what times are possible. … I know I have to be really fast in that event to compete for gold, or even to win a medal.”The pace of human advancement in the 400 freestyle in recent years has been breathtaking. As recently as 10 years ago, no female swimmer in history had been under 3:59, but then Ledecky, 17 at the time, did it twice in a two-week span in August 2014, going 3:58.86 and 3:58.37. For Rio in 2016, Ledecky had the audacious goal of getting into the 3:56s.“At that point, we didn’t even have to talk about winning it,” she recalled of her conversations with her coach at the time, Bruce Gemmell, “because there was no way at that point that anyone else in the world was setting that as a goal.”Between 1992 and 2012, a span of six Olympic races, the margin of victory in the women’s 400 averaged 0.52 seconds, but in 2016, Ledecky finished in 3:56.46 to take the gold by a staggering 4.77 seconds. Five years later at the Tokyo Games (following the one-year postponement because of the pandemic), Titmus (3:56.69) tracked down Ledecky (3:57.36) in the final 50 meters to claim the gold. McIntosh, 14 at the time, faded at the end and finished fourth.The trio have spent the past two-plus years passing the world record around like a hot potato. Ledecky’s record from Rio, her third time lowering the world standard, stood for nearly six years, until Titmus (3:56.40) took it down at the 2022 Australian championships. The following year, McIntosh (3:56.08) took it from Titmus at the Canadian trials ahead of the world championships, but then Titmus (3:55.38) reclaimed it at those world championships in Fukuoka, Japan, a nearly 3.5-second win over Ledecky.“It’s more satisfying in my races that to win, I have to beat the greatest … that if I do win, it’s in the toughest field in the world,” said Titmus, who following those worlds underwent surgery to remove benign tumors from an ovary, which had been discovered by chance during an MRI exam on a sore hip.The race is far from a three-swimmer showdown. Anything could still happen, including an unforeseen calamity that might prevent one of the vaunted triumvirate from advancing out of the preliminary heats Saturday morning. Among potential spoilers in the field, New Zealand’s Erika Fairweather is one of only five women in history to go under four minutes, and China’s Li Bingjie outpaced McIntosh for the bronze medal in Tokyo.Recent results would suggest a Titmus-McIntosh-Ledecky finish, in that precise order. Titmus owns the only two sub-3:56 performances in history, both coming within the past year. At 17, McIntosh is the second-fastest performer ever and still getting better.Ledecky, meanwhilee, hasn’t been under 3:57 since Rio, though she threatened that threshold with her 3:57.36 in Tokyo. At 27, time is no longer on her side. But Nesty, her coach, cautions anyone who might be inclined to count her out. He believes she still has a personal best, if not a world record, within her.“I see it in practice all the time,” Nesty said. “I’m not a big believer in [the notion that] when you get older you can’t do the things you could when you were younger. Personally, I think she’s due for a great 400. Because over the last two years, they’ve been good but not at a level she wants to compete at. I think she’s well overdue for putting one together.”"
WaPo_53,Usha Vance told friends Trump appalled her. Now she’s working to elect him.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/27/usha-vance-trump-jan6/,2024-07-27 18:00:02.669076,,"During her rise through America’s most prestigious schools, law firms and judicial clerkships, Usha Vance rarely — if ever — volunteered her opinions on the nation’s bitterly partisan politics to friends and colleagues.But she did express revulsion at former president Donald Trump’s actions on Jan. 6, 2021.Vance told friends she was outraged by Trump’s incitement of the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol and lamented the social breakdown that fueled his political support, according to one friend, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations. Her view at the time contrasts with the later pronouncements of her husband and Trump’s newly minted running mate, JD Vance, who has downplayed the storming of the Capitol and called participants who were jailed “political prisoners.”“Usha found the incursion on the Capitol and Trump’s role in it to be deeply disturbing,” the friend recalled. “She was generally appalled by Trump, from the moment of his first election.”Speaking the morning after Usha Vance introduced her husband at the Republican National Convention and watched his speech from the same VIP box as Trump, the friend added, “It was surreal to see her sitting next to him last night.”That sensation is widely shared among her friends, former co-workers and fellow alumni, more than two dozen of whom spoke to The Washington Post for this story. Some watched in disbelief on July 17 when Usha Vance, 38, addressed an overwhelmingly White crowd on the convention floor that tittered uneasily as she joked about her husband learning to cook Indian food and audibly gasped when she mentioned her vegetarian diet.A spokesperson for JD Vance declined to comment for this story or to say whether Usha Vance voted for Trump in 2020 and 2016. The spokesperson did not dispute the friend’s description of Usha’s opinions about Trump and Jan. 6. When the riot occurred, Usha Vance was working as a lawyer and her husband was several months away from launching his Senate campaign.Jai Chabria, a Republican strategist for JD Vance’s 2022 Senate campaign and a family friend, said Usha’s views of the former president have changed, mirroring the evolution of her husband, once a fierce Trump critic.“Usha has had a similar shift in views and fully supports Donald Trump and her husband and will do whatever she can to ensure their victory this November,” Chabria said in a statement provided by the Vance spokesperson. A Trump campaign spokeswoman did not comment for this story.In many ways, Usha Chilukuri Vance — born to prosperous Indian Hindu immigrants, raised in Southern California and employed, until she quit last week, at a San Francisco law firm known for its self-consciously progressive office culture — appears to represent the sort of cultural and economic elite whom Republicans often rail against. A self-described “Order Muppet” remembered for her circumspect manner and almost fanatically detailed scheduling habits, she is very different, temperamentally, from the freewheeling former president and his incendiary MAGA movement.Though she worked for prominent conservative judges and voted in the 2022 Republican primary in Ohio when her husband was on the ballot, she has registered to vote as a Democrat at least twice, records show: as a teenager in San Diego in 2004 and as a law student in New Haven, Conn., in 2010. In the fall of 2014 she registered to vote in D.C. without a party affiliation, according to elections officials.But the forces that propelled her to the convention have long been evident, those who know her say: extraordinary ambition and deep devotion to her husband.That ambition was contagious. JD Vance has long credited his wife as a catalyst in the evolution that led him from a troubled childhood in an Ohio steel town to the summits of finance, media and politics, calling her his “spirit guide” through the ruthlessly competitive landscape that awaited him at Yale. Her motivations and influence are key to understanding the vice-presidential nominee, who has said he “really benefits from having a sort of powerful female voice” guiding his decisions.“She unequivocally increased his odds of success,” said Dan Driscoll, a friend who attended Yale Law School with the couple.In JD’s early years with Usha, Driscoll said, “if you had … said, ‘You’re going to end up on your school board and go to your kid’s Little League games and own a small manufacturing business that employs people in your community,’ I think he would have defined that as success.”Instead, picked at age 39 to be Trump’s running mate on the GOP presidential ticket, JD Vance has been anointed as the heir apparent to the leader of a movement that has transformed American politics. Vance, who greeted a raucously cheering crowd on the convention stage with an earsplitting grin, is clearly reveling in his new heights of success.That success is also drawing new scrutiny to his much more private wife, the potential second lady, Usha Vance.Vance’s parents immigrated to the United States from southern India, settling in San Diego in the 1980s. Her father came from a family of prominent academics, a relative told the Indian Express, saying of Usha: “I always knew that she would excel academically and in any profession she chooses. You see, it runs in the family. Her great grandfather, her grandfather, her father — are all toppers. She follows in their footsteps.”Her father is an engineer and her mother a microbiologist. Both are academics: Vance’s mother is a provost at the University of California at San Diego, and her father lectures at San Diego State University.“I did grow up in a religious household, my parents are Hindu, and that was one of the things that made them such good parents, that make them really very good people,” she said in a recent Fox News interview.Vance attended public high school; graduated in 2007 from Yale College, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa; and embarked on a prestigious teaching fellowship in China. She taught English and American studies at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, according to a Yale announcement that described her as having “devoted much of her time at Yale to public education, volunteering in local elementary schools and as a Girl Scouts troop leader.”Peter Hamilton, another Yale graduate who participated in the program, recalled his surprise when he walked into Vance’s bedroom and saw the walls were covered in hundreds of color-coded Post-it notes that organized her week into 15- or 30-minute intervals.“It was kind of intense,” said Hamilton, now an assistant professor in world history at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. “It really stuck with me. … I always thought of Usha as quite serious and highly intelligent, in a well-plotted-out kind of way.”Vance ended her two-year fellowship in China after only one year, according to Hamilton, enrolling in Cambridge University and earning a master’s degree for her research on “the methods used for protecting printing rights in seventeenth-century England,” according to the esteemed Gates Cambridge scholarship program.Next up: Yale Law School, where she impressed classmates by the sharpness of her intellect but left many guessing about her core political convictions. She did not join any ideological groups such as the conservative Federalist Society or liberal American Constitution Society, according her LinkedIn page and former law firm’s biography.“People respected her intelligence,” said Doug Lieb, who was editor in chief of the Yale Law Journal while Usha worked on the review’s managing board. “She was not the sort of person who was trying to provoke controversy. I think she has a technical brain. If she thought you were technically wrong about something, she would point that out.”Like Hamilton, Lieb still vividly recalls her organizational methods.“Her notes were always, like, tabbed and highlighted and very meticulous and categorized,” said Lieb, who is now a civil rights attorney in New York and attended the Vances’ wedding.Vance appeared to poke fun at her own tendencies in a 2012 Facebook post, sharing a link to an article in the online magazine Slate — “What kind of Muppet are you, chaos or order?” — and writing, “I don’t think there’s any doubt that I am an Order Muppet.” (Screenshots of Vance’s Facebook page, which is not publicly accessible, were shared with The Post.)In an environment teeming with overachievers, Vance stood out not only for her “seemingly superhuman capacity to achieve” but as “a kind, unassuming friend who had no trouble bridging seemingly disparate social groups,” said James Eimers, a law school classmate who now works at a consulting firm that advises applicants to college and graduate school.JD and Usha met and started dating in their first year at Yale Law School. They earned the moniker “Judusha,” a melding of their names that came to imply “awe and reverence that they were intimidating as a power couple,” said Josh McLaurin, JD’s former roommate, now a Democratic state senator from Georgia who has been outspoken in his criticism of the vice-presidential nominee’s politics.The legacy of Yale Law’s most famous power couple — Hillary and Bill Clinton — still loomed over the campus, with many students bent on mimicking what one graduate called the “Clinton template”: several years spent burnishing elite credentials before returning to a (preferably Southern or Midwestern) home state to launch a political career.It was a path some predicted the Vances might follow, and one that Usha seemed to invoke with admiration in a Facebook post in August 2012, the summer before their final year in law school.“Driving through Arkansas, listening to Bill Clinton tell us about his life. Best road trip ever,” she wrote.The post was written near Chester, a tiny town in northwestern Arkansas. She tagged a companion who accompanied her: JD Vance.Usha and JD married in Kentucky in 2014 — and were separately blessed in a Hindu ceremony. Around the same time, she embarked on a series of highly competitive clerkships for Republican-appointed judges, including U.S. District Judge Amul Thapar in Eastern Kentucky, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. of the Supreme Court.Records from the D.C. Board of Elections show that in 2015, while clerking for Kavanaugh, Vance switched her voter registration from no party to Democratic. But on Friday, the elections office told The Post that the switch to a Democratic affiliation had been a clerical error.Between and after her stints clerking, she was a litigator at Munger, Tolles & Olson, which has represented corporate  behemoths such as Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and the Walt Disney Co. The San Francisco law firm’s workplace culture  makes it “a top contender in the cool, woke category” of large legal offices, according to a January 2019 article in the American Lawyer. On its website the firm touts its “Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee” and its welcoming attitude toward “intersex, transgender, non-binary, and gender nonconforming people.”When Vance began working at Munger Tolles, her husband was still years away from lashing out against “woke DEI” corporations and “far-left gender ideology.” With the 2016 publication of his memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy,” he instead emerged as a thoughtful, center-right commentator on the White working class with one foot in Middletown, Ohio, and the other in Silicon Valley, where he worked with conservative venture capitalist Peter Thiel.Vance supported her husband as he expressed this iteration of his politics, sometimes sharing links on Facebook to his commentary in publications such as the Atlantic, where in 2016 he likened Trump to “cultural heroin. He makes some feel better for a bit. But he cannot fix what ails them, and one day they’ll realize it.”In her post about that article, Vance noted her husband’s “firm stand against Trump.”The Vances have raised their three children, born between 2017 and 2021, in deep-blue enclaves. In 2018 they bought a $1.4 million home in the East Walnut Hills neighborhood of Cincinnati, and when in the D.C. area, they live in a $1.6 million house in Del Ray, a sought-after neighborhood in Alexandria, Va.In July 2021, JD Vance announced that he was running for the Senate in Ohio. His victories in the Republican primary and general election were widely credited to Trump’s endorsement and Thiel’s financial backing. Usha was not a fixture on the campaign trail, although she did star in an ad, calling him “an incredible father” and “my best friend.”“She doesn’t crave the political spotlight, but she was very much a part of the campaign,” said Chabria, the GOP strategist who worked on the 2022 race.Vance voted in her husband’s Republican primary that year, records show. (Ohio voters do not register by party, and can vote in either the Democratic or Republican primary contests.) During the same election cycle, she donated to Blake Masters, a far-right Republican — funded, like her husband, by Thiel — who lost a Senate race in Arizona.After moving to Ohio, Usha Vance joined the board of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. During her husband’s brief tenure in the Senate, she continued to work as a litigator, resigning from Munger, Tolles & Olson on the day JD Vance was announced as Trump’s vice-presidential pick.Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval, a Democrat and the first Indian American to lead the predominantly Democratic city of just over 300,000, said he has never run into JD or Usha Vance at any social functions or community events.“I’ve never met her,” Pureval said, adding that while he strongly opposes the Republican ticket, “I wish her only the best.”Last week, Usha Vance moved from relative obscurity into the spotlight at a packed convention hall in Milwaukee. Ohio state Sen. Niraj Antani, an Indian American Republican and Hindu, said he was thrilled to see her onstage.“Having an Indian American potentially as the second lady is inspiring to so many,” he said. “I’ve received countless calls, texts and emails from our community wanting to meet and support JD and Usha.”Other Trump supporters were less enthused. An outpouring of racist bile directed against Usha Vance from the far right has erupted online. Nick Fuentes, a white supremacist and antisemite who visited the former president at his Mar-a-Lago resort in 2022, questioned the wisdom of having JD Vance on the ticket, asking, “What kind of values does a man have to marry somebody that far outside your race, who isn’t even a Christian?”Her appearance also generated confusion, for very different reasons, on the other side of the political spectrum. Some friends and colleagues said they have struggled to reconcile their affection for Usha Vance with the hard-right turn of her husband’s politics.Among other things, JD Vance has denigrated those crossing the border illegally from Mexico, pushed legislation that would criminalize gender transition procedures for minors, and said he would have acquiesced to Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election — as then-Vice President Mike Pence did not — by certifying fraudulent slates of electors.“Am I surprised to see Usha speaking onstage at a major political convention? No. She’s brilliant,” said Chad Callaghan, a Los Angeles-based writer and marketing director who said he was friendly with her in college. “Am I surprised to see her there to support a man who seems to be building political power by punching down at trans folks and immigrants? Yeah, that part caught me off guard.”In her speech introducing JD, which lasted less than five minutes, Usha Vance herself offered no clues to how she was processing the moment. At a convention suffused with fervor for its presidential nominee, she did not once mention Trump.But she did acknowledge in passing what so many who know her said they felt as they watched her onstage: amazement.“It’s safe to say that neither JD nor I expected to find ourselves in this position,” she said. “But it’s hard to imagine a more powerful example of the American Dream. A boy from Middletown, Ohio —”At that point Vance was forced to take a lengthy pause, looking from side to side as her voice was drowned out by raucous cries from the crowd. They were chanting her husband’s name.Aaron Schaffer and Alice Crites contributed to this report."

WaPo_56,Is stress causing my eyelid to twitch?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/07/27/eyelid-twitch-blepharospasm/,2024-07-27 20:03:02.900499,,"Is it true that stress can cause your eyelid to twitch?Many people have experienced it — that twitch that causes an eyelid to wiggle for several seconds. Twitches of the eyelid muscles may feel weird but are typically harmless and have been associated with stress, lack of sleep and caffeine use, among other culprits.The exact mechanism that causes the twitch is not completely understood, but it occurs randomly and usually resolves within seconds, ophthalmologists said.The eyelid muscle responsible for opening and closing the eyelid, the orbicularis oculi, “is the fastest-working muscle in the human body, so when it goes into a spasm, it goes into a spasm,” said Stephanie Marioneaux, an ophthalmologist and a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. The muscle can close an eyelid in less than 100 milliseconds and reopen it in about 200 milliseconds.In rare cases, eyelid spasms may be debilitating and require treatment. A blepharospasm causes one or both eyes to close involuntarily. Although benign, blepharospasms can become chronic and, over time, increase in frequency, making it difficult to perform daily tasks.With hemifacial spasms, a neuromuscular disorder, an eyelid spasm progresses to incorporate the brow and muscles in the lower face, often pulling the mouth to one side.Eyelid spasms differ from eyeball spasms, ophthalmologists said. If it appears that the world is moving with each spasm, consult an ophthalmologist or neurologist.A simple eye twitch does not require treatment. If the twitches persist or start to involve other muscles in the face, consult an ophthalmologist.Blepharospasms and hemifacial spasms can be treated with regular injections of botulinum toxin. Also known by the brand name Botox, the medication produced from the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, temporarily blocks nerves thereby weakening or paralyzing certain muscles.In severe cases of blepharospasms that do not respond to the injections or for people who are afraid of needles, deep brain stimulation implantation may be considered, said Andrew Carey, associate professor of ophthalmology and neurology at Johns Hopkins University.Microvascular decompression surgery may be considered in some cases for hemifacial spasms to relieve pressure on the facial nerve causing the spasms, but surgical options are invasive and can carry certain risks, ophthalmologists said.Eyelid twitches are typically harmless. But if the twitch bothers you, try to reduce stress, get enough sleep and lower caffeine intake, medical professionals said."
WaPo_57,"Years after his dad drowned, this Commanders starter is teaching kids to swim",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/27/cornelius-lucas-swim-commanders/,2024-07-27 20:00:02.900499,,"Cornelius Lucas III remembers everything about the day his father drowned on a family camping trip outside their home in New Orleans.“We had a little campfire going. … I was running around. I was in and out the water, but I didn't really go deep. My dad had went in the water deep a couple times, and I feel like this was his second or third time, maybe third or fourth time going back in the water.“He literally asked me, ‘You want to come with me?’ I was like, ‘Nah, I’m just gonna stick back here and throw the football around.’ And I just remember seeing him walk out — as a kid, everything seemed bigger — but maybe like 40, 50 yards deep into the water. And then he — I saw his hands waving at me, and he just dipped underwater.”People rushed out to help, but when they got there, they couldn’t find his father. He had been dragged under by a rip tide.“Forty-five minutes later, he floated back,” Lucas said.“At the age of seven, I was out of having a dad, out of having my best bud, my best friend, my greatest — my best teacher, you know what I’m saying? Like, the guy that was put in this world to give me all the game that I’ve been searching for since then.”Twenty-six years later, Lucas is a man, 6-foot-8, 327 pounds, a professional hitter with a goofball grin and the self-confidence he lacked growing up without his dad. Lucas believes his unlikely journey has led him to this moment with the Washington Commanders, where, entering the 11th season of his improbable NFL career, the longtime backup is competing for the huge role of starting left tackle and blindside protector for new franchise quarterback Jayden Daniels.Lucas, 33, feels he’s doing well early in the competition with rookie Brandon Coleman, and unlike his first shot at being a full-time starter (his second season, with Detroit), he feels ready.Many players who go undrafted out of college, as Lucas did out of Kansas State in 2014, get chewed up by the NFL. Their moment is darkened by the ever-present possibility of getting fired, and they’re often forced out of the league against their will, broken or brokenhearted. In his fifth year, Lucas was overwhelmed by repeated rejection and tried to quit by ignoring calls from his agent.It was in those difficult moments Lucas felt his father’s absence most.“Outside of my coaches and my teammates to push me and tell me I could do this, I haven’t had someone I could call on and just tell them how I’m feeling, what’s going on,” he said.“It’s really been a me situation. Like, me figuring it out. Me going home and sitting in silence for two hours because I got beat in practice, and I’m thinking about why I got beat and how I can’t get beat no more because I’m on the edge of getting cut, and you know — I’m saying it’s been stressful. ”As he honed his skills, Lucas has grown mentally tough, observing people around him, looking for “life tidbits” and refining who he wants to be. In 2018, everything came together. Lucas caught a break, played well in one game for his hometown New Orleans Saints and parlayed it into a job with Chicago, where he shined. In 2020, he signed a two-year deal with the Commanders, and in 2022, he signed another. Last summer, he felt like he finally “filled myself up enough to pour into others.”And he had an idea how: Swim camp. Every summer, NFL players host youth football camps across the country, and while he saw the value in them, he wanted to do something more personal. He attended pool parties growing up, even after his father’s death, but he still had never gone in a pool deeper than his height.So he partnered with Son of a Saint, a nonprofit organization for fatherless boys in New Orleans, and figured he could show boys like him how to be a man and teach them a potentially lifesaving skill.“I live in New Orleans, Louisiana,” Lucas said. “We are currently seven feet under sea level. In New Orleans, we get flooding. Hurricane Katrina, it was flooding for 45 days.”This year, at his second camp, the only boy scared of the water was too big for anyone but Lucas to hold while learning to doggy paddle. Lucas encouraged him to go into the pool, urging him to fight their fear together.“Trust me,” Lucas said. “I won’t let you drown.”Weeks later, Lucas left New Orleans for training camp extra motivated. His girlfriend — with whom he bonded, in part, over missing a parent — is pregnant with their first child, a son, due in early November. Sometimes, when Lucas notices her belly growing, it makes him want to go outside in the sun and practice.“When he gets here, I just want him to see his daddy doing the right thing.”Lucas wants to teach his son all the lessons he had to gather from others, such as how to mow the lawn or drive on the highway. He’s picking up even more from Instagram and TikTok. He hopes to one day teach his son to play tackle.And he wants to throw his son in the water. He wants him to flail on his own at first, to fight to float, because he believes struggling will help his son get comfortable. Even if he doesn’t like to swim, Lucas’s top priority is for his son to never feel how he sometimes felt around water.“He’s not gonna have a fear of it,” he said."
WaPo_58,"For some District ANC commissioners, a difficult decision to run again",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/27/dc-ancs-elections-vacancies/,2024-07-27 21:29:02.869522,,"At a recent meeting of the Chevy Chase Advisory Neighborhood Commission, the body of elected officials was set to vote on how to oppose the planned use of synthetic turf on a new athletic field.By the time it ended, the meeting devolved into shouting, interruptions and even profanity. Commissioners repeatedly implored attendees, and one another, not to interrupt. Lisa Gore, chair of Advisory Neighborhood Commission 3/4G, voiced her disappointment with an email that had circulated in the community, accusing her of abusing her power and “shutting off the mic on anyone she does not want to hear.”Gore is among the hundreds of Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners (often shortened to “ANC”) across the District. The unpaid role is one of the most important yet accessible positions in local politics, requiring just 25 signatures to make the November ballot. But data from the D.C. Board of Elections shows that as of Friday, 117 out of 345 commissioner seats did not yet have a single interested candidate.Kent Boese, director of D.C.’s Office of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission, which provides oversight and technical assistance to all ANCs, said in an interview that this number should not be a cause for alarm. Some incumbent commissioners may be waiting until closer to the Aug. 7 deadline to pick up petitions and turn in signatures, which can be done in a day, he said. Those who aren’t on the formal ballot can also launch a write-in campaign during the general election, as dozens of ANC candidates did two years ago.But Boese said a “much bigger concern” is a recent spate of commissioner turnover, which erodes the transfer of institutional knowledge. Sixty-three percent of commissioners who won election in 2022 were new to the job, he said — a likely sign of fatigue among incumbents.In interviews, veteran commissioners said that it wasn’t an easy decision to run again for a position that has sometimes made them a target for angry neighbors. Others, describing the role as fulfilling yet thankless, say it can be difficult to perform well as an ANC while also juggling day jobs and familial obligations — renewing discussions about whether District lawmakers should consider more incentives, like a stipend, to fuel interest and more competitive races. A D.C. Council bill that could change that got a hearing last year.Gore, who has twice run unsuccessfully for D.C. Council, said she hesitated before deciding to pick up paperwork this month to run for a third two-year term as an ANC, pointing largely to balancing the job with family commitments.“Some community members are like, ‘Why put yourself through it?’ But at my core, I’m a public servant,” Gore said. “It seems like there’s more hesitancy than in the past. This is the first time we’ve had to scramble to ensure people are comfortable taking the seat.”Legal analyst Michael Zeldin, another two-term commissioner in ANC 3/4G, is done with it.Zeldin, 73, said he found the job largely rewarding, but noted the role has also kept him busy for an average of 20 hours per week on issues that residents care about deeply, from the long-stalled Connecticut Avenue bike lane project to addressing “potholes the size of New Jersey.”“There are moments where you think, ‘Why was I so unlucky to have won?’” Zeldin said. “When things affect people, sometimes those frustrations come to you in a very difficult way. And when I hear about other commissioners who are leaving because of that, I can say, ‘I get it.’”City code instructs many D.C. government agencies to give “great weight” to recommendations and concerns raised by the city’s 46 Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, which represent about 2,000 residents and may contain anywhere from two to 10 commissioners depending on population density.The commissions are tasked with keeping up regular public meetings, managing modest budgets, and frequently draft resolutions to indicate support of or opposition to local zoning decisions, liquor license renewals and more. But these elected officials are also often the eyes, ears and voices of their neighborhoods. And for some, the role is a first foray into local politics; some of the city’s most prominent leaders got their start as a commissioner, including Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D).Tricia Duncan, who chairs the seven-person commission that represents Ward 3 neighborhoods including Foxhall, Kent and the Palisades, said she’s at times been treated harshly by neighbors during her tenure, particularly as the commission facilitated conversations on contentious proposals involving a marijuana dispensary and new school building. “I wasn’t sure if I was going to run again, if I’m being honest,” said Duncan, a well-known community advocate who ran unsuccessfully for the Ward 3 Council seat two years ago.“Seventy percent of the things that people say to me are wonderful. They thank me for keeping an eye on the neighborhood, updating the listserv, and that’s what keeps me in this,” Duncan added. “But I also get shouted down when I go to my farmers market … I’ve had people scream at me that I should be ashamed.”Former Ward 4 commissioner Zach Israel declined to run for a second term in 2022 after the birth of his second child, believing he wouldn’t be able to balance the role while caring for his growing family. But while some parts of the job were frustrating, Israel said he found even the tedious bits to be rewarding.While no longer an elected commissioner, Israel still uses his social media to break news to residents and keep tabs on ANC vacancies, reminding anyone who will listen to pick up a petition. He is a proponent of legislation introduced by council member Christina Henderson (I-At Large) and backed by a majority of lawmakers that would stand up a task force to make recommendations on compensation for D.C.'s many elected officials, boards and commissions.The legislation notes that there are nearly two dozen city boards and commissions whose members receive pay for their work.“A lot is asked of ANC commissioners, and the mayor and ward-level council members often refer their constituents to their ANC,” Israel said. “There needs to be some level of monetary compensation for people engaged in these public services.”Boese, the head of D.C.’s Office of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission who served as an ANC for 12 years, said that while he is confident that more residents will pick up petitions to access the ballot in the next couple weeks, he remains focused on how best to support the city’s high number of rookie commissioners.“The other thing that played a big role in turnover last term, it was not easy to serve during the pandemic — it was exhausting, to be frank,” he said. “And for those who chose to continue, there may be a lingering effect as well.”Many commissioners don’t find their stride until the closing months of their first term, Boese said. To support the newbies, Boese’s office offers a boot camp and trainings throughout the year. And after early challenges during the pandemic, virtual and hybrid meetings are a mainstay. His office is now better equipped to provide technical support.Until the council takes up the issue of pay, Boese’s office is also pushing for ways to make notoriously complex commissioner roles, like treasurer, more accessible to residents. Until recently, he said as an example, ANCs could only make payments through checks and debit cards; but a change to the law his office pushed for creates more flexibility for electronic payments.“We need checks and balances still, but we need paths for guidance so commissions aren’t hamstrung trying to do the basics,” Boese said. “It’s not sexy stuff, but sometimes the problem is in the details.”Across the Anacostia River, the Rev. Wendy Hamilton, chair of ANC 8D, hopes more of her neighbors will show interest in joining her. Her ANC has two vacancies, and while some incumbents have shown interest in returning, none except Hamilton have picked up a petition to run.She expects the seats will be filled — but recently spoke to one incumbent co-commissioner who made it clear they didn’t have the energy for a second term.“They told me, ‘People don’t understand that we don’t get paid to do this,’” Hamilton said. “And they’re right. We don’t get paid, not only for the work we endeavor to take on, but even for some of the not-so-friendly, borderline abusive behaviors that we get subjected to.”Whenever she does have negative encounter with a resident, Hamilton — who has run unsuccessfully to become D.C.’s nonvoting delegate to Congress — said she draws upon her background in ministry.“I try to just let people be heard,” Hamilton said. “A lot of times, they just want to be validated.”"
WaPo_59,Blinken warns China’s top diplomat that Harris cares about rules-based order,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/07/27/blinken-china-wang-harris-vp/,2024-07-27 21:26:02.869522,,"VIENTIANE, Laos — In a sign of the political tumult back home in Washington, Secretary of State Antony Blinken delivered a message on Saturday to his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, that Vice President Harris, and not just President Biden, is committed to the rules-based international order, a senior State Department official said.The two chief diplomats met for more than an hour on the sidelines of a conference of foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which was being held this year in the Laotian capital. It was their sixth meeting since resuming relations in June last year after a tense hiatus in which most high-level contacts between Washington and Beijing were put on hold.Blinken “noted that both the president and the vice president believe that stability in the relationship is important, and that both also believe it's important to uphold the rules-based order,” the senior State Department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to speak frankly about the closed-door conversations.Blinken’s effort to speak on behalf of Harris, and not just the president, was a sign that the administration is taking steps to convey political continuity to U.S. rivals after Biden’s surprise decision to abandon his reelection effort on Sunday. The top U.S. diplomat typically speaks on behalf of the president and doesn’t single out the views of the vice president during international conversations, although it is not the first time he has mentioned Harris with Chinese officials, the State Department official said.Harris has emerged as the presumptive Democratic nominee in the past week after Biden dropped out of the race.“Obviously, there's a little bit different context now than there has been in the past,” the official said. Blinken has “noted that the vice president met with [Chinese] President Xi [Jinping] in Bangkok in 2022, so he has mentioned her before, but obviously there's a different context now, because the circumstances are different than they were looking during previous meetings.”In their conversation, Blinken ran through the litany of U.S. frustrations in its dealings with China, but the State Department official gave no indication that substantive progress had been made on any of the key topics. Chinese companies continue to supply key components to the Russian military industry. Blinken warned Wang against impeding the Philippines’ ability to resupply its ships and outposts in the South China Sea, which China claims as its own. And he warned Wang against threatening Taiwan.“The secretary made clear that the United States, together with our allies and partners, will advance our vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific. He emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,” State Department spokesman Matt Miller said in a statement.Harris has made three trips to Asia as vice president, working to build relations with regional leaders in an effort to counterbalance China’s efforts to push against nearby countries and claim preeminence over its near neighborhood. Her allies say that Harris, a former prosecutor, is especially incensed by global rule-breaking and that she would continue Biden’s policy of a firm approach toward authoritarian nations that are trying to overturn the post-World War II system of international laws and governance."

Malone, usually a steady competitor, has helped lead the U.S. team’s push for medals after not winning any at the Tokyo Games in 2021, but his mistakes Saturday doomed his chances of finishing on the podium in multiple finals.Malone fell on pommel horse in the opening rotation and struggled on high bar, his signature event, putting a spot in the all-around final out of reach. The top 24 athletes qualify for the final, but no more than two per country advance. Americans Frederick Richard (83.498) and Paul Juda (82.865) finished well ahead of Malone and will officially clinch their spots in the final once the other sessions of qualifying are complete.Malone and Richard traded the top two positions on the all-around podium at nationals and the Olympic trials — Malone ahead of Richard at nationals, then the opposite at the trials. Those two gymnasts were expected to be the Americans in the all-around final here, but Juda had performed well and was in contention even before Malone fell twice on high bar. Malone, who also fell on floor in the final rotation, called his errors “silly mistakes.”“What happened here today is done and over,” Malone said. “There’s nothing I can do about it now. Just do the best I can to be ready for team finals.”Malone, the lone returning Olympian on this team, finished with a 79.598, far off the 86.350 he earned at nationals. After Saturday’s competition, he apologized to his teammates, according to Juda, who added: “He’s the captain of this ship. He’s going to right us for the next couple of days.”The American men had a breakthrough showing at world championships last fall, winning bronze in the team competition, along with three individual medals. They have a chance to replicate that performance on a bigger stage here.But Britain tallied a team score Saturday more than three points higher than the United States, and Japan and China are expected to top the field, leaving the Americans in fourth place or worse. Scores do not carry over, so Malone and the U.S. team have a chance to rebound.In the qualifying round, teams drop one score per apparatus, so Malone’s low marks did not factor into its score of 253.229. But the Americans typically rely on his performances to be among the best on the team. In the first session, the Americans were outshone by the British men, who had the best team score (256.561) and the top all-arounders in Jake Jarman and Joe Fraser.Malone, the high bar world champion in 2022, also lost his chance to contend for a medal on his best event. His low score on that apparatus (12.233) will be well short of the mark needed to advance. Now his best — and perhaps only — chance of winning a medal here will be in the team final, where the Americans badly need him to perform better."
WaPo_62,4 hottest days ever observed raise fears of a planet nearing ‘tipping points’,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/07/27/hottest-days-ever-recorded-climate-change/,2024-07-27 21:17:02.869522,,"As global temperatures spiked to their highest levels in recorded history on Monday, ambulances were screaming through the streets of Tokyo, carrying scores of people who’d collapsed amid an unrelenting heat wave. A monster typhoon was emerging from the scorching waters of the Pacific Ocean, which were several degrees warmer than normal. Thousands of vacationers fled the idyllic mountain town of Jasper, Canada ahead of a fast-moving wall of wildfire flames.By the end of the week — which saw the four hottest days ever observed by scientists — dozens had been killed in the raging floodwaters and massive mudslides triggered by Typhoon Gaemi. Half of Jasper was reduced to ash. And some 3.6 billion people around the planet had endured temperatures that would have been exceedingly rare in a world without burning fossil fuels and other human activities, according to an analysis by scientists at the group Climate Central.These extraordinary global temperatures marked the culmination of an unprecedented global hot streak that has stunned even researchers who spent their whole careers studying climate change.Since last July, Earth’s average temperature has consistently exceeded 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels — a short-term breach of a threshold that scientists say cannot be crossed if the world hopes to avoid the worst consequences of planetary warming.This “taste” of a 1.5 degree world showed how the natural systems that humans depend on could buckle amid soaring temperatures, said Johan Rockström, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. Forests showed less ability to pull carbon out of the atmosphere. Sea ice around Antarctica dwindled to near record lows. Coral bleaching became so extreme scientists had to change their scale for measuring it.Even as scientists forecast an end to the current record-breaking stretch, they warn it may prove difficult for parts of the planet to recover from the heat of the past year.“The extreme events that we are now experiencing are indications of the weakening resilience of these systems,” Rockström said. “We cannot risk pushing this any further.""This week’s broken records come on the heels of 13 straight months of unprecedented temperatures — fueled in part by the planet’s shift into an El Niño climate pattern, which tends to warm the oceans, as well as pollution from burning coal, oil and gas.The warming neared its apex on Sunday, when data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service, the European climate monitor, showed the global average temperature edging out a record set a little over a year earlier.But the new benchmark only stood for 24 hours, with Monday hitting a historic 17.16 degrees Celsius (62.89 degrees Fahrenheit). Tuesday was the second hottest on record, and Wednesday tied Sunday as the third warmest.Though these numbers may not seem extreme, they are the average of thousands of data points taken from the Arctic to the South Pole, in places that are experiencing winter as well as those in the midst of summer. The preliminary data was generated using a sophisticated type of analysis that combines global weather observations with a state of the art climate model — a method that outside researchers said Copernicus’s is highly reliable.The world’s oceans are also awash in historic heat. Copernicus data shows that the waters around Taiwan are 2 to 3 degrees Celsius (3.6 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than normal, helping to fuel Typhoon Gaemi’s devastation. Research shows that higher ocean temperatures give more power to tropical cyclones, while a warmer atmosphere can hold more water — and thus produce more rain.Meanwhile, nearly 2,000 weather stations around the planet notched new daily high temperature records over the last seven days, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information.Although scientists have not yet quantified the role of warming in all of this year’s extreme events, there is abundant evidence that heat waves, storms and fires are made more frequent and intense because of climate change.“We are running out of metaphors” to describe the unrelenting pace and scale at which the world is now breaking records, Copernicus director Carlo Buontempo said.Sometimes, he said, he feels like the planet’s temperature is a helium balloon drifting inevitably upward. All he can do is stand below and say “look, it is higher.”Scientists have estimated Earth’s average temperature based on observations dating back to 1850, and now measure it by pulling data from more than 20,000 land-based stations as well as readings from ships and buoys around the globe,To convey the severity of Earth’s current heat, other researchers have turned to the planet’s past. By studying tree rings, lake sediments and other records of the ancient climate, paleoclimate researchers have determined that the world is likely now warmer than it has been in more than 100,000 years, since before the start of the last ice age.Humanity now faces conditions unlike anything our species has known before. According to a Climate Central analysis of the five-day period ending Friday, nearly half of the planet experienced at least one day of “exceptional heat” — temperatures that would have been rare or even impossible in a world without climate change.United Nations Secretary General António Guterres on Thursday called for improved warning systems, stronger worker protections and other policies to protect people from these scorching temperatures.“Extreme temperatures are no longer a one day, one week or one month phenomenon,” he said at a  news conference.Buontempo expects that Earth’s record-breaking streak may soon end. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration last month declared an official end to the El Niño, reflecting cooling conditions in the tropical Pacific Ocean. The end of summer in the Northern Hemisphere — where most of the world’s land is — also tends to bring down the planet’s overall temperature.Yet the unprecedented amount of heat-trapping carbon in Earth’s atmosphere — which is at its highest level in more than 3 million years — will mean that even without El Niño, the world remains perilously warm. Many researchers project that 2024 will end as the hottest year on record, exceeding the benchmark set in 2023.“The fluctuations we’re seeing are relatively modest on top of a very large, decades-long warming trend,” said climate scientist Kim Cobb, director of the Institute at Brown University for Environment and Society. “We’re dancing about a climate average that is very dangerous for communities and ecosystems around the world.”The worst of this week’s heat was concentrated in Antarctica, where temperatures were as much as 12 degrees Celsius (21.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal.Lynne Talley, a researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California at San Diego, said that anomaly is likely the product of strong winds pushing warm air onto the continent. Those conditions will make it more difficult for the ocean to freeze during what is usually the prime time for sea ice formation.“It seems like global warming is finally catching up with Antarctica, and that’s pretty frightening,” she said.The amount of sea ice around Antarctica is already at its second lowest level on record for this time of year — coming in just behind last July. After losing an unprecedented amount of ice cover during the 2023 melt season, Talley said, the region has been unable to rebound.To Rockström, the decline in Antarctic sea ice is one indication of how the recent global heat may be undermining the planet’s ability to buffer against some of climate change’s worst impacts. Sea ice helps keep the poles cool by reflecting much of the sunlight that hits it back into space. When the ice melts, and the sun’s rays can reach the dark open ocean, their energy is absorbed by the planet.He also pointed to a new analysis that found the wilting and burning forests of the Amazon, Asia and Canada had lost much of their ability to absorb the excess carbon dioxide produced by human activities. The research, which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, focused on data from 2023 — meaning scientists are still unsure whether the finding represents a short-term blip or a more permanent shift.This year, the world’s forests are struggling once again. As of Wednesday, Canadian authorities were battling 310 uncontrolled wildfires, including the blaze that ravaged the town of Jasper. Trees turned to tinder by weeks of extreme heat are fueling a fast-moving fire in Northern California. The Amazon is bracing for a second consecutive year of an extreme drought that studies show is fueled by climate change.Robert Rohde, chief scientist for the climate data nonprofit Berkeley Earth, called these extreme events “suggestive” of what will happen to the planet if global temperatures consistently exceeds 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming — something that researchers project will occur in the early 2030s.Studies indicate that crossing that threshold could trigger irreversible changes in major Earth systems: the collapse of the Greenland ice sheet, complete loss of tropical coral reefs, abrupt thawing of some permafrost.What the world is seeing now, Rockström said, is a “worrying sign of potentially approaching tipping points.”And as long as people continue adding carbon to the atmosphere, Cobb said, disasters will continue to happen and records will continue to fall.“It’s a Russian roulette wheel of climate devastation,” she said. “Whether it’s going to be your community in the line of a hurricane, or your city is going to have a heat wave. The threat is here and it’s now.”"

He had on real underwear, the kind with an elastic band that he hadn’t worn in 34 years, and had thrown out his prison toothbrush. His wife would be waiting with a new one in the parking lot.A judge had finally ruled two days earlier what Dunn had always maintained: He was wrongfully convicted of murder in 1990.But as the Missouri Department of Correction was finalizing his release papers Wednesday, the warden got the call. The state Supreme Court had halted the release order after the state attorney general appealed to keep Dunn in prison.“It was probably the highest high and lowest low I can remember in my life,” said Kira Dunn, who had used saved-up airline miles to fly in from California to see her husband’s release. “We were completely stunned.”“He was literally 50 feet from freedom,” she added.On Monday, St. Louis Circuit Court Judge Jason Sengheiser had ruled Dunn, 52, was wrongfully convicted of the murder of 15-year-old Ricco Rogers and ordered he be released by Wednesday evening.The judge wrote that St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore had proved Dunn’s “actual innocence,” after two witnesses who had identified Dunn as the killer in 1990 later recanted their testimony as adults, saying they had been coerced by police to testify.Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican, argued that the recantations had been coerced and that Dunn was really guilty. Sengheiser rejected his argument, writing in his decision that, “The Attorney General provided zero evidence to support these allegations.”Within hours of that ruling, Bailey filed an appeal. Just before the Wednesday deadline to free Dunn, the state’s top court stopped his release to let the appeal process play out.That court could rule on the case and set Dunn free as soon as next week.In the meantime, he has traded in his civilian clothes for another prison jumpsuit, his wife said.“He had gotten rid of all his property at the prison,” Kira Dunn said. “We’re so hurt and, frankly, don’t understand why the person who’s tasked with defending the well-being of Missourians would do this.”Dunn has maintained his innocence for decades. In 2020, another judge found that a jury would likely find him not guilty based on new evidence but said he couldn’t exonerate Dunn because only those on death row in Missouri were eligible for that ruling.The state then passed a law in 2021 expanding who could seek new hearings, allowing prosecutors to bring possible wrongful-conviction cases to court when new evidence arises.In February of this year, Gore, the St. Louis prosecutor, did just that, filing a motion seeking to vacate the guilty verdict.Court filings show that Bailey, the state attorney general, advised the Department of Corrections to wait to release Dunn until the appeal played out.“Throughout the appeals process, multiple courts have affirmed Christopher Dunn’s murder conviction,” said Madeline Sieren, Bailey’s spokesperson, in an email. “We will always fight for the rule of law and to obtain justice for victims.”Sieren declined to comment further on the record, citing the pending litigation.Dunn’s case is the second time in weeks Bailey has sought to appeal an overturned conviction to the state’s top court.After another judge overturned the conviction of Sandra Hemme for a 1980 fatal stabbing on June 14, Bailey’s office also told prison officials not to release the 64-year-old woman while the appeals process proceeded. Missouri’s top court agreed with the vacated ruling, and the judge in that case said last week that if Hemme wasn’t released, Bailey would have to appear in court himself. She was released that day.Charles Zug, a political science professor at the University of Missouri, noted that Bailey gave little legal rationale for why Dunn shouldn’t be released. He said there could be a political reason.Bailey is facing a primary challenge to his right by attorney Will Scharf, who has represented Donald Trump. The former president has not yet made an endorsement in the race, but Zug noted that if he did, it could swing the primary. Zug said he interprets what Bailey is doing as trying to bolster his “law and order” bona fides to national party officials and garner their support.“He seems to be throwing spaghetti at the walls trying to signal as much as possible to national Republicans that he’s conservative enough,” Zug said. “Unfortunately, Dunn has found himself as a chess piece here.”On Thursday, Dunn’s attorneys argued in a filing to the Missouri Supreme Court that Bailey had no right to appeal the judge’s ruling, and that only the prosecutor who fought for Dunn’s release could do so.“This tug-of-war should end,” they wrote.Dunn’s mother, sisters and nephew had joined his wife, Kira, in Missouri to see Dunn walk out of prison Wednesday. When they found out that wouldn’t be happening, Kira went inside to talk to the warden, who let her see her husband.The light was out of Dunn’s eyes, she said. They held hands. She told him it was a bump in the road, that she would be back next week waiting outside the prison, waiting for him.“We’ve been waiting a long, long time,” she said. “I guess we’ll just keep waiting.”"
WaPo_65,Simone Biles’s coaches cheer on another Paris Olympian: Their daughter,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/27/juliette-landi-cecil-laurent-simone-biles/,2024-07-27 22:28:02.814944,,"SAINT-DENIS, France — Cecile and Laurent Landi, the most visible gymnastics coaches on the planet right now, cheered enthusiastically from the stands near an Olympic pool Saturday, even while their prize pupil, Simone Biles, was across town getting ready for a final tuneup before the women’s gymnastics competition begins.There was no way the Landis were going to miss this, though, because their 17-year old daughter, Juliette Landi, was diving into Olympic waters, competing for the French team in the women’s synchronized 3-meter event.“We had to miss practice today with the team,” Cecile said from the stands at the Aquatics Centre. “The other coaches got it, though. The girls got it. Everyone understood.”While her parents are originally from France, Juliette was born in Oklahoma and moved to Texas as a baby, where the Landis would become two of the most high-profile coaches in the country. Juliette grew up as a gymnast, specializing in trampoline before making the jump to diving.“She has worked so hard for this,” Cecile said. “The years in gymnastics, in trampoline, helped. She found a true passion for this sport. When you’re passionate about it and you work hard, good things happen.”When Juliette was named to the French team in May, it meant all three family members would be part of Olympic delegations at these Paris Games: Juliette competing under the French flag, Cecile carrying the title of head coach for the U.S. women’s gymnastics team and Laurent working alongside his wife as the personal coaches for Biles and teammate Jordan Chiles.They all had a busy first few days in Paris but made sure to connect each day in the Olympic Village. They’re stationed in different parts of the village but got together for meals and shopping. They posed together Friday for a photo with the giant Olympic rings: Laurent seated in the green ring, Cecile in the yellow and Juliette above her parents in the center black ring. Juliette shared the photo on Instagram, saying “I wouldnt be where I am without them. they let me live out my dreams and now we are all three at the same olympics! Thank you guys for everything.”Cecile represented France as a gymnast at the 1996 Olympics, competing under her maiden name Canqueteau. At the Aquatics Centre on Saturday, she proudly wore a blue shirt with “France” written across the chest, clapping excitedly when Juliette and her partner, Nais Gillet, also a converted gymnast, completed their first dive: a backward 1½ somersault with a half twist. Laurent was next to Cecile, his eyes locked first on the water and then on the scoreboard.The judges weren’t impressed, but this competition always was going to be an uphill climb for the French duo. They had only recently started working together, and their final three dives had a lower degree of difficulty compared with the other seven teams competing.In the end, the French pair finished last in the eight-team competition, while China took gold and the American duo of Sarah Bacon and Kassidy Cook won silver.“As coaches, we can tell she's very talented,” Cecile said. “As her parents, we're just happy she found something she loves.”While Juliette’s Olympic competition is over, Cecile’s and Laurent’s is just beginning. Juliette is planning to attend some of the gymnastics competition across town at Bercy Arena, cheering on her parents and friends.After that, the family will return to the United States. Cecile heads to Athens, Ga., where she’ll co-coach the University of Georgia gymnastics team, Laurent and Juliette will go back to Spring, Tex., where Laurent will continue coaching at World Champions Centre while Juliette finishes her last year of high school. He’ll join his wife in Georgia next year when Juliette begins school at Auburn, where she’ll compete for the diving team.And beyond that? The whole family very well could be back at the Olympics four years from now in Los Angeles, again juggling sports and schedules.“It’s just pretty cool,” Cecile said of their unique Olympic experience."

WaPo_68,"House Republicans continue to flail, further endangering their majority",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/27/house-republicans-mike-johnson-recess-appropriations-bills/,2024-07-27 23:45:02.660167,,"In his bid to claim the House speaker’s gavel and end three weeks of chaos last fall, Rep. Mike Johnson mapped out an ambitious agenda.Week by week, month by month, the Louisiana Republican promised to meet the “urgency of this hour” with “bold, decisive action.” Above all else, Johnson promised, the House GOP would finish funding federal agencies before the traditional end-of-summer five-week recess.“DO NOT break for district work period unless all 12 appropriations bills have passed the House,” he wrote on Oct. 23, in a letter sent to all House Republicans with to-do lists and all-caps directives.Well, that didn’t pan out.Before lunchtime Thursday, Speaker Johnson bowed to reality and sent lawmakers home a week earlier than originally planned, turning what is traditionally called “August recess” into a 6½-week break from legislative action.Republicans have passed five of the 12 bills that fund the federal government, putting them well ahead of last year’s absolutely dysfunctional timeline, when just one bill had been passed at this point. But the House GOP failed to pass two others and decided the rest were too politically tricky to even attempt at this point.Even those bills that did pass contain so many extremely conservative policy riders and spending cuts to important programs that they are dead in the Senate, where a traditional bipartisan process is playing out as expected. All that House Republicans have to show for their work on government funding is creating more political exposure for a couple dozen incumbents that might further endanger their majority.While most Americans have focused their attention on the made-for-Hollywood presidential campaign that has captured the nation’s attention, House Republicans have continued sputtering along in the shadows the past three months in their traditionally chaotic fashion.A few weeks ago, as President Biden struggled, that might have been a fine enough strategy. But his decision to stand down has lit a fire under liberal activists rallying for Vice President Harris, and up to 10 of the most vulnerable House Republicans reside in California or in the New York media market. In those places, former president Donald Trump remains a political anchor while Harris might energize her base out of their Biden-induced slumber — possibly setting the stage for a net gain of at least four seats that would vault Democrats into the House majority next year.It didn’t have to be this way for House Republicans. Back in the early spring, Johnson allowed passage of a national security bill that included $60 billion for Ukraine. That came right after the passage of two massive packages that included all 12 spending bills at the funding level agreed to last year by Biden and Johnson’s predecessor, Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).As a result, some of Trump’s loudest House allies  tried to force him out in similar fashion to McCarthy. But Trump gave the speaker the support he needed to fend off the challenge (also bolstered by some Democratic votes). Johnson’s path to remaining in power became clear: retain the majority and hope Trump wins the presidency and endorses him for another term.Trump has never shown much interest in the specificity of agency budgets, other than those dealing with border security. Some of the most conservative members encouraged the speaker to not even bother trying to approve the 12 spending bills until after the election, hoping for a Republican sweep that would lead to a very conservative budget.But House GOP leaders have tried to split the difference by sticking to the rigid outline of the Biden-McCarthy deal. They’re ignoring side deals that led to billions more in domestic funding while also allowing some very conservative policy riders to creep into funding legislation.Democrats accused the speaker of genuflecting, again, to his most conservative wing by engaging in a spending process that would fail. “They knew these bills could never pass. They went through this charade to appease Republican extremists, and now, Speaker Johnson is sending members home despite promising he would not take August recess unless all 12 bills passed,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro (Conn.), the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee.Republicans defend their dismal showing by blaming Democrats for never providing more than a handful of votes for the bills, leaving them little margin for error. “You eventually hit a wall because, you know, we have a few of our own members that vote against some of these bills,” House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.), who made the call to send lawmakers home early, told The Hill.By pushing ahead with these GOP-only bills, Republican leaders have repeatedly forced their most politically vulnerable members to cast votes in the committee and on the House floor that aren’t exactly appealing to centrist voters.Because of their own conservative political demands, House Republicans protected funding for the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs, as well as Social Security and Medicare. That forced deep cuts to some domestic programs in order to slash overall spending consistent with their political and policy aims.The result: Democrats estimate that 72,000 teacher positions for low-income students would be eliminated in the bill funding the Education Department, while the Environmental Protection Agency could face a 20 percent cut. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service budget would come more than $300 million below the president’s request.These domestic programs don’t grab national headlines, but they are often beloved in certain regions and can be quite easily turned into political weapons.Rep. Juan Ciscomani (R-Ariz.), a freshman whose district narrowly backed Biden over Trump four years ago, received an early lesson last year when he voted in committee for the bill funding the Agriculture Department. It included restrictions against mail delivery of pills related to abortions, a vote that Democrats turned into a quick video ad against him.Democrats homed in on Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Calif.), a senior member of the committee who is facing a difficult reelection in his suburban district, for voting to strip LGBTQ+ community funding projects out of another bill.The more establishment-friendly corner of the House Republican conference often begrudgingly goes along with leadership even if it means supporting bills pushed by far-right Republicans from safe conservative districts.After final votes Thursday, Rep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.), from a Long Island district that leans Republican, told reporters he would center his campaign on bills passed last year that tried to deal with key issues for swing-district voters.“I'm going to focus my campaign on policy and ensuring that voters know where I stand on the issues that matter the most — about the border, about the economy, public safety, pocketbook issues, inflation,” said LaLota, who faces a well-funded opponent, former CNN news personality John Avlon.He said he was ready to defend cuts to some domestic programs as a down payment toward reducing the nearly $35 trillion national debt.“There are things that responsible people from Washington need to do, and that should not be a partisan issue. Members of both parties should be able to join in reasonable, responsible spending cuts,” LaLota said.Some GOP moderates have rebelled against the spending bills — along with some arch conservatives who make it a habit of voting against almost every funding plan — and that has stalled the appropriations process until the fall, or more likely, until after the November elections.In trying to placate his hard-line members, Johnson and other GOP leaders are fighting the last war. They continue act as if their biggest fear is a right-wing coup, as befell McCarthy, when their most immediate concern should simply be protecting their majority.About 20 House Republicans antagonized McCarthy last year, beginning with forcing him to go 15 rounds in early January 2023 before electing him speaker. In October, eight of them joined with Democrats to oust him as speaker.After three weeks of paralysis over electing a speaker, Johnson’s best résumé highlight might have been that no one hated him, meaning he could win the floor vote for speaker.But in the past few months, the atmosphere shifted away from the 20 or so most strident conservatives and instead toward whatever best serves the interests of Trump — who seems to clearly get that last year’s chaos should not be repeated anytime soon.Trump demonstrated that by helping defeat the effort by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), considered one of Trump’s closest allies, to oust Johnson. And not a single Republican has paid any political price in their primary election for supporting Ukraine aid, with Trump silent in most of those races.The Trump-Johnson connection was on display at the GOP convention in Milwaukee, where the speaker regularly got spotted in the VIP front rows with Trump and other high-profile Republicans. And some of the fringier conservatives were somewhat sidelined, including Greene, who was often seated a row or two behind Trump and got relegated to a non-primetime speaking role. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) never spoke onstage.If Trump wins and Republicans retain the House majority, Johnson stands a good chance of winning his endorsement to remain speaker — which would all but silence Johnson’s critics.If Republicans lose the majority, whether or not Trump wins, Johnson will have a hard time remaining GOP leader.And Democrats want to make Republicans pay for every vote they’ve cast the past 18 months.“I think what we should use against them is the fact that they are incompetent,” said Rep. Jim McGovern (Mass.), the top Democrat on the Rules Committee. “I have served here for a long, long time, and I’ve never seen such incompetence.”"
WaPo_69,The view from Paris: Drenched but joyful at the Opening Ceremonies,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/27/daily-olympics-visual-guide-paris-opening-ceremonies/,2024-07-27 23:39:02.660167,,"I’m Pete, and The Washington Post sent me to Paris to show you some of the wonders and weirdness you couldn’t otherwise see without being here. You can see my previous dispatch here.I didn’t see Lady Gaga, the headless Marie Antoinettes or the U.S. team’s boat during Opening Ceremonies. I did see a lot of fences, port-a-potties and joy. You can see all those things in this amazing gallery my fellow photographers took on Friday.Here’s how — and where — my adventure unfolded.My plan was simple: I’d follow the route of the parade of boats along the Seine and finish as close as I could to the Eiffel Tower. I even drew a map in my notebook in case my phone ran out of battery. (It didn’t!).At 1 p.m., more than six hours before the ceremony started, I left my hotel wearing my favorite comfy sneakers and carrying a bag that included a laptop, raincoat, rain hat, water bottle, notebooks, camera, selfie stick and mini Kit Kats.I took the Metro to the Trocadéro to scout out the finish area but couldn’t get close because of the security perimeter. So I walked to the Louvre, rented a bike and rode back to the start to begin the journey for real.It was drizzling a little, something the French call crachin. “Good thing I brought rain gear,” I thought.The first thing I noticed were fences everywhere, cars almost nowhere, and huge lines of people.Police at the first checkpoint were thorough and even asked me to take a sip of my water. After arson attacks on the French rail system earlier in the day, security was understandably tight.Just before crossing into the secure perimeter, I stopped to get a brick a l’oeuf, a Tunisian egg-and-bread dish, then headed toward the start. There was so much to see!One thing I didn’t see was a hole in front of me. I stepped in it and (lightly) sprained my ankle.I kept going, gingerly, past people clumped around giant screens. Everyone was friendly, and as I chatted with a reporter from Argentina, music suddenly blasted out of the speakers near me. I saw the very top of the explosion of red, white and blue smoke from the Austerlitz Bridge.I went back outside the security perimeter, rented another bike, and pedaled toward where the river came back together. I tried to get back through a checkpoint.The security officers, in an extremely nice way, said non. Several times.I texted my editor: “I got out and it’s impossible to get in again. And it’s raining.”She told me to suck it up.But I found what seemed to be a good spot to get a peek at the boats.By this point, I’d been out for hours, and the ceremony was not even half finished. I made an important discovery: The port-a-potties are surprisingly clean! And there are no lines!Next, I stopped in the Jardin des Tuileries. The egg brick was long burned off, and the Kit Kats weren’t cutting it. I asked for pizza. Sold out. But they had lager!Festive and wet spectators cheered as the Palestinian athletes went by, then sang along to “Lady (Hear Me Tonight)” by French duo Modjo.As I was sending an update, a raindrop hit my phone screen and caused a glitch. I watched as it typed the letter “g” 106 times. My editor feared I was having a medical emergency. I noticed my hands were pruney.I stopped under a portico to dry off a bit. I was starting to get cold as the sun went down, but the lights of Paris were just warming up.As I got ready to resume the chase, I made another important discovery: The electronic bike payment system doesn’t work well in a downpour.1/7
I heard Juliette Armanet singing “Imagine.” I imagined being dry again.
Then — a break in the rain! I watched on a screen from Pont Alexandre III as the Olympic flag went up.
From where I was standing, I could see the very tip of the Eiffel Tower and a few beams from the laser light show. “I’m missing this!” I thought, and sped up.
I got lost going around what seems to be the entire world’s supply of fences.I ended up within view of the tower and watched on yet another screen as Paris 2024 president Tony Estanguet welcomed the athletes.Rain was pouring down again.I hoped my camera was waterproof.I hoped the cauldron was waterproof.Then who did I see on the tower? Oh wow! I hoped Celine Dion was waterproof!I got in at 1:02 a.m., 12 hours and 2 minutes after I left. My phone says I walked more than 12 miles (20 kilometers) and I covered more by bike.But I experienced the Opening Ceremonies of the Olympics, in person, in Paris. I didn’t just see the big things on the screen, but the little things on the street — dancers, skaters, vendors, groups of happy people from all over the world.“I am living this,” I remembered thinking, “and it is amazing.”Even all that rain was a little big magical.About this storyPete’s adventures are mostly those of Artur Galocha, who is reporting from Paris, with help from afar from Bonnie Berkowitz and Álvaro Valiño.Graphics editing by Samuel Granados."
WaPo_70,"TikTok’s Chinese owner built search tool for users’ views on abortion, gun control, DOJ claims",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/27/tiktok-bytedance-justice-department-ban/,2024-07-27 23:19:02.660167,,"TikTok’s China-based owner ByteDance had access to a search tool that allowed its employees to collect information on U.S. users’ views on divisive issues such as gun control, abortion and religion, the Department of Justice alleged in the latest chapter of the legal battle over the video app’s future in the United States.New documents filed with the federal appeals court in Washington late Friday said an internal ByteDance workplace and communications program called Lark connected employees in China and the  United States and was used to send data on U.S. users, including personally identifiable information.The search tool inside Lark would have allowed ByteDance and TikTok employees “to collect bulk user information based on the user’s content or expressions, including views on gun control, abortion, and religion,” a DOJ official said. The filing did not indicate how or if the data was used.In April, President Biden signed a law forcing  ByteDance  to sell TikTok to a non-Chinese company  or face a ban in the United States, where it has 170 million users. The documents filed Friday were the government’s first major response to a legal challenge brought by TikTok and ByteDance.TikTok spokesman Alex Haurek said early Saturday that the company remained “confident we will prevail in court.”In a statement published on X, TikTok added that a ban on the app would violate its users’ First Amendment rights. “Nothing in this brief changes the fact that the Constitution is on our side. The TikTok ban would silence 170 million Americans’ voices, violating the First Amendment.”Social media companies, like Meta’s Facebook, also ask users to share their religion and other personal information. However the DOJ alleges that  TikTok’s access to sensitive information could cause geopolitical risks, by allowing the Chinese government to demand ByteDance share U.S. users’ data.The department stated that TikTok’s algorithm, which determines the videos users see, “can be manually manipulated, and its location in China would permit the Chinese government to covertly control the algorithm — and thus secretly shape the content that American users receive — for its own malign purposes.”“The serious national-security threat posed by TikTok is real, as evidenced by the public record and confirmed by classified information supplied by the intelligence community,” the government argued in another filing.“TikTok provides the Chinese government the means to undermine U.S. national security in two principal ways: data collection and covert content manipulation,” it added.The documents filed late Friday were heavily redacted, and Justice Department officials have said they intend to give the court an unredacted version of their legal brief featuring classified information. Judges could review that brief, but not the companies or the general public.China has said it will block the sale of TikTok’s algorithm, and TikTok and ByteDance’s lawsuit claims the challenge of replacing such a central part of the app’s structure “is not remotely feasible” before the January deadline.In May, eight TikTok creators sued the U.S. government over the law, which they said violated their First Amendment rights. TikTok, which is funding their action, has consolidated the two cases into one lawsuit.The department responded to this by saying that users would still be able to post and view the same content on other social media platforms if TikTok were taken down.“Any preference these petitioners may have for using TikTok over those other platforms does not create a constitutional right to TikTok,” it said, “nor could their preference overcome the national-security interests supporting the Act.”Responding to TikTok’s argument that the U.S. had offered no proof for its claims of Chinese government influence, the Justice Department said in its brief that the U.S. “is not required to wait until its foreign adversary takes specific detrimental actions before responding to such a threat.”“Congress can act even if all of the threatened harms have not yet broadly materialized or been detected,” officials wrote.DOJ officials also argued against TikTok’s First Amendment defense, saying any damage from the law to users’ speech freedoms would be “incidental.”“Any adverse effects on expression by U.S. persons are indirect and amply justified,” officials said. TikTok creators, they added later, “have no First Amendment right to TikTok.”"

No place at all for someone who possesses Frederick Richard’s aspirations.Richard, 20, may be a gymnast in name and reputation. But he’s really a dreamer. An ambitious climber. A young man who views these Paris Olympics as his launchpad to world domination. Which, if Richard was a movie villain, would sound menacing.“I’d want to say that the world knows Frederick Richard’s name …”Somehow, Richard — with his disarming smile and sincere expressions — can pull off a quote like that. He’s just being honest.So, ahead of his high bar routine, Richard stood just feet away from the elevated platform and lowered his head. No, he wasn’t thinking about the standings. Richard says he doesn’t follow the scores, and if that’s true, then he didn’t realize that he was trailing his U.S. and University of Michigan teammate Paul Juda and a pair of gymnasts from Britain. Instead, Richard bowed his head so he could visualize his routine.This was the same apparatus on which he had earned an NCAA championship during his freshman season at Michigan and won during the 2021 U.S. gymnastics championships. Most people don’t know that — because most people don’t follow men’s gymnastics. Richard aims to change that.Some Olympians arrive at the Olympics just happy to wave their flag during the Opening Ceremonies. Did you catch the Italians’ party boat floating down the Seine on Friday night? Not all of those athletes will leave with a medal, but they all won gold in having the most fun.Other athletes would consider it to be a lifetime achievement to medal in their discipline. After U.S. divers Kassidy Cook and Sarah Bacon won their silver medals in the women’s synchronized three-meter diving competition, Cook summed up the dream feeling: “This is freaking awesome.”But Richard has other plans. He simply wants to dominate his sport, make it popular for the masses, create a pipeline for young Black boys … and, oh, yes, take over the world.“I put it on myself, but I don’t view it as pressure. I view it as an opportunity,” Richard said after the day’s first subdivision when the United States competed alongside Britain, Canada, Germany and several other individuals representing their countries. “I grew up my whole life wishing there was some Black gymnast dominating the sport in the men’s side that I could look up to, wishing that the sport was 20 times bigger. And now I have an opportunity to contribute to that and make that happen.”Conquering a mountain that high takes small, incremental steps. Such as in 2023, when Richard became the first American male to medal in the all-around at the world championships in 13 years. Then another step Saturday, when he sought to finish among the 24 gymnasts who would qualify for the all-around final in the Olympics.So Richard was envisioning his next step, seeing himself complete every daring and graceful skill on the high bar. With his eyes closed, Richard moved ever so slightly. Turning his head to the right, twisting his torso to the left. He called it “going through the motions,” a mundane and completely wrong way of explaining the complexities and power involved in his high-difficulty routine. When Richard finished his visualization, he rested on a seat to watch teammate Brody Malone’s routine.Malone struggled. On his first release element, Malone let go of the high bar, flipped in the air and fell. Richard reacted by looking away. The way you might divert your eyes when someone slips on a sidewalk, as to not add to their embarrassment. Then Malone slipped again, and Richard, again, turned his eyes to the left. Looking away might have been the most kind thing, but also someone with Richard’s goals can’t let the visual of a faulty release creep into his mind. He’s got a world to conquer.Finally, his turn on the high bar. And Frederick Richard proved why he deserves to speak liberally of himself in the third person.From the crowd inside Bercy Arena, the gasps were mixed with awe when Richard let go for his first release attempt and caught the bar. Those gulps grew louder into enthusiastic cheers by his second and third and fourth flips. Then, Richard dismounted and stuck a dead-on landing, finishing with a 14.166 score, good enough for third overall in the group.“Let’s go!” Richard said to himself, to the crowd, to the audience he hasn’t met quite yet but hopes to wow over the next few days.“I just view that as an opportunity,” Richard said. “Every day’s an opportunity to compete and to make this sport bigger, and make my dreams happen. So I could see it right there; I’m reaching for it and not fearing missing out.”The United States finished behind Britain in its subdivision, casting doubt on whether this team can earn a medal. That’s not where Richard wants the sport to be.Behind his high bar routine, Richard finished 10th after all the gymnasts were done Saturday.  Richard would have to earn a medal — gold would be nice, if far-fetched — to accomplish his world takeover. For now, a gymnast can dream, can’t he?“I think we want to say that Team USA made a statement to the world, that we’re getting better and better on the men’s side, and we represented the country well,” Richard said, answering a question on what he would like the narrative to be surrounding his team following its Olympic performance. “I’d want to say that the world knows Frederick Richard’s name and that he’s going to keep getting stronger and stronger and in 2028 he’ll probably be the greatest gymnast in the world. That’s what I want the world to say after this competition.”"

A baker lost his way — or her way — while baking a cake. The specifics of this legend have been lost to time.You might be able to guess where this goes: The resulting dessert was all wrong, but the baker, pinching pennies, decided to sell it anyway, and customers thought it was just right. Gooey butter cake — the legend and the dessert — was born.So what, exactly, is gooey butter cake? I grew up in St. Louis, eating it at potlucks and barbecues and the occasional birthday party, but for most of my life, I had no idea how to answer that question. Often, the gooey butter cake I encountered as a kid was a saccharine, dense bar cookie, with a cracked, sugary top and yellowish hue. But sometimes, if I was lucky, I happened upon a gooey butter cake that looked and tasted more like a sticky coffee cake, with two distinct layers: a less sweet, breadlike base and a creamy, gooey, honey-colored top.Get the recipe: Gooey Butter CakeThey were, without question, two different desserts, and I always wondered which hewed closer to the truth, to that happy baking accident decades ago. So I decided to try to find out. And even if the creator of gooey butter cake remains a mystery, even if that original, messed-up recipe is lost to time, there’s still a trail of sticky, sweet crumbs — in newspaper archives and old recipes — that offers hints about the dessert’s murky origins.By the late 1940s, gooey butter cake had entered the historical record, as neighborhood newspapers in St. Louis advertised the cake, often sold for 50 cents a sheet. Some referred to it as “gooey butter coffee cake,” hinting at a certain genre: Were these cakes not as sweet as other desserts and therefore acceptable for breakfast? Maybe.Over the years, newspapers published variations on the same recipe, all relying on a yeasted base and a top layer heavy on butter, sugar and light corn syrup. That was the status quo as the cake’s celebrity spread. In 1989, a syndicated New York Times story referred to gooey butter cake as an “intensely rich piece of gastronomic lunacy” — without knowing what folly was about to take hold.At some point, probably in the 1990s, a gooey butter cake shortcut was born, presumably to avoid the unpredictability and time suck of working with yeast. Bakers swapped the sturdy, breadlike base for a boxed, yellow cake mix, and for reasons that boggle the mind and the arteries, added cream cheese to the topping. This, then, was the gooey butter cake I encountered most often as a kid.I’m not sure when I first tried the other gooey butter cake — dare I say, the original. But I know I was immediately swayed. It wasn’t that I didn’t like the cake mix version; it was just that I had no idea it was possible to eat gooey butter cake that had a more nuanced flavor beyond just sweetness. So banish the cream cheese and light the cake mix on fire. Working with yeast is well worth the extra effort when you wind up with something as brilliant as gooey butter cake. It’s the ideal cross between a coffee cake and a bona fide dessert — which means, of course, that it’s acceptable to eat at any time of day.Get the recipe: Gooey Butter Cake"
WaPo_73,‘I don’t mind sweating’: Readers who actually love humid summer weather,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/27/love-hot-weather-dmv/,2024-07-28 01:30:02.623022,,"This summer so far has been, as they say, a scorcher. In July, temperatures reached 104 degrees, the highest since 2012. That may be hot, but not everyone dreads the sun beating down, sweat on their brow as they commute to work. Some just wish they were at the pool, reveling in the summer sun.We asked readers who live in the DMV and thrive in the heat to come forward and share what they appreciate about hot summers. Responses touched on feeling healthier, livelier and even nostalgic. Some readers submitted photos that screamed summer to them or tips to help those who prefer to stay cool.Reader letters have been lightly edited for length and clarity.I love summer!! The pool and the beach are lots of fun for my family of four. The longer daylight hours tempt me to go outside much later than I would during the winter. Sunshine instead of cloudiness makes me happy. Oh, and the smell of sunscreen is amaaaaazing. I don’t mind sweating (most of the time). Snow is a pain … if you have to go anywhere/do anything. I also HATE my coat closet and entryway being full of hats, gloves, snowsuits and car scrapers with salt on my floor all winter long, not to mention getting ready takes longer because of having to have all of those items and put them on my children.
Tip: Find some activity you enjoy about summer and try to make that a weekly activity or part of your summer routine. Stay cool by wearing lighter, cooler clothing. I know it’s hot, but go outside. The vitamin D is good for you (still wear sunscreen!). If all else fails, be like my aunt and count down the days until the winter holiday season.
— Connie Wesley, 42, Frederick, Md.I loved the hot summers, and I miss them. I moved to Ocean Pines during the pandemic, and I always compare the temps here to Laurel, Md., where I lived before, and feel actual anger that it’s cooler here. I love the sweltering heat and the nights where being outside feels like walking into a sauna. Summer!!!— Jackie Ward, 62, Ocean Pines (formerly Laurel), Md.I love the hot weather because I teach outdoor aqua fitness classes, and these classes bring so much joy to the participants!Tip: Get in the water!— Nancy Brouillette, 68, Rockville, Md.I spend all summer on my front porch — conducting meetings, facilitating writing circles, reading, making phone calls. I don’t want to miss any of it. People look at me sweating on Zoom and wonder why I don’t go inside to the air conditioning, but then I would miss the blazing sunshine, the cacophonous symphony of birds, the swelling cicada song.There’s something about the extremeness of the season that I love. It’s like turning up the volume to the max. Plus, I don’t have to layer anything extra on my body to ward off chill. Maybe the heat and humidity feel like a giant hug.Tip: I try to remember that soon this season will be over. It’s so fleeting. I know that when the tiger lily buds start to run out, that means summer is about halfway over. Without heat, maybe we wouldn’t have outdoor pools, Popsicles, bare feet, and the lush vegetation and flowers that flourish here.— Amy Suardi, 55, TenleytownI don’t like to be cold. The warmer, the better. Believe it or not, the heat and humidity here is nothing compared to what I experienced growing up in the South, in Arkansas and Texas. Here, there will be a few days when the heat and humidity rival the South, but overall, it’s so unlike summers there. Here, there are breaks in the heat and humidity. Yes, there may be a “heat wave” for a couple of weeks, but it always seems to relent with cooler fronts that usher in less humidity and heat. In the summer South, that’s rare. Count on May to mid-September without any major breaks in the heat and humidity.
Tip: Be glad you are not in the Deep South; embrace our moderate summers.
— Fletcher Bransford, 65, Sterling, Va.I LOVE HOT WEATHER! A few days recently may have been a bit too hot (95 degrees is about as high as I generally want to go), but no matter how hot it is, I like it better than the oppressive cold of winter. At my advanced age, a lot of these things are just fond memories, but hot means playing outside, riding my bike, the beautiful trees and flowers, baseball, swimming in Ocean City, concerts at Wolf Trap, wearing shorts and T-shirts, sipping wine outside in the gorgeous scenery of Virginia wineries, watching the light show provided by the lightning bugs in my backyard, hearing the sounds of birds — basically, freedom and liberty.What others appreciate is their business, and I wish them well, but if they want it cold, I would, if I had my druthers, deny them their wish.Tip: Wear light colors and light fabrics. Drink plenty of fluids, preferably chilled. Stay near somewhere with an air conditioner.— Glennwood Smith, 73, Arlington, Va.It’s nice to have less crowded local soccer pitches, which means more space to kick around with my soccer-loving son.Tip: Embrace the heat while understanding your body’s limits. I like to think of sweat as our own personal air conditioning.— Sam Lee, 45, Vienna, Va.It makes me feel healthier! I feel more free and comfortable in my body. It’s like doing a hot yoga class — my muscles are loose and warmed up. I also get to wear loose, comfy clothing rather than lots of layers.Tip: Get access to water, if you can. D.C. has free public pools and spray parks all over the city! I’m at the pool all the time. Get access to shade — easier said than done in neighborhoods that are heat islands, but there are bus lines that go to Rock Creek Park, which is often much cooler than surrounding areas. Try to find the right clothing and gear. If you’re going somewhere that you have to look nice, a makeup or body wipe can be so useful.— Mary Ellen Dingley, 34, Van NessI grew up in Germany in the 1970s. It never got above 75 degrees in summer. Mostly it was around 65 in the summer. It rained almost all the time. It was so depressing! I was always freezing. When I moved back to Virginia in 1982, I felt like I was in heaven: the smell of magnolia trees, mimosa trees and dogwood. Best of all, I loved the feeling of humidity on my skin. It was so hot, I could actually wear shorts again and a cute sleeveless top and flip-flops. It felt like freedom!
Wish people reminded themselves that some people live in cold and darkness all the time.
Tip: Get all chores done before 8 a.m. Close all shades and drapes at 10 a.m. Walk in the woods in the shade.

WaPo_74,"After ‘big show’ in U.S., Netanyahu faces political battles at home",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/27/netanyahu-united-states-harris-trump-hostages/,2024-07-28 01:01:02.623022,,"JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s first trip outside Israel since the attacks of Oct. 7 featured a packed and dramatic itinerary: meetings with President Biden and both of his most likely successors, a globally broadcast address to Congress, and the kinds of confrontations with protesters and the families of Israeli hostages he often tries to avoid at home.Now he will return to see what impact — if any — his headline-grabbing swing will have on his many battles back home, with angry voters, rebellious governing partners and frustrated military leaders.It will take time, and polling, to tell. But political, diplomatic and security experts here say the results are likely to be mixed, boosting Netanyahu with his base while not significantly shifting his overall public standing. The trip also ramped up pressure on Netanyahu to reach a cease-fire deal as talks reach a critical point, something he was pushed on by everyone from hostage parents to Biden to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.The events in Washington and Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Palm Beach resort, probably achieved what may have been Netanyahu’s main priority: reminding his core supporters that he can command the attention of presidents and the world.“He got exactly what he wanted out of the trip,” said Anshel Pfeffer, a Netanyahu biographer and the Economist’s Israel correspondent. “He got a big show, the spectacle of being a statesman that he thrives on.”The trip came as Israel’s standing has been battered for months by its military campaign in the Gaza Strip. More than 39,000 people have been killed there since the war started, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children.Netanyahu himself could face war crimes charges, after the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced in May that he was seeking an arrest warrant for the prime minister for alleged atrocities in Gaza.His appearances in Washington and Florida, while massive protests dogged his motorcades, were potent counter programming. He was welcomed at the White House, an honor that Biden, who has made no secret of his frustrations with Netanyahu, had denied him for more than a year and a half.And his address to Congress, which aired in prime time in Israel and featured more than 50 standing ovations, may also stem some of the bleeding from his base, aiding his fight against brewing rebellions within his government and party.“This was Netanyahu returning to his well-known role of making the Israeli case in a prestigious setting in articulate English,” said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute. “It’s going to be well-received by those people inclined to support him.”But shoring up the base will not patch up Netanyahu’s cratering popularity among the broader electorate, Plesner said. Around two-thirds of Israelis consistently say they want the prime minister to step down over the failures that led to the Hamas attacks and for not negotiating a hostage release deal.“Forty-five minutes of speech and applause won’t erase the one sad fact: the words ‘Deal Now!’ were absent from the prime minister’s address,” the Hostage and Missing Families Forum, an umbrella group, said after the event.But in Israel’s fragmented parliamentary system, Netanyahu might be able to cling to power just by restoring his edge among the right-wing voters that give him a tiny, four-seat majority in the Knesset.“He doesn’t need a groundswell of support to remain prime minister,” Pfeffer said. “He just needs to move various needles slightly rightward.”An official close to the prime minister’s office, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues, said his inner circle was largely satisfied with a trip that forced Netanyahu to confront a presidential race in turmoil.Netanyahu had a meeting with Biden that was civil, at least publicly. He began mending his years-long rupture with Trump, who greeted the prime minister and his wife warmly and denied — contrary to several previous, sometimes profane, statements to the contrary — that the two had ever fallen out.But the team was taken aback by Vice President Harris, who has solidified her position as the likely Democratic nominee, the Israeli official familiar with the discussions said. Her behavior and rhetoric signaled that a President Harris would be tougher on Netanyahu than her boss has been.“Harris was a surprise,” said the official. “She was harsher than expected.”Harris skipped Netanyahu’s congressional speech for a campaign trip. After a meeting with the prime minister Thursday, she gave public remarks that echoed Biden’s usual statements of support for Israel’s right to defend itself but also emphasized her “serious concern about the scale of human suffering in Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians,” and “images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety.”“We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering, and I will not be silent,” she said.The remarks put Israelis on notice that a Harris victory might or might not bring a shift in U.S. relations, but it would probably change the tone.“It was mostly the same message but the music was very, very different,” said Chuck Freilich, a former deputy head of Israel’s National Security Council and a senior fellow at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. “She used this meeting to stake out her differences.”Talks for a deal to end the fighting and release the hostages still held in Gaza were a constant backdrop to Netanyahu’s trip. Negotiations are scheduled to resume next week in Rome, and U.S. and Arab brokers say the chances of an agreement are as high as they’ve ever been.The prime minister was beseeched to conclude an accord at every turn. Israeli protesters traveled overseas to chant “Seal the Deal!” sometimes standing not far from pro-Palestinian demonstrators shouting “Cease-fire Now!”Biden brought eight American hostage families to the White House to plead with Netanyahu, as did rescued hostage Noa Argamani, who traveled on the prime minister’s plane. Trump, too, said the time was right.“It was made very clear that everyone is pushing for a hostage deal,” the Israeli official said.Netanyahu said he thought Israel’s recent military attacks have brought Hamas closer to accepting agreeable terms, although there are key differences that need to be ironed out.But his political dilemma remains: If he allows for a cease-fire deal that ends the fighting in Gaza before “total victory” against Hamas, his most extremist coalition partners have threatened to bring down his government.Hostage families hope Netanyahu’s Washington trip, and the possible boost it gives him with right-wing voters, will give him more maneuvering room. Or at least give him more confidence that he could survive new elections.The prime minister’s travels also helped him run out the clock on the parliamentary session — lawmakers begin a three-month recess Monday — freezing any political machinations until closer to the end of the year.Whether all those factors combine to finally bring about an end to the fighting won’t be known for days, or even weeks, when the process in Rome concludes."

Israel’s army said it had targeted a Hamas position with precision; video and eyewitness testimonies from a nearby hospital suggested that most of the dead were civilians.The Khadija School in Deir al-Balah had been housing around 4,000 displaced people, according to Gaza’s civil defense force. Video from the immediate aftermath of the attack showed bodies on the ground and bloodied children being carried by adults. In the al-Aqsa Hospital, doctors said that they had received patients with full bodily burns or missing limbs.More than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict so far, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children.In a statement, the IDF described its strike as targeting “terrorists operating a Hamas command and control center embedded inside the Khadija School in central Gaza,” and said that precautions were taken to “mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of appropriate munitions, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence.”The force has issued similar statements after other strikes on schools packed with displaced civilians. Military experts caution that precision munitions still have the capacity to kill large numbers of people when they are used in densely populated areas.Yazan Ahmed, 33, whose tent is near the school, told The Washington Post that the school was targeted with what appeared to be four missiles at around noon local time. He said he went to help rescue people from the school, and “the scene cannot be described. The limbs were torn everywhere. They were all women and children whose bodies were torn apart.”His description was echoed by other eyewitnesses. “There were victims everywhere,” said Fayez al-Toum, 21, who said he had been standing on the roof of a school building across the road when the attack began.Most of Gaza’s roughly 2.2 million population has been displaced by the conflict, as fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas militants has shunted much of the civilian population from north to south, and now back toward the enclave’s center.The United Nations said this week that more than 190,000 Palestinians had been displaced from Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, to the south, in just four days, as the Israeli army issued evacuation orders ahead of military operations there. On Saturday, the military extended those instructions to southern neighborhoods of Khan Younis.“Due to significant terrorist activity and rocket fire toward the State of Israel from the southern area of Khan Younis, remaining in this area has become dangerous,” the Israel Defense Forces said on X, warning that it was “about to forcefully operate” there and was adjusting the boundaries of an area that it has designated as a safe zone.It was the second time in less than a week that Israel has ordered the evacuation of a former safe area. On Monday, the IDF ordered the evacuation of an eastern sector of the city of Khan Younis, including an area in the Mawasi neighborhood that was previously within the boundaries of a designated safe zone for displaced people. Israel said it was targeting Hamas militants who had been firing rockets from the area.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been sheltering in the safe zone area, having been displaced multiple times since the war began.At a news briefing Friday, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres described Gaza’s humanitarian crisis as a “disaster.” The displaced were now being told to move, he said, “in search of a safety that doesn’t exist.”The Israel Defense Forces said one of its navy ships intercepted a drone flying close to the offshore Karish gas field. The Saturday statement noted that a drone flew in from Lebanese territory, but added that it was not immediately clear whether the drone was for reconnaissance purposes or equipped with explosives. Hezbollah, which has not commented on the claims, has previously threatened to hit Israeli oil platforms in the event of an all-out war.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Friday with former president Donald Trump, the latest stop on a whirlwind trip for the Israeli leader, who addressed a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday and met with President Biden and Vice President Harris on Thursday. Trump has been openly critical of Netanyahu’s management of the war in Gaza, but both men downplayed past antagonisms Friday, with Trump saying “we’ve always had a very good relationship.”At least 39,258 people have been killed and 90,589 injured in Gaza since the war started, the Gaza Health Ministry said Saturday. It does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack, including more than 300 soldiers, and it says 328 soldiers have been killed since the start of its military operations in Gaza.Alon Rom contributed to this report."

With the World Cup two years away, U.S. soccer could not bear yet another international pratfall and another round of questions about the program’s future.It took just a half-hour at Stade Vélodrome to settle nerves and lift spirits.Djordje Mihailovic, Walker Zimmerman and Gianluca Busio scored early goals and Paxten Aaronson added one in the second half as the Americans cruised to a 4-1 victory over New Zealand, substantially brightened their quarterfinal prospects.A victory, or perhaps even a draw, against Guinea on Tuesday in Saint-Etienne would accomplish something the U.S. men have not achieved since 2000: reaching the Olympic knockout stage.Group A favorite France (1-0-0, three points) played Guinea (0-1-0) later Saturday, but as things stand, the United States (1-1-0, three points) is in the top two, ahead of New Zealand (1-1-0, three) on goal differential. The Americans are even, while the Kiwis are minus-2. New Zealand will close Tuesday against France in Marseille.The four goals marked a U.S. Olympic men’s record. The men’s team is in the Olympics for the first time since 2008. The competition is for players 23 and under, with three exceptions per team, but several U.S. players are on the national team radar as the World Cup nears.Despite the 3-0 loss to France here Wednesday, the Americans said they felt good about their performance and optimistic about winning the next two matches against opponents that, on paper, were not in their class. They had created a number of high-quality chances against the French, only to falter with their finishing touches. France made no such mistakes in a decisive span midway through the second half.U.S. Coach Marko Mitrovic was so comfortable with the performance, he did not make any lineup changes Saturday.The scoring parade began in the eighth minute when Mihailovic converted a penalty kick after Nathan Harriel was tripped in the box. Four minutes later, Mihailovic drove a free kick into the penalty area, prompting a scramble that ended when Zimmerman, the only U.S. player with World Cup experience, poked the ball into the net from inside the six-yard box.In the 30th minute, left back John Tolkin busted through the left side and crossed to Kevin Paredes (South Riding, Va.). Paredes touched the ball to Busio, whose initial bid was blocked. The ball caromed back to him for a 10-yard shot through a tangle of bodies.Busio, an Italian-based midfielder, was forced out of the match six minutes later with a leg injury.In the 58th minute, two minutes after entering, Griffin Yow (Clifton, Va.) rushed to the end line and dropped the ball back to Aaronson for an angled effort into the far corner. Twenty minutes passed before Jesse Randall scored for New Zealand, but the outcome had been settled."
WaPo_77,Trump vows to stage outdoor rallies with extra help from Secret Service,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/27/trump-shooting-outdoor-rallies/,2024-07-28 03:00:02.905064,,"Former president Donald Trump vowed Saturday to stage more outdoor rallies two weeks after surviving an assassination attempt and claimed the Secret Service has agreed to “substantially step up their operation” to protect him.Trump wrote on Truth Social in a post Saturday morning that the Secret Service, which has been sharply criticized for its handling of security at the Butler, Pa., rally where he was wounded, was “very capable” of providing extra security.“NO ONE CAN EVER BE ALLOWED TO STOP OR IMPEDE FREE SPEECH OR GATHERING!!!” Trump wrote.I WILL CONTINUE TO DO OUTDOOR RALLIES, AND SECRET SERVICE HAS AGREED TO SUBSTANTIALLY STEP UP THEIR OPERATION. THEY ARE VERY CAPABLE OF DOING SO. NO ONE CAN EVER BE ALLOWED TO STOP OR IMPEDE FREE SPEECH OR GATHERING!!!The Secret Service did not confirm or deny that it would provide additional security, citing security concerns, but a law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media, said it was accurate that the Secret Service will be increasing security for Trump’s outdoor rallies.The Washington Post had previously reported that the Secret Service has encouraged Trump to stop large outdoor rallies and his campaign was scouting indoor venues.“Ensuring the safety and security of our protectees is our highest priority,” the Secret Service said in a statement. “In the interest of maintaining operational integrity, we are not able to comment on specifics of our protective means or methods.”The Secret Service said it had previously increased security in June as the presidential campaign heated up and the candidates were appearing at more events.Trump was wounded in the ear as he spoke at a large outdoor rally on July 13 when a gunman opened fire from a nearby roof. The shooting left one rallygoer dead and injured two others in the crowd that had gathered to see the Republican presidential nominee. Law enforcement snipers shot and killed 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks.The FBI said Friday that Trump was injured by a bullet or a bullet fragment fired by the shooter, after lingering questions about whether a bullet or debris caused his injuries.Trump has not provided medical records about his injuries, but Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Tex.), a Trump ally and former White House physician, released a letter saying he had treated Trump for a two-centimeter wound on his ear that did not require stitches.Trump’s Saturday post followed another on Truth Social on Friday night in which he promised to return to Butler for a “BIG AND BEAUTIFUL RALLY” that would honor the firefighter, Corey Comperatore, who was killed at the rally and those injured. Trump did not say when the event would occur or if it would be outdoors.“WHAT A DAY IT WILL BE — FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT!” Trump wrote.Trump has not appeared at an outdoor rally since the shooting. He is scheduled to appear at a hockey arena in St. Cloud, Minn., Saturday night for a campaign rally.After intense criticism from lawmakers for not preventing the shooting, Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned this week. Law enforcement has not been able to determine a motive in the shooting.Cheatle previously said that an internal review of the agency’s handling of the shooting should be available within 60 days and an independent report ordered by President Biden was due in 45 days. The FBI is leading the investigation into the shooting.The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to questions seeking additional information about the president’s plans for outdoor rallies."

Do you support Vice President Harris?Okay, now tell the truth: What’s up with your country?Sometimes, it feels like the “USA” on their attire might as well be scrawled in scarlet letters.Experience America from the outside, and you can see our tension seeping into the entire world’s anxiety. It leads to an overarching question: At a time of fear and division, what does it mean to wear red, white and blue? Over the next two weeks, these Olympians are America’s greatest ambassadors. What do they hope to show the world?Dominance isn’t a sufficient answer anymore. Arrogance is never a good look. When concerned eyes fixate on them, they can either aggravate or soothe the angst about the perception that America is crumbling.“This is a monumental next couple of months for our country and the direction that we’re heading,” basketball superstar Stephen Curry said. “Hopefully, this is a great way to do our part and continue unifying the country. Sports brings a lot of people together.”As one of his country’s most famous athletes, Curry wants to represent positivity. With his joyful flair, he challenges the assumption that promoting unity requires willful ignorance about the country’s shortcomings, or worse, capitulation to keep the peace. He can be outspoken and fun at the same time.This week, he endorsed Kamala Harris in the presidential race, which angered the Trump faithful, but he stayed out of the political mud. Curry and Coach Steve Kerr share Bay Area ties with Harris, who was born in Oakland and had a long legal and political career in California. Kerr made the same endorsement. For both, the right-wing backlash was loud but uninspired. The passion to question the national pride of sports figures in conflict with Trump fizzled several years ago. The recent athlete protest era subsided, too. With the temperature lowered, athletes aren’t left to weigh whether they must make a huge sacrifice just to voice their opinions.If there’s any doubt that “Shut up and dribble” has been pushed to the margins, look at LeBron James carrying the flag for the U.S. delegation Friday night. He shared the honor with 20-year-old tennis star Coco Gauff, who has never been afraid to raise her voice. The sight symbolized that Black and liberal-leaning athletes have reclaimed patriotism.Of course, they still have detractors. But the way they see the world — and their efforts to promote inclusion — is no longer made to seem treasonous. The power dynamic shifted when Trump lost the 2020 election. It could change again, perhaps more dramatically, if he returns to office. So it’s not surprising Curry favors Harris to succeed Biden.“For her in this moment, knowing what’s ahead, it’s all about positive energy and optimism knowing how divided our country is right now,” Curry said.In a WNBA group chat, members of the league’s social justice council are formulating a plan. They want Harris in the White House, too. For a second straight presidential election, they’re ready to leverage their influence.“We have been talking … finding a way to make sure that we can obviously back Kamala as much as we can,” superstar forward Breanna Stewart said during a U.S. women’s basketball news conference Saturday afternoon. “The things that she stands for, we also stand for.”Four years ago, WNBA players united to back Raphael G. Warnock (D-Ga.) during his Senate race against Kelly Loeffler, who co-owned the Atlanta Dream but had disparaged the league for its support of “Black Lives Matter” and “Say Her Name” sentiments that brought awareness to police violence. The social justice council has targeted voting rights and women’s reproductive rights as key issues. Because Harris shares their concerns, they’re focused on helping her. And no one unites around a cause like the WNBA.“This is a big, big election,” forward A’ja Wilson said.But at the Olympics, U.S. athletes aren’t interested in turning popularity into political capital. Regardless of their beliefs, the athletes want to celebrate all that they are. They want to create space for the full range of American life.In a flawless video to introduce the U.S. Olympians, NBC worked with music legend Beyoncé, who is still in her “Cowboy Carter” phase. A master of reclaiming and adding dimensions to the concept of Americana, Beyoncé emphasized the fullness of the country as only she can. Because she’s so intentional about every detail of her image, you couldn’t help but think about the diverse tapestry of this Olympic team as she presented the vast squad representing the nation.For 2½ minutes, you couldn’t see division. From the first second, you knew that would be the point. Still, it was a powerful and entrancing video.“The athletes, we all come from different backgrounds,” Gauff told me during a media session last week. “We all have different walks of life. We believe different things. But we’re all proud to be here, being an Olympian, representing the USA.”Upon deeper reflection, she added: “At least this year, there’s obviously been a lot of political turmoil on both sides. So I think for me, when I get this opportunity, I think of it as something completely separate. I think this is a good opportunity for our country to come together and stand behind something.”Normally, we ask Olympians to make us proud. It tends to be a gentler way of demanding them to win, baby, win. But this time, we should make a correction. They’re certain to do their best. For a change, we should ditch the lunacy, if only for a few ephemeral days. We should make them proud."
WaPo_79,"From first lady to Flav, everyone wants in on U.S. women’s water polo",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/27/us-womens-water-polo-jill-biden-flavor-flav/,2024-07-28 02:00:02.905064,,"SAINT-DENIS, France — They had summarily laid waste to another Olympic opponent and celebrated with Flavor Flav, and now a dignitary of a different sort wanted to meet them. As members of the imperial U.S. women’s water polo team walked off the Aquatics Centre pool deck Saturday afternoon, an assistant coach told them first lady Jill Biden was waiting.“I got chills,” goalie Ashleigh Johnson said.“My jaw dropped,” captain Maggie Steffens said.When they walked into their players’ lounge after their 15-6 demolition of Greece in their Paris Olympics opener, the Americans saw more than Biden. South Carolina women’s basketball coach Dawn Staley, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass (D) and figure skating legend Brian Boitano all wanted to meet them, too.One of the most dominant sports teams on the planet, the U.S. women opened their attempt at a fourth consecutive gold medal and discovered they have become kind of a big deal. Before Saturday, they had been supported in some form by luminaries that ranged from Taylor Swift to Flav, the rapper who signed a five-year contract to sponsor and promote them as an official hype man.Now, the first lady handed them coins with the presidential seal, and Staley commended their centers, the players who jostle a few feet in front of the net, as particularly impressive.“It just made me remember that this is so much bigger than us,” Johnson said. “It also reminded me that the Olympics creates moments that would never happen.”Johnson felt shaky as Biden addressed her and her teammates. She marveled at how Biden made her feel like the only person in the room. Biden told the players that she had never watched water polo before and that she could not believe the physical exertion the sport requires.“She reminded me of my mom,” Steffens said. “She was wearing the cutest outfit. Here’s the first lady, and the first thing she said was: ‘I could never do what you guys do. It’s so difficult.’ I was like, ‘I do not want to trade jobs.’”Biden arrived late in the match and sat in the front row next to her Greek counterpart. Flav, whose counterpart exists neither domestically nor internationally, sat in the top of the stands waving an American flag and wearing a water polo cap, then walked down to wave to them.The United States’ three remaining group-stage games feel like formalities before the knockout phase in larger Paris La Défense Arena, a place that already holds special meaning for the Americans.As the year began, Coach Adam Krikorian scheduled a test match at the Aquatics Centre for May, wanting his players to get a feel for the city and the pool that would host their opening games. Over the winter, while scanning for a potential family trip to see Swift in concert, Krikorian realized the Eras Tour would be swinging through Paris the same week as his team’s exhibition — and that Swift would be playing La Défense Arena, the venue of the gold medal water polo match.“For us to be able to visualize and get to see the stadium, the only way was to go to a Taylor Swift concert,” Steffens said.Team operations manager Ally Beck contacted Swift’s camp. Swift gifted the entire team tickets. Four days after dusting France, 12-6, in the test match, the U.S. women glammed up and headed to the show together. And thus, two superpowers in their chosen fields — one globally famous, one largely anonymous — converged on a Friday night in May on the outskirts of Paris.“If we get the chance to play in La Défense Arena, we want to be like her,” Steffens said. “We want to be able to love the pressure and have fun and enjoy the moment. As badass and powerful of a woman as she is, for us to see that in person was pretty magical.”At one moment during the set, Krikorian stepped back and looked at his team: Olympic veterans with arms slung over one another’s shoulders, first-timers still in college singing along, all of them swaying together. He began to cry.“You’re trying to create the best environment where there’s so much love and joy that the rest of it takes care of itself,” Krikorian said. “To see them all in that moment, it just got me.”After the Tokyo Games in 2021, there was no guarantee they would be together for another run. They had conquered the world again, and they were exhausted. Krikorian, their coach since the 2012 London Olympics, contemplated retirement. Kaleigh Gilchrist, twice a gold medalist, was sure she was done. Rachel Fattal, a leading scorer back at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games, considered moving on to coaching. Johnson asked herself, “Do I have anything left to give to this sport?”Steffens, the lone current player to win all three golds, started recruiting them for one more run. Krikorian took Gilchrist out to breakfast and, rather than congratulating her on a great career as she expected, told her, “You know, you could still play water polo.” Gilchrist texted Johnson to ask if she would return. “I will if you do,” Johnson replied. At some point, an individual choice became a collective decision.The Americans entered these Olympics carrying both utter dominance and relative vulnerability. They brought a 172-5 streak into the Tokyo Games, then lost to Hungary in the group stage before cruising to gold. They have gone 27-6 in major tournaments since 2021, finishing fifth at last year’s world championship and losing twice before taking gold at the World Cup. They fell to Hungary, 10-8, in their final friendly tuneup in Berkley, Calif., this month.In an instant Saturday, the United States showed it still has the Olympics in a stranglehold. The Americans romped to a 7-0 lead, Johnson commanding from the goal and their rhythmic offense pulverizing Greece’s net. “There’s a part of me that was like, ‘Where’s this been, guys?’” Krikorian said. “They love these moments.”Johnson — “maybe the best goalkeeper of all time,” Greek Coach Alexia Kammenou said — saved 10 of the 14 shots she faced. Nine Americans scored. Olympic rookie Jenna Flynn had a hat trick before halftime and finished with four goals, an emblem of how younger players have meshed with gold medalists.“There was a fairly large gap between the women that have been there and done it before and all of our youngsters,” Krikorian said. “And I think that gap has closed significantly, if there even is a gap.”Krikorian tells his players to appreciate every moment. After their opener, Maddie Musselman, twice a gold medalist, looked up into the crowd and felt goose bumps. She did not see a rapper or celebrity or politician. She saw her family, and it reminded her that they had been absent in Tokyo. It was another moment that could happen only at the Olympics."
WaPo_80,JD Vance is giving Republicans buyer’s remorse,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/27/jd-vance-republicans-buyers-remorse/,2024-07-28 03:00:02.905064,,"As the Bush-Quayle and McCain-Palin campaigns learned the hard way, it is never a good thing when the No. 2 person on the ticket becomes the story.Is there anyone in America who hasn’t heard in recent days what JD Vance said in a 2021 interview with Fox News’s Tucker Carlson? The best-selling author of “Hillbilly Elegy,” who was embarking on a U.S. Senate race in Ohio, asserted that Democrats — including Vice President Harris, whom he called out by name — are “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.”Now, it might have been sensible for Donald Trump’s newly named running mate to put out a statement like this: “I said something boneheaded three years ago, and I regret it.”But rather than doing cleanup and moving on, Vance is expanding the blast zone. On Friday, he told SiriusXM talk show host Megyn Kelly: “Sometimes it’s the truest and most important points that cause them to attack you the most.”The specific words he chose, Vance said, were meant to be “a sarcastic comment. I’ve got nothing against cats.”Vance also indicated, implausibly, that he had been uncertain of Harris’s “family situation” when he branded her one of those bitter, childless cat fanciers.The makeup of Harris’s family is not exactly an anomaly in modern America. When she got married a decade ago, Harris became the stepmother of two children, who call her “Momala.” And it speaks well of the dynamic in that blended family that one of the people offended by Vance’s slap at the vice president was her husband’s ex-wife. “These are baseless attacks,"" Kerstin Emhoff said. “For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I.”In his interview with Kelly, Vance said: “Having kids is a profoundly life-altering thing. It’s a fundamentally good thing.” He also said that the nation’s low birth rate is a “profoundly dangerous and destabilizing thing.” (If you listen to Vance for any length of time, you notice that he really likes the word “profoundly.”)Vance insisted that the larger point of his cat-lady crack is that Democrats are “anti-family.” This is a dubious assertion. Led by President Biden, Democrats have been fighting, against some Republican opposition in the Senate, to bring back the expanded child tax credit put in place during the covid pandemic.Of course, Vance knows — we all know — that any backtracking would not sit well with his running mate, who says obnoxious things on practically an hourly basis and has never been known to apologize for any of them.But what has become clear in Vance’s rocky national rollout is that this sort of thing is going to keep happening. As he opportunistically reinvented himself from NeverTrumper to ultimate MAGA warrior, Vance created a rich vein for opposition researchers to mine.Take, for instance, his idea, advanced in a 2021 speech, that people with children should be allowed to cast additional votes on behalf of their offspring. “When you go to the polls in this country as a parent, you should have more power,” he said.That was, he told Kelly, merely “a thought experiment.”Uh, okay. But it was also another way of showing what little respect he has for people whose choices and circumstances are different from his own.These stumbles by Vance are deepening the doubts that many Republicans are feeling about the wisdom of Trump’s choosing such a polarizing and untested running mate, which he did before Biden dropped out of the race. The calculation then was that Vance’s own life story, laid out movingly in his Republican National Convention acceptance speech, would resonate with the aggrieved Trump base.But the prospect of Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket has changed the dynamic of the election. Though the vice president still has plenty of ground to make up, her party no longer appears to be on the road to a certain rout in November.“If you had a time machine, if you go back two weeks, would [Trump] have picked JD Vance again? I doubt it,” conservative commentator Ben Shapiro speculated on his radio show. “I think he probably would have picked somebody like Glenn Youngkin from Virginia in an attempt to broaden out his base.”Trump surely doesn’t enjoy being asked, as he has, whether he regrets his impulsive choice of a Mini-Me as a running mate. “He’s doing really well,” the former president has insisted. “He’s really caught on.” And in one sense, that is true. Vance is giving people a lot to talk about."

WaPo_82,"Attacks in Gaza and Israel kill more than 40, many of them children",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/27/israel-gaza-hamas-evacuation-mawasi/,2024-07-28 03:47:02.905064,,"The Israeli military blamed Hezbollah for a rocket strike which killed at least 11 people on a soccer pitch in northern Israel on Saturday evening, sparking vehement denials from the Lebanese militant group as fallout from the incident tipped the two sides closer to all-out war.The Israel Defense Forces said at least 20 other people were wounded in the blast in Majdal Shams, a majority Druze community in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Many of the casualties were children.In a statement from the country’s ambulance service, a senior paramedic said his team had witnessed “gruesome” scenes on the grass. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was conducting a situational assessment with the military, his office said.“We will prepare for a response against Hezbollah,” IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a news briefing. “We will finish our assessments and we will act.”In a swiftly issued statement, Hezbollah denied any connection to the attack, saying it “categorically denies all false claims in this regard.”The strike drew sharp condemnations from Israeli officials amid fears that it would accelerate the now-daily exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah into a full-blown conflict. Warnings of such an eruption — caused by precisely the kind of high casualty incident that occurred Saturday — have grown urgent in recent months, as fighting along the Lebanese-Israeli border has intensified.“For more than nine months, Hezbollah has been attacking our citizens in the north, firing thousands of rockets and missiles and UAVs … targeting families, homes and communities,” Hagari said.Hezbollah began strikes against Israel soon after the Hamas-led attack on Israeli communities Oct. 7. During the conflict, Palestinian factions, including Hamas, have occasionally claimed attacks from Lebanon against Israel.This month, Hezbollah’s leader, Hasan Nasrallah, vowed to retaliate against Israeli strikes that had killed Lebanese civilians, saying his group would hit new areas in Israel that had not previously been targeted. He has also said Hezbollah would end its attacks if there was a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip.Hezbollah announced that Israel had killed four of its members, adding that it had also struck several military targets inside Israel. The targets included what Hezbollah called the Golani barracks, shown on a map that the group distributed as being just north of Majdal Shams.The incident in Majdal Shams followed a deadly strike in central Gaza, where local health authorities said at least 30 Palestinians were killed when Israel attacked a school sheltering displaced people.The IDF said it targeted a Hamas position with “precision,” but video and eyewitness testimonies from the nearby Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital suggested that most of the dead were civilians.Around 4,000 people were staying in the Khadija School in Deir al-Balah, according to Gaza’s civil defense force. Video from the immediate aftermath of the attack showed bodies on the ground and bloodied children carried by adults. At the hospital, doctors said they had received patients with full-body burns or their limbs shorn off.More than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict so far, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children.In a statement, the IDF described its strike as targeting “terrorists operating a Hamas command and control center embedded inside the Khadija School in central Gaza” and said precautions were taken to “mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of appropriate munitions, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence.”The force has issued similar statements after other strikes on schools packed with displaced civilians. Military experts caution that precision munitions still have the capacity to kill large numbers of people when they are used in densely populated areas. It was not clear which munitions were used in the explosions. A video from the scene, confirmed by the local civil defense force, appeared to show an unexploded U.S.-made small diameter bomb in the wreckage, according to Trevor Ball, a former U.S. Army bomb technician who reviewed the footage.Yazan Ahmed, 33, whose tent is near the school, told The Washington Post that the school was targeted with what appeared to be four missiles at around noon local time. He said he went to help rescue people from the school and “the scene cannot be described. The limbs were torn everywhere. They were all women and children whose bodies were torn apart.”His description was echoed by other eyewitnesses. “There were victims everywhere,” said Fayez al-Toum, 21, who said he had been standing on the roof of a school building across the road when the attack began.Most of Gaza’s roughly 2.2 million population has been displaced by the conflict, as fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas militants has shunted much of the civilian population from north to south, and now back toward the enclave’s center.The United Nations said this week that more than 190,000 Palestinians had been displaced from Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, to the south, in just four days, as the Israeli army issued evacuation orders ahead of military operations there. On Saturday, the military extended those instructions to southern neighborhoods of Khan Younis.“Due to significant terrorist activity and rocket fire toward the State of Israel from the southern area of Khan Younis, remaining in this area has become dangerous,” the Israel Defense Forces said on X, warning that it was “about to forcefully operate” there and was adjusting the boundaries of an area that it has designated as a safe zone.It was the second time in less than a week that Israel has ordered the evacuation of a former safe area. On Monday, the IDF ordered the evacuation of an eastern sector of the city of Khan Younis, including an area in the Mawasi neighborhood that was previously within the boundaries of a designated safe zone for displaced people. Israel said it was targeting Hamas militants who had been firing rockets from the area.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been sheltering in the safe zone area, having been displaced multiple times since the war began.At a news briefing Friday, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres described Gaza’s humanitarian crisis as a “disaster.” The displaced were now being told to move, he said, “in search of a safety that doesn’t exist.”Alon Rom and Sarah Dadouch contributed to this report."
WaPo_83,"Victor Wembanyama, his image everywhere in France, delivers in Olympic debut",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/27/victor-wembanyama-france-olympic-basketball/,2024-07-28 04:59:02.810686,,"VILLENEUVE-D’ASCQ, France — As the Summer Olympics approached, France’s basketball giant felt both sides of his burgeoning fame: His image was ubiquitous in Paris, even though he was anxious and doing his best to stay out of the limelight.There on the cover of L’Équipe, the nationwide sports newspaper, was Victor Wembanyama posing pensively with his eyes closed and a basketball pressed to his forehead. At the modern art museum at Centre Pompidou, images of the San Antonio Spurs center leaping for a dunk beamed from a video board that was several stories tall. Tourists standing on the Montparnasse Tower’s observation deck, some two miles away, easily could make out his likeness. And Nike included Wembanyama in its official Olympics commercial, positioning the NBA’s unanimous rookie of the year alongside LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo.Yet Wembanyama and his teammates didn’t participate in Friday’s Opening Ceremonies, a notable absence that turned their 78-66 opening win over Brazil on Saturday into a grand reveal for the 7-foot-4 sensation. Facing the pressures of being the host country and living up to its silver medal finish at the Tokyo Olympics, France traded the pomp and circumstance of the Seine procession for what center Rudy Gobert called the “security and tranquility” of Lille, the charming city of 230,000 that is hosting the group stage of the men’s and women’s basketball tournaments.The getaway gave the French an opportunity to lick their wounds after a 2-4 showing in an exhibition run that included losses to Germany, Serbia, Canada and Australia. It also allowed Coach Vincent Collet to counsel Wembanyama about managing the outsize expectations that come with his first Olympics. France’s basketball program has produced a four-time NBA champion in Tony Parker and a four-time defensive player of the year in Gobert, but Wembanyama is the country’s first basketball phenomenon — a hardwood complement to soccer megastar Kylian Mbappé.“People who know basketball understand he’s only 20 years old,” Collet said. “The people who like sports but don’t know basketball, they think Victor is already Michael Jordan. … A few days before the game, I felt he was a little bit stressed. We talked together. Everybody on the team tried to help him. He’s so mature. Day by day, he got better with that.”Lille delights in its devotion to Wembanyama, the No. 1 pick in the 2023 NBA draft and the heir to a French team seeking its first Olympic gold. This past week, fans in the city center donned several versions of his jerseys, including his No. 32 for France and No. 1 for the Spurs. Bshop, the city’s main basketball apparel store, constructed a large display in his honor next to murals of Jordan and Kobe Bryant.Inside suburban Stade Pierre-Mauroy, which was packed with 27,000 on Saturday, a group of die-hards banged drums, chanted encouragement and roared when Wembanyama took control of the game in the second quarter. Many fans held signs addressed to “Wemby,” including a young woman who scrawled a marriage proposal across France’s tricolor flag.Putting aside the adulation, Wembanyama finds himself in a tricky spot. Despite being one of the headliners of the men’s basketball tournament, he’s also the new guy on a veteran-dominated roster that includes program mainstays Gobert, Nicolas Batum and Evan Fournier. The big question entering the Games: Would Wembanyama fit into the experienced roster, or would the group morph around him?“I’m taking everything that’s given to me and communicating a lot with my teammates,” Wembanyama said. “It’s about sacrifices. Inside, we have two of the very best players in the EuroLeague and two front-runners for [NBA] defensive player of the year. We’re all ready to give our spot to the next guy. The guys here who have played together for a long time know each other. I like the way they’ve tried to install me in the system.”It was Wembanyama who sorted out the pecking order when he shook France out of its first-quarter nerves with impressive baskets in the paint. He twirled, stretched and dunked — using his game-changing wingspan to full effect against a Brazilian front line that tried its best to muscle him away from the paint. Wembanyama displayed excellent technique establishing position to receive entry passes, and he made decisive and powerful moves to set up highlight dunks with both hands.On the defensive end, Wembanyama and Gobert made their presence felt by blocking shots on the same possession and scaring Brazil’s guards out of the paint. Even so, Collet went away from the 32-year-old Gobert more than he has in past international tournaments. By breaking up his twin towers combination, France’s coach created more offensive space and better scoring opportunities for Wembanyama.By halftime of his Olympic debut, the prodigy had seized control of his national team. Wembanyama finished with a sparkling line of 19 points, nine rebounds, four steals and three blocks, and he sealed a comeback victory by finishing a lob dunk in the closing minute.“He’s obviously already our leader,” Collet said. “For Victor, the main thing was to go inside, where he’s sure to dominate every time. If he plays too much on the perimeter, he’s like any other player: Some nights you make the shots, and some nights you don’t.”Though France survived some shaky backcourt play, the victory was crucial to its medal hopes. With a win against overmatched Japan on Tuesday, France can virtually guarantee a trip to Paris for the quarterfinals.The French formula for a medal will require better production from its guards and more consistent intensity on defense. Even if those plans don’t materialize, Wembanyama should get the opportunity to fully test the boundaries of his game thanks to France’s veterans, who understand the program’s future has arrived ahead of schedule.“[Wembanyama] knows who he is,” Batum said. “He knows what he has to do to be great. Take us home. That’s who you are right now. He’s not scared of the moment.”"
WaPo_84,"A priest sues Grindr after he was outed, his lawsuit says",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/27/priest-grindr-privacy-lawsuit/,2024-07-28 04:48:02.810686,,"When Monsignor Jeffrey Burrill began using queer dating app Grindr in 2017, there was no indication that people outside of the app could access his data, according to a new lawsuit. If there had been, the lawsuit said, he never would’ve downloaded it.After all, Burrill’s position as the top administrator of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) required him to take a vow of celibacy, and Catholic teaching opposes sexual activity outside heterosexual marriage.But in 2021, a Catholic media site reported that Burrill had been using the app, news that forced him to resign from his position, according to the lawsuit, which Burrill filed against Grindr last week in California Superior Court.Burrill alleged that Grindr did not protect his data and inform him that vendors could access it, leading him to lose his job and suffer “significant damage” to his reputation.Grindr did not respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post on Saturday morning, but a company spokesperson told Law360 that he “intends to respond vigorously to these allegations, which are based on mischaracterizations of practices relating to user data.”James Carr, an attorney representing Burrill, wrote to Grindr last month that his client was “publicly ‘outed’ as gay” as a result of his data being released, according to a copy of the letter.“To have that decision forced out of your hands and into the public realm is reprehensible,” Carr told The Post on Saturday.Burrill’s resignation made national headlines in July 2021, dividing Catholics and reflecting a shift in traditional church power dynamics, with some churchgoers now in positions to pressure bishops. It also shed light on the issues surrounding data privacy.His resignation came around the same time that the Pillar, an online newsletter that covers the Catholic Church and that is not a defendant in the lawsuit, reported that it had collected information about Burrill from Grindr that showed he visited gay bars. The news site said it hired an independent firm to authenticate the information.The USCCB asked Burrill to resign after it received his Grindr data from the Catholic Laity and Clergy for Renewal (CLCR), a Denver nonprofit organization that aims to support churches, said Gregory Helmer, an attorney representing Burrill. A USCCB spokeswoman told The Post at the time that Burrill decided to resign after allegations of his “improper behavior” were released.Jayd Henricks, the president of the CLCR, wrote in an email to The Post on Saturday that the organization retrieved Grindr data to help Catholic bishops “assist their priests and seminarians in living their priestly vows.” He denied sharing information with the Pillar, which has not revealed its source.Grindr sold Burrill’s data from between 2017 and 2021 to companies and data vendors, the lawsuit said. Henricks wrote in religious journal First Things last year that the CLCR bought the “publicly available data” in an “ordinary way.” But Helmer hopes to learn in court where the organization obtained the data.“We want answers so we can use that as a warning to other Grindr users,” Helmer said.In June 2022, Burrill’s bishop, William Callahan, appointed Burrill the parochial administrator of a parish in La Crosse, Wis. But Burrill is still “trying to get back on his feet” after suffering from “shame and embarrassment,” Helmer said.Last month, Carr asked Grindr to compensate Burrill $5 million. When Grindr didn’t agree, Carr said, Burrill filed a lawsuit on July 18, requesting damages and an order that would prevent the app from releasing users’ data without prior notice.Chris Hoofnagle, the faculty director of the University of California at Berkeley’s Center for Law and Technology, said most people don’t read companies’ privacy policies, and even if they did, companies typically remain vague in their policies, such as saying they’ll “sometimes” share information about their users. Hoofnagle said some companies could find new customers by purchasing data from Grindr, such as a store that sells LGBTQ+ products.“There’s this illusion of control when users put personal information into applications,” Hoofnagle said, “and the reality is that there are an unfathomable number of security breaches, many of which we never hear about because they’re undisclosed.”Anton Dahbura, the executive director of Johns Hopkins University’s Information Security Institute, said the U.S. government doesn’t have enough regulation over data privacy to halt many data sales. Even as some lawmakers are pushing for more protections, Dahbura said the problem is getting worse.Burrill isn’t the first person to accuse Grindr of not protecting users’ privacy. A lawsuit filed in April alleged that the app shared users’ HIV statuses, and the company’s former chief privacy officer Ron De Jesus said last year that he was fired after he raised concerns about Grindr’s privacy."
WaPo_85,Harris and Trump grapple with a transformed race for the White House,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/27/harris-trump-election-white-house/,2024-07-28 04:50:02.810686,,"ST. CLOUD, Minn. — Donald Trump supporters lining up to enter a rally here passed the usual tents hawking MAGA merchandise, but suddenly most of the gear attacking President Biden (often in vulgar terms) was gone. A few straggler stickers remained with a phrase that’s code for a profane expression against Biden. New swag targeting Vice President Harris, the new likely Democratic nominee, had yet to arrive.Those sale racks were a small but telling symbol of how the White House race has rapidly transformed since Biden withdrew last Sunday. Democrats have swung from despondency to jubilance with a surge of fundraising, volunteering and meme-making, with one dance club thumping to an excerpt of a viral quote from Harris about falling from a coconut tree. Republicans, meanwhile, have struggled to adapt to Biden’s exit and settle on a clear message to define Harris, with just 100 days until the election.“He will always be my first choice, but she’s my second choice,” Trump said on Saturday of running against Biden or Harris at the top of the ticket.A new national survey by the Wall Street Journal found 49 percent of registered voters said they supported Trump and 47 percent backed Harris, within the margin of error, compared to Trump leading Biden by six percentage points in the same poll before Biden dropped out. New Fox News polls in battleground states found the candidates statistically tied in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Harris led by six points in Minnesota.Interviews with rallygoers ahead of a Trump event that was supposed to signal strength and a widening path to victory reflected the grab-bag attacks that Republicans are trying against Harris. Trump supporters referenced her role in the administration’s response to migration, called her liberal and criticized the process of replacing Biden on the ticket. Similarly, the pro-Trump MAGA Inc. super PAC launched new ads attacking Harris on the border, accusing her of covering up Biden’s health and having a liberal voting record.“I will proudly put my record against his any day,” Harris said at a fundraiser in Pittsfield, Mass. “Some folks would suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down … The true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.”Harris allies responded with a new spot touting her work as a prosecutor, state attorney general and vice president. The super PAC Future Forward said it would spend $50 million boosting Harris ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August. Another group, American Bridge 21st Century, is resuming Trump attack ads in battleground states.Harris allies are leaning into attacking Trump’s new running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), as out of touch with the values of most Americans, especially by spotlighting his three-year-old comments calling Democrats — including Harris — “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable.” (Harris has two stepchildren.)“You’ve all seen how pathetic JD Vance is, what a weirdo,” second gentleman Doug Emhoff said Saturday at a door-knocking event in Stevens Point, Wis., in support of his wife. “Seriously, this guy, the more you get to know him, the more it’s just ridiculous.”In a viral cable news interview, Gov. Tim Walz (D-Minn.), who has emerged as a leading contender for Harris’s running mate, warned Vance that he should careful about stirring the anger of cat people. The Harris campaign followed with a statement describing Vance as a “creep (who wants to ban to abortion nationwide).” Even before changing candidates, the campaign has consistently sought to portray Trump as dangerous and unhinged.Walz, in an interview with The Washington Post, said he wasn’t trying to drive a political message, just making “an observation.”“This is weird stuff — they’re way too obsessed with our bedrooms,” he said. “All of a sudden it feels like to me, people are pausing and saying, ‘You’re right, this just doesn’t feel right.’”Harris’s fundraiser in western Massachusetts on Saturday was expected to bring in $1.4 million for the campaign, according to one of the co-hosts. The campaign said it raised $126 million from 1.4 million donors in the three days after Biden endorsed Harris.The surge of contributions marks a reversal of fortunes for Democrats. As of June, Trump and the GOP had virtually erased an earlier Democratic cash advantage.Harris landed in Massachusetts greeted by busloads of local Democrats, Air National Guard base employees and a 4-H youth group. She took her time on the rope line, mostly posing for selfies.“It’s definitely a complete transformation,” said Valery Franco, a 23-year-old from Springfield, Mass., who works in recruiting at the nearby base. “There was a lot of discouragement about Biden and what we saw in the debate. People felt like they were choosing between the lesser of two evils. But with Kamala, there’s a lot more energy that she’s bringing to the table.”At the fundraiser in Pittsfield, Harris told the crowd that Trump and his allies have been resorting to some “wild lies” about her record. And she picked up the Walz line of argument as well.“Some of what he and his running mate are saying it’s just plain weird,” Harris said to laughter at The Colonial Theatre in Pittsfield. “That’s the box you put that in.”She also noted that Trump had “just pulled out of our debate.” Trump and a spokesman have recently made statements casting doubt on sticking with the debate that the former president and Biden agreed to have in September, hosted by ABC News.“I hope he reconsiders because we have a lot to talk about,” she said. But she also told the crowd that Democrats are the “underdogs” in the November election. “The bottom line is we have our work cut out for us.”The event included cellist Yo-Yo Ma, pianist Emanuel Ax and singer-songwriter James Taylor. Former governor Deval Patrick is among the co-hosts for the fundraiser, where tickets to attend ranged from $100 to $12,500. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who ran against Harris in the 2020 presidential primary, also attended.“She made a commitment to come here before this all happened,” said co-host Sherwood Guernsey, an attorney and former state legislator who leads the Rural Freedom Network, a political action committee. “She could have easily said ‘I’ve got to go to the swing states.’ … She’s got lots of other places to go.”Across the pivotal swing states, the Harris campaign said it was hosting 2,300 grass-roots events this weekend to mobilize supporters. Several of the events doubled as auditions for potential running mates including Walz, and Govs. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan.Trump, meanwhile, was scheduled to speak Saturday afternoon at a bitcoin conference in Nashville. The former president previously dismissed cryptocurrency as “a scam” and a “disaster waiting to happen” — but in this campaign, he started opposing “a Central Bank Digital Currency,” adding that to the Republican Party platform, after aggressive lobbying and major donations from industry executives.In the Nashville speech, Trump repeatedly attacked Biden, adding Harris almost as an afterthought.“We lost this wonderful person, you know he’s actually a terrible human being,” Trump said of Biden. “The problem is that Kamala,” he added, mispronouncing Harris’s name. “She’s worse than Joe. … She’s got a little honeymoon going on now.”Later Saturday, Trump was set to join Vance for the rally in Minnesota. Vance has been on defense over his past comments insulting childless people and advocating for a national abortion ban.Many St. Cloud rally attendees brushed off concerns that Harris could pose a stiffer challenger to Trump than Biden. They asked, rhetorically, what she had done as vice president, convinced she had little to show for it. Like Trump, many mispronounced her name. Some had seen the viral videos of what they called Harris’s “word salads” and predicted she would soon trip up again.But there was also a hint of apprehension in the crowd that the race just got harder.“I just feel like there’s more problems ahead with that happening,” said Kris Ryks, a rally attendee from New London, Minn. “It just seems like there’s so much money involved and so many people behind them like never before.”Knowles reported from St. Cloud. Reston reported from Pittsfield. Wells reported from Wasau and Stevens Point. Arnsdorf reported from Washington."
WaPo_86,Texas sues Biden administration over teenage access to birth control,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/27/texas-teen-birth-control-lawsuit/,2024-07-28 04:03:02.810686,,"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) is suing the Biden administration over a policy that allows adolescents to access birth control without their parents’ consent, arguing that the rule violates state law requiring guardians to consent to their children’s use of contraceptives.Paxton said in a statement that he was protecting parental rights, a popular GOP rallying cry used by Republicans to talk about culture-war issues such as education and transgender care.“By attempting to force Texas health care providers to offer contraceptives to children without parental consent, the Biden administration continues to prove they will do anything to implement their extremist agenda — even undermine the Constitution and violate the law,” Paxton said in a statement.The lawsuit, filed Thursday in a division of the Northern District of Texas that has one federal judge, is unlikely to change much in the state, analysts said. That’s because a similar case ended in March with a ruling that required Texas providers to begin obtaining parental consent this spring without wholly striking down the rule.But it is the latest conservative effort to challenge the Biden administration’s reproductive health-care policies and Title X, a half-century-old family-planning program.With that March ruling already in place, some worry this week’s lawsuit is an attempt to build Paxton’s political clout by ending confidential care for teens not just in Texas but across the country.“It seems intended to take away people’s bodily autonomies as part of a much larger campaign across the country,” said Robin Summers, the senior counsel at the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, which represents family-planning providers and administrators nationwide. “This would be terrible for the health of minors seeking this care.”The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Title X, has said it is within its right to prohibit providers from obtaining parental consent because its rules supersede state law. It argues that minors’ access to confidential reproductive care is crucial for their health. HHS did not respond to a request for comment Saturday morning.Confidential care can prevent sexually transmitted diseases and protect against potential infertility, Summers added, for children whose parents might abuse or disown them if they knew they were seeking that care.Texas has the eighth highest teen birth rate in the country and some of the nation’s strictest abortion limits.The new requirement for parental consent has had a swift impact on Texas providers and minors. In El Paso, one facility saw a stark drop in teens seeking appointments for contraception in the immediate aftermath of the ruling, according to a Texas Tribune article published in April.Carmen Robles Frost, a Texas mother of two, joined the state’s suit, arguing the Title X rule takes away her right as a parent to consent to her children’s medical care and use of contraception — though Texas facilities are already now required to notify parents of such care.Robles Frost also cites her Christian faith in the suit, saying she is teaching her two daughters to practice abstinence until marriage. Jonathan Mitchell, a prominent antiabortion attorney known for devising aggressive legal strategies to crack down on abortion in Texas, is representing Robles Frost.Texas entities receive approximately $18 million annually in Title X funding, according to HHS. Statewide, Title X administrator Every Body Texas serves more than 180,000 clients, many of whom are low-income, people of color or members of the LGBTQ+ community. The group did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday morning.The March decision from the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a ruling from federal Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who has been shaped by his antiabortion beliefs. Kacsmaryk’s ruling found that the policy denied a parent “a fundamental right to control and direct the upbringing of his minor children.”The appeals court, however, left in place the rule that prohibits Title X providers from telling parents about their children’s use of contraceptives because HHS implemented it in 2021, after the original lawsuit was brought in 2020. It required providers in Texas to notify parents, but it did not strike down the HHS rule more broadly.Paxton’s latest lawsuit seeks to clarify that ruling.Kacsmaryk — a former general counsel for a conservative religious group who is the sole federal judge in the Amarillo division and was appointed by Donald Trump — will more than likely hear this case, too. Last year, he delivered on the hopes of the antiabortion world last year when he blocked U.S. government approval of the abortion pill mifepristone. (The U.S. Supreme Court allowed access to the drug in June.)Summers worries he could provide a favorable ruling to Paxton and antiabortion advocates once again. If Kacsmaryk does, she expects appeals to be filed in a case that could make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court."

WaPo_88,"It took the host nation, and 69,000 fans, to end Fiji’s rugby sevens run",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/27/france-fiji-rugby-sevens-paris-olympics/,2024-07-28 05:46:02.770109,,"PARIS — In an enchanting motif of recent Olympiads, the great-big world with all its great-big populations and its great-big facilities kept straining to solve laudable little Fiji in one hellacious pursuit. Since 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, when the brisk sport of rugby sevens debuted in the Olympics with its 14-minute matches, the world had tried Fiji 17 times and had failed 17 times, all the way to the gold medal tussle at these Paris Olympics.Good grief, what would it take?Oh, it would take some things.To beat Fiji at an Olympics, the evidence from a booming Saturday night suggests, it helps to have a thunderous stadium with about 69,000 belters of the French national anthem, among them President Emmanuel Macron, next to a Fijian fan contingent tiny enough that their singing wasn’t audible upstairs.To stop Fiji at two gold medals, it helps to have a desperate star such as Antoine Dupont, striving from a bummer in the 2023 World Cup of 15 a side in France, before he veered to the sevens and the medal stand. It helps a lot if, pretty soon, he’s on a long, long run like some French daydream up the left edge of the field, about to feed Aaron Grandidier Nkanang to finish off a try that broke a 7-7 tie before Dupont adds two more tries to reach 28-7 and ecstasy.That’s how a nation of 68 million can manage to upend a nation of 950,000, then send its crooners rejoicing for a solid hour in the acoustic pleasure of Stade de France before they departed to rejoice more elsewhere.“To the people back home,” said Fiji Manager Osea Kolinisau, the 2016 captain who took the helm mere months ago, “we’re sorry we couldn’t defend the legacy.”Kolinisau had given a pep talk to his team about the value of a silver, especially given that Fiji had spent recent years dipping into a dry-and-drier spell. Perhaps one of those earthly fan bases where winning has made people exacting might brook some understanding.“It’ll be quiet, not like” previous Olympics, said Akuila Cama of the Fijian Broadcasting Corporation. “But still, people will be proud back at home, because we were not expected to win anything in these Games … It is like [soccer] in Brazil, you know. Everyone is a coach. But for this loss, judging from fans’ reactions on social media, they are still proud.”As one Fijian observer noted, they’d still go to church.They had themselves quite some night owing to the curvature of the Earth. When their team finished off Australia 31-7 in the semifinal ending around 4:30 p.m. Paris time, that was 2:30 a.m. out in the Pacific in Suva, the Fijian capital and largest city. When it started against France at 7:45 Paris time, that would be 5:45 a.m. in Suva.“The whole country’s obsessed,” said Waran Goundar, a Fijian living in Sydney, “and there’s more people overseas from the [United] States, Australia, New Zealand, they all follow. I think rugby brings the nation together.”“When Fiji plays, everything just stops,” said Ulaiasi Tui Tubou, a Fijian who has lived in England since joining the Royal Navy in 2000. “Everything just stops, people are focused on the game. After the game is finished, they’re back again.”Speaking at the stadium between the semis and final, Tui Tubou said knowingly, “Now, everybody’s waiting for the final now, 5 o’clock in the morning. Some of them will have a snooze. Some will be drinking kava, and then when it comes again, everything will be silent. It will be silent, [but then] you can know if Fiji scored a try, because the whole nation will erupt. If you didn’t have a television for watching, and you wanted to know, you will know when Fiji scored a try, because everything just goes Baaaaaah! The sound, just, boom, Baaaaaah! All over. And you’ll know, we just scored a try.”Tui Tubou’s brother in Suva had sent pictures of a family gathering of about 10 near other family gatherings close by. They showed people sitting around, waiting through the hours such as 4 a.m. From the stadium, Tui Tubou could picture some of them leaning back, eyes closed.That sound he impersonated did come to the 110 or so inhabited Fijian islands from among the more than 330. The fast, furious and free approach that translated to mastery in the semifinal when Fiji had trailed Australia 7-0 carried on. The Fijian players had sung the national anthem, “Meda Day Doka,” (“God Bless Fiji”), their mouths moving on the TV monitors, tears roaming down the face of player Joseva Talacolo, their trickle of fans inaudible. Next came the overwhelming wow of “La Marseillaise,” the French anthem heard so often at soccer World Cups of the era.Then play got going, and soon Fiji actually infused that crowd with obvious fret. One very large and fast man, Selesitino Ravutaumada, tore across and down the pitch before flipping to a very, very large and fast man, Raisuge Josaia, who went most of the rest of the way before casually finding Talacolo, who scored. Things quieted for a while, even in a sport without too many whiles.But France scored to tie before halftime, and right off the kick in the second half, Dupont caused that one really loud try and then scored two more himself.The world had overcome Fiji at rugby sevens after quite some trying, and as seemingly all of France roared and half the team wept with the host country’s first gold medal, the Fijians crumpled to the grass and stayed a while, and then Kolinisau had to give that old silver medalists’ talk. He huddled the team beside the bench while the French players ran to different sections of rapturous fans.“I saw them, they were really disappointed that we didn’t win,” he said. “I just told them, ‘Look, we didn’t win a gold but we won a silver medal at the Olympics. A lot of athletes dream to be where you are right now.’ … Some chase it all their lives, but they don’t get a medal.”He had come in so recently and had found standards lacking and had written enough “warning letters” to players, he said, that his manager got tired of it. Now he tried to convince them of the hugeness of silver and said, “I know the bar is set really high by the 2016 boys and the 2020 boys, and I know the boys wanted to keep that legacy, but I told them that’s no mean feat to win a silver medal.”With silver so often all relative, the world finally had forced that wee giant Fiji to ponder silver."
WaPo_89,"Toumani Diabaté, world music master of Mali’s stringed kora, dies at 58",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/07/27/toumani-diabate-mali-kora-dies/,2024-07-28 05:35:02.770109,,"Toumani Diabaté, a Malian virtuoso of a 21-string instrument known as the kora, who brought a rich West African musical legacy to audiences around the world with genre-mixing collaborations ranging from American blues to the London Symphony Orchestra, died July 19 at age 58.His death from kidney failure, at a hospital in Mali’s capital, Bamako, was announced by his family.Mr. Diabaté embraced his dual roles as an envoy and historian of a music-making tradition that stretches back millennia from the western Sahel to the Atlantic coast. His projects often explored how music flows across borders and between regions, especially the echoes of African rhythms brought across the ocean by enslaved people.“It’s the past meeting the present for the future,” said Mr. Diabaté (pronounced dja-BAH-tay).His connections to the kora and the music of the Mandé-speaking people go back more than 70 generations as a member of a lineage known as the griots, who act as caretakers of the region’s songs, stories and instrumental styles. The kora, a mix of a harp and lute, has been a fixture of classical West African music for centuries.The kora’s plucked strings can create a dulcimer-like range with an interplay of bass notes and cascading and lilting melodies. “When you listen, it’s like three men playing at the same time,” he told Songlines magazine in 2018, “and I learned the kora that way.”His family included highly accomplished musicians in the griot tradition, including playing a guitar-style ngoni and the kora. Mr. Diabaté was a prodigy. He said he never had formal lessons and learned the kora by listening to his father and grandfather play.Music also was therapy. As a child, Mr. Diabaté contracted polio and faced a long recovery. For the rest of his life, he walked with a limp and often used a cane. At 13, he gave his first public performances with the Koulikoro Ensemble at a national cultural festival, the Mali Biennale. Within a few years, he was touring with the band of a well-known Malian singer, Kandia Kouyaté.The group’s concerts in other West African nations and in France, Mali’s former colonial ruler, gave Mr. Diabaté a firsthand look at overlapping musical traditions in Africa and the eclectic experimentation within Western pop in the 1980s. He became fascinated with the idea of mingling styles.First, however, he helped introduce the kora to many Western ears — much in the way that Ravi Shankar’s sitar helped expand Indian music in the 1960s. In London, Mr. Diabaté recorded a solo album, “Kaira” (1988), as his first of many projects with Lucy Durán, a record producer and ethnomusicologist.The tracks are traditional-style compositions of Mr. Diabaté on the kora with no backup accompaniment. The album’s name refers to the anti-colonial cultural movement in Mali led by the griots before the country’s independence in 1960. “If you think of West Africa as a body, then the griot is the blood,” he told the New York Times in 2006. “We are the guardians of West Africa’s society. We are communicators.”The interest generated by his debut album opened the way for decades of collaborations on more than 20 recordings, including albums with a Spanish flamenco trio, Ketama, and American blues guitarist Taj Mahal on “Kulanjan” (1999), which included the folk-blues standards such as “Queen Bee” and “Take This Hammer.” He then worked with jazz trombonist Roswell Rudd on 2002’s “MALIcool.”Mr. Diabaté said the musical signatures of the blues — including the call-and-response-style chord progressions — were a tangible link to West Africa. “So playing with Taj Mahal means the blues is coming back home,” Mr. Diabaté told Australia’s Daily Telegraph.He later explored the African roots of the banjo on “Throw Down Your Heart” (2009), a compilation by American master picker Béla Fleck with various African musicians, and “The Ripple Effect” (2020) also with Fleck.On some songs on “Throw Down Your Heart” — a reference to a lament by enslaved people as they left the shores of Africa — Fleck played the akonting, a forerunner of the American banjo. “You can still hear the music, the slave music sometimes. … And when you hear the akonting music, to me, it really sounds like the music of that time,” Fleck told NPR’s “Morning Edition” in 2009.A concert by Mr. Diabaté with the London Symphony Orchestra was released as the album “Kôrôlén” in 2021. Mr. Diabaté said the performance was a reminder that “our music is older than Beethoven.” In one of Mr. Diabaté’s last projects, he joined with Kayhan Kalhor, an Iranian master of the bow-played kamancheh, on the album “The Sky Is the Same Colour Everywhere” (2023).“When I play with other musicians, I don’t play their music,” Mr. Diabaté said in a 2011 interview with Uncut magazine. “I play my music. And I don’t let them play my music. I say, ‘Play your music and I’ll play mine.’ We put it together and it becomes a new music, from the heart.”For decades, the Symmetric Orchestra, which he founded in 1990, performed around the world. The group, however, built its musical home in Mali with regular gigs at Le Hogon, a club in Bamako. Mr. Diabaté also found some of his greatest acclaim with another Malian musician, guitarist Ali Farka Touré. Their albums, “In the Heart of the Moon” (2005) and “Ali and Toumani” (2010), each won Grammy Awards for best traditional world music album.“The kora,” said Mr. Diabaté, “was a gift from God to me.”Toumani Diabaté was born on Aug. 10, 1965, in Bamako. His father was a renowned kora player, and his mother was a singer.After Mali’s independence, his parents were part of the National Ensemble, the country’s premier musical group. The first president, Modibo Keïta, honored the family by allowing them to build a house near the presidential palace in Bamako.Mr. Diabaté’s breakthrough came when the ethnomusicologist Durán visited Bamako seeking musicians for a festival in 1987 in London. Mr. Diabaté and his father were picked. Mr. Diabaté remained in London to record his debut album and began working with European musicians including British jazz bassist Danny Thompson and the Icelandic singer-songwriter Björk.“My father did not play the kora like my grandfather, and my grandfather did not play like his father,” Mr. Diabaté once said. “Times are changing. The world today is different.”Mr. Diabaté liked to call his kora a “spiritual instrument” that can be a force for peace. He also playfully joked about lore that said the kora can summon mischievous spirits, jinni, if played after midnight. His gigs in Bamako often went on until near dawn.In passing the griot traditions to his son, Sidiki, Mr. Diabaté joined him for two albums “Toumani & Sidiki” (2014) and “Lamomali” (2017), which featured the French singer-songwriter Matthieu Chedid. (Mr. Diabaté's son also became a star in Mali’s hip-hop scene.)Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.Mr. Diabaté once described playing the kora as “talking to your woman” because, during the medieval Mali Empire across West Africa, a female singer would often join the kora player and help set the mood. “It’s a real spiritual instrument,” he said, “and a magic one.”"

WaPo_91,"After ‘big show’ in U.S., Netanyahu returns to turmoil at home",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/27/netanyahu-united-states-harris-trump-hostages/,2024-07-28 05:25:02.770109,,"JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s first trip outside Israel since the attacks of Oct. 7 featured a packed and dramatic itinerary: meetings with President Biden and  each of his most likely successors, a globally broadcast address to Congress, and the kinds of confrontations with protesters and the families of Israeli hostages he often tries to avoid at home.Now he will return to see what effect — if any — his headline-grabbing swing will have on his many battles back home, including with angry voters, rebellious governing partners and frustrated military leaders.It will take time, and polling, to tell. But political, diplomatic and security experts here say the results are likely to be mixed, boosting Netanyahu with his base while not significantly shifting his overall public standing.The trip also ramped up pressure on Netanyahu to reach a cease-fire deal with Hamas in the Gaza Strip as talks reach a critical point, something he was pushed on by everyone from hostage parents to Biden to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.On Saturday, a rocket attack in northern Israel killed 11 people on a soccer pitch in Majdal Shams. The Israeli military blamed Hezbollah for the attack and Netanyahu, preparing to leave the United States, said the Lebanese militant group, which denied involvement, “will pay a heavy price.”The events in Washington and Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Palm Beach resort, probably achieved what may have been Netanyahu’s main priority: reminding his core supporters that he can command the attention of presidents and the world.“He got exactly what he wanted out of the trip,” said Anshel Pfeffer, a Netanyahu biographer and the Economist’s Israel correspondent. “He got a big show, the spectacle of being a statesman that he thrives on.”The trip came as Israel’s standing has been battered for months by its military campaign in Gaza. More than 39,000 people have been killed there since the war started, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children.Netanyahu could face war crimes charges, after the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced in May that he was seeking an arrest warrant for the prime minister for alleged atrocities in Gaza.His appearances in Washington and Florida, while massive protests dogged his motorcades, were potent counter programming. He was welcomed at the White House, an honor that Biden, who has made no secret of his frustrations with Netanyahu, had denied him for more than a year and a half.And his address to Congress, which aired in prime time in Israel and featured more than 50 standing ovations, may also stem some of the bleeding from his base, aiding his fight against brewing rebellions within his government and party.“This was Netanyahu returning to his well-known role of making the Israeli case in a prestigious setting in articulate English,” said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute. “It’s going to be well-received by those people inclined to support him.”But shoring up the base will not patch up Netanyahu’s cratering popularity among the broader electorate, Plesner said. Around two-thirds of Israelis consistently say they want the prime minister to step down over the failures that led to the Hamas attacks and for not negotiating a hostage release deal.“Forty-five minutes of speech and applause won’t erase the one sad fact: the words ‘Deal Now!’ were absent from the prime minister’s address,” the Hostage and Missing Families Forum, an umbrella group, said after the event.But in Israel’s fragmented parliamentary system, Netanyahu might be able to cling to power just by restoring his edge among the right-wing voters that give him a tiny, four-seat majority in the Knesset.“He doesn’t need a groundswell of support to remain prime minister,” Pfeffer said. “He just needs to move various needles slightly rightward.”An official close to the prime minister’s office, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues, said his inner circle was largely satisfied with a trip that forced Netanyahu to confront a presidential race in turmoil.Netanyahu had a meeting with Biden that was civil, at least publicly. He began mending his years-long rupture with Trump, who greeted the prime minister and his wife warmly and denied — contrary to several previous, sometimes profane, statements to the contrary — that the two had ever fallen out.But the team was taken aback by Vice President Harris, who has solidified her position as the likely Democratic nominee, the Israeli official familiar with the discussions said. Her behavior and rhetoric signaled that a President Harris would be tougher on Netanyahu than her boss has been.“Harris was a surprise,” said the official. “She was harsher than expected.”Harris skipped Netanyahu’s congressional speech for a campaign trip. After a meeting with the prime minister Thursday, she gave public remarks that echoed Biden’s usual statements of support for Israel’s right to defend itself but also emphasized her “serious concern about the scale of human suffering in Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians,” and “images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety.”“We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering, and I will not be silent,” she said.The remarks put Israelis on notice that a Harris victory might or might not bring a shift in U.S. relations, but it would probably change the tone.“It was mostly the same message but the music was very, very different,” said Chuck Freilich, a former deputy head of Israel’s National Security Council and a senior fellow at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. “She used this meeting to stake out her differences.”Talks for a deal to end the fighting and release the hostages still held in Gaza were a constant backdrop to Netanyahu’s trip. Negotiations are scheduled to resume next week in Rome, and U.S. and Arab brokers say the chances of an agreement are as high as they’ve ever been.The prime minister was beseeched to conclude an accord at every turn. Israeli protesters traveled overseas to chant “Seal the Deal!” sometimes standing not far from pro-Palestinian demonstrators shouting “Cease-fire Now!”Biden brought eight American hostage families to the White House to plead with Netanyahu, as did rescued hostage Noa Argamani, who traveled on the prime minister’s plane. Trump, too, said the time was right.“It was made very clear that everyone is pushing for a hostage deal,” the Israeli official said.Netanyahu said he thought Israel’s recent military attacks have brought Hamas closer to accepting agreeable terms, although there are key differences that need to be ironed out.But his political dilemma remains: If he allows for a cease-fire deal that ends the fighting in Gaza before “total victory” against Hamas, his most extremist coalition partners have threatened to bring down his government.Hostage families hope Netanyahu’s Washington trip, and the possible boost it gives him with right-wing voters, will give him more maneuvering room. Or at least give him more confidence that he could survive new elections.The prime minister’s travels also helped him run out the clock on the parliamentary session — lawmakers begin a three-month recess Monday — freezing any political machinations until closer to the end of the year.Whether all those factors combine to finally bring about an end to the fighting won’t be known for days, or even weeks, when the process in Rome concludes."
WaPo_92,"Trump faces backlash for ‘in four years, you don’t have to vote again’ remark",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/27/trump-faces-backlash-four-years-you-dont-have-vote-again-remark/,2024-07-28 06:54:02.645931,,"Democratic lawmakers and Vice President Harris’s campaign joined a chorus of online critics in calling out remarks Donald Trump aimed at a Christian audience on Friday, arguing that the former president and current Republican presidential nominee had implied he would end elections in the United States if he won a second term.At the conclusion of his speech at the Believers Summit in West Palm Beach, Fla., Trump said, “Christians, get out and vote, just this time. You won’t have to do it anymore. … You got to get out and vote. In four years, you don’t have to vote again. We’ll have it fixed so good you’re not going to have to vote.”Democrats and others interpreted the comments as signaling how a second Trump presidency would be run, a reminder that he previously said he would not be a dictator upon returning to office “except for Day One.”Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who is running for Senate, shared the clip of Trump’s speech on X, writing, “This year democracy is on the ballot, and if we are to save it, we must vote against authoritarianism. Here Trump helpfully reminds us that the alternative is never having the chance to vote again.” Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) called Trump’s comments “terrifying.” And Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) said, “The only way ‘you won’t have to vote anymore’ is if Donald Trump becomes a dictator.”The Trump campaign, however, says the comments, made at the event hosted by the conservative group Turning Point Action, were about how Trump would unite the country. Asked to clarify what Trump meant, Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for the campaign, said in a statement on Saturday that the former president “was talking about uniting this country and bringing prosperity to every American, as opposed to the divisive political environment that has sowed so much division and even resulted in an assassination attempt.”Trump, who has continued to assert without evidence that the 2020 election was rigged against him, preceded his comments about not having to vote again by telling the audience that Democrats “don’t want to approve voter ID — that’s because they want to cheat. But until then, Republicans must win. … We want a landslide that’s too big to rig.”The Harris campaign is calling Trump’s remarks “a vow to end democracy.”“When Vice President Harris says this election is about freedom she means it,” Harris campaign spokesperson James Singer said in a news release on Saturday. “Our democracy is under assault by criminal Donald Trump: After the last election Trump lost, he sent a mob to overturn the results. This campaign, he has promised violence if he loses, the end of our elections if he wins, and the termination of the Constitution to empower him to be a dictator to enact his dangerous Project 2025 agenda on America.” (Project 2025 is a think tank document outlining policy priorities for the next Republican president. Many Trump allies and former administration officials were involved in drafting the document, but his campaign has sought to distance the former president from it.)Trump’s comments also drew some concern among those on the Christian right.David Lane, an organizer of conservative Christian pastors, said in a text message that Trump “may have gotten a little over his skis” with what he said because it could discourage conservative Christians from shaping the outcomes of future elections.“Evangelicals in 2028, 2032, and 2036 must raise their civics game to a new level if America is to return to the Judeo-Christian heritage and Biblical-based culture laid out by the founders,” said Lane, the founder of the American Renewal Project, whose mission is to help elect more Christians to office. He added that “somebody’s values will reign supreme in the public square,” and if Christians don’t vote, their values will not be reflected in their elected officials.In front of a different Christian audience last month, Trump made a similar suggestion about Christians not needing to vote after this year’s election.At a Faith and Freedom Coalition event in Washington, the former president said Christians “don’t vote as much as they should.”“Do you know the power you have if you would vote? … You’ve got to get out and vote, just this time. I don’t care — in four years, you don’t have to vote, okay? In four years, don’t vote,” he said. “I don’t care by that time, but we’ll have it all straightened out, so it’ll be much different.”But if Democrats were to come into power, he said at the time, “they’ll ruin it [and] we’ll have to do this all over again.”Erica De Bruin, a professor of government at Hamilton College whose research focuses on civil-military relations, civil war and policing, said, “Trump frequently makes these kinds of deliberately ambiguous statements that can be interpreted in multiple ways.”But she added that “to understand what another Trump presidency would involve, I think it is more useful to look at his past behavior than to attempt to parse what might be the ‘true meaning’ of any individual set of remarks he makes.” She pointed out that the last time he was in office, “he attempted to subvert the outcome of an election and remain in power longer than the American public voted to keep him there.”Steven Levitsky, a professor of government at Harvard University, and co-author of “Tyranny of the Minority: Why American Democracy Reached the Breaking Point,” also said that while he didn’t think Trump’s recent comment was “indicative of an organized plot to end elections in the United States,” it did represent yet another sign that “the guy has got authoritarian reflexes.”“Over the course of 10 or 15 years,” Levitsky added, a growing number of Republicans “convinced themselves that they weren’t going to be able to win elections in this new, multiracial America. I’m not so sure that’s true, but they were deeply fearful that was true. And so Trump, I think more than anything else, he senses … where they’re going and they’re feeling.”Christian conservatives — White evangelicals, specifically — make up a substantial part of the voter base that Trump has been courting since his 2016 campaign.In both 2016 and 2020, a third of Trump’s support came from White evangelical Protestants. So 1 one in every 3 votes Trump received came from White evangelical Protestants, a group that the Religion Research Institute estimates constitutes 14 percent of the population.Levitsky’s co-author, Daniel Ziblatt, also a professor of government at Harvard, put a finer point on the significance of Trump’s comment. “I can’t think of a major candidate for office in any democracy on Earth since at least World War II who speaks in such overtly authoritarian ways,” said Ziblatt. “Not Victor Orban in Hungary, not Recep Erdogan in Turkey. Nowhere.”Jennifer Mercieca, a communications professor at Texas A&M University and author of “Demagogue for President: The Rhetorical Genius of Donald Trump,” said in an email that she interpreted Trump’s comment as an attempt to address the “double bind” that supposed “strongmen” leaders face.“They narrate a world of chaos and promise that they are strong enough to fix it in order to win elections, but they frequently don’t actually solve the problems that they’ve said that they could easily solve if given power,” said Mercieca, whose research focuses on the relationship between democracy and American communication practices. “I think Trump is here promising Christians that he will actually solve the problems that he has promised them he’ll solve (a full abortion ban … and various ‘culture war’ issues) and so with all of the problems solved, they won’t feel like the world is so chaotic that they have to vote to save the nation.”“It’s a big promise,” she added, “and he doesn’t give specific details here.”"
WaPo_93,A beach in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower makes for a ‘magical’ site,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/27/beach-volleyball-eiffel-tower-paris-olympics/,2024-07-28 06:03:02.645931,,"PARIS — At the Paris Olympics, the venues themselves are stars. Fencers will compete under the nave and glass roof of the Grand Palais. The brick-red clay of Roland Garros will host tennis players and boxers. Skateboarders will shred at Place de la Concorde. But no field, arena or stadium in Paris — or anywhere else, if you want the truth — shines brighter than Eiffel Tower Stadium.At Champ de Mars, a public garden in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, Paris 2024 organizers dumped tons of French sand and constructed a 13,000-seat beach volleyball stadium. One night after the Eiffel Tower provided a denouement for the Opening Ceremonies, it stood watch over the opening round of the Olympic beach volleyball tournament and provided a setting unlike anything else in sports.Olympic beach volleyball has taken the Games to exotic locations in its limited history, from the Horse Guards Parade in London to Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, the sport’s birthplace. But it has never luxuriated against a backdrop like the Iron Lady, and it is doubtful it ever will again. Good luck in 2028, Los Angeles: There isn’t enough CGI in Hollywood to match the setup here.In just one night, the stadium shattered the unofficial Olympic record for selfies taken.Drizzle spoiled the unveiling Saturday afternoon, but at night, Eiffel Tower Stadium showed off. As fans filtered through a dense tangle of security, the sunset’s streaks of pink and orange illuminated the tower. The stadium lights went down, fans turned on their phone flashlights, and the tower’s bulbs sparkled as the announcer introduced teams from the United States (Kristen Nuss and Taryn Kloth) and Canada (Heather Bansley and Sophie Bukovec).“That is what dreams are made of,” Nuss said. “Sitting there, seeing the Eiffel Tower twinkle, seeing all the flashlights around us going off, that will be printed in my brain forever.”The Eiffel Tower glowed orange as players below dived on the sand and blocked spikes, a spotlight near the tower’s tip rotating in the night sky. Nuss and Kloth, who met playing together at LSU and train in New Orleans, controlled their match and won in straight sets, 21-17, 21-14.Nuss admitted that during practice on the warmup courts outside the stadium, noticing the Eiffel Tower during points could be a distraction. U.S. Coach Drew Hamilton had attempted to calm his players as they prepared for their first Olympic match. “They’re going to hit the ball at you,” he recalled telling them. “Just hit it back.” He knew it would be a challenge.“I’m awestruck by it,” Hamilton said. “This is just unfathomable, and I know they feel the same way.”Once on the sand, though, Nuss and Kloth found a way to make the setting a mental edge. When Canada went on a run or aced them, the Americans leaned into all that surrounded them.“When we’re in tough situations, it does kind of put things in perspective,” Nuss said. “You’re like, ‘Hey, Taryn, look up.’ You stare there for a minute, and you see the Eiffel Tower, and you’re like, ‘Wow.’ It puts you back at peace.”Near the top of the east side of the stadium, artist Peter Spens set up a canvas on an easel and went to work on an oil painting of the scene. Spens, a Londoner, also was commissioned for paintings of the beach volleyball arenas at the London and Rio Games.“It’s definitely a challenge,” Spens said between brushstrokes. “But it’s great. It’s the iconic building of the Olympics. It’s wonderful.”Even the sand was spectacular. Organizers shipped in tons of sand from the Montgru-Saint-Hilaire quarry in Aisne, a department about 80 miles northeast of Paris. It turns out French sand is perfect for beach volleyball — the quarry also provided sand for Athens 2004, London 2012 and Rio 2016. The grains are mostly between 250 and 500 microns, which boosts the players’ stability. The sand isn’t too bright, which reduces glare. It also has a high silica content, which prevents the players’ feet from burning on a hot day.“Whoever made that sand did a great job,” Kloth said.“That is some deep, deep sand,” Nuss said. “It is definitely, I would say, pristine.”The stadium made even the losers feel grateful. Bansley had played in two prior Olympics, and while careful not to disparage Rio or Tokyo, it was clear she had found a new favorite Olympic experience.“We get to play in the best venue here,” Bansley said. “It doesn’t get better than that.”At the end, as Nuss and Kloth prepared for match point, American fans chanted, “U-S-A! U-S-A!” After an extended rally, Nuss caught Canada too far back and tickled the last ball over the net. It nestled into the deep, pristine sand. Nuss and Kloth hugged, the Eiffel Tower hovering above them, in a scene that did not quite feel real.“Oh, my gosh,” Kloth said. “It was so magical.”"

WaPo_96,"After Tokyo disappointment, Torri Huske is positioned for Paris redemption",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/27/torri-huske-100-meter-butterfly-olympics/,2024-07-28 07:53:02.835354,,"NANTERRE, France — Living through the race was painful enough, re-watching it was downright torture. So Torri Huske has mostly avoided it. She says she played it a couple of times that first year after the Tokyo Games, but it never got any easier. The result never changed. The difference between an Olympic medal and three years of second-guessing, wondering, lamenting: just one-hundredth of a second.“Even though, like, it sucked having to watch it, I feel like it probably helped me,” Huske says now. “Just seeing that race and knowing I don’t want to feel like that ever again.”She’s in Paris seeking redemption at these Olympics, to find the sliver of time that kept her off the podium and make sure the Olympic record books don’t remember her as a talented sprinter who was a fingernail away from glory. Huske, the 21-year old from Arlington, Va., is off to promising start, helping the U.S. women capture silver in the 4x100 freestyle relay Saturday night and putting herself in prime podium position entering Sunday’s final of the 100-meter butterfly.She’s certainly not dwelling on the past, but that race is a wound that’s still trying to heal. In Tokyo, she was just a year removed from graduation at Yorktown High and was getting ready to report to Stanford for her freshman year. Her skill level was high; experience and expectations were not.“Last time, the whole goal at trials was just to make the team,” Huske said in a recent interview. “And I feel like once I had done that, it was really hard for me to try to kind of change gears and be like, okay, now I have to set goals for the Olympics. In my head, I was kind of just like, ‘Wow, I’m here. I made it.’”In that Tokyo 100 fly race three years ago, Huske found herself in second place at the turn, but the last half of the race was a mad sprint with water sloshing in every lane. Canada’s Maggie MacNeil blasted her way from seventh to first, but only 0.14 seconds separated the top four finishers. Huske was nipped at the end. Her fourth-place time of 55.73 seconds was just a hair behind Australia’s Emma McKeon, 0.01 seconds that would somehow hang over — and influence — the weeks, months and years that would follow.“Even though it was definitely a setback at the time, it helped me in the future,” Huske said, noting her strong showing a year later at the 2022 world championships in Budapest, where she won six medals, including three golds.That growth was on display Saturday, the opening night of the Paris meet. Three years earlier, her strategy in the 100 fly race amounted to “fly and die,” she says. She’s more measured now, thinking strategically and focused on the back half of her race.In the Paris semifinal, Huske led from start to finish, touching the wall in 56.0 seconds. It was the second-best mark of the day, but Huske knows there’s room for improvement. She posted her personal best time at the U.S. trials last month, 55.52, the fourth-fastest time ever, though she might have to go even lower Sunday.Her U.S. teammate, Gretchen Walsh, won Saturday’s other semifinal in 55.38 seconds, just 0.20 seconds shy of the world record she set at last month’s trials, putting the Americans in position for a pair of potential medals in the race.Huske already got a taste of the Paris podium, turning in a tremendous leg in the women’s 4x100 relay Saturday. The Americans were running in fourth at the race’s midway point, when Walsh touched the wall and Huske leaped from the block.Huske went on to turn in the best 50-meter split of any of the U.S. women — 24.47 seconds. She reeled in Sweden first and then China, and had the Americans in second for the final leg. Huske’s 100-meter time of 52.06 was the second-best of anyone in the relay final, and gave Simone Manuel enough breathing room on the anchor leg to hold on for silver. It’s Huske’s second Olympic medal; she was part of the U.S. women’s 4×100m medley relay team that finished second in Tokyo, just 0.13 seconds behind Australia.“It was good,” she said Saturday night. “I get really nervous on relays, and I’ve been workshopping my start for the whole year. That I finally got it in a good place and I was just trying to set it up well for Simone.”Huske will also compete in the 100 free in Paris and could get a look in at least one more relay. It’s a heavy workload, to be sure, but she’s been focused on it since that disappointing 100 fly result in Tokyo. In the year leading up to these Olympics, she took a break from her studies at Stanford and paused her athletic career. She felt overloaded by schoolwork, emotionally and mentally drained. Focused solely on her training, she says, has already paid dividends in the water and out.This time around, just making the U.S. Olympic team wasn’t going to be enough,“I have more goals for the future,” she said."
WaPo_97,"It was 90 in D.C. on Saturday, but it was also a great day.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/27/weather-washington-warm-dry-cool/,2024-07-28 07:47:02.835354,,"It was 90 degrees in the District on Saturday once again, but it demonstrated how delightful even a 90-degree day can be when the sweet summer air is totally lacking in humidity.Saturday was also notable for the coolness of the morning, when the mercury in D.C. descended to a pleasant and comfortable level that had not been encountered here in weeks.A few minutes before sunrise, the thermometer proclaimed that the temperature in Washington was only 68 degrees. It was a July milestone of minimalism.Even in the strictly numerical sense, that 68 proclaimed a definite victory over the steamy forces of  summer.Although it may have occurred too suddenly to organize a celebration, that 68-degree reading marked the first time in a substantial period of punishing heat that Washington had  been cooler than 70 degrees.On July 2 the low was 66 degrees. Since then the low temperature each day had been in the 70s. That is, when it was not in the 80s.One of the best techniques for summertime survival in an often-steamy city like Washington is to enjoy the consolations of cool shelter at night. But high nighttime temperatures frustrate that effort. Thus, Saturday’s morning low of 68 degrees seemed enough in itself to make the day  worth welcoming. That reading is the average low temperature in D.C. in the middle of June, a month with a far better meteorological reputation than July.Among the other delights, large and small, offered by Saturday was the sight of the moon during morning daylight. Waning, but still more than half full, it rode high in the west,  an almost ghostly apparition in a blue sky.Around 9:30 a.m., it seemed to be an isolated presence, unaccompanied by any cloud in an expanse of sky that showed the barest hint of summertime haze.The temperature was in the low 80s. A dew point on the border between the 50s and 60s confirmed a suspicion that humidity had temporarily abandoned the Washington area.It suggested the start of long sunny hours of summertime pleasure, of a kind of day that seemed to represent late July at its atmospheric pinnacle.It seemed benevolent and beguiling, filled with luxuriant but benign warmth. Clouds eventually gathered, but they drifted in a lazy, almost dreamlike way.Saturday seemed to be close to the peak of July enjoyment,  and almost everything about it combined to dismiss even the possibility that summer could ever be fearsome or disagreeable."
WaPo_98,"U.S. swimmers can’t take gold, or Caeleb Dressel, for granted anymore",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/27/paris-olympics-swimming-katie-ledecky-caeleb-dressel/,2024-07-28 07:59:02.835354,,"NANTERRE, France — As Caeleb Dressel flung himself from the starting blocks Saturday at Paris La Défense Arena at the end of the first finals session of the Paris Olympics swim meet, Team USA was still without a gold medal. There are few sure things anymore for the American swimmers in what feels like a transitional era for this powerhouse program, but Dressel with a nearly two-second lead in the anchor leg of the men’s 4x100-meter freestyle relay is still one of them.There is a reason the U.S. swim team considers Dressel its ultimate firewall against the encroaching tide of parity coming from Australia and other rivals, why the Americans would take 90 percent of Dressel’s best over 100 percent of someone else, why they chose him over some faster, younger teammates — the ones who built him that lead Saturday night — for the crucial anchor leg.When Dressel, 27, touched the wall more than a second clear of the Australian to his right, Team USA had that first gold medal, with Dressel and the three youngsters — Jack Alexy (21), Chris Guiliano (21) and Hunter Armstrong (23) — finishing in 3:09.28, safely ahead of the runner-up Aussies (3:10.35) and the bronze medalists from Italy (3:10.70).“They made my job easy,” Dressel said.For Dressel, the victory extended one of the more remarkable runs in recent swimming history: He remains unbeaten in Olympic finals. Eight times to the starting blocks, eight gold medals. Though he isn’t the unbeatable force he was in Tokyo, where he won five gold medals and cemented his status as the premier male swimmer in the world, he remains an elite racer whose ability to get his hand to the wall is still world-class.“Relays are a little more special, to be honest. It takes me back to my first gold,” Dressel said, recalling his two relay wins at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games. “It really doesn’t get old. It’s really special standing on the podium with these guys.”The crowd that filed into La Défense Arena, a 30,000-seat indoor stadium that is home to the Racing 92 rugby team, cheered on the Americans with only slightly less energy and volume than it did the French swimmers in the field. After two playings of “Advance Australia Fair” — the Aussie national anthem — finally the last medal ceremony of the night brought a rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner.” On the top step of the podium, Armstrong was in tears as the anthem rang out.“I will give my entire body and soul up for these boys,” said Armstrong, who swam the third leg, of the emotions behind his 46.75-second split, the fastest of the four Americans. “I knew I had to give Caeleb everything I had, so I’m glad I was able to get my job done.”If Dressel’s presence at the end of that relay was a comfort to his three teammates, that relay’s presence at the end of an otherwise unfavorable race card on opening night was a comfort to the entire team. While the victory in the men’s relay prevented a gold medal shutout, the Americans already trail their rivals from Down Under in the gold medal count (two to one) and the overall count (four to three).Earlier Saturday night, Australian middle-distance star Ariarne Titmus turned a potential race-of-the-century matchup against American distance legend Katie Ledecky and Canadian teenager Summer McIntosh into a rout, touching the wall in 3:57.49, nearly a second faster than silver medalist McIntosh (3:58.37) and more than three seconds clear of Ledecky (4:00.86). For Ledecky, the bronze medal was the first of her Olympic career, to go with seven golds and three silvers, and leaves her one medal shy of matching three others for the most by a female swimmer in history.You would need to go back to 1988 — when they amassed eight gold medals and 18 overall, compared with 11 and 28 for East Germany — to find the last time Team USA failed to finish atop the medal table in swimming. But Australia, in particular, has been closing fast and outpaced the Americans in golds a year ago at the world championships in Fukuoka, Japan — a meet in which, notably, Dressel did not swim, having recently taken an eight-month mental health break from the sport.When it comes to the women’s side of the sport, the Australians have already surpassed Team USA for world supremacy, based on the results from the Tokyo Olympics as well as the 2023 world championships — both of which saw the Aussies double the Americans’ gold medal hauls.And Saturday, their women’s 4x100 free relay of Mollie O’Callaghan, Shayna Jack, Emma McKeon and Meg Harris (3:28.92) torched the silver-medal-winning American quartet of Kate Douglass, Gretchen Walsh, Torri Huske and Simone Manuel (3:30.20). Walsh and Huske, however, have Team USA pointed toward a potential gold-silver sweep of the women’s 100-meter butterfly Sunday, having finished 1-2 in Saturday’s semifinals.Like Dressel, Manuel, 27, has been absent from the international scene in recent years, having been forced into an extended break by a bout of overtraining syndrome. Like Dressel, she poured an infinite amount of emotion and energy into trying to will herself back into form. And like Dressel, she viewed her anchor leg as a mission she once thought she might never be entrusted to take again.“It just feels good to be back here, honestly,” Manuel said. “I didn’t know if I would ever be performing at this level again, and so just to have the full-circle moment of being on this relay again from 2021 to now, but in a happier and healthier place, I just think is really special. So I’m really excited I got to get my first Paris medal with these women.”Like Dressel and Ledecky, Manuel represents a link to the glory years of the past. All three earned gold at Rio in 2016, the last Olympics of Michael Phelps, when the Americans could still be counted on to dominate the medal table — that year’s haul was 16 golds and 33 overall, compared with three and 10 for second-place Australia — and the pipeline of talent seemed endless.To get the Americans back to that point, if it’s even possible anymore, is going to take more than the efforts of their veterans. The remaining eight days of this meet will show whether the younger group has the wherewithal to hold off Australia and the rest of the world for another generation."
WaPo_99,"Attacks in Gaza and Golan Heights kill more than 40, many of them children",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/27/israel-gaza-hamas-evacuation-mawasi/,2024-07-28 07:00:02.835354,,"JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hezbollah would “pay a heavy price” for a rocket strike that killed 11 people on a soccer field in the occupied Golan Heights on Saturday, sparking vehement denials of responsibility from the Lebanese militant group as the fallout tipped the two sides closer to all-out war.“Israel will not move on after this murderous attack,” he said, as he prepared to return to Israel from the United States, according to a statement from his office. “Hezbollah will pay a heavy price for this that it has not paid so far.”Israeli military leaders were meeting Saturday night to “prepare for a response against Hezbollah,” Israel Defense Forces spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a news briefing. “We will finish our assessments and we will act.”The IDF said the blast in Majdal Shams, which Israel annexed from Syria in 1981, was caused by an Iranian-made Falaq-1 rocket fired from across the border in southern Lebanon. At least 20 more people were wounded, the IDF said, adding that many of the casualties were children or young adults.Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, swiftly denied any connection to the attack, saying in a statement that it “categorically denies all false claims in this regard.”The Falaq-1, which Hezbollah began using against Israel in January, is an unguided, short-range surface-to-surface rocket “ideal for … fighting in dense urban areas,” according to Armament Research Services, a global weapons consultancy.The strike drew sharp condemnations from Israeli officials amid fears that it would accelerate the now-daily exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah into a full-blown conflict. Warnings of such an eruption have grown more urgent in recent months, as fighting along the Lebanon-Israel border has intensified.“For more than nine months, Hezbollah has been attacking our citizens in the north, firing thousands of rockets and missiles and UAVs … targeting families, homes and communities,” Hagari said.The two heavily armed adversaries fought a bruising war in 2006 but left the border largely quiet for about 17 years after that. Hezbollah began its recent strikes on Israel soon after the Hamas-led attack on Israeli communities Oct. 7, which killed around 1,200 people. During this conflict, Palestinian factions, including Hamas, have occasionally claimed attacks against Israel from Lebanon.This month, Hezbollah’s leader, Hasan Nasrallah, vowed to retaliate against Israel for strikes that have killed Lebanese civilians, saying his group would hit new areas not previously targeted. About 100 civilians have been killed in Lebanon since October. In Israel, more than 20 civilians — including those killed Saturday — have died.The group has launched rockets at Israel and recently sent surveillance drones over the port city of Haifa, evading Israeli air defenses. Nasrallah has also said Hezbollah would end its attacks if there was a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip.More than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed there since the war began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children.Hezbollah announced earlier Saturday that Israel had killed four of its members, adding that it had also struck several military targets inside Israel. The targets included what Hezbollah called the Golani barracks, shown on a map that the group distributed as being just north of Majdal Shams.The flare-up at the border set off a diplomatic scramble to prevent a wider conflagration. The Lebanese government said in a statement that it “condemns all acts of violence and aggression” and called for “an immediate cessation of hostilities on all fronts.”The United States, which has been leading negotiations between Israel and Hezbollah, via intermediaries, also condemned what it said was a “horrific attack.”“Our support for Israel’s security is iron-clad and unwavering against all Iranian backed terrorist groups, including Lebanese Hezbollah,” a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said in a statement.The incident in Majdal Shams also followed a deadly strike in central Gaza, where local health authorities said at least 30 Palestinians were killed when Israel bombed a school that was sheltering displaced people. The IDF said it targeted a Hamas position with “precision,” but the bombing left a massive crater and video and eyewitness testimonies from the nearby Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital suggested that most of the dead were civilians.Around 4,000 people were staying in the Khadija School in Deir al-Balah, according to Gaza’s civil defense force. Video from the immediate aftermath of the attack showed bodies on the ground and bloodied children carried by adults. At the hospital, doctors said they had received patients with full-body burns or their limbs shorn off.The IDF described the strike as targeting “terrorists operating a Hamas command and control center embedded inside the Khadija School in central Gaza” and said precautions were taken to “mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of appropriate munitions, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence.”Military experts caution that precision munitions still have the capacity to kill large numbers of people when they are used in densely populated areas. It was not clear which munitions were used in the strikes. A video from the scene, confirmed by the local civil defense force, appeared to show an unexploded U.S.-made small diameter bomb in the wreckage, according to Trevor Ball, a former U.S. Army bomb technician who reviewed the footage.Yazan Ahmed, 33, whose tent is near the school, said the school was targeted with what appeared to be four missiles at around noon local time. He said he went to help rescue people from the school and “the scene cannot be described. The limbs were torn everywhere. They were all women and children whose bodies were torn apart.”His description was echoed by other eyewitnesses. “There were victims everywhere,” said Fayez al-Toum, 21, who said he had been standing on the roof of another school building across the road when the attack began.Most of Gaza’s roughly 2.2 million population has been displaced by the conflict, as fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas militants has shunted much of the civilian population from north to south, and now back toward the enclave’s center.The United Nations said this week that more than 190,000 Palestinians had been displaced from Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, to the south, in just four days, as the Israeli army issued evacuation orders ahead of military operations there. On Saturday, the military extended those instructions to southern neighborhoods of Khan Younis.“Due to significant terrorist activity and rocket fire toward the State of Israel from the southern area of Khan Younis, remaining in this area has become dangerous,” the Israel Defense Forces said on X, warning that it was “about to forcefully operate” there and was adjusting the boundaries of an area that it has designated as a safe zone.It was the second time in less than a week that Israel has ordered the evacuation of a former safe area. On Monday, the IDF ordered the evacuation of an eastern sector of the city of Khan Younis, including an area in the Mawasi neighborhood that was previously within the boundaries of a designated safe zone for displaced people. Israel said it was targeting Hamas militants who had been firing rockets from the area.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been sheltering in the safe zone area, having been displaced multiple times since the war began.At a news briefing Friday, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres described Gaza’s humanitarian crisis as a “disaster.” The displaced were now being told to move, he said, “in search of a safety that doesn’t exist.”El-Chamaa and Fahim reported from Beirut and Harb and Cheung from London.

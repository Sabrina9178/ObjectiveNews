NBC_1,"As Biden dug in on continuing his campaign, Pelosi kept the pressure on",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/nancy-pelosi-helped-pressure-joe-biden-end-2024-campaign-rcna162943,2024-07-22 17:00:03.084934,,"WASHINGTON — Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi stepped down from her powerful perch leading House Democrats nearly a year and a half ago. But behind the scenes, sources say, Pelosi, a Democrat from San Francisco, played a critical role in delicately nudging President Joe Biden to the exits.
Although Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Pelosi’s protégé, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both of New York, also told Biden about Democrats' concerns about his continuing his campaign, three sources told NBC News that any time the issue of his dropping out began to die down and lose momentum, they viewed Pelosi as the one fanning the flames. 
Unlike the two current Democratic leaders, Pelosi is no longer on the leadership team and could afford to be more front and center in the effort to push Biden out after his disastrous debate performance last month.
“I think Pelosi continues to show she’s a master political tactician,” a House Democratic leadership aide said Sunday.
Throughout Democrats’ painful three-week ordeal, Pelosi never publicly called on Biden to quit the race; neither did Schumer or Jeffries. Doing so could infuriate Biden and cause him to become intransigent and never step aside.
Instead, Pelosi worked quietly and methodically, speaking to scores of rank-and-file lawmakers, members of her old leadership team and her large network of Democratic donors who had once made her the party’s most prolific fundraiser.
For those vulnerable rank-and-file lawmakers who reached out to her seeking guidance, two sources said, Pelosi advised that they “speak their conscience” in the days leading up to Biden’s stunning decision to drop out. A source close to Pelosi made it clear that she was not initiating conversations but fielding calls. On Friday, 13 congressional Democrats called on Biden to exit the race, the most defections in a single day, handing him what would be the fatal blow to his campaign.
“That groundswell on Friday of members calling for him to step down was all Nancy’s doing,” said a vulnerable House Democrat who spoke with Pelosi last week.
During their call, the lawmaker said, Pelosi asked twice about poll numbers — both for the lawmaker and for Biden in this person’s swing district — so she could write them down.
“The gist was that she felt our ability to take back the majority was at risk,” the Frontline Democrat told NBC News.
Asked how responsible Pelosi was for Biden’s stepping down, the lawmaker replied: “50%.”
It was all vintage Pelosi, who had made history as the first female speaker of the House and had ruled House Democrats with a velvet glove for two decades: guide Democrats to where they needed to go and have them make the decision.
In this case, the Democrat was Joe Biden. And all in the party knew that he would have to be the one to make the final call to bow out.
When Biden dug in and declared he absolutely wouldn’t drop out of the race, Pelosi appeared on his favorite show, MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” She kept the issue alive by saying Biden needs to make a decision “because time is running short,” even as he and his campaign insisted he had decided to stay in.
In a private phone call a week after her MSNBC appearance, Pelosi warned Biden, 81 — someone she has known in Washington for more than 30 years — about the realities of the 2024 race: He could lose so badly to their mutual political foe, Republican Donald Trump, that he could damage Democrats down ballot and possibly cost them control of the House and the Senate.
And after last weekend’s assassination attempt on Trump shocked the nation and appeared to stall momentum to push Biden out, a trio of close Pelosi allies brought the story back to the forefront.
Rep. Adam Schiff, a vocal Trump critic who is the favorite to be California’s next senator, on Wednesday became the highest-profile Democrat to call on Biden to step aside. Rep. Jared Huffman, who represents a Bay Area district next to Pelosi’s, organized a successful effort to delay the Democratic National Committee’s quickly coronating Biden as the party’s nominee through a virtual roll call. Huffman and a third Pelosi ally, Bay Area Rep. Zoe Lofgren, were among the surge of lawmakers calling on Biden to leave the race Friday.
No other Democrat understands the stakes of a possible second Trump term more than Pelosi, Schiff and Lofgren. Pelosi, hunted by pro-Trump rioters during the Capitol attack and later targeted at home by a man who fractured her husband’s skull with a hammer, appointed Schiff, Lofgren and others to the Jan. 6 select committee that concluded that Trump was to blame for the effort to overturn the 2020 election results and the deadly riot.
“It was certainly notable that so many of her longest California allies were so outspoken,” said Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., who lost the Democratic nomination for the Senate to Schiff this year after Pelosi endorsed him.
A Democratic lawmaker said of Pelosi’s strategy to affect the outcome she desires, “She deploys her assets.”  
A former Democratic leadership aide added: “Biden has a history of losing and winning. Pelosi doesn’t make moves unless she knows she will win.”
Asked about the impetus for her statement Friday, Lofgren didn't dismiss her proximity to Pelosi — they’ve served together for nearly three decades — but she said it was a decision she made herself. “She is not directing anyone to do anything. This is from me,” Lofgren said on MSNBC.
Biden was angered and hurt when Pelosi, his former running mate Barack Obama and other Democratic leaders declined to support him, sources said. But when he announced his decision Sunday, Pelosi was quick with a magnanimous statement.
“President Joe Biden is a patriotic American who has always put our country first. His legacy of vision, values and leadership make him one of the most consequential Presidents in American history,” she said. “With love and gratitude to President Biden for always believing in the promise of America and giving people the opportunity to reach their fulfillment. God blessed America with Joe Biden’s greatness and goodness.""
Shortly after he announced he wouldn’t stand for re-election, Biden quickly endorsed his vice president and running mate, Kamala Harris, to replace him on the ballot. Party luminaries quickly followed his lead, including Schiff; Bill and Hillary Clinton; Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, a top Biden ally and longtime member of Democratic leadership; Senate President Pro Tem Patty Murray of Washington, who is third in line to the presidency; and progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.
But Pelosi, Schumer and Jeffries haven’t yet endorsed Harris, a former San Francisco district attorney who has known Pelosi for decades. Given her track record, Pelosi could play a key role in either securing the nomination for Harris or helping a potential rival get the nod at the convention in Chicago in August, though many of Harris’ potential rivals, including a fellow Californian, Gov. Gavin Newsom, have already endorsed her for president.
Pelosi is “politically still our leader,” the front-line Democrat said. “She and she alone can ensure Kamala’s success.”
Not all Democrats believe Pelosi’s efforts have put the party in a better position for November. Some worry that Republicans will follow through on threats to sue to keep Biden on the ballot, arguing that to replace him would disenfranchise 14 million primary voters who cast their votes for him.
“Pelosi pushed him and left us with no plan. Is it Harris? Who knows?” a former House Democratic leadership aide said. “But I do know that Republicans will definitely spend millions of dollars trying to tie this up in court. It could be worse than the 2000 election.”Scott Wong is a senior congressional reporter for NBC News.

House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., and Minority Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., announced their endorsements of Harris for president.
After commending Biden for making the “patriotic decision” to withdraw from the race, Aguilar said the election “will be the fight of our lives,” citing abortion bans in the wake of the Supreme Court’s overturn of Roe v. Wade in 2022 and the need to lower costs for average Americans, adding that Trump poses a threat to reproductive rights and clean energy jobs.
“Moving forward, I will do everything I can to elect Kamala Harris the 47th President of the United States, defeat Donald Trump and take back the House from Extreme MAGA Republicans,” he said in a statement. “I know Kamala to be a fierce advocate for working families and a tough-minded prosecutor who knows right from wrong. I ask every American who believes in the rule of law, supports our Democracy and wants to keep America a beacon of hope for future generations to join me in this fight.”
Clark said she “proudly and enthusiastically” endorses Harris for president. She pointed to Harris’ support for reproductive rights, role in lowering prescription drug costs for seniors, effort to expand the Child Tax Credit, advocacy for affordable child care and housing, and help in pass gun safety reforms.
“While Donald Trump campaigns on dividing the American people and rigging the system for the rich, Kamala Harris will grow the economy by growing the middle class and defend our core principles of democracy and justice for all. I’m proud to stand with Kamala and excited to get to work to elect her!” Clark said in a statement.

Trump’s political team has been preparing to run against Harris for weeks, something it got one step closer to yesterday after Biden said he is dropping out of the race.
“We are pretty excited about the fact that he endorsed Kamala,” said Richard Grenell, a former U.S. ambassador to Germany and Trump’s acting director of national intelligence. “As we know in California, she has never been vetted. … Kamala Harris is a product of this whole system. She’s very far left, unvetted and untested.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., anticipates that Harris is coming into the race “bringing the receipts” against Trump, noting her experience as a former prosecutor during an interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”
“She’s been on the world stage, and she will have a unique ability, as a former prosecutor and a fierce competitor, to prosecute his past, his selfishness about his role in all of this,” she said. “And it’s going to be, I think, something like you’ve never seen before.”
Klobuchar, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, recalled Harris’ cross examination of conservative Supreme Court nominees who ultimately overturned the landmark ruling of Roe v. Wade.
“We believe women should be able to make their own decisions about their health care, not politicians,” she said. “Kamala Harris is going to be looking at Donald Trump, the guy that did the video this year that said he was proudly the person who overturned Roe v. Wade. She is the prosecutor, is going to be able to talk about what he’s done all of his felony indictments in a way that you’ve never seen before, and then she’s going to be able to talk about the economic record.”

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., denied in a ""TODAY"" interview this morning that there was a coordinated behind-the-scenes campaign by Democrats to pressure Biden to exit the race .
Schiff, who called on Biden to step aside, said he himself “certainly wasn’t part of any coordinated campaign.”
“And I don’t think there was,"" he said. ""I think you had individual leaders in the party looking at the polls, listening to people from battleground states and from battleground House districts, and increasingly concerned about the trajectory that we’re on.”
“It was hard for all of us, frankly, because we admire Joe Biden, we respect Joe Biden, and more than that, we just have tremendous affection for Joe Biden,” he added. “He’s a wonderful and decent human being. So this, I think, was hard for all of us in the party. But I can’t say that I was part of any coordinated effort.”
Schiff said he made his “own judgment about what I thought was best” in urging Biden to consider “what he thought was the right direction for the country.”
“And I think that Joe Biden wasn’t going to be intimidated or pushed or anything else,” he said. “He was going to make his decision when he was ready to make it. And you know, once again, he did what he has always done through his lengthy, multi-decade career. And that is put country first.”

Harris campaign spokesperson Brian Fallon said this morning that she raised $49.6 million from grassroots donors in the hours following Biden's exit from the 2024 campaign and his endorsement of her.
It's among the biggest fundraising sprees ever for a presidential campaign. Earlier this year, Trump's political operation raised more than $63 million online across two days following his criminal conviction in New York.

One thing hasn’t changed now that Biden is no longer seeking the Democratic Party’s nomination: Democratic convention delegates remain free to vote for whomever they want to be their party’s nominee, regardless of the results of the primary.
The only command to delegates under current convention rules is to “in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.” After a primary process in which Biden won virtually every contest and faced no true opposition, those “sentiments” were easy to predict.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer formally endorsed Harris in statements Monday morning, joining a long list of other Democrats known to harbor national ambitions who came out for Harris on Sunday, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.
And moderate Sen. Joe Manchin, I-W.Va., announced he would not be seeking the nominating himself, which he had been considering just a day earlier.
It's now unclear if anyone will even challenge Harris for the Democratic nomination ahead of next month's convention in Chicago, let alone pose a real threat to her.
Statements of support for Harris have been streaming in from seemingly every corner of the sprawling Democratic coalition, with no obvious pockets of opposition emerging so far.
State delegations to the Democratic National Convention came out in droves for Harris after holding emergency meetings and internal votes in the hours after Biden dropped out.
Harris' nomination now seems so assured that Democrats have moved on to speculating about who might be her running mate. 
Behind-the-scenes jockeying for the second spot began almost immediately, with potential candidates eager to do what they can to show their support for Harris.
Later Monday morning, the vice president was scheduled to make her first remarks since Biden dropped out and she declared her intention to run. Alex Seitz-Wald is a senior political reporter for NBC News. "
NBC_4,"In a California gold rush town, some Black families are fighting for land taken from their ancestors",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/california-gold-rush-town-black-families-are-fighting-land-taken-ances-rcna163014,2024-07-23 00:11:02.838869,,"In a tiny town where the California gold rush began, Black families are seeking restitution for land that was taken from their ancestors to make way for a state park now frequented by fourth graders learning about the state’s history.
Their efforts in Coloma, a town of around 300 people that’s located about 36 miles (58 kilometers) northeast of Sacramento, are one of the latest examples of Black Americans urging the government to atone for practices that have kept them from thriving long after chattel slavery was abolished.
Debates over reparations for African Americans often come back to land. That was at the center of a promise originally made — and later broken — by the U.S. government to formerly enslaved Black people in the mid-1800s: Give them up to 40 acres (16 hectares) of land as restitution for their time enslaved. 
For some, the promise of reparations has been nothing more than Fool’s gold, epitomized by a bill in Congress that’s stalled since it was first introduced in the 1980s, even though it’s aimed at studying reparations and named after the original promise.
The fight in Coloma is taking place in a state where the governor signed a first-in-the-nation law to study reparations. But advocates are pushing for the state to go further.
Gold was found near Coloma in 1848 by James W. Marshall, a white carpenter, setting off the California gold rush that saw hundreds of thousands of people from across the nation and outside of the U.S. come — or be brought — to the state. Those who migrated included white, Asian, and free and enslaved Black people.
Decades later, Black and white families had their land taken by the government in the town before it was turned into the Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park, which opened in 1942. The park today is home to a museum, churches and cemeteries where residents were buried. A nearly 42-foot (13-meter) monument of Marshall stands on its grounds.But the history of Black families who settled in Coloma only recently started getting increased recognition. California State Parks launched an initiative in 2020 to reexamine its past and to tell “a more thorough, inclusive, and complete history” of California, department spokesperson Adeline Yee said in an email to The Associated Press. The department created a webpage with information about properties owned by Black families at the park in Coloma.
Elmer Fonza, a retiree who worked at a brewery in California before eventually relocating to Nevada, said he is the third-great grandson of Nelson Bell, a formerly enslaved Black man from Virginia who became a property owner in Coloma.
After Bell’s death in 1869, a judge determined he had no heirs in the state, and his estate was sold at an auction, according to a probate document shared by the El Dorado County Historical Museum.
It is unclear what happened to Bell’s property in the years that followed, Fonza said, adding that the land should be returned to his family.
“We rightfully believe that we have been denied the generational wealth that our family may have been entitled to if given our rightful inheritance — the land once owned by Nelson Bell,” he said at the final meeting of a first-in-the-nation state reparations task force.Nancy Gooch, a Black woman, was brought to Coloma from the South in 1849 by a white man who enslaved her and her husband. Gooch was soon freed when California became a state and worked as a cook and cleaned laundry for miners. She later brought her son, Andrew Monroe, from Missouri to join them in the town. The Monroe-Gooch family would become one of the most prosperous Black landowners in California.
“We have to bring forth the truth, because that’s reconciliation,” said Jonathan Burgess, a Sacramento resident who co-owns a barbecue catering business, and who also is claiming land in Coloma was that of his descendants. “And then once we bring forth the truth, which I’ve been doing in speaking the whole time, we’ve got to make it right.”
Making it right would mean compensating families for land that can’t be returned or returning property where possible, Burgess said in an interview at the park. He said he is descended from Rufus Morgan Burgess, a Black writer who was brought to Coloma with his father, who was enslaved.
Jonathan Burgess also said his family is descended from Bell, but the Fonza and Burgess families say they are not related to each other. The discrepancy highlights the difficult work that could be ahead for Black residents if California ever passes reparations legislation requiring families to document their lineage.
Cheryl Austin, a retiree living in Sacramento, said she is an heir of John A. Wilson and Phoebe Wilson, a free, married Black couple who came to Coloma during the late 1850s. After John and Phoebe Wilson died, their property was sold through probate, Austin said. The state must somehow repair harm done to families whose property was seized, she said.The restitution fight in California comes as lawmakers are weighing reparations proposals in the state Legislature. That includes a bill to create the California American Freedmen Affairs Agency, which would help Black residents research their family lineage. Another proposal would make any families whose land was seized unjustly by the government due to racially discriminatory motives entitled to the return of the property or compensation.
The legislation, which is expected to be voted on this summer, reflects a growing push for restitution by Black families targeting the misuse of a practice known as eminent domain, where the government must pay people fairly for property it plans to make available for public use. The issue garnered attention across the state when local officials in Los Angeles County returned a beachfront property in 2022 to a Black couple, nearly a century after it was taken by the government from their ancestors.Earlier this month, California marked a milestone when Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom included $12 million in the state’s 2024 budget to spend on reparations legislation. But the budget does not specify what the money would be used for, and estimates from the state say the bills could cost millions of dollars annually.
State Sen. Steven Bradford, a Los Angeles-area Democrat who authored the proposals, said they will help the state atone for taken land, adding that land ownership is critical to building general wealth.
“Reparations was never about a check,” Bradford said. “It was about land.”

NBC_5,McDonald's to extend $5 value meal in most U.S. markets as diners return to chain,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/mcdonalds-extend-5-value-meal-us-markets-diners-return-chain-rcna163047,2024-07-23 00:00:02.838869,,"McDonald’s will extend its $5 value meal beyond its initial four-week window in most of its U.S. markets as the fast-food giant says the offer is driving traffic back to restaurants.
In a memo to the U.S. system obtained by CNBC on Monday, executives wrote that nearly every business unit, encompassing 93% of its restaurants, voted to extend the promotion past its original end date late this month. The memo said the majority of locations will extend through August, or plan to vote on whether to do so. 
The $5 value meal rolled out on menu boards beginning June 25 and was initially set to last roughly a month. It includes a McChicken or McDouble, four-piece chicken nuggets, fries and a drink. The combo costs substantially less than purchasing those items individually.
“Our message is resonating with our millions of customers,” Myra Doria, national field president, and Tariq Hassan, U.S. chief marketing and customer experience officer, wrote in the memo. “When our customers are ordering the $5 Meal Deal, they aren’t visiting the competition, and early performance shows this deal is meeting the objective of driving guests back to our restaurants.” 
Bloomberg earlier reported the decision to extend the deal.
The move comes as restaurants offer deals to boost sagging traffic, as consumers — particularly lower-income diners — balk at higher prices after years of inflation-fueled hikes. The meal has faced competition from other chains including Burger King, Wendy’s, Taco Bell and even Starbucks, which have offered deals ranging between $3 and $5, as companies look to bring in value-conscious consumers in a highly competitive environment.
The memo went on: “We must remember that driving guest counts ultimately propels our business and is the key to sustained growth.”
Coca-Cola kicked in marketing funds to make the initial value offer more appealing for franchisees, CNBC reported in May. Some franchisee advocates had pushed for future contributions from the company to make the discounted offering sustainable for operators in the long run.
The company is set to report earnings July 29.

FOX_1,RFK Jr says this is '2-man race' after Biden drops presidential bid,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rfk-jr-says-two-man-race-after-biden-drops-presidential-bid,2024-07-22 08:00:02.864516,politics,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. talks immigration, civil liberties and foreign policy as he pledges a return to transparent government and a battle against D.C. bureaucracy.
Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the contest for the White House is a ""two-man race"" and that only he can beat Donald Trump after President Biden's shocking withdrawal from a second-term bid.
Speaking Sunday at a hastily called press conference from his family's storied compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, Kennedy praised Biden while simultaneously blaming Democratic Party leaders for ""hiding"" his mental decline.
""I want to begin by commending President Biden for a career in public service: a long, long career and representing and serving our country and for his handling of the many difficulties and challenges, personal challenges and tragedies that he suffered during his life with so much admirable conduct and the empathy that he derives from those experiences,"" Kennedy said.
Kennedy, who left the party his family once ruled after it blocked his bid to challenge Biden in primaries, said the Democratic National Committee created a mess by covering for Biden.
RFK JR INTERVIEW: TRUMP, BIDEN 'BOTH RAVAGED AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AND THE REPUBLIC'""The reaction of the DNC to that obvious condition was to hide it from the American public and to use their power over the Democratic Party nomination process to make sure that nobody could compete with President Biden in a way that would expose his deficiencies,"" Kennedy argued.
Kennedy continued his campaign as an independent, and he has reached double-digits in some polls on a platform that decries ""corporate capture,"" the affordability crisis, and ""forever wars,"" according to his campaign website.

Kennedy also called out former President Trump as well as Vice President Harris, who appears poised to head the Democrat ticket. 
""President Trump has a connection to the American people, a populist connection,"" said Kennedy. ""But in many ways, it's the same fraudulent connection that we saw with the DNC over the past year, concealing a real purpose of their objective, which was to give us a president that … represents corporate interests rather than the interests of the American public.""
WHAT COMES NEXT FOR DEMOCRATS AFTER BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN SUSPENSION?
""If the Democrats do what I suspect they're going to do, which is to anoint Kamala Harris, a vice president who is monumentally unpopular within her own party … they're doing it because it's the easiest way to hold on to the money,"" Kennedy said.
Kennedy said he would consider accepting the Democrat nomination if were it offered to him.
""I would certainly listen to the party elders if they came to me, I would discuss something with them,"" said Kennedy. ""I'm the only presidential candidate who can beat Donald Trump, and if I were them, I would do that, and I would certainly listen to their proposals.""

""I wouldn't be the front-runner, because by the time I left the Democratic Party, it was really clear that, and this is the only reason I left that day, that the rules have been rigged to prevent me from winning,"" Kennedy said. ""So, I would be in the same position as [presidential candidates] Dean Phillips today or Marianne Williamson, which is, you know, sidelined.""
Kennedy added, ""I am very content running where I am, and I believe I can win this election. I believe at this point it's a two-man race or two-person race. Let me put it that way. And, you know, and that I'm in the best position to win.""

FOX_2,Trump calls for next presidential debate to be held on Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-calls-next-presidential-debate-held-fox-news,2024-07-22 08:00:02.864516,politics,"'America's Newsroom' co-anchor Dana Perino joins Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum to discuss the fallout from President Biden withdrawing from the presidential race.
Former President Donald Trump said the next presidential debate should be moderated by Fox News, not ""on Fake News ABC,"" after President Biden dropped out of the 2024 race. 
""My debate with Crooked Joe Biden, the Worst President in the history of the United States, was slated to be broadcast on Fake News ABC, the home of George Slopadopolus, sometime in September. Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC. Thank you!,"" Trump posted to Truth Social late Sunday afternoon. 
Trump's statement comes after Biden officially dropped out of the 2024 presidential race following weeks of mounting pressure from Democratic allies that he should bow out and pass the mantle to someone better suited to defeat Trump come November. The calls for him to drop out stem from concerns over his mental fitness and 81 years of age, which came under heightened scrutiny after his disastrous debate performance last month. 
""It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,"" Biden said in his letter posted to X Sunday afternoon.

The president endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president shortly following his announcement. Harris is the most likely candidate to run in Biden's place, but still needs to become the official nominee at the Democratic National Convention next month.

""My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it’s been the best decision I’ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this,"" Biden said.

CNN moderated the first presidential debate in June, with ABC News slated to host the second debate in September. Due to Biden now out of the race, Trump is calling for the debate schedule to be modified and have Fox News host the debate. It is unclear who Trump will debate until the DNC certifies its nominee. 
Trump and his campaign previously accepted two Fox News debates this election cycle, including a presidential debate for Oct. 2, and a vice presidential debate for a date that had not yet been determined.

Steve Scalise, R-La., demands answers from the Secret Service for the attempted assassination of Donald Trump on America Reports.
Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle will testify Monday before the House Oversight Committee in a hearing on the circumstances surrounding the attempted assassination of former President Trump – amid intense criticism of her leadership and calls for her to step down.
The House Oversight Committee subpoenaed Cheatle to appear last week as part of an open investigation into the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump was shot in the ear, while one attendee was killed and two others injured. 
In a statement, Anthony Guglielmi, chief of communications for the Secret Service, confirmed her attendance on Friday.

""The Secret Service is fully accountable for the safety of its protectees. We are committed to better understanding what happened before, during, and after the assassination attempt of former President Trump to ensure it never happens again. That includes cooperation with Congress, the FBI and other relevant investigations.""
In the wake of the shooting, Republicans and some Democrats immediately raised questions about the performance of the agency, including about how a gunman was able to get so close to the former president and fire multiple shots. In his letter to Cheatle, Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., had accused the Secret Service of a lack of transparency in issuing the subpoena.

""Americans demand answers from Director Kimberly Cheatle about the Secret Service’s historic security failures that led to the attempted assassination of President Trump, murder of an innocent victim, and harm to others in the crowd. We look forward to Director Cheatle’s testimony on Monday, July 22 to deliver the transparency and accountability that Americans deserve,"" Comer said in response to Cheatle confirming she would testify.
In addition to the Oversight Committee hearing, the House Homeland Security committee has called for a hearing and has subpoenaed documents from DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. In the Senate, both Homeland Security Committee Chairman Gary Peters, D-Mich., and ranking member Rand Paul, R-Ky., have launched an investigation. The DHS Office of Inspector General is also reviewing the Secret Service’s handling of the rally
In a preview of the pressure Cheatle may face, she was confronted by multiple Republican senators at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday.

""The buck stops with me,"" she told ABC News last week. ""I am the director of the Secret Service, and I need to make sure that we are performing a review and that we are giving resources to our personnel as necessary.""
However, in response to the intense criticism from lawmakers, the Secret Service says she does not intend to resign.

FOX_4,Trump assassination attempt: 3 key questions the Secret Service must answer,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-assassination-attempt-3-key-questions-secret-service-must-answer,2024-07-22 16:01:02.794696,opinion,"Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., weighs in on the investigation into the Trump assassination attempt, the upcoming testimony from Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle and protection for whistleblowers.
The American people are more than a week out from the attempted assassination of President Donald Trump in Butler, Pa. We have few – if any – answers as to why it was allowed to occur. 
As a former Secret Service agent, I have three crucial questions that we need answers to right away. 
1. Who Was Responsible for Securing the Building? 
There was catastrophic failure in defining and communicating who was responsible for posting and holding the building where the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, accessed the rooftop and fired at President Trump and rally attendees from on Saturday, July 13th.  
SECRET SERVICE DIRECTOR KIMBERLY CHEATLE REACTS TO INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF TRUMP ASSASSINATION PLOT
The way the Secret Service primarily defines and designates responsibility is through a series of events commonly known as the ""7 Phases of Site Advance."" All agents are trained in this process prior to graduating from the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Glynco, Georgia.
We assess potential weaknesses and points of interest where a threat could emerge. We need to ask how the information or specific assignments regarding the duties of the Butler Township Police Department became unclear.
Simply put, the United States Secret Service is a Dual Mission Agency. It's both investigative and protective. Though the Investigative Mission was the original purpose of the agency’s formation in 1865, in 1901 after the assassination of President William McKinley, the United States Secret Service began protecting America’s presidents, vice presidents and other heads of state.  
Over the last decade, the United States Secret Service (USSS) has been under a tremendous manpower strain due to limited resources. Numerous appeals to increase the budget for recruitment and to advance the agency's technological capabilities have not been fruitful.
WHO WAS THOMAS MATTHEW CROOKS? WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT TRUMP’S ATTEMPTED ASSASSIN
Many of these requests have been denied by the Department of Homeland Security and Congress. If granted, an increase was minimal to an already anemic budget.  Combined with the high demand for additional details to be stood up  at the request of current and past administrations, it has wreaked havoc on the agency and put additional strain on the obligation to keep protectees safe. 
The last three administrations have all added additional protectees to the responsibility of the agency and the men and women of the United States Secret Service. Yet, there remains a tremendous strain on manpower, hence the need for the agency to rely so heavily on the local authorities to fill the gaps.
I am confident what the American people will see as the investigation unfolds is that the ""rooftop"" in question was addressed as a concern by the Counter Sniper & Counter Assault Team who are responsible for the tactical advance. With that said, due to manpower restraints, the outer perimeter posts are primarily manned by local counterparts. Though the agency cannot function without their cooperation, the reality is that policing and security are not the same – one is primarily reactive and the other proactive and preventative.  
FIRST CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRAT CALLS FOR SECRET SERVICE DIRECTOR TO RESIGN OVER TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT
By using primarily reactive local counterpart units, there has always been a disconnect about why we in the security industry, especially the United States Secret Service, do things which those in the reactive industry normally carry out. For instance, standing on the roof of a building in the hot sun for hours to ensure the integrity of the site before, during and shortly after one of the agency's protective visits.
For the shooter in Butler, Pa. to fall through the cracks is beyond me. We need to know who made the call for the local counterparts to remain inside the building rather than on top of the roof. If the directive to be on top of the building was given by the agency, then why, prior to taking the stage or arriving at the site once the site posts were manned and the site was secured, was a correction not made? 
DONALD TRUMP’S SECRET SERVICE PROTECTION UNDER INVESTIGATION FOLLOWING ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT
2) Why was President Trump allowed to take the stage at the time he did? 
We must not assume, based on media reports, that the Secret Service and Butler Township police had information prior to President Trump taking the stage in Pennsylvania that Crooks was a person of interest, based upon media reports.
Based upon the writing captured in the online gaming platform he used to describe his ""premiere"" being on July 13, we can’t assume that anyone would know what his intentions were due to the vagueness of his post. 
TRUMP TELLS JESSE WATTERS THAT HE WAS NOT WARNED ABOUT GUNMAN, DESPITE REPORTS
We must ask how the information was processed by local authorities within his parents’ jurisdiction and if that information was relayed to Butler Township and subsequently to the Secret Service. 
Based upon my knowledge, skills, training, and professional experience, that statement alone from the parents would not constitute a threat. We must wait until there is a full investigation to be able to determine if the communications sequence of events is thoroughly examined to determine where the failure was and who is responsible.
Crooks appears to have impulsively put together a hasty plan within the 24–36 hours prior to the event. The USSS, for almost 3 decades, has conducted extensive research on these events and commonly refer to this as ""pre-attack planning."" According to reports, his parents notified authorities he was missing and potentially had ill intentions towards former President Trump. This is what we commonly refer to as leakage. 
There are now videos that have surfaced showing Crooks conducting what appears to be a site survey or reconnaissance. My question is: If the parents reported him to authorities and expressed his potential target as being President Trump, was that information relayed from the receiving agency to the Butler Township Police and further the protective detail? 
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON TRUMP AT PENNSYLVANIA RALLY LEAVES 2 HURT, 2 DEAD, INCLUDING SHOOTER
Speaking from experience, it is common to have reports of an unknown suspicious person at protective sites. All efforts are made to locate the individual by the designated Counter Surveillance Team. If located, those individuals will be interviewed by the designated Protective Intelligence Team to determine their intentions. However, if the information were relayed and the authorities had an unknown suspicious person on the ground and there was an imminent threat, I believe the following questions would be appropriate to ask those in charge:
* Why the rush to get the president on stage? 
* Why not delay?
Protective assignments 101 would dictate that you would hold off on having the person you are assigned to protect with protecting be put in a potentially life-threatening position. 
SECRET SERVICE RESPONDS TO REPORT THEY 'REPEATEDLY' DENIED REQUESTS TO TRUMP SECURITY DETAIL IN THE PAST
The truth is that it would have taken little effort to take a tactical pause, assess the situation, locate the person of interest and prevent what the American people haven’t seen in 43 years – an assassination attempt on a president. 
3. When will USSS Chief Kimberly Cheatle speak to the American people? 
According to reports, the United States Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle will provide testimony before a Senate Panel this coming week to answer these questions.

As a former agent, I know the agency has a ""One Voice Policy,"" which I agree with. However, this is a historic event. I, former colleagues, and others currently serving in the agency feel her lack of transparency and decision not to speak to the American people was a failure. We deserve better. 
To the men and women of the United States Secret Service, keep doing what you are doing. This is not a reflection of you but instead a reflection of failed policies, failed leadership, divisive politics, failed political appointments on numerous levels and those within the agency in higher leadership roles. 
Some may have forgotten that it is you who breathe that breathes life into the agency. It is you that makes it happen on a day-to-day basis. Stay strong, lean on each other, band together and keep your head on a swivel.

Vice President Harris’ presidential campaign has raised nearly $50 million in grassroots donations since President Biden suspended his re-election bid and endorsed her, Fox News Digital has learned.

The unprecedented announcement came as an increasing number of Democrat lawmakers had begun to publicly call for Biden to step aside and the party's leadership reportedly was engaged in efforts to convince Biden, 81, he could not win in November's general election against former President Trump, the 2024 GOP nominee who Biden defeated four years ago to win the White House.
Biden quickly offered his ""full support and endorsement"" for Harris to take over as the party's presidential nominee.
""It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your president,"" Biden wrote in a public letter. ""While it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interests of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term.""

Biden said he will formally address the nation later this week about his decision. 
In a social media post, Biden backed Harris to take over as the party's standard-bearer.
""My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it’s been the best decision I’ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this,"" Biden wrote.

The president's endorsement could dissuade any serious completion from other Democrats who may have mulled a bid for the presidential nomination and could clear a path for the vice president to succeed Biden as the party's nominee.

Harris has already gained endorsements from more than half a dozen governors, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul; along with more than 178 Democratic lawmakers in the House and Senate. 
Harris, in a statement about two hours after Biden's announcement, said she is ""honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination.""
""Over the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election. And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead,"" she added. ""I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party—and unite our nation—to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda.""
The vice president praised her boss, thanking Biden ""for his extraordinary leadership as President of the United States and for his decades of service to our country. His remarkable legacy of accomplishment is unmatched in modern American history, surpassing the legacy of many Presidents who have served two terms in office.""
A source familiar told Fox News that Biden and Harris spoke multiple times on Sunday ahead of the president's stunning announcement.
Biden's endorsement of Harris was quickly followed by two top party elders, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State and former Sen. Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee.
""We are honored to join the President in endorsing Vice President Harris and will do whatever we can to support her.""

LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, one of the Biden campaign’s biggest donors, also quickly endorsed Harris.
Former President Obama, however, has not yet endorsed her, and is instead backing a process where an ""outstanding"" nominee can emerge. 
""We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead. But I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,"" the former president wrote in a letter.
Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama were among the scores of top Democrats praising Biden for putting the nation and the party over personal ambitions.

FOX_7,Gen Z influencers rave about Trump VP pick JD Vance: 'He has what it takes to win over my generation',https://www.foxnews.com/media/gen-z-influencers-rave-trump-vp-pick-jd-vance-win-generation,2024-07-22 17:00:03.084934,politics,"Gen Z activist and influencer Christian Hodges discusses the impact former President Trump's vice presidential pick could have on young voters and the 2024 election.
All eyes are on Gen Z.
Former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy called them the generation that will ""eventually save America"" during his speech at the 2024 Republican National Convention. The Wall Street Journal has called them the ""toolbelt generation"" for changing the trajectory of work and education in America. On Sunday, President Biden announced he was dropping out and in such unpredictable times, both parties will be actively seeking the votes of young people. 
Some conservative Zoomers say Trump gained ground in the race to win over the youngest voting bloc by choosing Ohio Sen. JD Vance – the first millennial to be added to a presidential ticket – especially as age concerns ring loud and clear in the political realm.
""If we look at JD Vance specifically as VP, one of their [Gen Z's] biggest concerns is the age"" of then-candidate Biden and Trump, podcast host and Gen Z influencer Christian Hodges told Fox News Digital. He added, ""They see JD Vance as an insurance policy for Trump in case there is another assassination attempt, and it's successful, unfortunately.""

Hodges, author of the book ""America, Don't Give Up: Your Right to Freedom of Speech,"" has previously addressed lingering age concerns young voters have for the candidates, especially then-candidate Biden following his debate performance last month.
The political activist and conservative commentator says Zoomers – or members of Gen Z – are looking for a new generation of leaders to take the reins, and he sees Vance as a step in the right direction.
""If we also look at JD Vance and his background, he supports everything that Gen Z, especially men, are going towards,"" he said to Fox News Digital.
Surveys have shown Trump has an historic opportunity to win the largest chunk of the 18-29 age demographic than any Republican in decades.
""If you look at the top careers that Gen Z men are pushing for, they're going into careers like blue-collar jobs. Blue-collar is trendy again, and they're also going into finance fields. A lot of Gen Z is entrepreneurial because that's also trendy again today, and they're also going into the tech field in Silicon Valley,"" Hodges said.
Gen Z is shifting education and the labor force toward blue-collar trades, according to recent data from National Student Clearinghouse, which found an increase of 16% in enrollment for vocational-focused community colleges compared to 2022, along with a 23% increase for students studying construction jobs and a 7% increase for students enrolled in HVAC/vehicle maintenance and repair programs.
Hodges said Gen Z finds it ""trendy"" to be politically active and an advocate for a cause.
GEN Z VOTERS URGE REPUBLICANS NOT TO ‘SLEEP ON’ THE YOUNG VOTE: ‘WE’RE STILL UP FOR THE PICKINGS'

""I think we're seeing, especially on the conservative side, that Gen Z men and women are becoming conservative, and they're seeing that as a trend. So, whether it's trendy or not, we're seeing that they actually are becoming conservative and care about those issues, which is a great positive that we're seeing today. And I think if JD Vance appeals to them specifically, it just adds to the trendy effect that we're seeing among Gen Z.""
According to research organization CIRCLE, 41 million Zoomers (or members of Gen Z) will be eligible to vote in 2024, meaning eight million will have ""aged into the electorate"" by the time Trump and Biden go head-to-head this November. Their vote matters now more than ever.
Caroline Joyous, an 18-year-old conservative Christian influencer from Alabama, is one of those voters.
The host of the ""Fire and Freedom"" podcast told Fox News Digital last week that she was excited to see Trump pick Vance as his running mate.
""He's young, he's energetic, and he's got a fresh face, and he's just so fiery,"" she said. ""Gen Z is tired of these politicians who are just sitting up in DC [and] doing nothing, and we take a look at JD Vance, and we're like, ‘Oh my goodness, he’s actually gone up there in a short amount of time, and he's fighting harder than pretty much everyone in D.C.""

Every year, on July 20, our family celebrates the day my mother and I arrived in America. We tell the stories of our arrival, of our assimilation and marvel at the unbelievable luck that we get to be Americans. I feel blessed every single day. I look at my American children and know how fortunate I am. 
There are days when it’s hard to be optimistic about America. We’ve had another tough year. I hear from people all the time who are struggling in their everyday lives and find it hard to maintain hopefulness in their country’s future.  
It’s not that America hasn’t had hard times before. Our family arrived in this country in the late 1970s. There was inflation, everybody admitted it. Crime was high, no one denied it. There was immigration, it was through a process. American hostages were being held in Iran; they were frequently on the news.  
ARMED MAN IN SKI MASK ARRESTED WHILE APPROACHING REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION PERIMETER IN MILWAUKEE
The difference now is there’s an avalanche of pretense that we’re all supposed to accept. We’re lied to about our problems. It makes national cohesiveness incredibly difficult when we can’t identify, or admit to the existence of, the issues that need fixing.  
The Statue of Liberty in New York City has welcomed immigrants to America for many years.  
People are struggling to feed their families. Nearly 80% of Americans now consider fast food a ""luxury."" Yet economists like Paul Krugman at the New York Times pretend inflation is not happening. He posts charts that show, if you squint a little, and exclude necessities like food, energy, housing and cars, we’re doing super great.  
He is not laughed out of his position. His political side quietly hopes people will believe his lies, and they stay quiet as he delivers them. They know people are hurting, but to say so would mean acknowledging a truth that might affect them politically. They should do it anyway. 
On crime, we’re not supposed to notice how bad our cities have gotten. George Soros proudly funds prosecutors who refuse to prosecute crime. As he wrote in 2022, ""I have been involved in efforts to reform the criminal-justice system for the more than 30 years I have been a philanthropist.""

He has succeeded in reforming the criminal-justice system, and we are all less safe because of it. His bad ideas play out on our streets. We used to understand that committing a crime comes with repercussions. It no longer does. The change has been catastrophic. 
The border remains wide open and any solution to stop the flow of people entering illegally is labeled cruel. When we left the Soviet Union, we were granted passage through Italy. We were refugees and still we didn’t get to hop a flight to the country of our choice.   
We arrived in Rome and a refugee resettlement organization gave us a small stipend for rent and food. We rented an apartment in Ladispoli, a small beach town outside of Rome, while we applied for entry to various countries. We did not get money from the governments of either Italy or our eventual home of America. Someone had to sponsor our family and pledge we would not be a burden on society and collect public funds. How quaint the system seems now.    
And five American hostages are being held right now in Gaza. The president rarely mentions them. They were kidnapped on October 7 in Israel. In the 290 days since, Americans around the world have understood that should anything happen to them, their government will not speak up in their defense. The blue passport once meant security. It meant that bad people would think twice about harming you. It does not mean that anymore.

America is still the greatest country that’s ever been, but it’s hard not to notice our current slump. When we arrived in this country, the word used was ""malaise."" But the word for our current status is ""denial."" We’re a country in denial.   
Our problems are not impossible to solve, and decline is not inevitable, but it involves facing the reality of our difficulties. We have been through turbulent times before, and we have come out the other end. We’re a country worth saving, a country worth preserving. We’re all so lucky to be American. It’s time to act like it and defend what we have.

FOX_9,Joe Lieberman tried to heal our nation’s wounds by doing something politicians rarely do,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/joe-lieberman-tried-heal-nations-wounds-doing-something-politicians-rarely-do,2024-07-22 17:00:03.084934,opinion,"Fox News host Neil Cavuto remembers former Connecticut senator and vice presidential nominee Joe Lieberman and describes what made him 'very different' and 'very special' on 'Your World.'
The legacy of Democrat Senator Joe Lieberman will be honored in Washington on July 24, where those of us who knew and loved him will celebrate his life, even as we mourn his loss.  
We are mourning, too, what has been lost in the realm of politics in recent years, with a polity defined more by polarization than progress. Lieberman embodied the antithesis – always embracing an ethos of bipartisanship. Having known him since 1980, I witnessed firsthand how vigorously he sought common ground and contributed to the commonweal. 
Collaboration requires compatriots, and there were plenty to be found in those years gone by. First as state attorney general, then in the Senate, Lieberman routinely worked with Republicans on issues as diverse as the environment, school choice, national security, health care and the impact of entertainment on America’s youth. 
'NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED': BIPARTISAN LAWMAKERS PUSH TO RAMP UP SECRET SERVICE PROTECTION FOR CANDIDATES
The spiritual heirs of such bipartisanship can be found today in groups like the Problem Solvers Caucus and No Labels. Unfortunately, they are the exception, not the rule in a political landscape that for years has resembled the trench warfare of World War I. That ""no man’s land"" is precisely where Lieberman stood strong for the entirety of his career, as he built a rich legacy of accomplishment.

How did we fall so far? Harmony replaced by hostility; comity turned to conflict. I blame our descent in large part on the 21st century iteration of the cultural forces that Lieberman warned of three decades ago – namely, social media and its negative effect on our politics and on impressionable young people.  
With the rise of the social platforms, a Pandora’s Box has been opened, which no ""community standards,"" oversight boards or filtering tools can close. Algorithms encourage people to stay in stifling silos, and reward extremism, not moderation. The advent of artificial intelligence threatens to supercharge these ominous trends. As Pope Francis warned, ""in an obsessive desire to control everything, we risk losing control over ourselves.""  
Compounding the problem (and contributing to it), while social media has defiled the public square and degraded how we relate to one another, much of humanity has lost faith in institutions, and one of the most disturbing declines is the loss of faith itself. 
Lieberman agreed. In January of last year, he told me he planned to write a book ""to show how the belief in God … should lead us (particularly those who are in elective office) to behave differently in our governmental and political lives than we are now.""  
After he passed away in March, his son Matt let me know his father finished the book, and ""Faith’s Answers to America’s Political Crisis"" will be published by Post Hill Press on October 1st. 
This is a topic Joe Lieberman and I spoke of often, as we shared a deep connection to our respective Jewish and Catholic faiths. We didn’t always agree on the policy implications of our views – I am a pro-life Democrat (an endangered species), and he voted pro-choice, though we did work together on issues like opposing the withholding of hydration and nutrition from seriously ill patients. 
I traveled with Senator Lieberman on his first major campaign swing as Al Gore’s running mate in 2000, where he said at a church in Detroit, ""as a people, we need to reaffirm our faith and renew the dedication of our nation and ourselves to God and God’s purpose.""  
It is hard to find many political leaders echoing such sentiments these days. And it is even harder to find examples of faith in our culture. How often do characters in crisis in films or on television turn to God, utter a prayer or seek spiritual solace in a house of worship? How often does entertainment – and the larger society it reflects – seem to exist in a world where there is no God at all?

In spiritual contrast, Joe and Hadassah Lieberman and their family strictly observed the Sabbath, well described in his book, ""The Gift of Rest."" (I can’t tell you how many media appearances I had to regret for him due to his Sabbath observance.)

Joe Lieberman’s final book will arrive in the final weeks of a contentious campaign for the presidency. In the wake of the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, both parties say they wish to lower the temperature of intemperate rhetoric. Big, if true, as they say on X.  
Because ascribing the most hateful of motives to the other side builds walls, not bridges. And that is no way to run a country, no way to better the world and no way to lead a life. Lieberman knew that, and while he would vigorously defend his point of view, he never resorted to vitriol and always treated his opponents with respect. 
""Maybe America needs another Religious Awakening, like those that have helped us through awful times in our history before,"" Lieberman wrote in his book proposal.

I agree, and if we fail to be awakened, are we bound to be ""sinners in the hands of an angry God,"" as Jonathan Edwards preached at the start of the first Great Awakening in 1741? Are we ""storing up wrath"" for ourselves, as Saint Paul wrote to the Romans?

As bad as things seem, could they not get so much worse if we don’t chart a more faithful course? I fear God may witness the cynically secular belief that there is no divinity in the universe, no soul in our nature, no life after death (""Imagine there's no heaven"") and no reason to pray, and He will say, as the Lord spoke to Moses, ""My anger will flare up against them; I will forsake them and hide My face from them; they will become a prey to be devoured, and much evil and distress will befall them"" (Deuteronomy 31:27-18). Indeed, a civilization devoid of God’s love would be Hell on Earth.  
God forbid. And in the meantime, I pray that Joe Lieberman’s book will prove to be a transcendent October surprise, and like the balm in Gilead, speed the healing of all those political wounds that have been become so infected in this secular, algorithmic age.

FOX_10,Embattled Secret Service director to tell top House committee 'we failed' to protect Trump,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/embattled-secret-service-director-face-grilling-from-top-house-committee-over-trump-shooting,2024-07-22 19:00:02.680756,politics,"Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., demands answers from the Secret Service for the attempted assassination of Donald Trump on America Reports.
Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle will testify Monday before the House Oversight Committee in a hearing on the circumstances surrounding the attempted assassination of former President Trump – amid intense criticism of her leadership and calls for her to step down.
The House Oversight Committee subpoenaed Cheatle to appear last week as part of an open investigation into the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump was shot in the ear, while one attendee was killed and two others injured. 
In a statement, Anthony Guglielmi, chief of communications for the Secret Service, confirmed her attendance on Friday, and ABC News has since reported excerpts of testimony Cheatle is expected to deliver.
""The Secret Service’s solemn mission is to protect our nation’s leaders. On July 13th, we failed,"" Cheatle is expected to tell the committee on Monday. ""As the Director of the United States Secret Service, I take full responsibility for any security lapse. As an agency, we are fully cooperating with the FBI’s investigation, the oversight you have initiated here, and conducting our own internal mission assurance review at my direction. Likewise, we will cooperate with the pending external review and the DHS Office of the Inspector General.""

In the wake of the shooting, Republicans and some Democrats immediately raised questions about the performance of the agency, including about how a gunman was able to get so close to the former president and fire multiple shots. In his letter to Cheatle, Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., had accused the Secret Service of a lack of transparency in issuing the subpoena.
""Americans demand answers from Director Kimberly Cheatle about the Secret Service’s historic security failures that led to the attempted assassination of President Trump, murder of an innocent victim, and harm to others in the crowd. We look forward to Director Cheatle’s testimony on Monday, July 22 to deliver the transparency and accountability that Americans deserve,"" Comer said in response to Cheatle confirming she would testify.

In addition to the Oversight Committee hearing, the House Homeland Security committee has called for a hearing and subpoenaed documents from DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. In the Senate, both Homeland Security Committee Chairman Gary Peters, D-Mich., and ranking member Rand Paul, R-Ky., have launched an investigation. The DHS Office of Inspector General is also reviewing the Secret Service’s handling of the rally.
In a preview of the pressure Cheatle may face, she was confronted by multiple Republican senators at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday.
""This was an assassination attempt, you owe the people answers, you owe President Trump answers,"" Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., said.

Cheatle, meanwhile, has called the shooting ""unacceptable"" and ""something that shouldn’t happen again."" She is expected to tell the committee Monday that she will move ""heaven and earth"" to make sure what happened on July 13 never does again, according to the excerpts obtained by ABC News. 
""Our mission is not political. It is literally a matter of life and death, as the tragic events on July 13th remind us. I have full confidence in the men and women of the Secret Service,"" she is expected to tell the committee. ""They are worthy of our support in executing our protective mission.""
However, in response to the intense criticism from lawmakers, the Secret Service says she does not intend to resign.

""Continuity of operations is paramount during a critical incident and U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle has no intentions to step down,"" Guglielmi said. ""She deeply respects members of Congress and is fiercely committed to transparency in leading the Secret Service through the internal investigation and strengthening the agency through lessons learned in these important internal and external reviews.""

FOX_12,Biden's rent-control plan will only make America’s housing crisis worse,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/bidens-rent-control-plan-only-make-americas-housing-crisis-worse,2024-07-22 19:01:02.680756,opinion,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
President Joe Biden is suggesting that a federal limit on annual rent increases in residential units will ease housing costs. This is what happens when economist Milton Friedman isn't ""running the show"": Policymakers follow ideas that make the problem they say they're solving infinitely worse. 
""While the prior administration gave special tax breaks to corporate landlords, I'm working to lower housing costs for families,"" Biden said Tuesday. He urged congressional Republicans to ""join Democrats to pass my plan to lower housing costs for Americans,"" in which corporate owners would have ""a choice to either cap rent increases on existing units at 5% or risk losing current valuable federal tax breaks."" 
If he had only looked west, he would have seen the damage caused by rent-control policies in California. 
BIDEN UNVEILS PLAN TO CAP NATIONAL RENT INCREASES AT 5%
California is one of the most rent-controlled states in the country. Even though more than a dozen cities have some type of law that limits how much owners can increase rental rates, it is going through a resurgence of anti-landlord rules, which is sure to spike even higher if voters approve a measure on the November ballot that repeals state limits on rent control. 
President Joe Biden proposed national rent control, which has already failed locally, especially in California. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)
While common sense tells us that rent control laws are counterproductive, it's clear that lawmakers often miss the obvious. For those, and for the activists who believe rent ceilings are beneficial, we have data. 
For instance, a 2019 study by the American Economic Association found that San Francisco landlords ""treated by rent control"" reduced ""rental housing supplies by 15% by selling to owner-occupants and redeveloping buildings,"" which ""likely drove up market rents in the long run, ultimately undermining the goals of"" the city's 1994 ballot initiative. 
The authors noted that ""a substantial body of economic research has warned about potential negative efficiency consequences of limiting rent increases below market rates."" Those consequences include the ""overconsumption of housing by tenants of rent-controlled apartments""; the misallocation of housing; ""negative spillovers onto neighboring housing"" that lower ""the amenity value of these neighborhoods and mak(e) them less desirable places to live""; and ""neglect of required maintenance"" – because who's going to pour money into an asset when the law cuts into the return on that investment? 
Rent control in Berkeley in the late 1970s created a large-scale dislocation because ""a large number of University of California-Berkeley students simply stayed in their apartments long after graduation,"" says economics professor William L. Anderson. The result was a ""massive shortage of housing for new students, who then had to look for housing in nearby cities like Oakland."" 
A two-decade study by California State University, Sacramento and the Sacramento Regional Research Institute discovered that rent control laws in Berkeley and Santa Monica reduced the supply of rental housing by nearly 7.5% in the former and more than 8.7% in the latter. 
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
Over that period, the number of college-age students living in Berkeley fell by almost 11%, while in Santa Monica, ""formerly a haven for UCLA students,"" the college-age student population dropped more than 50%. 
In California's biggest city, rent control has so skewed the housing market that property owners are offering tenants large sums of money, in some cases as high as six figures, as an incentive to move out. The hardship of rent control is forcing owners to make difficult decisions about their properties. Sometimes, the only options are demolishing their units and using the real estate for other purposes because they cannot afford to continue leasing their property. 
While common sense tells us that rent control laws are counterproductive, it's clear that lawmakers often miss the obvious. For those, and for the activists who believe rent ceilings are beneficial, we have data. 
Even the state's own nonpartisan fiscal and policy adviser has warned lawmakers of the negative consequences of rent control. In a 2016 report, the Legislative Analyst's Office said rent-control laws fail to ""increase the supply of housing and, in fact, likely would discourage new construction,"" which is perpetually needed in California to drive housing down to more affordable prices.

During the 2020 presidential campaign, Biden said ""Milton Friedman isn't running the show anymore,"" in an interview in which he said the next federal pandemic stimulus needed to be ""a hell of a lot bigger"" than the $2 trillion CARES Act that had just passed.  
Friedman was a brilliant economist who would have bristled at the ease in which today's lawmakers spend other people's money. But he never ran whatever show Biden had in mind, though he did, as economist Stephen Moore has said, have ""a profound impact on major policy decisions."" Biden would be wise to follow the advice that Friedman freely gave during his life, but he instead has chosen to take California foolishness national.

CNN commentator and former Obama administration official Van Jones grew visibly emotional while reacting to the news that President Biden would withdraw from the race. 
Biden stepped aside on Sunday and has endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, to become the new nominee for the Democratic Party.

""The Democrat Party's [Biden']s family at the end of the day, this is a family matter,"" Jones said. ""You know, Joe Biden’s body may not be as strong as it used to be. His language skills may not be as sharp as they used to be. His heart is as big as ever.""
Jones also compared Biden stepping down to taking away driving privileges from a senior family member. 
""It's kind of like when your grandpa, [when] you got to take the keys,"" Jones said. ""He’s fighting and he’s fighting and everybody’s so frustrated.""
""And then you finally get the keys back,"" he continued, becoming increasingly emotional. ""And then you just cry. Because this is somebody that you love. This is somebody that you care about. This is somebody who was there for you. This is somebody, you wouldn’t be here without him. And you had to take something from him.""

""Politics is politics,"" he said, ""But this is a human moment for one of the great humans in America."" 
""I just want to say, I don’t know who’s going to be the VP, the non VP. I don’t know anything about politics,"" Jones said. ""I just know that I love this man, I care about this man. It was painful every day to sit up here and talk about him like he’s just some problem for the party.""
""All of us are going to be in this situation someday, and I hope that we take a moment to honor this man and to love this man,"" Jones said. ""I love Joe Biden. I appreciate what he’s done. And a lot of people are heartbroken today. Even if it’s the right thing, it’s still just horrible.""

Other news hosts were also shocked by Biden's decision to drop out of the presidential race.
MSNBC host and former White House press secretary Jen Psaki reacted live on Sunday during her show. 
""There’s very little indication from people close to him and many people in the campaign that this was about to happen, as much as there were reports of Democrats calling on him to do that,"" she said after reading the letter posted to X by the president. 
Delaware Sen. Chris Coons also appeared close to tears in an interview with CBS News after Biden ended his campaign. 
""This was a very difficult decision, and one that I think reflects the very best of who Joe Biden is,"" Coons said.

FOX_14,How does Kamala Harris poll against Donald Trump?,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/how-does-kamala-harris-poll-against-donald-trump,2024-07-22 20:06:02.852779,politics,"Delegates are Democracy founder Chris Dempsey joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss how delegates are responding to Biden dropping out of the race and what the path forward looks like. 
Before President Biden announced he would discontinue his re-election campaign and endorsed Vice President Harris, recent polls that had been conducted after his disastrous debate performance showed little difference between how he matched up against former President Trump compared to how Harris would. 
The New York Times assessed that Harris falls about two percentage points behind Trump in recent polls. The 46% to 48% difference is slightly better for Harris compared to how Biden polled on average – three percentage points behind the Republican presidential nominee, 47% to 44%. 
A New York Times/Siena College poll conducted in the battleground state of Pennsylvania from July 9-11, before Biden dropped out and before the assassination attempt on Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, showed Harris was only behind by one percentage point in a hypothetical matchup against Trump. 
In Virginia, Harris had a five percentage point lead, compared to Biden only polling ahead of Trump in the same state by a razor-thin margin, according to the Times. Harris polled slightly better than Biden in both states among Black voters, younger voters and women.

According to a Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll conducted July 5-9, 70% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents indicated that they would be ""satisfied"" if Biden withdrew from the race and Harris was nominated to run as the 2024 Democratic presidential candidate.
In an open-ended question, that poll showed 29% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents named Harris as their pick for the Democratic nomination if Biden bowed out.

NEW POLL REVEALS WHAT DEMOCRATS THINK OF HARRIS AS PRESIDENT
Seven percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents referenced California Gov. Gavin Newsom, while 4% said they wanted former first lady Michelle Obama as Biden's replacement. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer each had 3% of support, though half of Democrats did not specify an alternative candidate.

As pressure mounted from Democrat lawmakers and donors for Biden to step aside, a poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research released last week found that about six in 10 Democrats believe that Harris would do a good job as president herself. About two in 10 Democrats do not believe she would, and another two in 10 say they do not know enough to say.

Results of a CNN poll conducted by SSRS and released on July 2 indicated that three-quarters of voters say the Democratic Party would have a better chance of keeping the White House with someone else other than Biden at the top of the party's ticket. In a hypothetical match-up, 47% of registered voters supported Trump compared to 45% for Harris, a difference that fell within the survey's margin of error.

FOX_15,Fox News Power Rankings: Is Kamala Harris unburdened by what has been?,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-power-rankings-kamala-harris-unburdened-what-has-been,2024-07-22 21:01:02.801601,politics,"Registered Democrat voter Jahmiel Jackson and father of three Chris McCullough discuss their support for Donald Trump and said Democrats are trying anything in order to beat Trump. 
President Biden's decision to stand down from re-election offers Democrats an unprecedented opportunity to reset this election.
At this hour, Vice President Kamala Harris is the most likely nominee.
Many party leaders have endorsed her candidacy, and no other candidate with an appreciable chance of winning the nomination is running.
Harris is known for asking voters to ""see what is possible, unburdened by what has been."" Her probable elevation to the top of the ticket allows her party to do that. But it is too early to tell whether she would perform better against former President Trump in the general election than Biden or any other candidate.
KAMALA HARRIS CONFIRMS 2024 PRESIDENTIAL BID AFTER BIDEN DROPS OUT

That means Biden’s decision to drop out may have been guided more by his own weakness than Harris’ strength. In the meantime, while Harris is unburdened by age, polls show she is burdened by the administration’s unpopularity.
Expect Harris to hold on to issues Democrats are winning and reposition the party on issues they are losing. The race restarts today.
FORCING PRESIDENT BIDEN OUT OF CAMPAIGN MAY HAVE BEEN MORE ABOUT CONGRESS THAN WHITE HOUSE
Some recent polls have asked voters whether they would support a Democratic candidate other than Biden.
So far, however, poll respondents are being asked to evaluate a hypothetical scenario.
Voters are about to hear a lot more about the new candidate's strengths and weaknesses.

Other voters will just be getting to know them.
These factors will all impact their standing with the electorate.
Harris is likely to have the least impact on the Democratic ticket’s standing, since her position as vice president means voters are more familiar with her than any other possible candidate.
DEMOCRATIC DELEGATES SHIFT SPOTLIGHT TO KAMALA HARRIS FOLLOWING BIDEN'S 2024 DROPOUT DECISION
However, polls cannot yet show whether her elevation changes the race.
Even after voters are aware that someone new is the nominee, it will take time to conduct polls and gather enough of them to understand how the race has changed.
Think of this as a three-step process:
A good rule of thumb is to wait a couple of weeks.
Polls conducted after Biden’s fatal debate performance show he was running a close race in national polls.
However, he was beginning to struggle in the most competitive states, narrowing his path to victory.
Biden had support from 46% of registered voters in an average of five post-debate polls, including the Fox News Poll, with Trump at 47%. The margin between them is statistically insignificant. (The polls tested both Biden and Harris against Trump.)
According to five post-debate national polls, Vice President Kamala Harris ties former President Trump at 47% apiece among registered voters. (JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images)
In the battleground states, a somewhat clearer picture was emerging.
Biden was locked in a tight battle in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, two crucial rust belt states on his pathway to 270 electoral college votes (NYT/Siena, AARP).
He was also within the margin of error in Georgia, where Black voters held the key to Biden’s 2020 election victory (AJC).
'PROUD OF OUR PRESIDENT': DEMS HEAP PRAISE ON BIDEN FOR DECISION TO END 2024 CAMPAIGN
In Michigan though, another Rust Belt state crucial to his bid, a poll released yesterday showed Trump leading Biden 49% to 42% in a head-to-head matchup; a seven point difference between the two (Detroit Free Press).
Democrats would have been anxious about a recent poll in Virginia that had Biden at 46% to Trump’s 44%, a two point difference that is well within the poll’s margin of sampling error (NYT/Siena). Biden won the state by 10 points in 2020.
Polls are snapshots in time. They do not account for the challenges that Biden would have faced in the final 100 days of the campaign, including another presidential debate and a rigorous campaign schedule, all while serving as leader of the free world.
Polling and these factors all likely played a role in Democrats’ thinking about his re-election odds and Biden’s decision.

On the surface, Harris’ odds look about the same.
In the same five post-debate national polls, the vice president ties Trump at 47% apiece among registered voters.
That is two points higher than Biden’s number in the same polls.
OBAMA OFFERS STATEMENT OF SUPPORT AFTER BIDEN DROPS OUT OF 2024 RACE: 'PATRIOT OF THE HIGHEST ORDER'
Her position is similar across three competitive state polls that tested both Biden and Harris.
In Georgia, Trump is ahead of Harris, 51% to 46%; Harris adds a point on Biden’s number, but overall the gap between the two candidates is wider (AJC).In Pennsylvania, Trump edges Harris 48% to 46%, a two-point improvement on Biden and within the margin of error (NYT/Siena).In Virginia, Harris gets 48% versus Trump’s 44%, another two-point improvement on Biden and within the margin of error (NYT/Siena).
These numbers suggest that today, a polarized electorate views Harris similarly to Biden. His values are hers; so are his accomplishments and failures.

There is also no meaningful difference between Biden and Harris’ support with key voter groups in a matchup against Trump. From last week’s Fox News Poll:
(Fox News Poll, July 7-10; MOE: Black ±9, Women ±4, Under 30 ±7.5, Independents ±7, Moderates ±6)
That means, so far, her pathway to 270 electoral college votes looks about the same as Biden’s.
TRUMP SAYS BIDEN 'IS NOT FIT TO SERVE': 'WHO IS GOING TO BE RUNNING THE COUNTRY FOR THE NEXT 5 MONTHS?'
Voters view Harris more favorably than Biden.
As the same Fox News Poll revealed, 44% of voters have a favorable opinion of Harris, while 54% view her unfavorably. 
Those numbers are similar to Trump’s (-12) and better than Biden’s (-20).
Harris, 59 years old, does not have Biden’s age issue. Voters were already concerned about it before the debate; those concerns exploded after it.
That is likely helping her ratings.
Again, these results reflect Harris’ current standing, with voters knowing her as the vice president on Biden’s ticket. Her polling, path to 270 and favorability could all change in the weeks ahead.
It is possible, for example, that Democrats will become more enthusiastic about their nominee.
The Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue said yesterday was their ""biggest fundraising day of the 2024 cycle,"" with Harris raising $47 million since her campaign launch.
TRUMP CALLS FOR NEXT PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE TO BE HELD ON FOX NEWS
Democratic strategists are also much more enthusiastic about the race than before, though Republicans have been for over a year, and they also seem energized by the news.

July’s Fox News survey also asked about California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, two candidates who the media floated as possible Biden replacements.
(Newsom has endorsed Harris for president, and Whitmer will reportedly do the same).
For both candidates, the race is a dead heat against Trump.
KAMALA HARRIS' PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN RAISES NEARLY $50 MILLION SINCE BIDEN ENDORSEMENT
No presidential candidate has ever announced that they were not seeking another term this close to Election Day.
However, Democrats have not yet formally nominated Biden, which means they can support a new candidate who will appear on general election ballots in all 50 states.
This week, the party is likely to affirm that their existing nominating process will continue as planned.

Under that process, delegates were awarded to candidates after the primaries earlier this year; almost all of them were pledged to Biden. The only step left is for delegates to formally nominate a candidate in the party’s ""roll call vote.""
This is just like the roll call vote that Republicans held at their convention last week.
The candidate who gets a majority of votes from delegates becomes the nominee. Again, it is most likely, but not guaranteed, to be Harris.
HARRIS NEEDS TO 'EARN' HER SPOT ON THE TICKET, PROVE BIDEN ISN'T JUST HANDING HER THE NOMINATION: AXELROD
The most pressing question is who she will choose as her running mate. Possible contenders include moderate Govs. Andy Beshear, Roy Cooper and Josh Shapiro.
Democrats must also decide when to hold that roll call vote.
Most recently, the party committee in charge of that process said it would happen in the first seven days of August.
The Power Rankings forecast was already on hold after Biden’s fatal debate performance and the attempted assassination of former President Trump, another two political earthquakes in this historic election cycle.
Now, Democrats will get to know a new presidential candidate.

Democrats must also soon decide what to do about further presidential debates.

(Philippine Coast Guard)
China and the Philippines reached a deal they hope will end confrontations at the most fiercely disputed shoal in the South China Sea, the Philippine government said Sunday.
The Philippines occupies Second Thomas Shoal but China also claims it, and increasingly hostile clashes at sea have sparked fears of larger conflicts that could involve the United States.
The crucial deal was reached Sunday, after a series of meetings between Philippine and Chinese diplomats in Manila and exchanges of diplomatic notes that aimed to establish a mutually acceptable arrangement at the shoal, which Filipinos call Ayungin and the Chinese call Ren’ai Jiao, without conceding either side's territorial claims.
SECRET HOSPITALS IN PHILIPPINES OFFER CRIMINALS SURGICAL MAKEOVER TO EVADE POLICE: 'ENTIRELY NEW PERSON'
Two Philippine officials, who had knowledge of the negotiations, confirmed the deal to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity and the government later issued a brief statement announcing the deal without providing details.
""Both sides continue to recognize the need to deescalate the situation in the South China Sea and manage differences through dialogue and consultation and agree that the agreement will not prejudice each other’s positions in the South China Sea,"" the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila said.
China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced shortly after midnight Sunday that they discussed with the Philippines ""managing the situation at Ren’ai Jiao and reached provisional arrangement with the Philippines on humanitarian resupply of living necessities.""

Neither side released the text of the agreement.
China has disputes with several governments over land and sea borders, many of them in the South China Sea. The rare deal with the Philippines could spark hope that similar arrangements could be forged by Beijing with other countries to avoid clashes while thorny territorial issues remain unresolved. It remains to be seen, however, if the deal can be implemented successfully and how long it will last.
Chinese coast guard and other forces have used powerful water cannons and dangerous blocking maneuvers to prevent food and other supplies from reaching Filipino navy personnel at Manila’s outpost at the shoal, on a long-grounded and rusting warship, the BRP Sierra Madre.
The yearslong territorial standoff has flared repeatedly since last year.
In the worst confrontation, Chinese forces on motorboats repeatedly rammed and then boarded two Philippine navy boats on June 17 to prevent Filipino personnel from transferring food and other supplies including firearms to the ship outpost in the shallows of the shoal, according to the Philippine government.
CHINA ATTACKS ON PHILIPPINE BOATS ARE TO PROVOKE US, PREP FOR TAIWAN WAR, EXPERTS WARN
The Chinese seized the Philippine navy boats and damaged them with machetes and improvised spears. They also seized seven M4 rifles, which were packed in cases, and other supplies. The violent faceoff wounded several Filipino navy personnel, including one who lost his thumb, in a chaotic skirmish that was captured in video and photos that were later made public by Philippine officials.
China and the Philippines blamed each other for the confrontation and each asserted their own sovereign rights over the shoal.
The United States and its key Asian and Western allies, including Japan and Australia, condemned the Chinese acts at the shoal and called for the rule of law and freedom of navigation to be upheld in the South China Sea, a key global trade route with rich fishing areas and undersea gas deposits.
In addition to China and the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have been locked in separate but increasingly tense territorial disputes in the waterway, which is regarded as a potential flashpoint and a delicate fault line in the U.S.-China regional rivalry. The U.S. military has deployed Navy ships and fighter jets for decades in what it calls freedom of navigation and overflight patrols, which China has opposed and regards as a threat to regional stability.
Washington has no territorial claims in the disputed waters but has repeatedly warned that it is obligated to defend the Philippines, its oldest treaty ally in Asia, if Filipino forces, ships and aircraft come under an armed attack, including in the South China Sea.
One of the two Philippine officials said the June 17 confrontation prompted Beijing and Manila to hasten on-and-off talks on an arrangement that would prevent confrontations at Second Thomas Shoal.

During final meetings in the last four days, two Chinese demands that had been key sticking points were removed from the draft deal.
China had previously said it would allow food, water and other basic supplies to be transported by the Philippines to its forces at the shoal if Manila agreed not to bring construction materials to fortify the crumbling ship and to give China advance notice and the right to inspect the ships for those materials, the officials said.
The Philippines rejected those conditions, and the final deal did not include them, according to the Philippine officials."
FOX_17,Taiwan reacts to Trump’s they 'should pay us for defense' comments,https://www.foxnews.com/world/taiwan-reacts-to-trumps-should-pay-us-for-defense-comments,2024-07-22 21:07:02.801601,world,"The U.S. House delegation in Taiwan led by Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul are greeted by members of the Legislative Yuan as part of their multi-day trip to meet with Taipei’s newly-elected government officials.
TAIWAN – Reactions to former President Trump’s blunt statements regarding what he sees as an imbalance in bearing the cost of defending the Republic of China (Taiwan’s official name) were mixed, with some expressing varying degrees of agreement and others pointing out that Taiwan is still waiting for some $19 billion worth of already-purchased American weapons. 
Trump’s comments were made in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek last week. The Republican Party nominee for president in November’s election said, ""I know the people very well, respect them greatly. They [Taiwan] did take about 100% of our chip business. I think Taiwan should pay us for defense.""
After the remarks became public, the share price of Taiwan’s chipmaker TSMC dropped significantly. TSMC Chairman C.C. Wei told investors at a conference the next day that the company will stay on course with expansion plans in the U.S., Japan and Germany, regardless of geopolitical tensions. 
TRUMP'S SECOND TERM FOREIGN POLICY LIKELY TO FOCUS ON 'STRENGTH' AND 'DETERRENCE': EXPERT

Taiwanese Premier Cho Jung-tai thanked the U.S. for its support and said ties remain solid. Cho added that the Taiwan government would continue policies that show it is shouldering its responsibilities as a member of the international community.
More controversially, Trump told Bloomberg, ""You know, we’re no different than an insurance company. Taiwan doesn’t give us anything."" This statement has been met with skepticism by some in Taiwan, who argue that Taiwan has been a reliable partner in the region.
""It is inaccurate to say Taiwan doesn’t ‘give anything,’"" Huang Kwei-bo, professor of diplomacy at Taipei’s National Cheng Chi University, told Fox News Digital. ""For decades, Taiwan has paid seller’s market prices for major weaponry systems from the United States, its sole provider.""
Huang conceded that, with bipartisan congressional support, the Biden administration in 2023 resumed some very limited amounts of military financial aid to Taiwan, the first such grants since the 1960s, moves Huang credited to anti-Beijing sentiment in the U.S.

Joann Ko (Ko Chih-en), an influential lawmaker with the Kuomintang (KMT) opposition party, expressed surprise at hearing the former president describe the countries' defense relationship in terms that amount to accusing Taiwan of being a freeloader. 
""We’ve increased spending and readiness and I think we pay enough,"" she told Fox News Digital in exclusive comments squeezed in between parliamentary sessions on Thursday. ""Of course, we are willing to discuss changes, and we highly value good relations with the U.S. The United States is welcome to offer advice, and we will take any proposals seriously. But I can’t agree with those comments.""   
INSPIRED BY UKRAINE, TAIWAN SEEKS TO BOLSTER MILITARY PREPAREDNESS AS CHINA THREAT CONTINUES

There are, however, many voices in Taiwan who either agree wholeheartedly or to some degree with sentiments expressed by Trump. 
Ross Feingold, Taipei-based lawyer, political commentator and former Asia chairman of Republicans Abroad, told Fox News Digital that as either a percentage of the Taiwanese government’s annual spending or as a percentage of GDP, Taiwan spends far less on defense than it should. ""Given the ever-increasing risk that Taiwan faces, the amount that Taiwan spends is clearly not enough and President Trump is right to point this out,"" he said. 
Huang notes that Taiwan has recently spent more on defense. The last administration increased the annual defense budget from roughly 2% of the total GDP to 2.5% when special ""one-off"" budgets are included. However, these figures still fall short of the 3% GDP threshold Trump has demanded from NATO members. Taiwan is not a member of NATO.

Huang said he wished the government had declined U.S. military financing or loans, as they may have given the wrong impression to Trump.
The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) is a U.S. law requiring the United States to provide Taiwan with defensive arms and mandates that the U.S. maintain the capacity to resist any force or coercion that would threaten Taiwan’s security or socio-economic stability. Trump critics highlight that the TRA contains no provision obligating Taiwan to pay for its defense. 
Such critics also point to the $19 billion backlog – meaning Taiwan has already purchased an array of items from fighter jets to Abrams tanks, that have yet to be delivered. According to the Cato Institute, Taiwan on average waits longer than other nations for the delivery of weapons, especially HIMARS, newly built F-16s, and Abrams tanks.

Feingold, however, agrees with those who think the U.S. will not abandon Taiwan, even if spending doesn’t reach numbers suggested by Robert O’Brien, a top Trump national security adviser, who recently said his personal view was that Taiwan should spend at least 5% of its GDP on defense, a number KMT lawmaker Ko said would likely be impossible to achieve. 
Should Trump return to the Oval Office in January 2025, there is a consensus here that he will likely be surrounded by a very pro-Taiwan team, people who are aware of the dangers posed to world peace by the communist government in Beijing.

Responding to Trump’s comments on Friday, Taiwan’s Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung told foreign reporters in Taipei that the island nation must indeed rely on itself for defense, and will both modernize its military and increase spending.

Joe Manchin called for a competitive nomination process on Monday and demanded a ""voice"" for centrist voters after President Biden decided to drop out of the race.
Sen. Joe Manchin, I-W. Va., called for a competitive Democratic nomination process on Monday, saying he wants centrist voters to feel like they have a voice.
""I want the middle to have a voice. I want the center of this country to be able to say, ‘We have a voice. We’re not extreme left or extreme right.' I don’t live my life that way, why do I have to only have two choices of a party that basically have taken the extremes?"" he told CNN's Kasie Hunt. 
President Biden made the decision to drop out of the presidential contest after facing several calls to do so. He quickly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him at the top of the ticket. 
""The calls and everything that’s coming in, is not quite sure, unless they see a process where they really are, have things changed any at all, and the coordination doesn‘t always basically produce, I think, the strongest, if you will, the strongest team. Very well Kamala could be that person. And I think going through some sort of process would have been very enlightening to everybody,"" Manchin said.

Manchin added that many Democrats being considered as potential running mates for Harris haven't been through a ""process,"" arguing that the country didn't know where they stand. 
""I’m an Independent now. Fifty-one percent of people participating in an electoral process are registered Independents. Only 23% of registered Democrats, only 25% are registered Republicans. If either side can‘t capture that middle, which is where the center of this country, where the common sense, and just, they just want to tap it down a little bit and not push onto me even though you think that‘s part of the policy, and you're playing to the base, is that where the country is? I don’t think – why is there 51% like me? How do they win back Democrats like me?"" he said.
Manchin also told ""CBS Mornings"" on Monday that he was calling for a ""mini-primary,"" and clarified that he was not looking to run.
""I am not going to be a candidate for president. I am a candidate for, basically speaking for, the middle of this country,"" he said.

Taiwan sent navy vessels out to sea and conducted take-off and landing exercises on Monday, July 22, at the start of the annual Han Kuang war games, which this year aim to be as close as possible to actual combat with no script and simulating how to repel a Chinese attack.
China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its territory, has been staging regular exercises around the island for four years to pressure Taipei to accept Beijing's claim of sovereignty, despite Taiwan's strong objections.

Taiwan's drills this year have canceled elements that were mostly for show, like scripted firepower displays, while there will be intensified nighttime exercises and practicing how to operate with severed command lines. The five-day war games will be happening in conjunction with the Wan'an civil defense drills, where the streets of major cities are evacuated for half an hour during a simulated Chinese missile attack, and test warning alarms will sound on mobile phones.
China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te, who says only the Taiwanese people can decide their future, has repeatedly offered talks but been rebuffed."

JD Vance breaks down why President Biden’s cabinet should enact the 25th Amendment on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'
Vice presidential hopeful JD Vance advocated for Democrats to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove President Biden from office in an exclusive interview alongside former President Trump set to air Monday night on Fox News.
""I think it is [a coup attempt],"" Vance told Jesse Watters, speaking of multiple Democrats' efforts to push Biden to step down.
""There’s a constitutional process, the 25th Amendment. If Joe Biden can’t run for president, he can’t serve as president and, if they want to take him down because he’s mentally incapable of serving, invoke the 25th Amendment. You don’t get to do this in the most politically beneficial way for Democrats. If it’s an actual problem, they should take care of it the appropriate way.""

Trump replied ""sort of"" when asked if he believes the presumed clandestine effort to unseat Biden was a ""coup"" attempt.
Speculation surrounding Biden's re-election campaign came to an end Sunday when he took to social media to announce his intent to drop out of the 2024 race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris shortly after.
Leading up to the political earthquake, Democrats urged Biden to step aside for new leadership to prepare for a face-off against Trump in November.

Some reports even indicated that elite Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also wanted Biden to exit the race.
Though the Democratic nominee remains unclear, Harris, along with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, former first lady Michelle Obama, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and others have been commonly floated.
Harris' vice presidential pick, should she be the Democratic nominee, also has yet to be determined.

Days ahead of officially dropping out of the 2024 race, President Biden declared in a media interview that a medical diagnosis from a doctor would likely sway him to reconsider running for a second term. 
""If I had some medical condition that emerged,"" Biden said, when asked in a BET interview this month if there was a reason that would make him reconsider running in 2024. ""If doctors came to me and said, ‘You got this problem, that problem.’""
Following weeks of adamant declarations from Biden and his campaign that he was staying in the race, the president dropped out on Sunday afternoon, and shortly after endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president. 
""My fellow Democrats, I have decided not to accept the nomination and to focus all my energies on my duties as President for the remainder of my term,"" Biden posted on X Sunday afternoon announcing his support for Harris.

""My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it’s been the best decision I’ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats – it’s time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this,"" he continued. 
For years, Biden’s health has been of concern to conservatives, including former White House doctor Ronny Jackson, before the concerns snowballed following Biden’s disastrous debate against former President Trump last month. The debate performance – which included Biden stumbling over his words, trailing off on his thoughts and answering questions in a much more subdued manner than during previous public events – opened the floodgates to legacy media outlets and Democratic allies calling on Biden to drop out over concerns about his mental fitness and age. 
WHAT COMES NEXT FOR DEMOCRATS AFTER BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN SUSPENSION?
Biden and the administration have hit back that Biden’s mental fitness is sound and that he does not have dementia, Parkinson’s or other diseases. Biden’s brother, however, said following Sunday’s announcement that the president’s health ""absolutely"" played a role in his decision not to seek re-election just weeks ahead of the Democratic National Convention.

""I'm incredibly proud of my brother. Selfishly, I will have him back to enjoy whatever time we have left. He is a genuine hero. Country over self. Sounds corny in our cynical political environment, but he nor I are cynical. The goal remains the same, defeat Trump and continue the work that Joe has done. My hope is that our party rallies around this heroic act,"" Frank Biden told CBS News on Sunday.

""In my humble opinion, absolutely,"" he said when asked if his brother's health played a role in him bowing out. 
Following Frank Biden’s comment, a source close to the Biden family told CBS that the president’s brother is an alcoholic and his claims were ""completely untrue."" 
""Frank Biden suffers from alcoholism and hasn’t spoken to his brother, the president, in weeks. What he said about President Biden’s health being a factor in his decision is completely untrue,"" the source told the outlet.

'PROUD OF OUR PRESIDENT': DEMS HEAP PRAISE ON BIDEN FOR DECISION TO END 2024 CAMPAIGN
Concerns surrounding Biden’s mental acuity stretch back to the 2020 election, when White House doctor under the Obama and Trump administrations, Ronny Jackson, sounded the alarm that he didn’t believe Biden was mentally fit for office. 
""As a citizen, not as a candidate running for Congress, but as a citizen of this country, I’ve watched Joe Biden on the campaign trail and I am concerned and convinced that he does not have the mental capacity, the cognitive ability, to serve as our commander in chief and our head of state,"" Jackson, who is now a Republican congressman representing Texas, said in 2020.

The concerns have mounted since, most notably in February of this year when Special Counsel Robert Hur published his report investigating the president's handling of classified documents after his departure as vice president in the Obama administration. 
The report stated Hur would not recommend criminal charges against Biden for possessing classified materials after his vice presidency, calling Biden ""a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.""
BIDEN ENDS BID FOR 2ND TERM IN WHITE HOUSE AS HE DROPS OUT OF 2024 REMATCH WITH TRUMP
His mental fitness again came under scrutiny when the Wall Street Journal published a piece earlier this year based on dozens of interviews with lawmakers and administration officials who characterized Biden as losing his mental edge and showing his age in meetings. The White House slammed the article as a partisan hit piece. 
In addition to concerns over Biden’s mental acuity, he previously ​​suffered two brain aneurysms in 1988 that nearly claimed his life.

OBAMA AGAIN STEPPING INTO ROLE AS JOE'S CLOSER AHEAD OF TRUMP V BIDEN REMATCH
Amid mounting concerns over his mental fitness, Biden was mocked and criticized on social media for a handful of gaffes and miscues during public events in recent months. Those include: former President Obama taking Biden’s wrist to seemingly lead him offstage at a fundraiser in Los Angeles in June; Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni directing Biden back to a gaggle of world leaders in Italy this summer after he took a few steps away from the group to give a thumbs up to a parachutist; and viral video showing the president standing relatively motionless during a Juneteenth concert event at the White House.

The floodgates for criticizing the president’s age and mental acuity opened on June 27, when he delivered his botched debate performance, with Democratic elected officials and traditional allies in political and media orbits calling on Biden to bow out of the race out of concern he could not defeat Trump. 
Biden and his campaign, however, repeatedly denied he would bow out of the race and hit back against claims his mental fitness had slipped.

Later Monday evening, Vance is to hold another rally in Radford, Virginia. 
For the first time since Biden announced he would no longer seek re-election, Harris spoke at the White House Monday morning during an event honoring NCAA college athletes.

He still has not been seen publicly since making the announcement.
Reuters reported that campaign officials have already made hundreds of calls on Harris' behalf insisting that delegates name her the Democrats' presidential nominee during next month's Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

Concerns over what was in the best interest of the party and the country mostly focused around Biden’s age and mental acuity, an issue that became even more prominent after the president’s disastrous debate performance at the beginning of the month. Calls for Biden, who would be 82 by inauguration day, to drop out of the race continued to intensify in the weeks after the debate, finally leading to his decision to step aside Sunday.

BIDEN ENDS BID FOR SECOND TERM IN WHITE HOUSE AS HE DROPS OUT OF HIS 2024 REMATCH WITH TRUMP
Harris, who only polled 3 percent higher than you or I before limping out of the 2020 primary, will now be painted as some combination between FDR, JFK, and Maya Angelou all in one.
But there was a reason that Harris’ poll numbers barely reached the average combined score of an average soccer game; she has no actual accomplishments, just an impressive set of job titles.
Between 2004 and 2017 Harris was first District Attorney of San Francisco, then Attorney General of California. The former is now a den of crime and open-air drug use that in places looks more like Lagos than America, and people can’t get out of the latter fast enough, including, recently, Elon Musk’s SpaceX.
Democrats will happily portray Kamala as Scottie Pippen to Joe’s Michael Jordan, when in fact they generally appeared less competent than Abbott and Costello.

But Democrats think they have an ace up their sleeve, after all Harris has spent the last three years in the executive branch, her presidency would be shovel ready, and this is where the true gaslighting begins.
The Democrats will tell us that Joe Biden is the most effective and consequential president of our lifetime and Harris has been learning from the master. This is an obvious lie, as every approval rating of Biden shows, but it is irrelevant now, because the big guy isn’t running.

Kamala Harris has been our tireless Border Czar as tens of millions of illegal immigrants have poured over the Rio Grande, Czar Nicholas II did a better job holding off the Bolsheviks.
In some polls, 70 percent of Americans disapprove of the administration’s handling of the border, led by the vice president, and that is because every state has become a border state with Bidenville tent cities and hotels being used for criminal activity by illegals.
Harris had a chance to rise above the fray when border agents were wrongly and ridiculously accused of whipping Haitian migrants, but she just went along with the lie, throwing good, decent people serving their community right under the bus.
On foreign policy, there is no reason to believe that Harris would deviate at all from the disastrous judgments of the administration on the Afghanistan withdrawal, the boondoggle in Ukraine or the insane mixed messaging on the war on Gaza, which regularly chides Israel while coddling Hamas.

Streets appeared calm in Bangladesh's capital on Monday, a day after the Supreme Court agreed to scrap most government job quotas that had angered student-led activists and led to deadly protests.
Late on Sunday, protesters gave Bangladesh's government 48 hours to meet a string of new demands, including a public apology from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for the violence, and the restoration of internet connections disrupted during the unrest.
But on Monday, most appeared to be obeying a curfew in cities that had seen regular demonstrations after a high court in June reinstated old quotas that reserved many state jobs for descendants of freedom fighters and other groups.
BANGLADESH URGES UNIVERSITIES TO CLOSE AFTER 6 DIE IN PROTESTS, BOMBS AND WEAPONS FOUND
At least 147 people have died in the violence, according to information from hospitals.
A public holiday declared over the last two days was extended to Tuesday, according to a government notification.
""Normalcy will return within one or two days,"" Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan told reporters.

Experts have blamed the unrest on stagnant job growth in the private sector and high rates of youth unemployment that have made government jobs, with their regular wage hikes and other privileges, more attractive.
Hasina, 76, who was sworn in for a fourth consecutive term this year, has been accused of authoritarianism, human rights violations, and crackdowns on free speech and dissent in the past - charges her government denies.
The recent clashes followed similar violent protests ahead of January's national elections by Hasina's opponents in response to what they called her authoritarian rule, and by garment workers demanding better pay amid high inflation.
On Monday, there were no reports of violence or protests across the country, officials said.
Army tanks were seen stationed at several places in the streets of Dhaka, the capital, while armed security patrols directed the few motorists who ventured out.
The Supreme Court's Appellate Division on Sunday ruled in favor of an appeal from the government, overturned the lower court's decision and scrapped most of the quotas, directing that 93% of government jobs should be open to candidates on merit.
Hours after that ruling, the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement issued a statement demanding the government reopen campuses and end restrictions imposed as protests raged.
It also called for the resignation of some ministers and university officials and the dismissal of police officers deployed in the areas where students were killed.
""We are giving an ultimatum to the government to fulfill our eight-point demand within 48 hours,"" one of the Movement's leaders, Hasnat Abdullah, told reporters.
He did not say what would happen if the government did not meet the demands. The government did not immediately comment.
Thousands were injured in last week's protests as security forces fired tear gas, rubber bullets and sound grenades to scatter the demonstrators.
Protesters said some of their leaders were detained, including Nahid Islam, who told the media he was picked up by ""20-30 people"" claiming to be police early Sunday morning and taken to a room where he said he was tortured until he lost consciousness.
""When I regained consciousness I found myself lying on the streets,"" he said.

Ukraine's top commander said on Monday that Russian forces were staging relentless assaults to try to advance towards the town of Pokrovsk, a logistics hub in the east, and that there was active fighting taking place along the entire front line.
Nearly 29 months since the full-scale invasion, Ukraine has stepped up its mobilization effort to address its manpower shortages and been reinforced by supplies of western artillery shells, but Russian troops have continued to inch forward.
""The enemy pays no attention to their fairly high level of losses and continues to push through towards Pokrovsk,"" Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi said in a statement from the eastern front.
REPUBLICANS DIVIDED ON RUSSIA'S SECURITY THREAT AS VANCE JOINS TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL TICKET
Pokrovsk is less than 15 miles from Russian-occupied land, according to open-source intelligence battlefield maps, and lies at an intersection of roads and a railway that makes it an important logistics point for the military and for civilians in the east.
""Active combat operations of varying intensity are taking place along the entire front,"" Syrskyi said, noting that Russian forces were also trying to capture floodplain islands near the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson.
Fierce battles, he said, also raged near several eastern villages and towns, including Krasnohorivka and Chasiv Yar, a strategic hilltop town whose capture would bring Russia closer to threatening important Kyiv-held Donetsk region cities.

Russia staged 39 assaults on the Pokrovsk front in the last 24 hours of a total 117 registered along the front line, the military said in its daily battlefield readout.
Russian forces captured two villages in the east over the weekend, Russian media said, citing the Defense Ministry.
Though Kyiv's weary troops have been on the back foot this year with Russia again on the offensive and keeping up the pressure, Moscow's progress has been slow.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, who travels to China this week on a diplomatic trip, estimated on Friday that Russia controlled 17.68% of Ukrainian territory compared with 17.61% on Jan. 1, 2024.
A senior NATO official said this month that Russia lacked the munitions and troops for a major offensive in Ukraine and would need to secure significant ammunition supplies from other countries beyond what it already has in order to do so.
Russia has pounded Ukraine's electricity system with airstrikes in recent months, causing regular power cuts across the country.
Ukraine has used domestic-made drones to attack targets in Russia and staged a major overnight strike that damaged its Tuapse oil refinery, its biggest on the Black Sea.

In his statement, Syrskyi said it was vital for Kyiv to conduct long-range strikes on Russian forces, echoing Ukrainian officials who have appealed to allies to allow Kyiv to use Western-supplied weapons to attack military targets inside Russia.
Russia has warned that the use of U.S. and Western weapons against targets inside Russia could trigger a new level of confrontation.
Ukraine is also grappling with a shortage of short-range anti-aircraft missiles to repel Russian reconnaissance drones and is having to rely on drones and other electronic warfare systems for defense, he said."

The family of Majd Kamalmaz, an American psychotherapist who was detained at a government checkpoint in Damascus, Syria, in 2017, have filed a civil lawsuit against the Syrian government, accusing it of abducting, torturing and killing him. 
The lawsuit, filed Monday in federal court in Washington, D.C., on behalf of Kamalmaz’s four children, his widow and sister, accuses Syrian officials of deliberately killing the humanitarian and attempting to cover up his death.
His daughter, Maryam, told Fox News Digital last month that U.S. officials had presented the Kamalmaz family with classified information in May, saying they believe he died in Syria’s notorious prison system.

The lawsuit, filed under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act's ""state sponsor of terrorism"" exception, seeks compensatory damages for wrongful death, assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and false imprisonment.
The plaintiffs also seek punitive damages, bringing the total claim to at least $70 million.
FAMILY OF DEAD WAR REPORTER MARIE COLVIN SUE SYRIA FOR HER DEATH
""Today, on behalf of the Kamalmaz family, we have taken just the first step towards holding the Syrian regime accountable for its crimes against Majd Kamalmaz which culminated in his murder,"" said Kirby Behre, lead counsel on behalf of the Kamalmaz family, according to a press release from the Syrian Emergency Task Force.
""The family filed this suit to bring international attention to Syria’s crimes against thousands of victims, and is counting on the U.S. government to initiate criminal charges against Syria.""

Kamalmaz was visiting an elderly family member at the time of his detainment and intended to establish a clinic in Syria to aid victims impacted by the civil war.
His daughter, Ula, told Fox News Digital earlier this year that the family was never given a reason for their father’s detainment because there was never a case or crime against him. 
She suggested her father could have been detained due to his American passport.
""He didn't do anything,"" she said. ""He wasn't very political, you know, the only thing he was doing was just … he was a psychotherapist working with refugees."" 
""They set up a temporary checkpoint, and it was set up to kidnap him. And they probably thought they could make money off of him. That's how they do things in Syria. Now, unfortunately, they'll detain the person, and they won't let him loose until the family pays a really large amount to get him out,"" Ula added. ""So, it's just very corrupt.""

The civil lawsuit alleges that Dr. Kamalmaz was unlawfully detained, falsely imprisoned and subjected to inhuman and unlawful treatment in notorious Syrian prisons, including the Mezzeh Military Airport, which is known for the ""torture and murder of perceived enemies of the Syrian regime.""
EX-DETAINEE: SYRIAN PRISONS ARE ‘SLAUGHTERHOUSES’
""Syrian officials and agents purposefully killed Mr. Kamalmaz. Acting in concert and with premeditation, these officials and agents deliberately killed Mr. Kamalmaz and attempted to cover up his death,"" the lawsuit read in part. 
""The Syrian regime’s killing of Mr. Kamalmaz was designed to intimidate and terrorize the civilian population of Syria, the victims’ loved ones, and the international community.""

The U.S. government has a fund set up for victims of state-sponsored terrorism that could provide compensation for the Kamalmaz family should the court rule in their favor and award them damages. 
The United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund can pay out claims, with a cap of $20 million per person, or $20 million to $35 million per family. Depending on the amount of money in the fund, the family could get a certain percentage of whatever award is given over several years.

CNN_1,‘This is transformative’: Early elation expressed by some Democratic donors at Harris’ potential ascension,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/democratic-donors-harris-biden/index.html,2024-07-22 08:53:00,politics,"
            Alan Kessler, a Philadelphia lawyer and longtime Democratic fundraiser, said the texts and emails began soon after news broke Sunday that President Joe Biden had withdrawn from the 2024 race and called for Vice President Kamala Harris to become his successor.
    

            One, in particular, summed up the mood among Biden’s donors, he said.
    

            “This is transformative,” the text from a major contributor read.
    

            After weeks of turmoil over the future of the Democratic ticket, Kessler said the campaign donors he’s courted as a bundler for Biden’s campaign are turning their full attention to Harris and committing to work on her behalf. “They’re really excited, and they are all in,” he said.
    

            In another sign of enthusiasm: Small-dollar donors contributed more than $27.5 million in the first five hours of Harris’ presidential campaign, according to ActBlue, the online fundraising platform for Democratic candidates and causes.
    

            Harris will need the money. Although the Biden-Harris campaign and its affiliated committees outraised former President Donald Trump’s political operation in June, newly filed campaign reports show the Trump team entered July and the general election showdown with a bigger war chest of available cash.
    

            The Biden campaign had dramatically outspent the Trump last month, drawing down the campaign’s reserves – just as concerns grew about Biden’s poor June 27 debate performance, putting future contributions at risk.
    

            On Sunday afternoon, the Biden campaign filed paperwork with federal election regulators, transforming itself into the “Harris for President” committee. But Harris is not yet the Democrats’ presidential nominee. It’s now up to some 4,700 delegates to decide who officially becomes the party’s standard-bearer.
    

            Biden’s withdrawal caps weeks of uncertainty and drama.
    

            Some Democratic donors were so alarmed by Biden’s halting appearance on the debate stage that they declared an embargo on future giving to his campaign – and in some cases vowed to withhold contributions to down-ballot Democratic candidates – until the president agreed to withdraw from the race.
    

            On Sunday, after Biden’s announcement, Biden campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond unleashed anger at some of those big donors, saying they had “created a self-fulfilling prophecy” by declining to give money to support Biden after his debate performance.
    

            “You can’t win without money, and then they were going to point the finger at the candidate. They were going to blame it on Biden,” Richmond said. “For a president that has accomplished so much, it was a no-win situation.”
    

            Richmond also had this message to financial backers who had abandoned the president in recent weeks: “Now those donors need to step the f**k up.”
    

            “Suffice to say, the DEMBARGO is lifted,” Damon Lindelof, a Hollywood screenwriter and producer, wrote Sunday on Instagram. Lindelof was among the contributors who had called on fellow Democratic donors to stop writing campaign checks.
    

            He wrote that he felt “profound relief, gratitude … and then for the first time, genuine EXCITEMENT for the election ahead.”
    

            The enthusiasm for Harris among the Democratic donor class was not universal, however.
    

            Florida lawyer John Morgan – an ardent Biden supporter and fundraiser for the president’s reelection campaign – said he no longer plans to raise money for the White House effort because he’s not persuaded that Harris is the strongest candidate Democrats could field.
    

            But Biden’s endorsement essentially closes the door on a more open selection process that some in the party had sought, he said.
    

            The party would have been better served by “someone who will appear more moderate” to voters, Morgan said, ticking off Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania as among preferred options.
    

            And he said he expects Republicans to quickly cast Harris as a “California progressive” who bungled efforts to stop illegal immigration at the southern border with Mexico, although he views that characterization as unfair.
    

            Morgan had planned a fundraiser for the Biden campaign in Florida, but those plans had been put on hold because of the tumult unleashed by the June 27 debate . Morgan said he already had collected $1 million for the event – money that now likely will benefit Harris – but will do no more.
    

            “Will I vote for Harris? Yes,” he said. “Will I raise money? No.”

CNN_2,Is Harris the Democratic nominee now? Answers to key questions about Biden’s decision to exit the race,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/biden-harris-questions-democratic-nominee-who-is-president/index.html,2024-07-22 08:40:00,politics,"
            President Joe Biden on Sunday announced he will not seek to be reelected as president in 2024, and he endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to become the Democratic nominee.
    

            But the 81-year-old’s decision — with just over 100 days until the election — has given rise to many more questions about what comes next for the rest of his presidency and for the presidential race.
    

Is Biden still the president?


            Yes. Biden’s announcement exclusively pertained to his role as the Democratic candidate in November’s presidential election. It has no bearing on his current role or term as president, which he said he intends to serve out in its entirety. Biden will remain president until his successor is sworn in on January 20, 2025.
    

            In announcing his decision, Biden wrote, “While it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.”
    

            Despite Biden’s statement, some Republicans are urging him to resign effective immediately. Notable lawmakers questioning Biden’s ability to serve as president and calling for his resignation include House Speaker Mike Johnson, House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik and the chair of the Senate GOP campaign arm, Montana Sen. Steve Daines.
    

            But, again, there is no indication as of Sunday evening that Biden has any intention of stepping down early.
    

Biden endorsed Harris. Does that make her the Democratic nominee?


            No. Following his announcement, Biden endorsed Harris, his vice president, to be the Democratic presidential nominee.
    

            Harris said in a statement that she was “honored” to receive Biden’s endorsement and intends to “earn and win” the nomination for president in her first public statement since Biden’s stunning announcement.
    

            A number of prominent Democrats quickly threw their support behind Harris, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who ran for president in 2020; top House progressive Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, a Biden campaign co-chair. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro also endorsed Harris, as did the entire Tennessee delegation to the DNC.
    

            But none of this automatically makes her the nominee.
    

How will the Democratic nominee be chosen and who will it be? 


            CNN’s Zachary Wolf and Ethan Cohen have laid out how the complex process to replace Biden will likely play out now that Biden is no longer the Democrat’s presumptive nominee.
    

            Individual delegates will now select the party’s nominee during the Democratic convention in Chicago next month — or, potentially, during a virtual roll call. But because Biden won nearly all of the delegates during the primary process; they were approved by the Biden campaign and pledged to vote for the president. This means that while the delegates can vote however they like, it will largely be Biden backers who will be picking the nominee.
    

            That doesn’t mean that a candidate who isn’t endorsed by Biden couldn’t attempt to secure the nomination. Some Democrats are calling for an “open process” to replace Biden, which would see other candidates in addition to Harris join the race.
    

            Under party rules, candidates must meet certain requirements to be nominated, including gathering hundreds of signatures from delegates from several states; being a “bona fide Democrat”; and having “established substantial support for their nomination as the Democratic candidate.”
    

            While this determination is to be made by the DNC national chairperson, the party has not yet released more details on how exactly the process would work.
    

Who else could be the new nominee if not Harris? 


            While Harris received Biden’s endorsement, the names of many prominent Democratic lawmakers have been unofficially floated as alternatives who could go against her for the party’s nomination. Most of those individuals, however, have not announced or otherwise signaled that they intend to vie for the role.
    

            On Sunday night, however, sources close to Sen. Joe Manchin, independent of West Virginia, told CNN’s Jake Tapper that Manchin is considering re-registering as a Democrat and throwing his hat into the ring. Manchin had called for Biden to bow out of the race Sunday morning on CNN’s “State of the Union.”
    

How will the new presidential nominee’s running mate be chosen?


            The Democratic Party elects a vice presidential candidate in largely the same manner as the vote for president, although there’s typically not a full vote. In practice, whoever the presidential nominee chooses as their running mate is typically accepted by the delegates.
    

What happens to the money raised for Biden’s reelection?


            Biden’s reelection efforts had raised a total of $240 million at the end of June. Those funds are split across the DNC, allied committees and Biden’s campaign committee itself. The latter alone holds $95.9 million as of the end of last month, Federal Election Commission data shows.
    

            Many campaign finance experts say that, should Harris become the nominee, any money remaining campaign’s bank accounts would transfer to her political operation because she already is part of the ticket.
    

            But some Republican lawyers disagree, arguing that under some interpretations, Biden and Harris must be formally nominated by their party before any money could be shifted.
    

            “If President Biden is committed to passing the torch to his vice president, and wants to be able to seed her campaign with the current Biden for President campaign war chest, he’ll first have to become his party’s legal nominee,” veteran Republican election lawyer Charlie Spies wrote in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal earlier this month.
    

            If Harris does not become the nominee, the Biden-Harris campaign could transfer the entire pot to the Democratic National Committee, according to the FEC. The committee would then be empowered to financially support another prominent Democratic nominee, and distribute the cash to candidates further down the ticket along with their allied committees. The DNC would encounter FEC limitations on spending and contributions, should it choose this route.
    

            Another option the campaign has is to transform into a political action committee, spending Biden’s funds on independent expenditures such as advertising campaigns for a new presidential candidate. But it would not be allowed to coordinate those spending activities with any of the candidates it supports.
    

Has this ever happened before?


            While no US president has been pressured out of a reelection campaign due to concerns over his mental fitness, it is not unprecedented for an incumbent president to abandon his reelection campaign — but it is rare.
    

            This is the first time a one-term US president has dropped out of a reelection run in decades. It recalls former Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Harry S. Truman’s decisions not to seek full second terms in 1968 and 1952, respectively. Biden’s decision notably comes months closer to Election Day, and it is the latest such decision in history.
    

            At least five other former presidents have also rejected the possibility of a second full term.

            In the end, President Joe Biden exited the political stage in isolation.
    

            After weeks of fighting for his political life – insisting he wasn’t going anywhere following a disastrous debate performance – the president’s about-face did not come in an Oval Office address or a speech on the campaign trail. Instead, it came in letter posted to social media as he recovered from Covid-19 at his beach house in Delaware.
    

            It was a low-key way to reveal one of the most historic decisions in modern American politics, but time was not on Biden’s side to reach a decision or make an announcement. Never before has a president left a reelection race this close to Election Day – and for 24 days it seemed as if he were stubbornly planning to ride out the storm that followed the June 27 CNN debate in Atlanta.
    

            He spent the three weeks after the debate repeating that he was staying in the race against former President Donald Trump. The president dug in. He insisted he could beat Trump. His inner circle shrank to his closest aides and family. He was forced to retreat to Delaware, where he reached a decision in the last day-and-a-half, finally conceding that a man loyal to the Democratic Party for more than a half-century was seen as a drag on the ticket.

The 25 days that unraveled Biden’s campaign


            But in the end, the pressure on Biden from party leaders, rank-and-file lawmakers and donors – and the polling showing the perilous and potentially insurmountable path Biden faced amid a growing deficit with Trump – ultimately proved too much. Described as being more isolated than he had ever been, Biden could not withstand the push behind the scenes and in public. The blunt reality became a chorus of voices calling for the president to exit the race, like a boulder rolling down a mountain that only picked up momentum with each passing day.
    

            The president’s team wanted the June CNN debate with Trump – months earlier than typical presidential debates – to shake up a race that Biden was trailing. They succeeded, but not in the way they had intended.
    

            Instead, Biden’s campaign unraveled over the course of the next 24 days. Everything the president and his team tried to do to calm Democrats’ fears simply failed to shed the perception that Biden’s age was too advanced, and his health too fragile, for him to stay in the race.
    

            With two posts on X Sunday afternoon, Biden bowed out of the race and threw his support behind his vice president, Kamala Harris, in the hopes of quickly coalescing their party and moving past the chaos that had engulfed Democrats since the debate.
    

            It’s a high-risk, high-reward gamble for Democrats, resetting a campaign Biden was losing with a new nominee just 107 days before the election. It comes as Trump is at his strongest point in the campaign, coming out of a completely unified Republican National Convention with a base rallying around him after the attempt on his life.
    

            Biden’s final decision to leave the race was reached in the last 48 hours, a senior campaign adviser said, as he consulted family and top advisers by telephone while recovering from Covid. A source familiar with the matter said the plans to exit the race began Saturday night and were finalized on Sunday.
    

            The adviser said the president “was not dug in” but was studying all of the data coming in and became convinced he would “weigh down” the ticket and be a distraction and complication to defeat Trump.
    

            Biden’s decision did not have to do with any medical issues, a senior White House official told CNN.
    

            Biden asked two of his closest advisers to start the process of drafting the letter and setting the announcement in motion Saturday night, according to another person familiar with the matter.
    

            The president worked with his longtime close adviser and message chief Mike Donilon to draft the letter, the person said. Steve Ricchetti, another longtime adviser dating to his time as vice president, was charged with organizing the mechanics of the announcement.
    

            Still recovering from a Covid diagnosis, Biden remained at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, all weekend with his wife, first lady Dr. Jill Biden.
    

            Biden did what he always planned to do before any crucial decision: He held a family meeting Saturday night. He has spoken to all of his family since making his decision to drop out of the race, and his daughter Ashley and son-in-law Howard drove to Rehoboth earlier Sunday, according to a source.
    

            But Biden consulted only a very small number of close aides on the decision. Some members of his inner circle were left in the dark until minutes before he posted his announcement on social media, including one of his closest communications advisers, Anita Dunn.
    

            Multiple sources told CNN that Dunn and a small group of senior aides became aware of Biden’s announcement in the minutes before the post. Many rank-and-file staff found out when the post came out. Dunn and her husband, Bob Bauer, were among Biden’s debate prep team and had faced the ire of the president’s family in the aftermath of the debate. A Biden aide disputed that her exclusion had anything to do with the debate, telling CNN that she, along with other top aides, was not in Rehoboth Beach, and that “the president told his aides that neither he or his family blame them for debate performance.”
    

            Biden and Harris spoke multiple times Sunday ahead of his announcement, according to a source familiar with the matter. Biden also held separate calls with chief of staff Jeff Zients and campaign co-chair Jen O’Malley Dillon informing each of his decision.
    

            In Washington on Sunday, Zients led a White House senior staff call with all assistants to the president in the mid-afternoon, as well as a call with members of Biden’s Cabinet. Zients is expected to hold an all-White House staff call Monday morning, and speak with political appointees across the executive branch.
    

            But even his vice president and pick to succeed him, didn’t find out until the day he announced his decision.
    

            In the end, Biden was confronting an untenable path forward: More than three dozen Democrats had publicly called for him to exit the race. Party leaders had told him he couldn’t win. And the money was drying up from donors who said they felt betrayed by the lack of disclosure around the condition of Biden’s health.
    

            “I don’t know one big donor who is going to write a check for $100,000 or more. And I know a lot of those guys,” one major Democratic donor told CNN before Biden dropped out.
    

            Biden and his team tried to play off the debate performance as a “bad night.” He and his aides blamed the president’s overseas trip. He said he would debate again and do better. And he returned immediately to the campaign trail, traveling to North Carolina the following day and delivering an energetic speech while acknowledging his debate shortcomings.
    

            “I know I’m not a young man. I don’t walk as easy as I used to. I don’t speak as smoothly as I used to. I don’t debate as well as I used to, but I know what I do know. I know how to tell the truth,” Biden said.
    

            Biden huddled with his family at Camp David the weekend after the debate for a previously scheduled get-together, during which they encouraged him to stay in the race.
    

            But in Democratic circles, panic had already set in. The issue problem was plain as day: Biden’s biggest problem with voters was they didn’t feel he was up to the job for the next four years. The debate had confirmed their fears and brought Biden’s biggest political weakness to the forefront. No policy or statement or criticism of Trump could change that.
    

            Even as Biden insisted there was nothing that could convince him to get out of the race, Democrats began laying the groundwork and keeping the door open to a change. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi went on MSNBC, saying: “I think it’s a legitimate question to say, is this an episode, or is this a condition?”
    

            Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas was the first elected Democrat to call for Biden to withdraw on July 2. The following day, Biden met with a group of Democratic governors, telling them he needed more sleep and should stop scheduling events after 8 p.m.
    

            On July 5, Biden sat down for an interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos, in an attempt to demonstrate he was able to keep campaigning. In the interview, Biden said that only the “Lord Almighty” could convince him to leave the race, a comment that angered many Democrats.
    

            It was the first of several attempts from Biden’s team to put the president in the public eye and quell the growing discontent. All failed to do so.
    

            After July 4, Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, quietly tried to gather a group of Democrats who would hold a meeting with Biden, potentially urging him to exit the race. The idea died, however, when the effort leaked.
    

            House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries held a call with House Democrats over that weekend, during which several lawmakers said that Biden needed to step aside.
    

            On July 8, Biden fired off defiant a letter to congressional Democrats saying he would continue his reelection bid. “I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump,” he wrote.
    

            The calls for Biden to leave soon started coming from outside Washington. On July 10, George Clooney, penned a New York Times op-ed calling for Biden to step aside. Even more devastating for the president, Clooney said the Biden he saw at a June fundraiser was the same Biden the world saw at the June debate and that the president had declined since taking the Oval Office.
    

            Pelosi also continued to raise questions about Biden, declining to endorse him in an MSNBC interview the same day as Clooney’s op-ed. “It’s up to the president to decide if he’s going to run,” she said, even if that was a decision Biden had already seemed to have made.
    

            Several news outlets, including CNN, reported that Pelosi and former President Barack Obama had privately expressed concerns about the future of Biden’s campaign.
    

            On July 11, Biden held a solo news conference on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Washington. He opened the door a bit further to the possibility he could drop out, saying he would consider doing so if data showed he cannot win.
    

            Biden also made several small verbal slip ups, including calling Harris “Vice President Trump.” Earlier in the day, he had referred Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as “President Putin,” before correcting himself.
    

            After Biden’s news conference, a handful more congressional Democrats called for him to drop out, growing the number to 15. The list included Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, who said he deliberately waited until after the NATO meeting.
    

            That weekend, Biden met and held calls with various Democratic caucuses, including the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the moderate New Democrat Coalition. The call with moderate Democrats was tense, as Biden got into it with Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat who bluntly told him that voters are concerned about his vigor and strength, especially as it is perceived on the world stage.
    

            The president responded to Crow — an Army Ranger who served two tours in Afghanistan and one in Iraq — that he knows Crow is a Bronze Star recipient like his late son Beau, but that “he didn’t rebuild NATO.”
    

            At one point, Biden told Crow “I don’t want to hear that crap” in addressing the lawmaker’s concerns.
    

            More Democrats had been expected to publicly call for Biden’s exit that weekend, but the chatter came to a halt in an instant when an attempted assassin’s bullet came within millimeters of killing Trump at his Butler, Pennsylvania, rally.
    

            The assassination attempt turned the political world on its head, draining the public focus on Biden’s ability to govern for a second term and turning it squarely onto the bullet that grazed Trump’s ear, raising a flurry of questions about how a gunman was able to shoot at the Republican nominee for president five days before he was to accept the nomination.
    

            The pause would not last.
    

            Behind the scenes, Democratic pollsters circulated memos showing Biden was on track to lose the election, and – importantly to congressional Democrats – damage candidates in ballot races, too. Some polling showed other Democrats outpacing Biden in battleground states.
    

            “Lose everything,” was how one Democrat described a polling memo Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg had sent to Biden’s inner circle.
    

            The dam reopened on Wednesday when California Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic Senate candidate and leader of Trump’s first impeachment, became the first lawmaker to join the public calls for Biden to withdraw from the campaign after the assassination attempt.
    

            Schiff’s place in the party – as a potential soon-to-be senator and close ally to Pelosi – made his voice among the most significant to that point.
    

            “While the choice to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden’s alone, I believe it is time for him to pass the torch,” Schiff said in a statement.
    

            More voices soon followed. And arguably more importantly, the private pleas for Biden to leave the race became part of a public cacophony of voices urging his withdrawal.
    

            Rep. Jamie Raskin, the Maryland House Democrat who led Trump’s second impeachment, confirmed that he had written a letter to Biden on July 6 encouraging the president that there was “no shame in taking a well-deserved bow” out of the 2024 presidential election – and making his argument with comparisons to George Washington and Red Sox pitching great Pedro Martinez.
    

            CNN reported Wednesday that Pelosi privately told Biden that polling showed he could not defeat Trump and that he could destroy Democrats’ chances of winning the House in November. Biden pushed back, saying he had seen polls indicating he could win. At one point, Pelosi asked Donilon, Biden’s longtime adviser, to get on the line to talk over the data.
    

            That same day, ABC News reported that Schumer told Biden in their Saturday meeting that it would be best if he bowed out of the presidential race. And a person briefed on the meeting between Biden and Jeffries said that the Democratic House leader stopped short of calling on him to step aside — instead pinning the suggestion on his members.
    

            The White House and congressional officers tried to tamp down the reports, issuing statements of denial. But the stories about the party leaders delivering Biden a message had their effect. On Friday, a dozen new Democrats released statements saying Biden should exit the race.
    

            Among them: Another close Pelosi ally, Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California. A source with direct knowledge described Biden on Friday as “seething” at Pelosi, a sentiment that only grew in light of Lofgren’s letter.
    

            The public statements from Democrats illustrated one element of Biden’s challenge to stay in the race – but just as important were the defections from his donors that would have dried up fundraising in the home stretch of the campaign.
    

            Major Democratic donors were skeptical of Biden’s viability, and multiple said their concerns had received an icy reception from Biden campaign officials.
    

            “How do you think we feel?” a Democratic donor close to the Democratic National Committee and the White House told CNN before Biden dropped out, explaining the mood among donors. “We all feel betrayed that they were not honest with us about his health.”
    

            Two sources told CNN on Thursday that furious donors were also telling House and Senate Democratic campaign committees they would freeze contributions unless and until party leaders took stronger steps to get Biden to step aside.
    

            “Yes, that card has been played,” a senior House Democrat told CNN Thursday night.
    

            “They believe if Joe is at the top of the ticket, the House and Senate are gone, too,” said a Democratic strategist intimately involved in big-dollar fundraising. “They don’t want to throw good money after bad.”
    

            Moments after Biden’s announcement, donors abruptly began reaching out to advisers, pouring in money, according to sources involved in the discussions. In the leadup to Biden’s decision to exit the 2024 race, multiple donors had reached out to Harris’ team proactively to signal they would be willing to support her if she ran at the top of the ticket, according to three people familiar with the discussions.
    

            Up until the moment he dropped out, Biden and his team insisted he was staying in.
    

            Biden’s team created a public schedule for the president over the past week that was intended to show his ability to stay in the race.
    

            On Monday, he held another television interview with NBC News’ Lester Holt, where he acknowledged his sub-par debate performance while criticizing the media for focusing on his gaffes instead of Trump’s falsehoods. Biden again said he had no intention of stepping aside.
    

            Biden then traveled to Las Vegas for campaign stops, speeches planned at the NAACP National Convention and the UnidosUS annual conference, and interviews with BET and Univision. Biden told BET News’ Ed Gordon that the only thing that would push him to reconsider his reelection bid would be a “medical condition.”
    

            The president spoke at the NAACP conference, but before he could make his speech Wednesday at UnidosUS, he was dealt another blow: the positive Covid-19 diagnosis.
    

            The president returned to his Rehoboth Beach home that day to isolate, his public schedule shuttered indefinitely while he recovered.
    

            On Friday, Biden issued a statement Friday that he would be back on the campaign trail the following week, while Biden campaign chair Jen O’Malley went on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” Friday morning to say Biden was “absolutely” staying in the race.
    

            The campaign also put out a memo saying there was “no plan for an alternative nominee.”
    

            Biden called some Democrats over the weekend who were out on TV on his behalf. Two told CNN that Biden voiced his gratitude and then his anger at those who were trying to push him out. “There was some hurt in his voice but mostly anger,” one of the Biden loyalists said.
    

            Even on Sunday, Biden’s team continued to publicly maintain he wasn’t going anywhere. South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, a key Biden ally, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” that Biden and Harris “have received over 14 million votes to be our standard bearers. That’s where we are,” Clyburn. The congressman’s 2020 endorsement of Biden ahead of the South Carolina primary was widely seen as instrumental in Biden’s victory.
    

            Biden spoke to Harris on Sunday before announcing his decision, which came in two messages: The first saying he was dropping out, and the second endorsing his vice president to be the Democratic nominee.
    

            Biden told his senior-most team he was getting out around 1:45 p.m., and the public letter went out right around then, a source familiar with the timing told CNN.
    

            “Before that, it was all steam ahead that he’s running,” the same source said.

CNN_4,Mayorkas names bipartisan panel to lead independent review of Trump assassination attempt,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/trump-assassination-attempt-independent-review-mayorkas/index.html,2024-07-22 09:00:00,politics,"
            Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, under pressure from the White House and Congress, unveiled Sunday the experts who will be conducting an independent review of the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, tapping former senior Homeland Security officials who served under multiple administrations, as well as law enforcement officials.
    

            Some of those chosen to serve on the independent panel include Janet Napolitano, a former DHS Secretary, and Mark Filip, a former federal judge and deputy attorney general to President George W. Bush.

Minute-by-minute: Visual timeline of the Trump assassination attempt


            The Department of Homeland Security and the White House have been closely managing how the Secret Service is handling the fallout from the attempt on Trump’s life. The independent review is an effort by officials to get ahead of congressional reviews and hearings happening on Capitol Hill, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN.
    

            Over recent days, the Department of Homeland Security had been reaching out to individuals, including some former government officials, to gauge interest and select who will be on the panel.
    

            Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, who has faced sharp criticism in the week since the shooting at Trump’s Butler, Pennsylvania, rally, said the agency is “eager to cooperate” with the bipartisan, independent review of the agency’s actions related to the incident.
    

            “I look forward to the panel examining what happened and providing recommendations to help ensure it will never happen again,” Cheatle said in a statement Sunday evening.
    

            In the days since the attack on the former president and Republican presidential nominee, relatively little has come out about the shooter’s motive, how he was able to perch on a nearby rooftop with an AR-style weapon and why Trump’s team wasn’t warned about a potential threat. Republican lawmakers in particular have been upset with the lack of answers, with some calling for Cheatle’s resignation.
    

            The review stems from a request by President Joe Biden to conduct an independent review of the assassination attempt. Mayorkas told reporters last week that he wanted the review up and running in a matter of days.
    

            “We are committed to getting to the bottom of what happened on July 13, and I am grateful to the distinguished members of this independent review who will bring decades of expertise in law enforcement and security operations to this important investigation,” Mayorkas said in a statement Sunday.
    

            “This independent review will examine what happened and provide actionable recommendations to ensure they carry out their no-fail mission most effectively and to prevent something like this from ever happening again,” he added.

CNN_5,Biden will not seek reelection; endorses Harris,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/joe-biden-drops-out-election/index.html,2024-07-22 08:29:00,politics,"
President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him on Sunday.
    

            “It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,” Biden wrote in a letter posted to his official account on X. “And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.”
    

            Biden said he will speak to the nation later this week in more detail.

Harris will seek Democratic nomination and could be the first Black woman and Asian American to lead a major party ticket


            In a follow-up post, Biden praised Harris and urged Democrats to unite behind her. “My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President,” Biden wrote. “And it’s been the best decision I’ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year.”
    

            Harris, who was informed of Biden’s decision Sunday, said in a statement that she was “honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination.” She is spending the day reaching out to lawmakers, outside organizations and donors, and was slated to make up to 200 calls on Sunday alone, a top Democratic source close to her told CNN.
    

            Many prominent Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, quickly came out in support of Harris, although some who released statements reacting to Biden’s decision did not mention the vice president, including former President Barack Obama.
    

            “I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,” Obama said in a statement that kept the focus on Biden.
    

            An adviser said Obama is taking the same approach as he did in the 2020 Democratic primary, watching closely with the intent of being able to help unify the party when a nominee is chosen – whether it is Harris or someone else.
    

            Others explicitly called for an open process to determine who should replace Biden at the top of the ticket.
    

            Later Sunday, the Biden-Harris campaign formally amended its filings with the Federal Election Commission to rename its principal committee “Harris for President.” But Harris’ ascension to the top of the ticket isn’t a certainty. The nominee will now be determined by the delegates to the Democratic National Convention. While Biden won an overwhelming majority of the delegates during the primary process earlier this year, they are now free to choose a candidate of their choice and he cannot simply transfer them to Harris.

Inside Biden’s unprecedented exit from the presidential race


            Biden’s departure capped off weeks of concern about the 81-year-old president’s stamina and mental capabilities and skepticism of his ability to effectively campaign against former President Donald Trump and govern the country for another four years. While Biden said he is committed to serving out the remainder of his term, his decision sparked immediate calls from Republicans for him to step down as president. Trump said Biden “is not fit to serve” in a post on Truth Social.
    

            In a phone call with CNN after Biden’s announcement, Trump said Biden would go down “as the single worst president by far in the history of our country” and said he thought Harris would be easier to defeat than Biden.
    

            Other leading Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, called on Biden to “resign the office immediately.”
    

            “If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President,” Johnson said in a statement.
    

            It’s the first time a one-term US president has dropped out of a reelection run in decades and recalls President Lyndon Johnson’s decision not to seek a second full term in 1968 – though Biden’s decision comes months later in the campaign than Johnson’s. It’s also the latest shocking development in a highly charged political campaign that has included an attempt on Trump’s life.
    

            But not even the attempted assassination on Trump and its tumultuous effect on the race would pause the drain of support Biden was facing among congressional Democrats who became increasingly convinced that a wipeout in November would also drown their down-ballot contests as well.
    

            Biden’s final decision to leave the race was reached in the last 48 hours, a senior campaign adviser said, as he consulted family and top advisers by telephone. He did not have a final in-person meeting with his top campaign or White House advisers as he recovered from Covid-19 at his beach home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.
    

            As his decision neared its end, first lady Jill Biden remained her husband’s most ardent supporter. “Down to the last hours of the decision only he could make, she was supportive of whatever road he chose,” Jill Biden’s communications director Elizabeth Alexander said in a statement to CNN.
    

            The president’s exit from the race sets the stage for the conclusion to a political career that has spanned a half-century, one that saw Biden enter as one of the youngest senators in US history and exit as its oldest president.
    

            Age and questions about the president’s mental faculties had been Biden’s biggest political liability since he first ran against Trump in 2020. Biden’s disastrous performance at a June 27 CNN debate – during which the president spoke softly, had a glazed-over look and, at one point, appeared to lose his train of thought mid-sentence while his opponent delivered an animated, while mainly fact-free performance – brought those concerns to the forefront of the political conversation and ultimately doomed his reelection push.
    

            Biden’s campaign had asked for the June debate in the hopes that it would force voters to tune into the race – and what Biden had said was at stake – earlier than usual. But that strategy appeared to backfire as the president solidified what had been the most persistent concern about his candidacy.
    

            The president’s performance shocked his donors, closest allies and the 50 million Americans who saw Biden stumble throughout the 90-minute debate — the most extensive exposure to an unscripted Biden since the last round of general-election debates four years ago. It left the White House and Biden campaign in a frenzied scramble to explain away his condition – at first, blaming it on a cold, before days later saying the president had been jet lagged by his international travel that wrapped up about 12 days prior to the debate.
    

            The president’s surrogates and campaign officials sought to soothe Democratic anxieties, hurriedly calling meetings with donors and top supporters to assure them that Biden’s performance was the product of one bad night and ask them to consider it in the context of his three-and-a-half-year presidency.

What happens in the Democratic nomination now that Biden has left the race


            The president himself recognized how poorly the night had gone almost immediately; at a campaign rally the next day, he sought to promote an animated and energized image that had largely been absent from the debate stage.
    

            “I don’t walk as easy as I used to,” Biden said. “I don’t speak as smoothly as I used to. I don’t debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. I know how to do this job. I know how to get things done.”
    

            But the damage had already been done.
    

            By the Monday after the debate, murmurs about replacing Biden on the ticket had grown into a full public conversation. The mood in the White House and at Biden’s campaign headquarters in Wilmington had turned sour. Biden, seeking to assert his control over his campaign and the presidency, delivered brief remarks that evening on the Supreme Court’s immunity decision earlier that day, asking voters to “dissent” in a rare political overture from the White House.
    

            The next day, Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas became the first member of Congress from Biden’s own party to ask him to drop out. The fractures in Biden’s support have grown steadily wider every day since. By the time Biden exited the race, dozens of lawmakers had asked him to bow out.
    

            So had major donors. Actor George Clooney, who has known Biden for years and was one of Hollywood’s biggest boosters of the president, said in a July 10 New York Times opinion piece that Democrats “are not going to win in November with this president” and called for the party to pick a new nominee.
    

            Biden was initially defiant that he would remain in the race. But as the defections in his base of support continued, and leading Democrats in Congress continued to have difficult conversations with the president about his odds against Trump and the damaging effect he might have on down-ballot Democrats in competitive races, Biden opened himself up more to the idea of dropping out of the race.
    

            In an interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on July 5, Biden laughed off questions about his political future and said only the “Lord Almighty” could convince him to drop from the race.
    

            Days later, Stephanopoulos candidly told a passerby that he also didn’t think Biden could serve another four years.
    

            Biden told reporters at a NATO news conference he would drop out if polls showed he could not win. About a week later, he said he would reevaluate whether to stay in if he had “some medical condition that emerged” and doctors told him that would be an issue. The next day, the White House announced that Biden had Covid-19.
    

            The attempt on Trump’s life on July 13 briefly stemmed the flow of congressional Democrats calling for Biden to drop out and pulled the national attention away from his faltering presidential campaign. But the reprieve didn’t last long. California Rep. Adam Schiff on July 17 became the first House Democrat to call on Biden to step down since the assassination attempt, and more followed in the ensuing days.
    

            Biden’s evolution on his future as the party’s nominee tracked closely with efforts among his biggest allies to convince him the path to victory was narrow. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Biden weeks after his debate that polls showed he could not win.
    

            A senior Democratic adviser told CNN the president was becoming “receptive” to conversations about him stepping aside: “He’s gone from saying, ‘Kamala can’t win,’ to ‘Do you think Kamala can win?”
    

            Those conversation accelerated as Biden isolated at his beach home with Covid over the last few days. Saturday night, Biden asked two of his closest advisers to start drafting the letter, according to a person familiar with the matter.
    

            Many rank-and-file staff found out about Biden’s decision when the post came out.

CNN_6,"As dozens of Hill Democrats back Harris, here’s why key Democratic leaders haven’t yet weighed in",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/democrats-biden-harris-endorsement/index.html,2024-07-22 08:15:00,politics,"
            Democratic leadership on Capitol Hill is currently not weighing in on whether Vice President Kamala Harris should be the party’s presidential nominee to avoid the appearance that they are forcing her candidacy onto the voters too quickly, according to two sources familiar with their thinking.
    

            In the hours since President Joe Biden announced he would not seek reelection and endorsed Harris to succeed him, dozens of Democratic lawmakers have publicly stated their support for Harris to become the nominee.
    

            But key party leaders have not yet done the same, and some Democratic lawmakers have called for an open process to determine the next Democratic presidential nominee. Democratic Party leaders now face a delicate balancing act as they hope to see their party unify behind a new nominee without alienating any factions after Biden’s historic decision upended the presidential race.
    

            Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries both praised Biden in statements following the president’s announcement but did not explicitly mention Harris.
    

            “Joe Biden has not only been a great president and a great legislative leader, but he is a truly amazing human being,” Schumer said in a statement. “His decision of course was not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first.”
    

            Jeffries, in a statement, called Biden “one of the most accomplished and consequential leaders in American history,” and said, “America is a better place today because President Joe Biden has led us with intellect, grace and dignity. We are forever grateful.”
    

            Former President Barack Obama similarly lauded Biden but did not mention Harris.
    

            “We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead. But I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,” Obama said in a statement.
    

            Many prominent Democrats, however, have been quick to voice their support for Harris.
    

            Washington state Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, who is president pro tempore of the Senate, said she respects Biden’s “willingness to pass the torch” and went on to endorse Harris for president.
    

            “We must beat Donald Trump — and I know Kamala Harris can win. I am behind Vice President Harris one-hundred percent — she is exactly the woman we need to prosecute the case against Donald Trump, save American democracy, lead the fight to restore abortion rights, and build an economy that puts working people — not billionaires — first. I will do everything I can to help elect Kamala Harris as our next President,” she said in a statement.
    

            Rep. Ted Lieu, vice chair of the House Democratic Caucus, also endorsed Harris on Sunday.
    

            “Four years ago, I was the first Member of Congress to endorse Kamala Harris for President,” he wrote in a statement. “So honored to endorse @KamalaHarris again for President.”
    

            Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina also endorsed Harris for president.
    

            Referring to Biden, he said, “I echo the good judgement he demonstrated in selecting Vice President Harris to lead this nation alongside him, and I am proud to follow his lead in support of her candidacy to succeed him as the Democratic Party’s 2024 nominee for President.”
    

            Congressional Progressive Caucus Chairwoman Pramila Jayapal endorsed Harris. And in a statement by Reps. Gregory Meeks of New York and Steven Horsford of Nevada, the Congressional Black Caucus PAC endorsed Harris as the next Democratic nominee for president.
    

            “She has been instrumental in delivering the accomplishments of the last 3.5 years and has led on lowering maternal mortality rates, protecting reproductive freedoms, and ensuring economic opportunities for all,” they wrote in a statement. “She will do an excellent job as President of the United States.”
    

            At the same time, some congressional Democrats are calling for an open process to select a new nominee.
    

            Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas, who was the first Democrat in Congress to call on Biden to step aside, said in a statement, “I continue to urge a fair, open, and democratic process to select the nominee best able to convince battleground voters to reject Trump’s dark, retribution-fueled plans.”
    

            “While, with President Biden’s endorsement, Vice President Harris is clearly the leading candidate, we should be open to all talented individuals who wish to be considered.”

CNN_7,Here’s what happened the last time a president chose not to run for a second term,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/03/politics/lbj-biden-what-matters/index.html,2024-07-22 08:15:00,politics,"
            President Joe Biden is the first president in more than a generation to decide not to seek a second term.
    

            But Biden’s situation is unique in American politics. He had planned to run and won nearly every delegate to the Democratic National Convention next month. Questions about his age and acuity ultimately convinced him to pull out of the presidential race. He endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to be his successor as the Democratic presidential nominee.
    

            Biden announced his decision in a letter posted to social media after weeks of fevered speculation, making him one of a handful of presidents who decided to step aside rather than seek reelection.
    

            Most recently, in 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson shocked the country when he made the surprise announcement that he would not run at the end of an Oval Office speech on his plan to limit US military operations in Vietnam. Here’s part of that address:
    

        With America’s sons in the fields far away, with America’s future under challenge right here at home, with our hopes and the world’s hopes for peace in the balance every day, I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office–the Presidency of your country. Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President.
    

            It is a remarkable speech to watch today.
    

            Nearly 60 years old when he made that speech, Johnson looked much older. He would die of a sudden heart attack in 1973 at 64, before eligibility for retirement programs like Medicare, which he signed into law, and Social Security, which he expanded.
    

            By the time he bowed out of the race, Johnson, unlike Biden, was facing multiple challenges for the Democratic nomination in the spring of 1968. Racial strife in the US, paired with a country fractured over the war in Vietnam, hurt Johnson’s popularity. In early 1968, the Tet offensive in Vietnam showed Communist forces there to be must stronger than the US military had claimed, and American casualties in the war mounted.
    

            Earlier that March, Johnson only narrowly won the New Hampshire primary against the anti-war candidate Sen. Eugene McCarthy. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, the brother of the man whose assassination elevated Johnson to the White House, entered the presidential race on March 16.
    

            Vietnam split the party in 1968, but the growing rift among Democrats over the war was not the only reason Johnson pulled out of the race, according to Mark Updegrove, a presidential historian and CEO of the LBJ Foundation.
    

I talked to Updegrove in 2022 about why presidents might not run for reelection, and he told me at the time that Biden, like LBJ, should consider his health before seeking another four-year White House term.
    

            “There’s the misconception that LBJ opted not to run again due solely to the growing controversy and divisions over the war in Vietnam. That may have been part of it, but his principal concern was his health,” Updegrove said.
    

            “He had had a nearly fatal heart attack in 1955, and his family had a history of fatal heart disease. He didn’t want to put the country through the kind of crisis we had gone through with the sudden death of FDR in 1945, and Woodrow Wilson’s stroke in 1919, which left him incapacitated,” Updegrove added.
    

            1968 is an infamous year in US history, and Johnson’s March 31 announcement kicked off a period of violence and uncertainty.
    

            Less than a week after Johnson announced his decision not to run for reelection, Martin Luther King Jr. was shot by a sniper on April 4, an event that sparked a wave of violence and riots that devastated many American cities, including Washington, DC, Baltimore and Chicago. Johnson deployed 58,000 National Guardsmen and Army troops to US cities.
    

            In June of that year, Kennedy was assassinated in California, creating even more turmoil. His son is now running for president as an independent.

Opinion: Before Democrats think about replacing Biden, they should remember 1968


            In 1968, Democrats ultimately sidestepped McCarthy, who channeled the anti-war sentiment. Instead, they elevated Johnson’s vice president, Hubert Humphrey, as their nominee at the Democratic National Convention – which, like it will be this summer, was held in Chicago that year too. As Humphrey accepted the nomination in the convention hall, riots raged in the streets outside.
    

            That November, Humphrey ran close to Richard Nixon, a Republican and the ultimate winner, but the independent candidate George Wallace, a former Democrat, won multiple Southern states with a populist and segregationist appeal. Wallace also likely siphoned votes away from Humphrey in key states.
    

            Johnson capitalized on a period of unity after the death of John F. Kennedy to pass landmark civil rights legislation. He won his own landslide reelection in 1964 and used that momentum to enact a series of laws meant to build the US into a “great society,” including Medicare and the Voting Rights Act, and declared a war on poverty.
    

            Those civil rights achievements were not universally celebrated in the US, and they hastened a realignment of the American political parties in which his Democrats went from the dominant to the minority party in the American South.

CNN_8,"More than 1,500 US flights canceled for the third day straight as airlines slowly recover from global tech outage",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/us/tech-outage-flight-cancellations-united-delta-airlines/index.html,2024-07-22 08:09:00,us,"
            More than 1,500 US flights have been canceled for the third day straight, as airlines struggle to recover from a global tech outage that left thousands of passengers stranded at airports.
    

            Around 1,600 flights into, within or out of the United States were canceled by Sunday evening, while more than 8,500 US flights were delayed, according to the tracking website FlightAware.com.
    

            More than 1,000 of those cancelations were from Delta Air Lines, the website shows.
    

            The airline is continuing its recovery efforts following “an outside vendor technology issue” resulting in delays and cancelations, Delta said Sunday. The airline is communicating directly with some impacted customers, offering travel vouchers, waivers and SkyMiles Program miles, it said.
    

            In an update to Delta customers Sunday afternoon, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said the airline’s teams are still working to recover their system and restore operations.
    

            “Canceling a flight is always a last resort, and something we don’t take lightly,” Bastian said.
    

            On Saturday, 2,136 flights among multiple carriers were canceled, and more than 21,300 flights were delayed, according to FlightAware.

A global tech outage brought many computer systems and businesses to a screeching halt. Here’s what happened


            The issue extended beyond airports, with businesses, government agencies, health and emergency services, banks, schools and universities around the world grinding to a halt or seeing services disrupted due to a flawed software update for Microsoft Windows operating systems issued by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, experts told CNN.
    

            The outage affected an estimated 8.5 million Windows devices, according to Microsoft.
    

            CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz apologized to customers and said a fix has been deployed, but experts say getting systems back in order will be a lengthy process.
    

            Major airlines have said services are being restored, but there could be more delays and disruptions.
    

            A majority of United Airlines systems have recovered from Friday’s outage, though some delays and cancellations are still possible, the airline said in a statement. More than 400 United flights were canceled Saturday, and over 200 flights were canceled Sunday, according to FlightAware.com.
    

            Delta has paused unaccompanied minor travel until Wednesday due to the outage, the airline announced over the weekend. Unaccompanied children who are already booked on a Delta flight will not be able to travel, and the airline has asked that no new flights be booked for them.
    

            Also impacted was American Airlines, which said in a statement  Friday “we were able to safely reestablish our operation” and it had “issued a travel waiver for our customers impacted by the vendor technology issue earlier this morning.” Allegiant Air said in a statement Saturday while “normal operations have resumed” after the outage, they’re processing a backlog of customer messages and troubleshooting their programs and platforms.
    

            Even with the flawed computer update rolled back, it’s not a quick fix for airlines, which have computers at thousands of gates that will need to be individually manually rebooted, David Kennedy, cofounder of cybersecurity company Binary Defense, told CNN on Saturday.
    

            “It’s not just as simple as rebooting. There’s a lot more steps and complexities in this that are involved,” Kennedy said. “There’s just not enough people at those airports, at those locations to go and do it.”
    

            The US Department of Transportation on Friday said it determined the flight delays and cancelations resulting from the system outage were “controllable,” meaning they’re “attributable to the airline.” In such cases, the airlines “must adhere to their customer service commitments.”
    

            Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in a social media post Saturday said he received reports of some airlines only offering flight credits to passengers for canceled flights.
    

            “Let me be clear — you are entitled to get your money back promptly if your flight is canceled and you don’t take a rebooking,” Buttigieg said.
    

            Flight cancelations persist at the world’s busiest airport, Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, where officials have implemented a “concessions crisis plan, ensuring concessions availability while all flights are operating.”
    

            “We’ve provided assistance and guidance to passengers spending the night in the airport, and we’re collaborating with our airlines to create space for luggage reunification areas,” an airport spokesperson told CNN on Sunday.
    

            “It just seems like nobody cares about us. We’re sleeping on the floor. There’s kids sleeping on the floor and no one’s done anything about it,” traveler Anthony Augugliaro told CNN affiliate WSB on Sunday.
    

            Long lines of passengers also waited for assistance at the airport Saturday. Delta passenger Catalina Villareal described the scene: “Mayhem. Chaos. Frustration. Hunger.”
    

            Villareal said she had experienced three flights cancellations.

The global software outage affected this forecaster’s broadcast. He took the weather report into his own hands – literally


            Charlotte Yeh, a traveler at Boston Logan International Airport, told CNN affiliate WFXT Saturday she received no notification her flight to Fort Lauderdale for her father’s 96th birthday was canceled.
    

            Thousands of people face the same uncertainty as they cram together in airports across the country, waiting for answers.
    

            “I was supposed to be in California for my mom’s wedding,” Richard Whitfield of Pasco County, Florida, told CNN on Saturday. Whitfield and his partner, Jonathan Shade, left Tampa on Thursday and missed their connecting flight in Atlanta due to poor weather conditions, delaying their landing and forcing the plane to refuel in Tallahassee.
    

            After their rescheduled flight on Friday was delayed many times, the couple decided to cancel the trip and just head home. But with no available flights back to Tampa on Friday night, they spent their second night in an airport hotel. They were unable to get a voucher from Delta for either of their stays.
    

            “(Richard has) been on hold for 24 hours,” Shade told CNN. “When he eventually got his number in line, it was 2,001.”
    

            Two hours later, Richard’s place in Delta Air Lines’ virtual customer service queue was 2,300 in line, Shade said.
    

            Whitfield told CNN the whole ordeal has had an impact on him.
    

            “For me, it’s been the domino effect that it has on humanity and everything that we need to survive: food, sleep, or water, housing,” he said.
    

            After spending 48 hours in Atlanta, they found a Saturday evening flight back to Tampa they say they can only hope is not delayed or canceled. For now, there is nothing the couple can do but wait and “get a good stiff drink,” Shade and Whitfield said.

CNN_9,The delegates will decide the next Democratic nominee as a groundswell forms for Harris,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/delegates-democratic-ticket-harris/index.html,2024-07-22 09:08:00,politics,"
            Democratic convention delegates are draining the political drama from Joe Biden’s decision to give up the presidential nomination by quickly coalescing around his chosen successor, Vice President Kamala Harris.
    

            The North Carolina and Tennessee delegations came out in unanimous support of Harris late Sunday. South Carolina Democrats also delivered a public vote of confidence.
    

            Harris’ swift ascent provides some rare good news for Democrats who have been agonizing over Biden’s fate for weeks. Biden’s endorsement has weight, but no formal bearing on the process. The makeup of ticket now rests with the roughly 4,700 delegates who will, in the coming weeks, vote for a new standard-bearer.
    

            Interviews with more than two dozen delegates in the immediate aftermath of Biden’s announcement suggest the vice president is the clear leader. Delegates pledged to Biden are under no obligation to support his choice, but their loyalty to him and his wishes suggests the lion’s share will quickly fall in line behind Harris. Many already have; some are now contacting other delegates, with no input yet from Harris’ campaign, to shore up her support.
    

            “Every one of us (delegates) were vetted and worked for Biden or the Biden campaign in some way, whether we volunteered or donated or something. These are all Biden people,” said Joe Caiazzo, a Biden delegate from Massachusetts who praised the president’s “selfless, patriotic” decision.
    

            What follows is less than certain – and unprecedented in modern political history.
    

            Current party rules were largely designed to pass the nominating process off to primary voters and ahead of an orderly, made-for-TV roll call vote to confirm their choice. But that pro forma process is not set in stone. The Democratic National Committee will likely need to do more work, either through interpretation of their existing rules or by passing new ones, to clarify the next steps.
    

            “In short order, the American people will hear from the Democratic Party on next steps and the path forward for the nomination process,” DNC Chair Jaime Harrison said on Sunday.
    

            Even before Biden’s bolt landed, Democrats were at odds over when and how the nominating vote would take place.
    

            Under a proposed plan outlined Friday to the convention rules committee, it would be up to Harrison and convention chair Minyon Moore to set a specific date for voting to begin, though not before August 1. Delegates would vote via digital ballots, with at least 24 hours’ notice, much like they did in 2020 during the largely remote convention. That year, voting ran for nearly two weeks and, of the 4,747 ballots they sent out, only over a dozen were not returned, according to Andrew Binns, a senior adviser to the convention.
    

            An open letter from more than 75 current and former DNC members, shared with CNN, praised Biden for his decision to give way “to a new generation of public servants” and insisted that Harris is “the only person that can credibly claim the torch from the Biden-Harris Administration.”
    

            “We also firmly believe that Vice President Harris and her Vice Presidential selection will help Democratic candidates for U.S. House, Senate, and in the states we need to win in November, enabling us to enact laws that truly benefit the American people,” the authors said, addressing one of the concerns that led so many Democratic lawmakers to call for Biden to step aside.
    

            In the critical swing state of Michigan, where party chair Lavora Barnes almost immediately endorsed Biden, the leadership of the “uncommitted” movement – which won about 30 delegates during a protest campaign against the president’s handling of Israel’s war in Gaza – opened the door for Harris.
    

            “It’s time to align our actions with our values,” said Layla Elabed in a statement datelined Dearborn, a Detroit suburb where more than half of the population is of Middle Eastern or North African descent. “Vice President Harris can start the process to earn back trust by turning the page from Biden’s horrific policies in Gaza.”
    

            Harris made headlines in March when she called for a ceasefire in Gaza during a speech on the anniversary of “Bloody Sunday” at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama.
    

            One California delegate, who like others spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment in this pivotal moment, said he’s “relieved” and “excited” after hearing Biden stepped down. The delegate, who wanted Biden to quit the race after seeing his shaky performance in last month’s presidential debate, said he hoped Harris would replace Biden at the top of the ticket, calling her the “strongest” candidate.
    

            Another California delegate said she’s “feeling a huge sense of relief.” She had privately been concerned about Biden’s viability following the debate and hoped for weeks he would step aside.
    

            “We couldn’t go on like that any longer,” the delegate said, “without jeopardizing the entire election up and down the ballot.”
    

            A Massachusetts delegate told CNN that while he still strongly supports Biden’s agenda, the president’s “vision has failed to reach Americans.” The delegate said he has not yet decided who to support for the nomination, and believes the party needs a leader who “can help Americans understand what’s at stake.”
    

            Another erstwhile Biden delegate from Colorado said, “It is long overdue that there is a competitive nomination for president” at the Democratic convention. She also told CNN she’s not yet decided on who to support for the nomination. When asked about Harris, the delegate said she’s not convinced the vice president can win in November.
    

            “It is not clear that (Harris) is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump,” she said.
    

            A delegate from Florida told CNN he’s “disappointed” Biden dropped out and said Democrats owe Biden “a debt of gratitude” for winning the 2020 election and “setting up Democrats to defeat Trump again.”
    

            He said he’s taking his cues from Biden and plans to back Harris, who has been making calls to Democratic lawmakers asking for their support as she tries to consolidate the party over the coming days.
    

            In South Carolina, one Democratic delegate told CNN they were “sad” to hear the news, noting that the Palmetto State had been so critical in Biden’s primary victory four years ago.
    

            “We saved and relaunched Biden’s campaign, so it’s sad to see his electoral career – that we take a lot of pride in - come to an end,” the delegate said, while also warning that this affection and loyalty would not necessarily be passed on to Harris.
    

            The delegate told CNN they would prefer Harris “wins in a competitive process,” reasoning that that “she’d be a stronger nominee if she isn’t anointed.” Though getting the support of Rep. Jim Clyburn, the state’s most powerful Democrats and a close Biden ally, could settle the matter,
    

            “He’s still the titan of politics in South Carolina,” the delegate said. “Is he going to put his full shoulder into whipping for Harris? That’s all unanswered,”
    

            In a statement issued shortly after Biden’s, Harris on Sunday confirmed she is running for president and said she was “honored” to receive Biden’s endorsement. Harris said she intends to “earn and win” the presidential nomination in her first public statement since Biden’s stunning announcement.
    

            “Over the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election. And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead,” Harris said, before hinting at the condensed timeframe. “We have 107 days until Election Day. Together, we will fight. And together, we will win.”
    

            Shasti Conrad, chair of the Washington state Democrats, said the party is currently calling all their delegates to get a “temperature check” and make sure everyone has up-to-date information on the process ahead. They have a group call scheduled for later Sunday.
    

            Conrad, who officially endorsed Harris, is the first South Asian women to lead a state party and said she is “thrilled” that Harris is on track to become the nominee.
    

            “It really means that we are fully a part of this American story,” Conrad said, “and that people who look like her and look like myself in this country have a place in leadership.”

CNN_10,Trump’s team is already on the attack against Harris,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/trump-team-kamala-harris-attacks/index.html,2024-07-22 10:46:00,politics,"
            The Sunday after the June 27 presidential debate, top advisers to Donald Trump went to bed expecting the Democratic handwringing over President Joe Biden’s performance to cool and give way to a fresh cycle of headlines at the start of the new week.
    

            But when they awoke the next morning to the Democratic calamity intensifying, they began the early plotting for the extraordinary potential scenario of Biden stepping aside.
    

            Behind the scenes, between preparing for a convention and a nation-rattling assassination attempt, they also studied up on the field of potential Democratic contenders, polled Trump against a would-be replacement and began soft launching more attacks on Vice President Kamala Harris, believing her to be the most likely heir-apparent.
    

            Now, with Biden announcing he won’t run for reelection, the seeds of that work are already on display. Within hours of Biden dropping out of the race and endorsing his vice president on Sunday, Trump’s campaign managers had released a blistering statement tying Harris to the administration’s policies. Meanwhile, an aligned super PAC has reserved airtime in a handful of swing states to try to define Harris to impressionable voters as someone who enabled a clearly diminished Biden.
    

            Trump, too, worked quickly to gain the upper hand over whoever his next opponent may be by suggesting the next debate move from the agreed-upon host network, ABC, to the friendlier confines of Fox News.
    

            Biden, Trump wrote on social media, “was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve - And never was!”
    

            The three-week scramble by the Trump campaign to prepare for the unprecedented may have started as a contingency but it now becomes an urgent necessity. For all the times over the past year Trump has claimed he didn’t expect Biden’s candidacy to last until November, neither he nor his campaign took serious steps to prepare for that outcome.
    

            Instead, Trump’s team had orchestrated an exacting campaign around defeating Biden. It included millions of dollars already spent on models to predict results in key battlegrounds, putting in place a sophisticated data operation and readying an advertising blitz to contrast the two candidates. It’s a campaign built around the assumption Trump would face an 81-year-old whose physical state and mental acuity had become such an albatross that enough voters would overlook the Republican nominee’s many flaws.
    

            Now, much of that work will be unusable or at the very least must be reimagined for a race completely altered by recent events. Whether Democrats anoint Harris or another name, Trump, the oldest major party nominee in history, becomes the candidate whose age is a concern for some voters.
    

            “The real value (Harris) brings is simply the fact that Democrats won’t have to worry whether their nominee can meet the minimal threshold of fitness for office,” said one Republican strategist who asked not to be named to speak freely. “That means this will be a real campaign.”
    

            For a time, Republicans gleefully watched the chaos unfolding on the Democratic side, and Trump for a couple weeks laid low while Biden fumbled through the fallout. But it was soon widely acknowledged within Trump’s camp that Biden bowing out would also throw their own campaign into uncertainty.
    

            As the calls for Biden to step down hit a fever pitch in early July, the Trump campaign started researching Democratic National Committee rules and bylaws to understand the internal processes that would take place if Biden should step aside, according to a senior official in the Trump campaign.
    

            Trump’s campaign also began privately ramping up and testing new lines of attack on Harris — someone they had largely ignored since she was sworn in as vice president. That included sprinkling new criticisms of the California Democrat into Trump’s speeches and encouraging the former president’s surrogates to do the same, according to two senior Trump advisers.
    

            Some of those new attacks revealed themselves at the Republican National Convention last week, where Harris was easily the second-most criticized Democrat on the stage behind Biden.
    

            Now that the moment has arrived, Trump’s team is planning a series of negative ads going after Harris’ record, not only under the Biden administration, but also during her time as a prosecutor and attorney general in California, a source familiar told CNN. The messaging will come through both the campaign and at least one super PAC aligned with the former president.
    

            While polling has shown Harris is the best known among possible Democratic candidates to replace Biden, Trump’s advisers and allies maintain that most Americans don’t know much about her, creating an opening to define her to the public.
    

            The leading pro-Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., launched a new 30-second spot Sunday, first shared on social media, previewing the plan of attack. The accusing ad said Harris “covered up Joe Biden’s obvious mental decline.” It proceeds to include clips of Harris praising Biden’s performance as president, saying, “Our president is in good shape, in good health, tireless, vibrant, and I have no doubt about the strength of the work that we have done.”
    

            The group, which has already spent $77 million on ads boosting Trump so far, announced plans to air the ad in the key battlegrounds of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania.
    

            Trump co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita last week hinted that the campaign intends to make an issue of Harris standing by Biden in the months leading up to the debate, when the president’s performance brought to the forefront concerns about his stamina.
    

            “You know how much tape we have on this?” LaCivita said Thursday at an event outside the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.
    

            Along those lines, Republicans have argued that Biden should step down immediately as president if he has concluded he can’t manage another four-year term.
    

            Trump’s campaign and allies also plan to argue that Harris is the person in the administration responsible for the border – a key theme in GOP messaging this year – after Biden deputized her in 2021 to tackle the root causes of migration from Central America. They also intend to tie her to the country’s inflation woes and are plotting similar messaging around crime they once prepared for Biden.
    

            “Over the last four years she co-signed Biden’s open border and green scam policies that drove up the cost of housing and groceries,” Trump’s new running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, said Sunday after Biden endorsed Harris. “She owns all of these failures.”
    

            Unknown, though, is whether voters who for months have told pollsters they dreaded a 2020 rematch will gravitate toward a fresh face. Many voters – including ones who intended to vote for Trump when he faced Biden – have deeply held negative opinions of the former president and have expressed a desire to move on from him.
    

            Harris also has an opportunity to reenergize Democrats who had grown disenchanted by Biden’s presidency. One veteran Republican strategist said Trump should prepare for Georgia – which Democrats had begun to believe was out of reach – to become competitive once again.
    

            “Biden was struggling with Black voters and young voters,” the strategist said. “Seems to me that Kamala will likely do better with those groups. The question is how much.”
    

            Brian Bartlett, an adviser to Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign, said Trump could also face new headwinds in swing states depending on who is tapped to join the Democratic ticket as vice president.
    

            “The writing’s been on the wall for a while now, so I expected they’re fairly prepared with messaging, oppo and the like,” Bartlett said. “Biggest potential challenge I see is if (Harris) picks a running mate that can bring over some of the blue wall or other key swing states.”
    

            Already some of those names have circulated as potential vice presidential picks, including Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper.
    

            The Trump campaign had prepared dossiers on some of those individuals, believing they could also emerge as potential successors, which one of the senior advisers referred to as “binders full of research.” Other names they’ve studied include Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and congressional leaders.
    

            But the majority of their focus in recent weeks has centered on Harris, they said, including conducting internal polling to test her in a match up against Trump, a second senior adviser said.
    

            Asked if they had begun to test Trump versus other Democrats in surveys, LaCivita last week responded in exasperation: “We’re a capable operation. What the hell do you think?”

CNN_11,Biden just made the hardest decision any politician can make,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/biden-ambition-democracy-analysis/index.html,2024-07-22 10:22:00,politics,"
President Joe Biden ran for reelection to save democracy. In the end, he came to the shattering realization he could only do so by ceding power himself.
    

            Biden reached the decision to end his campaign after days in isolation at his Delaware beach house with Covid-19 and after watching many Democrats desert the president who led them to power just four years ago.
    

            In offering to hand over power in service of what he saw as the national interest, he struck a contrast with former President Donald Trump, who fought bitterly against leaving office after loosing a free and fair election to Biden in 2020. It’s ironic that Republicans who whitewashed Trump’s election-stealing effort are now accusing Democrats of crushing the will of primary voters who voted for the president’s reelection bid.

            “It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,” Biden said in a letter he posted to X on Sunday afternoon. “And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.”
    

            Biden quickly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, but his late-in-the campaign decision sets off a potentially chaotic and divisive rush to rally behind a Democratic nominee in the month before the party convention in Chicago and less than four months before the election.
    

            The Biden campaign effectively ended in the 20 first, faltering minutes of his debate against Trump last month, when the president looked confused, exhausted and was unable to take the attack to his foe or to make an effective case for himself.
    

            His struggles validated concerns of majorities of voters that he would be too old for a second term that would have ended when he is 86. His fervent efforts to save his campaign in television interviews and campaign appearances only exacerbated the concerns about his showing in the CNN debate in Atlanta. Three weeks of severe erosion in his political position saw a daily drip of defections from Democratic lawmakers, while party grandees like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed from behind the scenes. The drying up of donor cash also seemed to make Biden’s campaign unsustainable. Even if he wanted to go on, it became clear that he couldn’t.
    

            Still Biden, proud and defiant, resisted every effort to push him out of the race, insisting, along with his loyal inner core of staff, that there was no other Democrat better qualified or more likely to beat Trump, whom the president views as an existential threat to American democracy and the country’s soul.
    

            But in the end, Biden could not find a way to make voters unsee the poignant picture of an 81-year-old commander in chief who appeared to have seriously declined and was stumbling in the debate.
    

            Biden’s impressive legislative record, which bears comparison with any Democratic president since Lyndon Johnson, was one of the reasons why he resisted attempts to push him out of the race, saying he wanted to finish the job.
    

            Becoming the oldest president ever elected, he was 78 when he took office. Biden declared in his inaugural address that the American political system of checks and balances had held and triumphed over Trump’s election lies – not knowing at the time that the ex-president’s threat to democracy would only grow.
    

            The new president immediately set about tackling the Covid-19 pandemic, the worst public health emergency in 100 years, which had been exacerbated by Trump’s mismanagement and politicization of his own government’s public health guidelines.
    

            Biden enacted a $1.9 trillion economic rescue package that the White House credited with helping to drive unemployment to near 50-year lows and spurring a faster rebound for the US economy than for other developed nations. Biden also passed a $750 billion health care, tax and climate bill known as the Inflation Reduction Act and a bipartisan infrastructure package that had eluded other recent presidents.
    

            But Biden badly underestimated the threat from inflation, which rose to 40-year-highs. While the cost of living has eased, many Americans are still feeling the punishing blowback from high grocery prices and elevated interest rates – which offered Trump an opening.
    

            Overseas, Biden responded forcibly to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, becoming the most important leader of the West since the end of the Cold War with his efforts to reinvigorate NATO. But the chaotic US exit from Afghanistan in the summer of 2021 hurt Biden’s self-proclaimed status as a foreign policy expert, and his handling of Israel’s war in Gaza damaged his standing with parts of his base.
    

            The soul searching that Biden endured led to a decision that in some ways represents a humiliating end for a politician who spent years pursuing the highest office and was frequently passed over in his climb to power.
    

            It is not an easy thing for a president — the most powerful person in the world — to separate his personal ambition from the fate of the nation. And the debilitating distancing that took place between top Democrats and Biden in recent weeks was a cruel lesson in the brutality of politics, given that the president had ejected Trump from power after the most tumultuous presidency in modern times. It must be an especially bitter pill for Biden that he will not be able to take the fight to Trump, who has spent the last three years saying he was too infirm and mentally diminished to effectively serve as president.

The 25 days that unraveled Biden’s campaign


            The ignominy of being effectively forced to shelve his reelection bid will also be painful for the president since he’s had to abandon two White House campaigns before — in 1987 after he was caught plagiarizing a British politician and in 2008 after he failed to gain traction in a blockbuster race that was dominated by Obama and former first lady Hillary Clinton. Sunday’s denouement was also the latest harrowing turn in a life of tragedy that saw Biden lose his first wife and infant daughter to a car crash when he’d been elected to the Senate from Delaware. He had to bury another child in 2015 when his beloved son Beau died of brain cancer. And in recent years, the president has been dealing with the pressure and pain of helping his other son Hunter through the horror of addiction and a personal crisis that culminated in a criminal conviction on a gun charge earlier this year.
    

            Given his political and personal history, it was no surprise that Biden would dig in his heels as calls mounted from within the Democratic Party for him to quit the race.
    

            But the growing possibility that his legacy would be remembered not for ousting the most aberrant president in modern American history but for paving the way for an even more extreme second Trump term, set in motion the political forces that would extinguish his hopes.
    

            If Biden’s gamble pays off and another Democratic candidate beats Trump, he may go down in history as one of the most successful one-term presidents in history. He will have enabled such a triumph by putting his own ambition on hold for the good of his party and the country. But his late exit will raise questions over whether he has saddled his party — and a Democratic successor — with an impossible task in standing up a campaign in a matter of days against a united Republican Party that emerged from its convention in Milwaukee last week convinced it was on a path to victory.
    

            Seeking a second term at the age of 81 turned out to be an impossible mission — and, despite his efforts, Biden may have saved his party huge problems had he reached the same conclusion before the primary season started.
    

            If history is a guide, Biden’s rock bottom approval ratings will spike in the coming days. When Johnson announced he would not run for a second term in his own right in 1968, he was greeted by massive crowds in subsequent public events around the country. Johnson made his move in March, during the primary campaign, and his departure set off a chaotic chain of events, worsened by the assassination of Democratic primary candidate Robert F. Kennedy, and a violence-plagued convention in Chicago — which will also host this year’s event. In the end, the eventual Democratic nominee, then-Vice Pre﻿sident Hubert Humphrey, lost to Republican Richard Nixon. Years earlier, in March 1952, Harry S. Truman, another Democratic president, had decided not to seek his own second term. The Democratic nominee that year, Adlai Stevenson, lost to Republican Dwight Eisenhower.
    

            But if Biden does enjoy a burst of support for his selflessness – and even nostalgia for the successes of what is now a lame duck presidency – it might not translate to his successor.
    

            No modern president has ever bowed out of the presidential race at such a late date. And Harris, or whoever picks up the baton, now faces one of the most daunting missions in electoral history, against an opponent who has already proved there is nothing he will not do to win.

CNN_12,Hunter Biden drops lawsuit against Fox News over ‘mock trial’ miniseries,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/media/hunter-biden-drops-fox-news-lawsuit-trial/index.html,2024-07-22 10:09:00,us,"
            Hunter Biden on Sunday abruptly dropped a lawsuit he filed last month against Fox News over the network’s fictionalized miniseries that he alleged included sexually explicit images of him without consent.
    

            Biden dropped the lawsuit just hours after his father, President Joe Biden, announced his decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, though it’s not clear if the timing is related.
    

            The decision came less than a month after the president’s son sued Fox News, claiming the right-wing network unlawfully published “intimate images” of him in a 2022 miniseries about his legal troubles on the Fox Nation streaming service.

Biden will not seek reelection; endorses Harris


            Representatives for Hunter Biden didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday. A Fox News spokesperson declined to comment.
    

            The miniseries, “The Trial of Hunter Biden,” was a six-part offering that featured a dramatized “mock trial” about Hunter Biden’s overseas financial dealings that led, in part, to his federal tax indictment and claims that fueled House Republicans’ stalled impeachment inquiry into his father.
    

            Fox News removed the miniseries from its platforms in late April after Biden threatened to file a lawsuit. Nonetheless, he sued the network on June 30.
    

            At the time, a Fox News spokesperson claimed the lawsuit was meritless and “entirely politically motivated,” and said the network looked forward to “vindicating our rights in court.”

            “Consistent with the First Amendment, Fox News has accurately covered the newsworthy events of Mr. Biden’s own making,” the spokesperson said.
    

            While Hunter Biden ended his lawsuit against Fox, his legal challenges continue. Biden, 54, faces a federal tax evasion trial scheduled for September. He was convicted earlier this year of three federal gun felonies in a separate trial. He has not, however, been charged in connection with the bribery and foreign lobbying allegations that were at the center of Fox’s miniseries.
    

            Earlier on Sunday, Biden released a statement praising his father’s historic decision to bow out of the 2024 race.
    

            “I’m so lucky every night I get to tell him I love him, and to thank him,” Biden wrote. “I ask all Americans to join me tonight in doing the same.  Thank you, Mr. President.  I love you, Dad.”

            Huge protests across Bangladesh escalated into deadly violence this week with clashes between students, pro-government supporters and armed police fueling widespread anger over civil service job quotas opponents say are discriminatory.
    

            Dozens of people have reportedly been killed and hundreds injured in the violence, which has seen riot police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters and crowds of demonstrators armed with sticks filling the streets and university campuses in the capital Dhaka and other cities.
    

            State broadcaster Bangladesh Television (BTV) was off air on Friday after student demonstrators allegedly set fire to its headquarters, according to local media, and protesters have called for a nationwide shutdown in a major challenge to the government of longstanding Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
    

            A curfew has been imposed, mobile and internet services cut, schools and universities ordered to close, and security forces deployed to quell the unrest, with human rights groups accusing authorities of using unlawful force against protesters.
    

            On Sunday, Bangladesh’s Supreme Court rolled back most of the controversial quotas on government jobs, with officials saying they hope it will bring normalcy back to the streets.
    

            Here’s what you need to know.
    

            Many Bangladeshi students are demanding an end to the government’s quota system, which reserves more than half of civil service posts for certain groups.
    

            Some 30% of those highly sought-after jobs are reserved for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh’s war of independence from Pakistan in 1971, a seminal moment in the nation’s history as it successfully won freedom from a much larger ruler.
    

            Many of the country’s contemporary political elite are related to that generation – including Prime Minister Hasina, a daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the widely regarded founder of modern Bangladesh who was assassinated in 1975.
    

            The reserved roles are linked to job security and higher pay, and protesters say the quota system is discriminatory and favors supporters of Hasina’s ruling Awami League party. They are demanding recruitment based on merit.
    

            “A government job is a really good opportunity,” said Maruf Khan, 29, a Bangladeshi studying in Australia, who has joined rallies supporting the protests in Sydney. “About 500,000 to 600,000 people are competing for 600 to 700 government jobs and on top of that it includes a 56% quota. It’s not easy.”
    

            Driving the anger is high unemployment levels in the country, especially among young people. Bangladesh has seen strong economic growth under Hasina, but it has slowed in the post-pandemic era and, as the World Bank notes in its latest overview, inequality has “widened in urban areas.” In a nation of 170 million people, more than 30 million are not in work or education.
    

            In 2018, the quota system was scrapped following similar protests but in June the High Court reinstated it, ruling its removal was unconstitutional. On July 10, the Supreme Court suspended the quotas for one month while it took up the case.
    

            Critics and protesters say the quota system creates a two-tier Bangladesh where a politically connected elite benefit by their birth.
    

            “The freedom fighters have sacrificed a lot for the nation … for that reason this quota was a logical thing in the past,” said student protester Tahmeed Hossain. “But there have been at least two generations after that. Nowadays, the quota … has rather become a form of discrimination. It has become a cultural propaganda to create a stronghold in the country.”
    

            On Sunday, the country’s top court dismissed the earlier ruling that brought back the quotas, directing that 93% of government jobs will be open to candidates on merit.
    

            Shah Monjurul Hoque, a lawyer representing students, said of the Supreme Court’s ruling: “That is 93% quota for general people, 5% quota for freedom fighters and their kin, 1% for ethnic minority community, and 1% for third gender and physically disabled.”
    

            The protests began at the prestigious Dhaka University on July 1 and later spread to other campuses and cities nationwide in almost daily street gatherings that included rail and road blockades.
    

            The demonstrations became violent on July 15 when members of the Bangladesh Chatra League – the student wing of the ruling Awami League party – reportedly attacked student protesters inside the Dhaka University campus.
    

            Since then, clashes between security forces, protesters and government supporters have escalated, with Bangladesh deploying its paramilitary Rapid Action Battalion, which was sanctioned by the United States in 2021 after “widespread allegations of serious human rights abuses.”
    

            The student protester Hossain told CNN he was wounded at a rally at Dhaka University on Wednesday when a projectile was thrown into the crowd.
    

            “Someone threw a small thing at us that blew up and I heard shots. I started running and realized that I had been hurt by some splinters in my hands. The police then attacked us with tear shell in the building,” he said. “One of my friends got hit by a (rubber) bullet in the leg. Some of my friends got their heads smashed and are currently under treatment in the hospital.”
    

            Another protester in Dhaka, Hassan Abdullah, said Thursday: “There are tear (gas) shells just 50 meters away from me as I am talking to you. The police are constantly bursting sound grenades right now.”
    

            CNN cannot independently verify the accounts but the sounds of protest commotion, including multiple audible cracks, could be heard during the conversation with Abdullah.
    

            Reports of the number of people killed has varied widely, with the Dhaka-based newspaper Prothom Alo saying 19 people were killed on Thursday alone and the Agence France-Press news agency reporting 32 deaths, citing its own tally compiled from hospital data.
    

            Authorities have also moved to block online communications.
    

            Internet monitoring site Netblocks confirmed a “near-total national internet shutdown” across Bangladesh on Thursday. “The new measure follows earlier efforts to throttle social media and restrict mobile data services,” it said on X.


            The demonstrations are the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Hasina since she secured a fourth consecutive term in January elections, which were boycotted by the main opposition party to protest what they said was a widespread crackdown on their ranks.
    

            Hasina has announced a judicial investigation into the killings and called on protesters to await the verdict of the Supreme Court.
    

            “I especially urge everyone to wait patiently until the Supreme Court verdict comes. I believe our students will get justice from high court, they will not be disappointed,” Hasina said in a news conference Thursday.
    

            But she has been accused of enflaming protester anger by reportedly calling them “razakar,”  an offensive term used for those who allegedly collaborated with the Pakistani army during the 1971 independence war.
    

            “We expected an apology from our prime minister for comparing us to traitors of 1952 and 1972, and a solid solution to quota reform,” said protester Salman Farsi. “What did the students do to deserve this tag?”
    

            Student protesters CNN spoke to say their demonstrations have gone beyond frustration over the quota system and their anger is now directed at Hasina and her government, which human rights organizations have long warned are headed toward a one-party system.
    

            “This is a people’s movement against the authoritarian government,” Hossain said.
    

            “This is not just about quota protests anymore, this is much bigger than that, in simple quota protests the government wouldn’t go around hurting and shooting students. This shows the current fascist and autocratic nature of the government, who has been upholding the power without any proper voting system.”
    

            Bangladeshi students have held smaller protests elsewhere, including in New York’s Times Square, the Australian cities Melbourne and Sydney and the Danish capital Copenhagen.

            At least 15 people have died after a bridge partially collapsed in China’s Shaanxi province with rescue efforts remaining underway as of Sunday evening, according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.
    

            Authorities said a portion of the bridge in Zhashui County in the city of Shangluo collapsed on Friday evening after recent rains and flash flooding, with CCTV reporting at least 25 vehicles falling off the bridge.
    

            China’s national fire and rescue authority dispatched a total of 1,630 people, 205 vehicles, and 63 boats to carry out the rescue, the broadcaster reported Sunday.
    

            It was unclear how many people remained missing or had been rescued as of Monday morning. Chinese state media earlier reported that one person was rescued.
    

            Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Saturday called for “all-out rescue efforts” and for authorities to stay alert to ongoing hazards.
    

            The situation comes as wide swaths of China have been grappling with torrential rains causing flooding and landslides in recent weeks in a flood season that started two months earlier than usual. 


            In neighboring Henan province, more than 100,000 people have been evacuated from their homes as a result of flooding, according to state media.
    

            In the southwestern Sichuan province, more than 10 people were killed and 29 remained missing as of Sunday afternoon after flash floods hit a village in Hanyuan County early Saturday, CCTV reported.
    

            Authorities said sudden floods struck around 2:30 a.m. local time, while many were sleeping and caused damage to homes, roads and bridges.
    

  This story has been updated with additional information. An earlier version of this story misstated the province where the bridge collapse took place. It is Shaanxi province.

CNN_15,Nipah virus death puts health officials on alert in southern India,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/india/nipah-virus-death-kerala-india-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-22 10:09:00,world,"
Kochi, India — Authorities in southern India’s Kerala state are taking preventive steps after the death of a 14-year-old boy from the Nipah virus and the identification of 60 people in the high-risk category, the state’s health minister said on Sunday.
    

            Parts of Kerala are among those most at risk globally for outbreaks of the virus, a Reuters investigation showed last year. Nipah, which comes from fruit bats and animals such as pigs, can cause a lethal, brain-swelling fever in humans.
    

            Nipah is classified as a priority pathogen by the World Health Organization (WHO) because of its potential to trigger an epidemic. There is no vaccine to prevent infection and no treatment to cure it.
    

            “The infected boy died on Sunday after a cardiac arrest,” Veena George, the state health minister told local TV reporters, speaking in the Malayalam language.
    

            Earlier, in a statement on Saturday, she said as part of Nipah control, the government has issued orders to set up 25 committees to identify and isolate affected people.
    

            Dr. Anoop Kumar, director of critical care medicine at Aster MIMS Hospital in Calicut, said one positive case of Nipah had been diagnosed in a school boy and people who had been in contact with him were being watched.

            “There is a minimum chance of an outbreak of Nipah virus at this stage,” he said, adding that the situation would be monitored for the next seven to 10 days.
    

            There are 214 people on the primary contact list of the boy, the statement said. Among them, 60 are in the high-risk category, it said, and isolation wards have been set up at health institutions to treat patients.
    

            Family members of the affected patient were kept at a local hospital for observation, after a case of Nipah virus was confirmed in Malappuram, a town about 350 kilometers (about 220 miles) from Kerala’s capital Thiruvananthapuram, local media reports said. Other people who might be at risk were asked to isolate at home.
    

            The state government said it is working to trace any affected people to contain the spread of the virus. Nipah has been linked to the deaths of dozens of people in Kerala since its first appearance in the state in 2018.
    

The virus was first identified 25 years ago in Malaysia and has led to outbreaks in Bangladesh, India and Singapore.

CNN_16,They built a home in Thailand after their US property was flooded in a hurricane,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/us-couple-moved-to-thailand-built-home/index.html,2024-07-22 11:51:00,world,"
            With his retirement fast approaching, Jim Dolan, from the US, felt as though his future was more or less mapped out.
    

            He and his wife Som Dolan would build a house in her native country, Thailand, and split their time between the Southeast Asian destination and the States.
    

            But the couple ended up leaving the US for good after their home in Houston was severely flooded during Hurricane Harvey, a Category 4 storm that hit Texas in 2017.
    

            “Our finances were such that we couldn’t live what was thought to be our dream life,” Jim Dolan, who previously worked for NASA, tells CNN Travel.
    

            He hadn’t ever really envisioned being based in Thailand permanently. In fact, Jim Dolan – originally from Worcester, Massachusetts – hadn’t even visited the country before meeting his future wife, from Bangkok, online in 2006.
    

            “We got to know each other, virtually at first,” he says. “And we visited together a number of times before we decided that we were soulmates.”
    

            The pair later got engaged, and Som Dolan moved to the US on a fiancée visa.
    

            “I was not ready to leave the United States at that point,” Jim Dolan explains. “I had a good job and a good career. So I wanted to bring her there. “
    

            The couple tied the knot that same year and quickly began building a life in the US together.

            “The first couple of years were kind of challenging to me, because of the language,” admits Som Dolan, who speaks both Thai and English, but had only used English for work purposes previously.
    

            “It was very hard for me to understand because the people speak very fast.”
    

            It took several years for Som Dolan, who previously worked in IT, to find her feet career-wise, and she briefly worked as a waitress in a Thai restaurant, and as her husband’s assistant.
    

            “I had a good job (in Thailand,)” she says. “When I moved here, it was hard for me to find a job where I could use my experience.”
    

            The Dolans spent 10 years living in the US together and had been looking forward to “a dual Thailand and US kind of lifestyle” in the future.
    

            However, that all changed after a series of financial setbacks. Jim Dolan explains that he lost “a lot of money in the stock market in the financial crash in 2009.”
    

            Although he says he was able to recover much of this in the following years, the damage inflicted on their home after Hurricane Harvey devastated the Texas Gulf Coast resulted in another financial blow.
    

            “We had to rebuild our house in Houston while still living in it,” he says. “Think of trying to change a tire on a race car while the car is going round the track. It was a challenge.”
    

            The couple didn’t have flood insurance, something Jim Dolan describes as a “regrettable decision.”
    

            Needless to say, the repair work cost them a considerable amount of money, and the Dolans realized that they wouldn’t be able to afford to live as comfortably as they’d hoped if they remained in the US.
    

            The pair, who sold their home in Houston and moved to Washington, DC in 2019, soon began looking into the prospect of relocating to Thailand permanently.
    

            “It was not a hard choice to make,” says Jim Dolan. “I had traveled to Thailand a number of times, I really liked being here.

            “I like the food. I like the culture. I love the climate. It’s a beautiful country. And obviously, Som is a native here. So she’s very comfortable here.
    

            “And it’s so much more affordable than the United States. It was ultimately a pretty easy decision.”
    

            When the global Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020, the Dolans decided to bring forward their plan to build a house in Thailand.
    

            “It was right around the time that I was just approaching retirement age,” explains Jim Dolan. “And so we just decided to make the move at that time. We had enough money to build a house, and we were ready to do it.”
    

            The couple then bought some land “sight unseen” in Sam Roi Yot, located in the province of Prachuap Khiri Khan, for around $50,000.
    

            Jim Dolan explains that they deliberately chose the area in the Gulf of Thailand as its position meant that they were less likely to be badly impacted by a natural disaster again.
    

            “There’s no risk of earthquakes or tsunamis on this side of the peninsula,” he says, explaining that while they hadn’t been to Sam Roi Yot before, the couple were familiar with the area, which is about 240 kilometers (150 miles) south of the capital, Bangkok.
    

            “So we don’t have to worry about that. We don’t have fires. We don’t have hurricanes.”
    

            Jim Dolan was able to obtain a Thailand Marriage Visa, which currently requires applicants to have at least 400,000THB (around $11,000) in a Thai bank account or a monthly income of no less than 40,000THB (about $1,100).
    

            Once they had their affairs in order, the Dolans packed up their lives in the US, shipping some of their belongings over in a container, while taking a “few necessary things to make our lives a little more comfortable.”
    

            In October 2020, they left the US for Thailand – the couple were given special visas due to the travel restrictions in place at the time.
    

            After undergoing a mandatory quarantine period, the Dolans briefly stayed with one of Som Dolan’s relatives in Bangkok, before renting a home to live in while their house was being built.
    

            According to Jim Dolan, one of the biggest challenges of the relocation was the process of transporting their beloved pugs Morgan and Gwennie.
    

            “The dogs are difficult to move because they have a very short snout, and that makes their breathing suspect to respiratory problems and some carriers won’t deliver them,” he explains.
    

            “So it took a lot for us to get the two dogs here.”
    

            The couple says they found the process of building their three-bedroom home, which they designed themselves, particularly tough, stressing that achieving the result that they desired meant a lot of back and forth with builders and contractors.
    

            “In the last four months of the building period, we had to come to visit the site every single day, to make sure that all the details would be the way that we wanted,” says Som Dolan.
    

            The entire process took about a year and a half and cost around $300,000 “including fence, fill and landscaping.”
    

            “It turned out to be just what we wanted, and what we had hoped for,” says Jim Dolan. “It was hard getting here. But the end result is what we wanted, and we’re happy with it.”
    

            He goes on to state that Thailand has proven to be more affordable for them, stressing that he and his wife feel “financially comfortable” now.
    

            “I joined a golf club for about $1,100 to play as many rounds as I want to for a year,” he says.
    

            “There’s no way I could do that in the United States.”
    

            He also feels that their overall quality of life has improved immensely as a result of being based in Thailand.
    

            “It’s very natural,” says Jim Dolan. “We eat locally grown vegetables that are plentiful and really cheap. The food is great.”
    

            When it comes to healthcare, he’s opted to pay for private medical insurance in Thailand, and finds that it provides “better benefits than my Medicare would in the United States and for much, much cheaper.”
    

            “There are a lot of things that the average person might expect to be able to do in their retirement that are available here,” he adds.
    

            “It’s a different culture. But it’s not a different planet… You adapt. You learn and you experience. It’s good.”
    

            More than four years since their big move, the couple is now very settled in Sam Roi Yot, known for the Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, and love living there.
    

            “It’s very quiet. Very peaceful. Very safe,” says Jim Dolan. “I feel safer here in Thailand than I think in any of the cities that I lived in the United States.
    

            “I lived in Denver, Houston and Austin. And all of them have much, much higher rates of crime.”
    

            While he and his wife are grateful to be able to live a very comfortable lifestyle in Thailand, Jim Dolan acknowledges that many Thai people “live on a very, very, very small budget” and “services and taxes are much lower” as a result.
    

            He explains that pumps need to be incorporated into the build for certain new homes, as water pressure is “minimal” in the country, and the roads are “a little bit rougher.”
    

            “There are many of those little kinds of issues…” he says. “The infrastructure, I think, in the United States is more sophisticated, and perhaps more reliable.
    

            “But you pay for it. Your taxes are high. We don’t pay any property taxes here. Our tax burden is virtually zero.
    

            “There’s no way we could have built a brand new, three-bedroom, 3,000-square-foot house, within a mile of the ocean in the United States, on what we did here.”
    

            Although he speaks other languages, including Spanish, Jim Dolan has struggled to learn Thai, pointing out that it’s challenging “for the Western ear because it’s a tonal language.”

            “Thai language is a very, very difficult language to learn,” he explains. “And I must admit, I haven’t really tried very hard because I have a built-in translator in my family.”
    

            And while Som Dolan is thrilled to be living in her native country once again, she says that going from speaking English constantly for a decade to using both Thai and English regularly has been confusing.
    

            “I still have to speak English all the time. All day, every day,” she says, pointing out that the majority of her husband’s friends aren’t Thai nationals, and she often finds herself acting as an interpreter.
    

            Although Jim Dolan admits that things haven’t always been “smooth sailing,” he’s confident that relocating to Thailand was the right choice for him and his wife.
    

            “I think she had a bigger challenge moving to the United States than I had coming here,” he says.
    

            He’d advise anyone thinking of making a similar move to visit the country they’re hoping to relocate to first, and avoid the temptation to “up and buy a property on some remote place, halfway around the world, sight unseen.”
    

            “We had traveled to Thailand a number of times and knew the area, knew what we were getting into,” he adds.
    

            The Dolans haven’t been back to the US since moving to Thailand, but eventually plan to return for regular trips.
    

            Jim Dolan is going to visit his family soon, but his wife has decided to stay behind to look after their dog Gwennie, who is nearly 15 years old – Morgan passed away in 2022.
    

            “No one else would take care of her the way Som takes care of her,” he says. “So as long as Gwennie is still with us. I’ll be traveling back to the United States solo.”
    

            Although he has no regrets about their move, Jim Dolan admits that there are some things that he misses about living in the US.
    

            “I miss northeast seafood,” he says. “And I miss my siblings. They’ve lived on the East Coast for much of my life.
    

            “All of my family members were just a drive away (before) and now it’s a big trip to visit. So that’s a bit of a sacrifice.
    

            “But overall, I think we’re much better off here than we would have been in the United States had we stayed there.”

CNN_17,What we know 4 days after a software update brought down computer systems around the world,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/22/us/microsoft-power-outage-crowdstrike-it/index.html,2024-07-22 12:24:00,us,"
            Four days after a faulty software update from a cybersecurity company unexpectedly brought down computers and technical systems across the world, airlines and some other companies are still experiencing delays and other technical problems.
    

            The “largest IT outage in history” – prompted by a software update for Microsoft devices late Thursday into the early hours of Friday – caused disorder at airports, outages for 911 services and challenges at healthcare facilities.
    

            The outage affected an estimated 8.5 million Windows devices – less than one percent of all Windows machines, according to a Saturday blog post from Microsoft. But the effects were ubiquitous, with airlines, banks, businesses, schools and governments, along with some health and emergency services, across the world affected.
    

            Costs from the outage could top $1 billion, Patrick Anderson, CEO of Anderson Economic Group, told CNN. But it’s unclear if – and how – any customers affected will be compensated.
    

            Here’s what we know about the outage and its continued effects.
    

            The outage was related to a software update rolled out by CrowdStrike, a major US cybersecurity firm. The software – used by numerous Fortune 500 companies, including major global banks, healthcare and energy companies, as well as by the US government — detects and blocks hacking threats.

What is CrowdStrike, the company linked to the global outage?


            CrowdStrike told customers early Friday the outages were caused by “a defect found in a single content update of its software on Microsoft Windows operating systems,” according to a post on X from CEO George Kurtz. The issue was identified and isolated, and engineers deployed an update to fix the problem, Kurtz said.
    

            The company’s engineers took action to address the problem, according to an advisory viewed by CNN, which told customers to reboot their computers and perform other actions if they were still having technical issues. The issue is specific to Falcon, one of CrowdStrike’s main software products, and is not impacting Mac or Linux operating systems, according to the advisory. Crowdstrike says Falcon is designed to protect files saved in the cloud.
    

            The company said the outage was not caused by a security incident or a cyberattack.
    

            Kurtz later apologized to customers and said the company is “deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption.”
    

            Travelers continued to feel the impact of the failure for a third straight day on Sunday, with more than 1,800 US flights canceled and more than 9,900 delayed, according to the tracking website FlightAware. Major hotels, including Marriott International and some Hiltons, were impacted both in regard to payment processing and delays to check in-processes.
    

            US-based carriers American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Allegiant Airlines, SunCountry and Frontier Airlines all reported issues on Friday.
    

            American Airlines said Friday morning it was able to “safely re-establish” operations. By Friday night, United said “most of our systems have recovered,” but cautioned there may still be some flight delays or cancellations as a result of the issues.
    

            Delta Airlines paused all its flights Friday morning while its systems were offline, and more than 3,500 Delta and Delta Connection flights were cancelled through Saturday, according to the airline. More than 1,200 Delta flights were canceled on Sunday, after the carrier canceled 1,208 flights on Saturday, according to FlightAware.


            Delta also announced that it would not be allowing unaccompanied minors to travel until July 24 due to the outage.
    

            Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg spoke with Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian Sunday afternoon as the air carrier continues to struggle with a high number of flight cancellations, according to the department.
    

            “We continue to receive reports of unacceptable disruptions and customer service conditions at Delta Air Lines, including hundreds of complaints filed with our Department. I have made clear to Delta that we expect the airline to provide prompt refunds to consumers who choose not to be rebooked, and free rebooking and timely reimbursements for food and overnight hotel stays to consumers affected by the delays and cancellations, as well as adequate customer service assistance to all of their passengers,” Buttigieg said in a statement.
    

            In a letter Sunday afternoon, Bastian apologized to customers, saying the extremely busy travel weekend contributed to the problem. Delta declined CNN’s request to comment further.
    

            Other airlines were getting back on track over the weekend, including one of the world’s largest operators, Turkish Airlines, which said Saturday, “The global technical issue has been resolved. All our operations have returned to normal.”
    

            The same day, Jetstar Japan, Hong Kong Express and Cebu Pacific airlines said their operations are gradually being restored after disruptions due to the global tech outage.

            Even with the flawed computer update rolled back, it’s not a quick fix for airlines, which have computers at thousands of gates that will need to be individually rebooted, David Kennedy, cofounder of cybersecurity company Binary Defense, told CNN on Saturday.
    

            “It’s not just as simple as rebooting. There’s a lot more steps and complexities in this that are involved,” Kennedy said. “There’s just not enough people at those airports, at those locations to go and do it.”
    

            Amid the travel chaos, Buttigieg said earlier in a social media post Saturday he received reports of some airlines only offering flight credits to passengers for canceled flights.
    

            “Let me be clear — you are entitled to get your money back promptly if your flight is canceled and you don’t take a rebooking,” Buttigieg said.
    

            The widespread usage of CrowdStrike’s software meant the outage penetrated numerous industries, including emergency communications, government services and healthcare.

            Large hospital systems, including Mass General Brigham in Massachusetts, Penn Medicine in Pennsylvania, Mount Sinai Health System in New York all reported Friday they were affected by the outage.
    

            Emory Healthcare in Atlanta said it had delayed “procedures at ambulatory surgical centers and hospitals are delayed until our systems are stabilized.”
    

            Some cancer centers, including Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and New York’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, also paused certain procedures and scheduled appointments.
    

            Several blood banks likewise experienced disruptions.
    

            And in a few areas, including Arizona and Alaska, 911 services were briefly disrupted before being restored.
    

            Government agencies, including Social Security offices and local Department of Motor Vehicles offices, also temporarily paused their operations due to the outage.
    

            Public transportation in Washington, DC, and Pennsylvania were also affected by the outage but restored operations Friday.
    

            And mail carriers UPS and FedEx said while they remained operational, they expected service delays Friday.

            A global software outage Friday brought many computer systems across business, healthcare, technology and government sectors to a screeching halt in under 12 hours.
    

            How did the crash unfold? Which systems have recovered, and which ones are still affected? We break it down. (All times Eastern Time.)
    

            Overnight on Thursday and into Friday, several states, including Alaska and Arizona, experience 911 service outages. Some hospitals also begin experiencing technology issues overnight, according to nurses on shift.
    

            Between 2 and 3 a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration announces that all Delta and American Airlines flights are grounded. Several minutes later, the FAA says flights from United and Allegiant Airlines have been grounded regardless of their destination.
    

            Spirit Airlines says its flight reservation system has also been affected by the outage.
    

            A few hours later, between 5 and 6 a.m., public transit systems in the Northeast begin announcing that they have been impacted. Washington, DC, public transportation services — including trains and buses — begin experiencing delays, according to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.
    

            In New York City, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, North America’s largest transportation network, says customer information systems have gone temporarily offline, but train and bus services remain unaffected.
    

            At 5:30 a.m., US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike tells customers that it was “aware of reports of crashes” of its software on Microsoft Windows operating systems, according to a company advisory viewed by CNN. CrowdStrike’s cybersecurity software — used by numerous Fortune 500 companies — detects and blocks hacking threats.
    

Between 6 and 7 a.m.: A White House National Security Council spokesperson tells CNN they are “aware of the incident and are looking into the issue and impacts.” A White House source familiar with the matter tells CNN there are no indications at this time of malicious activity, though the administration is still investigating.
    

            Global banks start reporting some service disruptions, including Australia’s Commonwealth Bank, South Africa’s Capitec, and the Bank of Israel. Australian lenders ANZ and Westpac were also impacted, according to Downdetector, a website that tracks cyber outages. Downdetector has also reported issues for New Zealand’s ASB Bank.
    

            Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler issues an emergency declaration in response to the outage that affected Bureau of Emergency Communication’s Computer Aided Dispatch system that is used for fielding emergency calls. The bureau begins taking calls manually, according to the mayor’s office.
    

            Meanwhile, United Airlines announces that it is resuming “some flights.”
    

            Delta Air Lines resumes some flight departures and issues travel waivers to affected customers.
    

            A spokesperson for Atlanta’s Hartsfield Jackson International Airport said that systems were operational and the airport put in place additional customer service personnel to address the challenges they’re facing.
    

            The spokesperson urged customers to “have patience. We’re trying to have grace and patience with all of the passengers. We’re asking the same.”
    

            Later Friday morning, Charlotte Douglas International Airport, an American Airlines hub, advises passengers to not go to the airport “unless they have confirmed their flight information with the airline.” Officials at Miami International Airport, another American Airlines hub, likewise warn travelers that US Customs and Border Protection operations have been affected nationwide, “so international passenger arrivals are currently being processed manually at a slower pace.”
    

            A little before 9 a.m., Alaska State Troopers and Phoenix Police Department in Arizona say that service at its 911 centers are once again operational after emergency and non-emergency call centers were impacted.
    

            Portland’s Computer Aided Dispatch system also comes back online at 9 a.m.
    

            “At no time was the community’s ability to make 911 calls impacted,” the mayor’s office says in a news release. “The critical, life-saving services of public safety bureaus, including Police and Fire & Rescue, continue.”
    

            The Federal Communications Commission announces it is working with federal agencies to provide assistance and determine the extent of the outage after it was made aware of “reports of a systems outage causing disruptions in service, including 911.”
    

            President Joe Biden is briefed on the CrowdStrike outage and his team is in touch with CrowdStrike and impacted entities, says a White House official. The president’s team is also engaged with agencies “to get sector by sector updates throughout the day and is standing by to provide assistance as needed,” according to the official.
    

            Around this time, an increasing number of federal agencies begin getting involved and reporting service disruptions. The US Department of Homeland Security says in a statement on X they are “working with CrowdStrike, Microsoft and our federal, state, local and critical infrastructure partners to fully assess and address system outages.”
    

            Social Security offices close to the public, as the agency warns the public that “longer wait times on our national 800 number are expected.”
    

            In an internal memo viewed by CNN, the US Department of Justice says it is feeling some impact from the technology outage and, while it’s working on workarounds, notes it does not have an “estimated restoration time.”
    

            Mail carriers UPS and FedEx tell CNN they were also impacted by the outage. UPS says its airline is operational and its drivers are on the roads, but there may be some service delays.
    

            A little after 11 a.m., CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz says in a post on X, the firm “(understands) the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption,” adding that the incident was not a cyber attack, and that customers’ data remains protected.
    

            “The issue has been identified and a fix has been deployed,” he said. “There was an issue with a Falcon content update for Windows Hosts.”
    

            The Massachusetts Department of Transportation announces that some Registry of Motor Vehicle operations are impacted. Other states also report impacts to their driving services, including Georgia, North Carolina, Texas and Tennessee.
    

            Around the same time, several of the nation’s healthcare and hospital systems announce they have been impacted by the global outage, including Mass General Brigham hospital system in Massachusetts, Penn Medicine in Pennsylvania, Northwell Health in New York, and Emory Healthcare in Atlanta.
    

            While some hospitals report delays in services, others cancel some non-urgent surgeries and medical office visits. Several cancer centers, including Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and New York’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center say they have paused certain procedures and scheduled appointments.
    

            In British Columbia, the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) announces its health system has been impacted, and is working on implementing contingency plans in order to ensure care for patients.
    

            Around 4 p.m., New York Blood Center, a supplier of blood to approximately 200 hospitals in the Northeast United States, says it has put in place an emergency driving operation to distribute blood.
    

            “The test tubes are not making it onto planes from yesterday and today, requiring for us to drive them,” New York Blood Center’s senior vice president Andrea Cefarelli told CNN in a phone call. “There is going to be a 12-24 hour delay in getting the test results.”
    

            Blood Centers of America, which rely on shipping companies like FedEx, says it is experiencing delays in reporting test results. Executive Vice President Jenny Ficenec says blood usage may be down due to hospitals canceling elective surgeries, so the delay should not cause any shortages unless the problem persists.
    

            Blood Assurance, which provides blood to hospitals in a number of Southeast states, including Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia, says its planned shipment of at least 20 platelets has been postponed due to flight delays and cancellations caused by the outage.
    

            “We are asking community members to help through donation,” Blood Assurance says in an email to CNN. “We have a fantastic community of donors that always shows up when we need them.”
    

            Meanwhile, CrowdStrike CEO Kurtz takes to social media again and promises customers “full transparency” on how the global IT outage involving the company’s software occurred.
    

            CrowdStrike would take steps “to prevent anything like this from happening again,” according to a statement on the company’s website.
    

            In a statement Saturday morning, Microsoft estimates the outage affected 8.5 million Windows devices.
    

            That’s less 1% of all Windows machines, according to Microsoft, but the company adds that “the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services.”
    

            Various sectors are still feeling the aftershocks of the outage. Although airlines have largely resumed services, many tell customers that they expect disruptions in schedules to continue.
    

            As of noon on Saturday, at least 3,375 flights across the United States have been delayed and more than 1,200 canceled, according to data from flight tracker FlightAware. Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the nation’s busiest airport, remains the most affected. Delta Air Lines has canceled more than 500 flights, while United Airlines has canceled almost 300, according to FlightAware.

CNN_19,World leaders react to Biden’s exit from the 2024 US presidential race,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/22/world/world-reaction-biden-exit-2024-us-presidential-race/index.html,2024-07-22 12:57:00,world,"
            Messages of gratitude and support for US President Joe Biden poured in following his stunning announcement Sunday that he is exiting the 2024 presidential race and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as the next Democratic nominee.
    

            It was the second seismic moment in US politics in just over a week, following the assassination attempt against former president Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally on July 13, which saw global leaders rally around him as the Republican nominee.
    

            Pressure had mounted on Biden to pull out of the race since his disastrous performance at the CNN presidential debate last month, and on Sunday, he confirmed he would remain a one-term president, prompting a flood of tributes from US allies who thanked him for his leadership.
    

            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who met with Biden this month in Washington, said he respects the president’s decision and looks forward to working together for the remainder of his term.
    

            “I know that, as he has done throughout his remarkable career, he will have made his decision based on what he believes is best for the American people,” Starmer wrote on X.


            Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau thanked Biden for being a “true friend” to his country. “He’s a great man, and everything he does is guided by his love for his country,” he said on X.
    

            In a news conference, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Biden deserves to be recognized for “once again not putting himself forward first, but giving his first consideration to being what he believes is in the interests of the United States of America, as he has done his whole public life.”
    

            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked Biden for his “unwavering support” in his country’s war against Russia, which the US has backed with weapons, military aid and diplomatic support, despite backlash from Republicans.
    

            “Many strong decisions have been made in recent years and they will be remembered as bold steps taken by President Biden in response to challenging times,” Zelensky said on X. “We will always be thankful for President Biden’s leadership.”
    

            In Israel, President Isaac Herzog described Biden as a “true ally of the Jewish people,” while Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the US president’s “steadfast backing, especially during the war, has been invaluable,” both in posts to X.
    

            Biden has been one of the biggest supporters of Israel’s war in Gaza since Hamas’ October 7 attacks. But he has increasingly clashed with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over humanitarian aid and the mounting civilian death toll of the conflict.
    

            There was no immediate word Sunday from Netanyahu, who is expected to visit Washington this week.
    

            Irish Taoiseach Simon Harris called Biden “a proud American with an Irish soul,” and thanked him for his “global leadership” and “friendship.”
    

            Other leaders commended Biden for making what must have been a tough decision to drop out of the race.
    

            Speaking at a rally Sunday, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said Biden made the “correct” decision and put his family and health first. He wished him “health and a long life.”
    

            Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on X that Biden had made difficult decisions “thanks to which Poland, America and the world are safer, and democracy stronger.”
    

            “I know you were driven by the same motivations when announcing your final decision. Probably the most difficult one,” Tusk said.

Biden just made the hardest decision any politician can make


            There was no official word from Chinese leader Xi Jinping as of Monday morning local time.
    

            But “Biden dropping out of the election” was the top trending topic early Monday on Weibo, China’s X-like social platform, with five more related topics including discussions of Kamala Harris and Trump’s assassination attempt together accumulating more than 400 million views.
    

            Some Chinese social media users excitedly speculated about the prospect of a woman becoming US president, while others said they believe Trump will win no matter the Democratic candidate.
    

            “The shot was definitely a good deal for Trump!” one Weibo user wrote.
    

            One user remarked, “that one shot didn’t kill Trump but dropped Biden,” while another described the political situation in the US as “a total mess.”

CNN_20,Navy aviator scores first air-to-air victory by a US female fighter pilot,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/22/middleeast/us-navy-first-air-to-air-kill-female-fighter-pilot-intl-hnk-ml/index.html,2024-07-22 12:53:00,world,"
            A US Navy fighter pilot has become the first American woman to score a victory in air-to-air combat, the service has revealed.
    

            The female pilot, who was not named in the Navy release, was flying an F/A-18 Super Hornet off the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D Eisenhower as part of Strike Fighter Squadron 32, nicknamed the “Flying Swordsmen.”
    

            The aerial victory came against a one-way Houthi attack drone, one of dozens the Yemen-based group has deployed against civilian merchant ships in the Red Sea and nearby waters in reaction to the destruction in Gaza during Israel’s war against Hamas, a release from Carrier Strike Group 2 said.

            The squadron amassed more than 3,000 combat hours in flying almost 1,500 combat missions as part of operations Inherent Resolve and Prosperity Guardian, the former targeting ISIS and the latter stood up in December 2023 to respond to the Houthi-led attacks on international shipping.
    

            The Swordsmen, one of four strike fighter squadrons that deployed on the Eisenhower, fired more than 20 air-to-air missiles against the Houthi drones during those missions, the Navy said.
    

            “During one mission, VFA-32 became home to the first American female pilot to engage and kill an air-to-air contact,” it said.
    

            The first air-to-air victory by a female pilot comes 30 years after Lt. Kara Hultgreen became the first carrier-based female fighter pilot in the Navy, flying the F-14 Tomcat off the USS Abraham Lincoln that year. Female aviators also joined the Eisenhower in 1994.
    

            The Eisenhower-led carrier strike group returned to US bases on July 14 after a nine-month deployment, an exceptionally lengthy deployment for a carrier. Normal deployments last about six to eight months.

            Cmdr. Jason Hoch, commanding officer of VFA-32, praised the squadron’s performance in “incredibly demanding conditions” during the deployment.
    

            Besides the air-to-air encounters, the Swordsmen led two of seven strikes against Houthi ground targets in Yemen, destroying munitions and command and control facilities, the release said.
    

            “We proved over and over again that the flexibility a carrier strike group brings to the fight is unmatched,” Hoch said.
    

            Overall, Carrier Strike Group 2, which besides the Eisenhower included the guided missile cruiser USS Philippine Sea and the destroyers USS Mason and USS Gravely, hit more than 460 Houthi targets in Yemen, according to the Navy.
    

            The group’s warships fired 155 standard missiles and 135 Tomahawk land-attack missiles during those strikes, while the strike group’s aircraft fired 60 air-to-air missiles and released 420 air-to-surface weapons, the Navy said.

            The Houthis are an Iran-backed Shia rebel group that controls swathes of Yemen, one of the poorest countries in the Middle East and a nation that has been ravaged by years of civil war.
    

            Since Hamas’ attacks on October 7 and Israel’s subsequent ground and air offenses in Gaza, the Houthis say they have been seeking revenge against Israel for its military campaign by targeting Red Sea shipping as well as Israel itself with drones and missiles.
    

            Both the United Kingdom and the United States have responded to the attacks on shipping by carrying out strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. Over the weekend, Israel struck inside Yemen for the first time following a deadly drone attack launched by Houthi rebels on Tel Aviv.

CNN_21,Super cheap robotaxi rides spark widespread anxiety in China,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/18/cars/china-baidu-apollo-go-robotaxi-anxiety-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-22 13:09:00,us,"
    Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.


            In China, it’s possible to travel six miles in a driverless taxi for just about 50 cents.
    

            Self-driving cars, commonly called robotaxis, are being popularized at cut-throat prices in Wuhan, a sprawling metropolis of over 11 million people in central China. It has ambitions to become the world’s first driverless city, even as the vehicles often struggle to navigate the streets.
    

            “You’ll never have to buy a car,” a passenger inside one of the white robotaxi sedans said in a video that has been viewed over 80 million times on Chinese social media platform Weibo since last week.
    

            The fleet of 500 vehicles operating in the city belongs to Apollo Go, a unit of Chinese tech giant Baidu (BIDU). They serve an area that covers roughly half of Wuhan’s population, according to a May company release.
    

            A major selling point is the price. Base fares start as low as 4 yuan (55 cents), compared with 18 yuan ($2.48) for a taxi driven by a human, state media Global Times reported on Wednesday.
    

            The service launched in 2022 and started to gain traction during the first half of the year. The company aims to double its fleet to 1,000 cars by the end of 2024. Wuhan currently has around 17,000 regular cabs, according to the city’s transport bureau.
    

            But the rapid adoption of the driverless taxis has rattled China’s gig economy workforce, which has suffered from stagnant wages because of deflationary forces stalking the economy following years of tight coronavirus restrictions and a real estate crisis.
    

            “With the Chinese economy struggling a bit, Chinese people are likely much more fearful of losing their jobs, and this serves as a reminder of one of the ways that could happen,” Tu Le, managing director of Sino Auto Insights, told CNN in an email interview. He added that any significant job losses could be a few years away.
    

            On Monday, the National Bureau of Statistics reported that the country’s gross domestic product expanded by just 4.7% in the April to June months, a much slower pace of growth than the 5.1% expected.
    

            There have also been complaints from residents in Wuhan about traffic jams, as driverless cars fail to respond to traffic lights. Earlier this month, one robotaxi ran a red light and crashed into a pedestrian, state-run paper People’s Daily reported.
    

            Backlash against the service, particularly against Apollo Go’s allegedly predatory pricing tactics, became the second top trending topic last week on Chinese microblogging site Weibo, with more than 75 million users chiming in on the discussion last week.
    

            “Disrupting the market is the least of their worries. They will steal your rice bowl,” one user wrote, referring to the ability to make a living.
    

            “Driving schools, road inspectors, and taxis are all going to shut down,” another user said.
    

            A source at the company told CNN that discounts from companies and subsidies from local governments are commonly used during the initial launch period to get people to try new services, and the“extremely low” pricing could be a temporary strategy.
    

            Autonomous taxis currently operate on a relatively small scale in several cities around the world, mostly in the United States and China, while the United Arab Emirates is also welcoming companies worldwide to run driverless vehicle trials.
    

            Several US companies, including Waymo, a subsidiary of Google’s parent company Alphabet (GOOG), and GM (GM) subsidiary Cruise, are working on autonomous ride-sharing services but have recently faced setbacks.

GM halting driverless car service nationwide after California ban


            Cruise’s permit to test fully autonomous vehicles in California was suspended in October 2023 after a series of collisions, including one that caused grievous injuries to a woman after dragging her across asphalt. The company is now being investigated by the Department of Justice.
    

            Waymo recently had to issue a recall after two of its cars hit the same tow truck within minutes of one another.
    

            Uncertainty over the safety and reliability of driverless cars has cast a long shadow over the industry in the US. But Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk isn’t bothered, with the electrical vehicle giant vowing to unveil its robotaxi in the coming months.
    

            China, already home to the world’s biggest car market, could someday also become the top market for automated vehicles, according to a 2023 report from consulting firm McKinsey.
    

            It projects the sector could generate between $300 billion to $400 billion in revenue by 2035 in part due to support from Beijing to roll out more pilot programs.
    

            Governments in several major Chinese cities, including Wuhan and Shenzhen, have granted commercial licenses for companies to pilot driverless services, while automakers and ride-hailing platforms are also investing in their automated fleets.

            Last week, authorities in Shanghai’s Pudong New Area started handing out licenses to driverless car operators, including Apollo Go and Alibaba-backed AutoX, according to state media China Daily. California-based startup Pony.ai, backed by Toyota and Saudi Arabia, was also given the green light to test driverless vehicles in the financial hub.
    

            Officials in Beijing said in June that they were “soliciting public opinion” on regulations involving the use of autonomous vehicles for buses, taxis and car rental services.
    

            Earlier this month, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Economy and Information Technology issued draft guidelines stating that autonomous vehicles should have drivers or safety officers on board, or be able to be intercepted remotely. Any traffic violations should be handled based on local laws and regulations, it said.
    

            In the southern megacity of Shenzhen, Apollo Go was granted a license in February to run a trial in Bao’an district, People’s Daily reported, which allowed the company to charge. More such trials are expected across the country.

CNN_22,"Veteran anti-whaling activist Paul Watson could be extradited to Japan after arrest in Greenland, his foundation says",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/22/europe/paul-watson-whaling-activist-arrested-greenland-japan-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-22 13:09:00,world,"
            Veteran environmentalist Paul Watson was arrested in Greenland on Sunday and faces possible extradition to Japan allegedly over anti-whaling activities in the Antarctic years ago, his organization said in a statement.
    

            The 73-year-old American-Canadian dual national was detained by Danish police when his ship docked in the Greenland capital Nuuk to refuel, according to the Captain Paul Watson Foundation (CPWF).
    

            The ship John Paul DeJoria and a 25-member crew were en route from Dublin, Ireland to the North Pacific to intercept Japan’s newly launched $48 million factory whaling ship the Kangei Maru, the organization said.
    

            “We were immediately boarded by a SWAT team and Danish police who wasted no time in cuffing Paul Watson, our founder, and arresting him on a decades old Red Notice at the request of Japan,” Ship Operations Director Locky MacLean said in a video message onboard the John Paul DeJoria.
    

            In the video, police can be seen boarding the vessel and leading Watson away in handcuffs.
    

            CNN has reached out to the Danish Police in Greenland for comment. Citing a police statement, the Associated Press reported that Watson will be brought before a district court with a request to detain him before a decision is made on his possible extradition to Japan.
    

            Watson’s foundation believes the arrest “is connected to a previous Red Notice issued for Watson’s anti-whaling activities in the Antarctic.”
    

            “This development comes as a surprise since the Foundation’s lawyers had reported that the Red Notice had been withdrawn. However, it appears that Japan had made the notice confidential to facilitate Paul’s travel for the purpose of making an arrest,” the statement continued.

Japan is determined to keep hunting whales. And now it has a brand new ‘mothership’


            CPWF said it “believes the reactivation of the Red Notice against Captain Watson is politically motivated, coinciding with the launch of the new factory ship.”
    

            The Japan Coast Guard (JCG) told CNN it was aware that Greenland police have issued a statement about Watson and said, “We will continue to respond appropriately in coordination and cooperation with related organizations.”
    

            Interpol issued a Red Notice for Watson in September 2012, two years after the JCG issued an arrest warrant for him. CNN has contacted Interpol for more information.
    

            An early member of Greenpeace, Watson went on to found the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, an environmental group famous for tracking, exposing and occasionally ramming Japanese whalers. His attempts to disrupt Japanese whalers at sea gained him fame through Animal Planet’s “Whale Wars” TV show.
    

            His activities have also previously landed him in legal trouble. In 2012, he was detained in Germany on an international arrest warrant issued by Costa Rica, which accused him of endangering a fishing vessel off the coast of Guatemala in 2002. He skipped bail but denied wrongdoing in that case.
    

            In 2013, the Japan’s Institute of Cetacean Research and the Japanese firm Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha secured a US District Court injunction against Watson and Sea Shepherd, which prohibited him and his group from coming within 500 yards of the plaintiffs on the open sea.
    

            Due to the injunction, Watson resigned as president and executive director of the conservation society in the United States and as president of the society in Australia.
    

            In June, Kyodo Senpaku launched a brand-new whaling “mothership” – the Kangei Maru – a 370-foot, 9,300-ton vessel equipped with state-of-the-art drones able to travel a reported 100 kilometers (62 miles) to allow crews to quickly locate and kill whales.
    

            The new ship replaces the Nisshin Maru, the infamous whaling factory vessel dubbed by activists as a “floating slaughterhouse” that was decommissioned in 2020 after more than 30 years of service, during which it frequently clashed with anti-whaling activists.
    

            Watson told CNN ahead of the launch that he believes the ship’s high-powered features – including a cruising range of 13,000 kilometers (more than 8,000 miles) and its ability to sail for up to 60 days – suggests that Japan could set its sights on whales far beyond its northern waters.

            “Japan has never given up on its whaling ambitions,” Watson told CNN at the time. “The only purpose of a vessel like that is so it can travel long distances … to hunt whales.”
    

            Japan is one of three countries, along with Norway and Iceland, that continues to hunt whales, and officials argue that the industry is an important part of its culture and history – and also provides food security.
    

            The Kangei Maru boasts a slipway large enough to haul 85-foot whales from the sea that leads to an indoor flensing deck the size of two basketball courts.
    

            There, workers will strip away the blubber before cutting up the whale flesh on enormous cutting boards, before vacuum-packing and storing the meat in 40 industrial freezers, ready for sale.
    

            Takaaki Sakamoto, director of the Whaling Affairs Office in Japan’s Fisheries Agency, told CNN that Japan sent ships to the Antarctic last year to collect numbers and skin surface samples, but those expeditions did not involve killing whales. He said they planned to return this year to do the same.
    

            Hideki Tokoro, president of Kyodo Senpaku, told CNN the Kangei Maru is not planning on killing whales beyond Japanese waters because it doesn’t make economic sense.
    

            Commercial whaling was banned under a 1986 International Whaling Commission moratorium. But Japan has used a loophole to continue hunting whales legally for what it claims is scientific research.
    

            In 2018, it announced its withdrawal from the IWC and resumed commercial whaling months later in defiance of international criticism.
    

            “We are proud of catching whales and are very proud of this ship which will allow us to begin offshore mothership-style whaling this year,” Tokoro told reporters in June.

            As temperatures soared across parts of central China’s agricultural heartland last month, farmers struggled with day after day without rain.
    

            In sweltering Henan province, many scrambled to irrigate parched crops during what is usually a key growing period, while authorities ordered water use to be limited and for clouds to be artificially seeded in an effort to prod rain clouds, state media reports said.
    

            Just one month later, however, parts of the province were awash – pounded by extreme rain that inundated tens of thousands of acres of cropland and forced more than 100,000 people to evacuate their homes, according to state media.
    

            Parts of Henan’s hardest-hit Nanyang city saw more than 600 millimeters (about 24 inches) of rain in 24 hours – three-quarters of what they would normally expect in a whole year. Rescuers navigated streets on speedboats, at times wading through waist-deep floodwaters to pluck people from their homes, footage circulating online showed.
    

            It’s a story playing out across China. In the past two weeks, tens of thousands have been evacuated across multiple provinces in the country following deadly floods and landslides, which have blocked highways, destroyed homes and caused devastating financial losses as they wiped out crops and livestock.
    

            The lurch from dry weather to flooding also throws into sharp focus the major challenge for the Chinese government as emergency response and recovery becomes a regular occurrence – and as extreme weather is only expected to become more frequent due to human-driven climate change.
    

            The flooding in Henan and surrounding provinces last week – and the double hit of arid heat and floods in a matter of weeks – has prolonged what has already been a devastating period of extreme weather across China that’s forecast to continue.
    

            Torrential rainfall has hit southern, central and eastern parts of the country and led to major emergency response efforts in a flood season that has started some two months ahead of its typical schedule and only last week entered what’s known as its peak period.
    

            China’s ruling Communist Party acknowledged the urgency of the situation last week, when a communique following a landmark meeting of its top members led by Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged to “refine the measures for monitoring, preventing, and controlling natural disasters, especially floods.”
    

            The government has in recent years grown increasingly alert to the domestic risk of climate change – including its potential impact on food security as drought and floods hit lands critical for the national grain supply.
    

            China, the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, has looked to position itself as a leader in the global transition to green energy – even as it’s met challenges weaning itself off coal due to high demand for power.
    

            Authorities are meanwhile grappling with the latest crises amid mounting social frustration with China’s stuttering economy and the broader direction of the country – and as local governments strapped with high levels of debt are tasked with recovery efforts.
    

            Before last week’s floods, natural disasters had already cost nearly $13 billion in direct economic losses and affected 32 million people this year, China’s Ministry of Emergency Management said on July 12.
    

            “Last night I couldn’t sleep at all,” one farmer in Henan’s Nanyang city said as he surveyed submerged crop fields in a video posted to social media and shared by a government-linked account.
    

            “All my hard work for a year has come to nothing.”
    

            As the heavy rains moved across central China in recent days, accounts of loss and devastated livelihoods also spread across social and local media.
    

            At least 34 people have been killed since last weekend due to flooding and landslides, including 15 who died in a bridge collapse in Shaanxi province Friday following flash floods and heavy rain. It comes after flooding and landslides late last month killed at least 71 people in southern China.
    

            One video posted on social media showed a farmer in Sichuan province wading through chest-high waters to pick corn – clearly determined not to lose his harvest.
    

            Meanwhile, a farmer in flood-hit Hunan lost more than 800 pigs – taking a hit of about $275,000 – after his barn was inundated this month, he told state-backed Agricultural Television.
    

            Retailers and farmers have also taken to social media to sell flooded crops at a discount – for many a last-ditch attempt to salvage an income in a country where research shows insurance coverage is low compared with other major economies.
    

            As of Sunday, 10 provinces were under emergency alerts for flooding, according to national weather authorities, with more heavy rain expected in the coming days.
    

            A typhoon that hit China’s Hainan island Monday is expected to make landfall on the mainland as a tropical storm Tuesday, while a cyclone that could strengthen to a typhoon is expected to hit coastal China later this week, according to CNN Weather.
    

            China’s government has mounted a top-down effort to revamp how the country responds to extreme weather in recent years after 2021 floods in Henan’s Zhengzhou killed more than 300 people. And climate scientists earlier this month issued a stark warning, calling the country a “hotspot where the impacts of climate change are acutely felt.”
    

            Observers say authorities have made progress, especially when it comes to early warnings and response, weather monitoring and certain infrastructure development – but they also note more must be done in China – like many countries grappling with climate change – to prepare for the impact of more frequent extreme weather.
    

            “While policies and strategies are being developed and implemented, the pace and scale of action often fall short of what is needed to effectively mitigate the risks and impacts of climate change,” said Hongzhang Xu, an adjunct research fellow at the Australian National University.
    

            That need may be more acute in remote, rural or mountainous regions, often populated by vulnerable elderly populations and with fewer resources, as well as provinces not historically prone to severe flooding, like in China’s northeastern breadbasket, which endured extreme rains last year.
    

            Another challenge, experts say, is bolstering recovery from severe flooding, where damaged croplands, destroyed homes and devastated livelihoods can take months to recover.
    

            Local governments are typically tasked with managing reconstruction efforts, while the central government plays a role in planning and financing. But there have been past issues of misappropriation of state recovery funds, for example following the deadly 2021 floods in Zhengzhou.
    

            And only about 8% of an aggregate $25 billion in losses in China from flooding caused by Typhoon Doksuri last summer were covered by insurance, according to data from global insurance firm Munich Re.
    

            “Farmlands need to be re-plowed, and fully restoring soil quality would take several months,” said Li Zhao, a senior researcher at Greenpeace East Asia in Beijing. “For the residential houses, each household should spend a lot of money to rebuild – just to recover from this kind of event is very difficult.”
    

            Those living in flood-prone areas also face a tough choice as the risks grow, she added.
    

            “Maybe in the future, we will see how people make the decision,” she said. “Are they moving to a safer place? Or will they go back to the villages (and rebuild)?”

CNN_24,Israel strikes Yemen for the first time following deadly Houthi drone attack. Here’s what we know,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/middleeast/israel-strikes-houthi-rebels-explainer-intl/index.html,2024-07-22 15:30:00,world,"
            For the first time, Israel has struck inside Yemen, following a deadly drone attack launched by Houthi rebels on Tel Aviv.
    

            Since the October 7 attacks by Hamas on Israel, the Houthis have been targeting shipping in the Red Sea in solidarity - they say - with Gaza. After Israel struck back on Saturday, the Houthis said they launched a fresh barrage of missiles towards Israel, promising a response that will be “huge and great.”
    

            Direct attacks on each other’s soil between the Israeli military and the Iran-backed rebel group now risk creating a new front in a conflict that already threatened to spill over into the region, with Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam on Sunday describing the situation as “open war.”
    

            Here’s what we know.
    

            The Houthis are an Iran-backed Islamist group based in Yemen.
    

            The Houthi movement, also known as Ansar Allah (Supporters of God), is one side in a civil war that has raged in Yemen for nearly a decade. It emerged in the 1990s, when its leader, Hussein al-Houthi, launched “Believing Youth,” a religious revival movement for a centuries-old subsect of Shia Islam called Zaidism.
    

            Since a ceasefire, the Houthis have consolidated their control over most of northern Yemen. They have also sought an agreement with Saudi Arabia, a major rival of Iran, that would bring the war to a permanent end and cement their role as the country’s rulers.
    

            The Houthis are believed to have been armed and trained by Iran. Since Hamas’s attacks on October 7 attacks and Israel’s subsequent ground and air offenses in Gaza, the Houthis say they have been seeking revenge against Israel for its military campaign by targeting Red Sea shipping.
    

            The US and UK have responded to those attacks by carrying out strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. However, Israel has not taken part in those responses.
    

            In addition, Israel’s army spokesman says the militant group has targeted “Israeli civilians and civilian infrastructure” about 200 times in the same period. Most of those launches were intercepted by US Central Command, the spokesman said, but Israel’s air defenses have also intercepted Houthi drones and missiles inside and outside Israel’s airspace.
    

            A tipping point for Israel appears to have come on Friday, when a drone attack was launched on Tel Aviv, killing one Israeli citizen and injuring several others.
    

            The attack was claimed by the Houthis, with spokesperson Yahya Sare’e saying the operation was performed by a new drone capable of “bypassing the enemy’s interception systems.”
    

            “We will continue to strike these targets in response to the enemy’s massacres and daily crimes against our brothers in the Gaza Strip,” Sare’e said. “Our operations will only cease when the aggression stops and the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted.”
    

            The attack marked the first time Tel Aviv, Israel’s commercial center, has been struck by a drone in an attack claimed by the Houthis. Israel authorities are investigating the circumstances and potential security failures around the deadly drone blast.
    

            Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari said that the military suspects the drone was an Iranian-made Samad-3 model, launched from Yemen, which had been upgraded to extend its range.
    

            A second drone was intercepted outside of Israeli airspace to the east at the same time as the attack, he said, adding that Israel is now upgrading its air defenses and increasing aerial patrols of its borders.
    

            Israel’s response came a day later, when Israeli aircraft hit the Yemeni port of Hodeidah.
    

            The attack, which marked the first time Israel has struck Yemen, killed at least six people and injured scores more, Yemeni officials said. The Houthi-run Al Masirah TV said the strikes targeted oil facilities in the port on Yemen’s west coast.
    

Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam said the strikes had also hit civilian targets and a power station. He slammed what he said was “brutal Israeli aggression” aimed at increasing the “suffering of the people of Yemen” and pressuring the group to stop its support of Gaza.
    

            Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the port was used by Iran to bring arms into Yemen.
    

            “The port we attacked is not an innocent port. It was used for military purposes, it was used as an entry point for deadly weapons supplied to the Houthis by Iran,” he said in a statement on Saturday.
    

            Netanyahu also said the operation, which hit targets 1,800 km (1,118 miles) from Israel’s borders, showed Israel was serious about responding to threats.
    

            “It makes it clear to our enemies that there is no place that the long arm of the State of Israel will not reach,” Netanyahu said.
    

            Neither side have suggested they are ready to back down. “It’s not in the Houthi ‘DNA’ to de-escalate with Israel,” Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute wrote on X.
    

            Houthi army spokesperson Yehya Saree said the Houthis have “prepared for a long war” with Israel and that Tel Aviv is still not safe. Israel’s Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, warned that the “blood of Israeli citizens has a price,” and that if Israelis are attacked, the “result will be identical” to that which has been seen in Lebanon and Gaza.
    

            On Sunday, Israeli military said it had intercepted a missile approaching Israeli territory from Yemen while the Houthis said they launched a “number of ballistic missiles.”
    

            The war in Gaza has already been accompanied by significantly heightened tensions between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. The two sides have been trading cross-border fire since October 8, when Hezbollah fired at three Israeli border posts “in solidarity” with Palestinians.
    

            Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi said on Sunday in a televised address on Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV that the group intended to continue “the fifth stage of escalation in support of Gaza.”
    

            Friday’s drone attack on Tel Aviv signaled the beginning of that stage, he also said.
    

            But while rising tensions with the Houthis undoubtedly creates fresh challenges for Israel, Hezbollah remains the bigger threat given its extensive arsenal and proximity to Israel.
    

            Yoel Guzansky, a senior fellow at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) who has served on Israel’s National Security Council, told CNN he believes Israel has until now been restrained in its response.
    

            He believes Israel was trying to send a signal to the US and the international community that “enough is enough,” and deliberately chose a target with high visibility.
    

            “You have to signal to a rogue actor that is attacking you that there is a price to pay, and I think this is what Israel tried to do.”
    

            Like the Houthis, Hezbollah is also heavily backed by Iran, which makes no secret of its animosity towards Israel.
    

            Any increase in hostilities between Israel and Iran’s proxies is seen as deeply destabilizing in the region because it could push the two countries closer towards open warfare.
    

            Israel and Iran have already traded one direct exchange since October 7. Few in the international community want to see it happen again.

CNN_25,"Instead of using film, this artist prints photos onto living plants",https://edition.cnn.com/style/almudena-romero-photos-onto-plants-spc/index.html,2024-07-22 15:39:00,world,"
            Spanish artist Almudena Romero knew from a young age that she loved plants: “I must have been about four or five - my granny would call and say, ‘what do you want for your birthday?’ And I’d be like, an olive tree.”
    

            Now, with her inclusion in exhibitions in London (at the Saatchi Gallery) and Paris (Albert Khan Museum), she’s showcasing her unique plant-based art that’s pushing audiences to question their hyper-consumerism whilst showing that it’s possible to create art in an eco-friendly manner.
    

            In her four-chapter series called “The Pigment Change,” rather than developing photos on photographic paper, she prints them directly onto plants.
    

            “I just put a negative on top of the leaf and leave it to the sunlight, and then the image gets recorded on the leaf,” Romero said. “But I also print on living plants using a digital projector, and the plant makes photosynthesis with the light from the projector and records an image.”
    

            In a chapter from that series, called “Family Album,” she spreads watercress seeds on a stretched canvas, and lets them grow in the dark, before projecting a negative onto the watercress.
    

            “The parts that receive more light produce chlorophyll, hence the dark green tones, and the parts that receive less light remain yellow, pale,” she said. “[It’s] exactly like in a photographic darkroom. But instead of having an enlarger, I have a projector, and my watercress canvas is my photo paper. That’s how I grow photographs.”
    

            The chlorophyll process adopted by Almudena was popularized in the 90’s by Heather Ackroyd and Dan Harvey, who projected photographs onto grass using a negative and light cast by a projector bulb. Allegedly, the British artists came up with the technique when they noticed random outlines of a ladder cast onto one of their grass installations.
    

            Despite being an innovative process, it wasn’t simple. It required a lot of space and preparation. Later, Artist Binh Danh enhanced this method by using photosensitive materials from plants, securing a positive straight into a leaf and enabling sunlight to bleach the photo onto its surface.
    

            Romero, who was raised in Madrid, used to spend holidays on her grandparents’ avocado farm in Valencia, in eastern Spain. Breathing fresh air, picking fruit, and learning from her grandmother about plants during her formative years instilled in her the eco-conscious values she embraces today.
    

            “When you grow close to nature, it becomes a really important thing in your life,” she said. “Plants for me are important, partly because of the legacy of my family and because as a photographic material, it’s impressive in quality.”
    

            But she concedes that her eco-friendly techniques wouldn’t work for all artists. “It is a niche because it produces ephemeral pieces, so it’s a lot more difficult to be financially sustainable when your art is ephemeral, but I guess it’s also depending on how you understand life and what you want to do with your practice,” she explained. 


            The 38-year-old is not alone in her love for plants. According to a survey published by consumer analytics platform CivicScience, more than 200 million Americans were houseplant owners in 2020. In the past few years, Millennials have embraced the “plant-parent” craze, sharing photos and care tips on social media. But for Romero, plants are much more than something to look after: they’re beings we can learn from.
    

            “Plants have been [around] for way longer than us on the planet and they have succeeded in doing that without causing any extinction,” she said.
    

            Romero points to plants in deserts and arid environments that have evolved strategies that limit reproduction, saying they allow her to better argue that it’s not an “unnatural behavior” to choose to be child-free. “I am a person who doesn’t want to have children because of climate change,” she explained. “I simply don’t feel comfortable.”
    

            In her series “The Pigment Change” she questions whether maternity or parenthood is something “beyond one’s control” or a “question of will,” reflecting on plants’ selective reproduction strategies and opening a broader reflection on procreation.
    

            In 2020, she won the BMW Residency Award for the project and her work was exhibited at the renowned photography festival Rencontres d’Arles, in France.
    

            It’s not only about what we can learn from plants, though. For the Spaniard, we should also consider non-anthropocentric ethics (a philosophical perspective which challenges the idea that humans are the most important beings, emphasizing the value of all living organisms and ecosystems), seeing other species as having their own agendas and intentionality.
    

            The artist explained that she sees photoperiodism (the way plants respond and adapt to light changes throughout the seasons) as a performance by plants. “Why do we tend to think that we only have these capacities as humans?” said Romero. “The problem is the perspective that we have that we think that we are very different until science proves the opposite.”
    

            Studies have shown that plants can be more complex than we may think. According to an article published in The Plant Journal, plants like Arabidopsis feel stressed when touched, which stunts their growth, while in 2019, another research group found that beach evening-primrose respond to the sound of pollinators.
    

            Now, Romero is working on her next project, which is due to be completed by June 2025. Commissioned by France’s National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment, the size of the work is planned to be bigger than a stadium.
    

            “I’m working in farming what will be the largest photographic artwork ever produced. We are going to farm an image of 30,000 square meters,” she said.
    

            Romero is collaborating with scientist Nicolas Langlade, with the help of AI, to use genetically different wheats and grasses to achieve a color palette sufficiently rich to produce a distinguishable image.
    

            The artwork reflects on the human relationship with land and plants, our impact on the environment and our interdependency with nature. For Romero, this art-science project is like coming full circle. “It’s a combination of my family’s background because we are going to farm it,” she said. “I love my passion for plant photography, so I’m really happy about it.”
    

            “Metamorphosis” is showing at the Saatchi Gallery, London, until the 28 July.


“Natures Vivantes” is showing at the Albert Khan Museum, Paris, until the 31 December.

CNN_26,Costs from the global outage could top $1 billion – but who pays the bill is harder to understand,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/business/crowdstrike-outage-cost/index.html,2024-07-22 16:46:00,us,"
            The world learned relatively quickly that cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike was behind a crippling global tech outage on Friday. But figuring out who will pay the bill for the damages could take a lot longer.
    

            What one cybersecurity expert said appears to be the “largest IT outage in history” led to the cancellation of more than 5,000 commercial airline flights worldwide and disrupted businesses from retail sales to package deliveries to procedures at hospitals, costing revenue and staff time and productivity.
    

The problem was caused by a few bits of CrowdStrike’s own bad code in a software “content update.” Unfortunately, fixing the mistake was much more time-consuming than causing it, and it could be days before all the systems are back to normal.

How the world’s tech crashed all at once


            In a social media post late Sunday, CrowdStrike said “a significant number” of about 8.5 million devices affected were back online and operational. It apologized again for the disruption.
    

            While CrowdStrike has apologized, it has not mentioned whether or not it intends to provide compensation to affected customers. And when asked by CNN about whether it plans to provide compensation, its response did not address that question.
    

            Experts say they expect that there will be demands for remuneration and very possibly lawsuits.
    

            “If you’re a lawyer for CrowdStrike, you’re probably not going to enjoy the rest of your summer,” said Dan Ives, a tech analyst for Wedbush Securities.
    

            Experts largely agree it’s too early to get a firm handle on the price tag for Friday’s global internet breakdown. But those costs could easily top $1 billion, said Patrick Anderson, CEO of Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan research firm that specializes in estimating the economic cost of events like strikes and other business disruptions.
    

            His firm estimates that a recent hack of CDK Global, a software firm that serves US car dealerships, reached that $1 billion cost mark. While that outage lasted much longer, about three weeks, it was restricted to one narrow industry.
    

            “This outage is affecting far more consumers and businesses in a way that ranges from inconvenience to serious disruptions and resulted in out of pocket costs they can’t get back easily,” he said. Anderson added that the costs could be particularly significant for airlines, due to lost revenue from canceled flights and excess labor and fuel costs for the planes that did fly but faced significant delays.
    

            Despite CrowdStrike’s dominance in the cybersecurity field, its revenue is just less than $4 billion annually.
    

            But there could be legal protections for CrowdStrike in its customer contracts to shield it from liability, according to one expert.
    

            “I would guess that the contracts protect them,” said James Lewis, researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
    

            Lewis pointed to case decided Thursday in favor of SolarWinds, another software company. A judge dismissed Securities and Exchange Commission charges against SolarWinds related to a Russian hack of federal government agencies in late 2020. Lewis said in that case SolarWinds was only facing charges for not disclosing its system’s vulnerabilities to an outside hack, not for damage caused by its own actions. But it still won a dismissal of the case.
    

            It’s also not clear how many customers CrowdStrike might lose because of Friday.
    

            Wedbush Securities’ Ives estimates less than 5% of its customers might go elsewhere.
    

            “They’re such an entrenched player, to move away from CrowdStrike would be a gamble,” he said.
    

            It will be difficult, and not without additional costs, for many customers to switch from CrowdStrike to a competitor. But the real hit to CrowdStrike could be reputational damage that will make it difficult to win new customers.
    

            “Today CrowdStrike becomes a household name, but not in a good way, and this will take time to settle down,” Ives said.
    

            CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said in an interview Friday morning on CNBC that the firm has been focused on fixing the continuing problems and that so far, he believed most customers had been understanding.
    

            “My goal right now is to make sure every customer is back up and running,” he said. “I think many of the customers understand it’s a complex environment and staying one step ahead of the bad guys requires these content updates.”
    

            But even if customers are understanding, it’s likely that CrowdStrike’s rivals will be seeking to use Friday’s events to try to lure them away.
    

            “It’s a very competitive business. There will be sales people from all the other companies, …(jumping) in and say(ing), ‘This has never happened to us,’” said said Eric O’Neill, a cybersecurity expert and former FBI counterintelligence operative. “They’re an excellent company doing important work. I hope they survive this. If they don’t, the only winner will be the cybercriminals.”

CNN_27,Ballet-inspired double skyscraper design tricks the eye,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/22/style/bond-tower-tirana-albania/index.html,2024-07-22 16:47:00,world,"
            In Albania’s capital Tirana, where a spate of new towers will soon transform the skyline, architects have revealed plans for a new double skyscraper that will bend elegantly like a ballet dancer’s plié, or a lover leaning in for a kiss.
    

            These were two of the visual cues for Bond Tower, a 50-story residential building and hotel that seems to trick the eye. Designed by Portuguese architecture firm OODA, the skyscraper will feature two connected structures that gently separate before rejoining one other, giving it a warped effect.
    

            Residents will stay on one side and hotel guests on the other, with office space and retail mixed in on several of the floors. The rolling mountains surrounding the city will be visible in the negative space between the buildings, explained Diogo Brito, a partner at OODA.
    

            Located on the corner of a major avenue, the silhouette of Bond Tower shifts depending on which direction it’s approached from, he added.
    

            “We found this idea of having this dance between these two volumes… like a gentle encounter on the corner,” Brito said in a phone interview. “It is very important to us to have this equilibrium — this balanced the beauty of form and shape.”
    

            The architectural team designed the shape using multiple visual references, including the “grace” of a ballet dancer’s movement and the romantic gesture of Gustav Klimt’s famous 1908 painting “The Kiss.”
    

            But OODA also wanted to integrate Tirana’s natural landscape into the design, which Brito said is sustainability-minded thanks to its carbon-absorbing stone cladding. “The thing that strikes you the most when you land in Tirana is the presence of those mountains, and to have (them visible) through that gap is something that was also interesting for us to picture,” he added.
    

            Aside from its visual appeal, the the unusual shape also offers structural sturdiness in an area prone to earthquakes, Brito explained.
    

            The project will break ground by the end of the year, according to the architect, with the tower scheduled for completion by the end of 2028. It will be one of many new buildings sending the Albanian capital’s skyline soaring and turning the city into an architectural destination.
    

            Earlier this month, Albania’s National Territorial Council approved a new tower that would become the city’s tallest building, according to local news reports. Several other high-rises are already under construction in the capital, including two 58-floor skyscrapers: Mount Tirana by Denmark’s CEBRA architecture and Tirana Tour by Spain’s Bofill Arquitectura.

            And, in January, Architectural Digest magazine recognized one of the city’s newest jewels — a monumental, colorful pyramid by Dutch studio MVRDV, revamped from a dilapidated former museum — as one of the world’s best new architectural projects.
    

            OODA alone is working on three other projects in the city, including a new television station headquarters inspired by a stack of film reels. This month, OODA will break ground on a greenery filled residential tower called Hora Vertikale that was designed as a “vertical village,” according to the firm.
    

            On the avenue where Bond Tower will rise, Brito expects that OODA’s design will soon be joined by other high-rise companions.
    

            “In Albania, the years to come — let’s say the next 10 to 15 years — will be something really special,” he said.

CNN_28,"Meet Yahya Jan, the architect building the world’s tallest hotel, Ciel Dubai Marina",https://edition.cnn.com/style/ciel-tower-dubai-yahya-jan-spc/index.html,2024-07-22 16:21:00,world,"
    Editor’s Note: This CNN series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.


            If you look out onto the Dubai skyline, you’re likely to be admiring the work of Yahya Jan.
    

            He is president and design director of architecture and engineering firm NORR, which is behind some of the city’s best-known landmarks, including the Atlantis and Shangri-La Hotels.
    

            Now he is working on one of his most ambitious creations. Due for completion by the end of 2024, Ciel Dubai Marina, formerly known as Ciel Tower, will have more than 1,000 rooms and suites spread over 82 floors — and at around 1,200 feet (365 meters) high, it is set to become the world’s tallest hotel.
    

            For the project, Jan was tasked with designing the skyscraper on a triangular plot of land at Dubai Marina with an area of just 2,500 square meters – small for a building of that height.
    

            “It’s a property that’s very compressed,” he told CNN in 2021. “It’s like what you would face in Manhattan or London. The constraints were tremendous, and yet we had to make it work.”
    

            A glass observation deck will offer 360-degree views of the city, as well as the coastline and iconic landmarks such as the Palm Jumeirah man-made island, according to the developer, The First Group. Visitors will also be able to take in the sights from a rooftop swimming pool and restaurants.
    

            As well as appealing to the senses, the project is energy efficient, using 25% less power for air conditioning than is typical for similar buildings, Jan said.

            “This project is not just about architecture. It’s about architecture and engineering coming together,” he added. “That’s why I love the project so much. It … is my passion, the convergence of science and art.”
    

            Throughout the build, Jan said he has been “extremely involved” in the work. “When you design a project as complex as the Ciel, you can never let your guard down, you can never say it’s over,” he said. “It’s a continuous process.”
    

            When Jan first arrived in Dubai in 1996, he never envisioned he would leave such a legacy, designing some of the city’s most iconic office developments, residential towers and malls.
    

            He grew up in Karachi, Pakistan, and moved to the US aged 18 on a scholarship. After studying structural engineering at Princeton, he got a Master’s in architecture. After that, Jan worked in the US for nine years and had no intention of leaving until he received a job offer as a senior designer working on the Emirates Towers office and hotel complex.

            Now aged 61, he said that he never planned to stay in the UAE for so long, now having spent 28 years in Dubai. “I got carried away with the excitement here,” he said.
    

            As for Ciel Dubai Marina — named for the French word for sky — Jan hopes that it will come to be seen as timeless, like the Empire State Building or the Chrysler Building in New York City.
    

            “The reason I like the fact that it’s called Ciel is because I believe in our own lives the sky is the limit, and that’s the case certainly in my own life,” he said. “I’ve had a chance to grow, to do things that I didn’t think I would get a chance to do. So it’s been amazing.”

CNN_29,Where every sport is being held at the Paris Olympic Games,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/22/sport/paris-2024-olympic-games-venues-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-22 16:24:00,world,"
            There’s a lot happening in Paris this summer.
    

            The Olympic Games are coming to the French capital and homes have been found for all 32 sporting disciplines.
    

            Many of the venues existed before the Games – the only permanent sports facility built for the Olympics is the Aquatics Center, which will welcome the artistic swimming, water polo and diving events. There will also be various temporary arenas and stands, with several being built around famous landmarks.
    

            While there are a handful of sporting venues in different parts of France – and even further afield – Paris is hosting a fairly compact Games, with the majority of the facilities located within a five-kilometer (3.1-mile) radius of the Olympic Village in the north of the city. Fans will be able to walk or cycle between the sites, or get around via Paris’ well-connected metro system.
    

            In a totally unique event, the Opening Ceremony will be held along the Seine River, marking the first time that the ceremony has not taken place inside a stadium.
    

            The famous Parade of Nations – which typically features national delegations of athletes entering the Olympic Stadium on foot – will take place on the Seine itself, with boats carrying the 10,500 athletes through the center of the city.
    

            With several spectacular attractions around the city, it is no surprise that the Paris 2024 organizers opted to host certain events in full view of some the capital’s most recognizable sites.
    

            Fans may have to tear themselves away from the Eiffel Tower when going to watch the beach volleyball event as the iconic landmark will sit next to the newly-constructed open-air stadium at the Champ de Mars.
    

            Another stunning venue is the famous Palace of Versailles. Once home to the nation’s monarchy before the French revolution, the Château will now crown sporting royalty in the equestrian and modern pentathlon events.
    

            Archery will take place at the Esplanade des Invalides, a huge open-air green space that will also serve as the finish line of the marathon. The Esplanade is located on the north side of the impressive Hôtel des Invalides, which contains museums and monuments relating to French military history, a hospital and a retirement home for veterans, as well as the tomb of Napoleon Bonaparte.
    

            It seems as though event organizers have made use of every available public space and morphed them into areas capable of hosting an Olympic event, with the transformation of the Place de la Concorde into a hub for urban sports among the most eye-catching.
    

            The famous public square will “enable urban sports to become established in their natural environment, away from stadiums, at the heart of the city,” per Olympics.com. Breaking, the newest Olympic sport, will take place at La Concorde and will share the area with 3x3 basketball, skateboarding and freestyle BMX.
    

            The City of Light also already possesses a selection of permanent sporting venues that will be put to use during the Olympics. The Stade de France is the home of the country’s national soccer and rugby teams and is no stranger to international sporting or cultural events. It is one of only two stadiums to host both the soccer and rugby World Cup finals and staged the UEFA Champions League final in 2002, 2006 and 2022.
    

            It will become the Olympic Stadium for the duration of the Games, welcoming track and field (athletics) and rugby sevens.
    

            Southwest of the arena is the Stade Roland Garros. Named after the famed French aviator, the complex is home to 18 clay tennis courts which are annually used for the French Open, one of the sport’s four grand slams. Olympic tennis will naturally take place here, but its centerpiece – Court Philippe Chatrier – will also play host to boxing bouts.
    

            Soccer will cover the most ground of any sport at the Games, with matches being held in seven different stadiums across the country. Located in the heart of Paris, though, is the famed Parc des Princes, one of the host venues for the ‘Beautiful Game.’ Home to 12-time Ligue 1 champion Paris Saint-Germain, the stadium has previously hosted World Cup and European Championship fixtures.
    

            Though the majority of events will be concentrated inside Paris or on its perimeter, a handful of sports will be held away from the capital.
    

            While most athletes will be dealing with the hustle and bustle of city life and the arrival of thousands of Olympics fans, the surfers competing at Paris 2024 are heading to a remote island paradise.
    

            The entirety of the surfing competition will take place in Tahiti, the largest island in the overseas collectivity of French Polynesia. Located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean over 9,000 miles away from Paris, Tahiti will welcome surfers from all over the world who will attempt to conquer the infamous Teahupo’o wave.
    

            Often referred to as the “The End of the Road,” Teahupo’o is known for its picturesque setting but also the danger it poses due to the shallow reef below the immense wave.
    

            Olympic sailors will not be venturing quite as far, but with Paris being located inland and away from the coastline, the seaside city of Marseille on mainland France’s southern coast has been selected to host the event. The Roucas-Blanc Marina will be adapted for the competition, with the coastal configuration and constant winds ensuring “ideal tactical and strategic conditions for the competitors.”
    

            The city will also host soccer matches at the Marseille Stadium (also known as the Stade Vélodrome) alongside the Parc de Princes and arenas in Bordeaux, Saint-Étienne, Lyon, Nantes and Nice.

CNN_30,Secret Service director to testify agency ‘failed’ during Trump shooting,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/kimberly-cheatle-secret-service-director/index.html,2024-07-22 18:15:00,politics,"
            United States Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle is expected to testify before the House Oversight Committee on Monday that her agency “failed” its mission during the attempted assassination of Donald Trump earlier this month.
    

            “The Secret Service’s solemn mission is to protect our nation’s leaders. On July 13th, we failed,” the director is expected to tell lawmakers, according to prepared remarks reviewed by CNN. “As the Director of the United States Secret Service, I take full responsibility for any security lapse.”
    

            The agency, Cheatle is expected to say, “must learn what happened and I will move heaven and earth to ensure an incident like July 13th does not happen again. Thinking about what we should have done differently is never far from my thoughts.”
    

            In her testimony – alone and under subpoena – Cheatle will be forced to provide many answers to what is essentially a single question: How did the Secret Service’s biggest failure in four decades happen under her watch?
    

            In the days following the attempted assassination, Cheatle has done no press conferences and very few interviews. Monday’s hearing will mark the first opportunity for a lengthy dive into the security failures at Trump’s July 13 rally.
    

            House Oversight Chairman James Comer on Sunday promised the hearing would be extensive and detailed.
    

            Cheatle is “going to have about a six-hour hearing, and she’s going to have hundreds of questions that she’s going to have to answer,” Comer said on “Fox News Sunday.”
    

            In his opening statement Monday, released prior to the hearing, Comer said Cheatle should resign and noted that so far, she has refused to do so.
    

            “The Secret Service has a zero fail mission, but it failed on July 13 and in the days leading up to the rally,” Comer’s opening statement says. “The bottom line is that under Director Cheatle’s leadership, we question whether anyone is safe. Not President Biden, not the First Lady, not the White House, not presidential candidates.”
    

            In the week since the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, relatively little has come out about the shooter’s motive, how he was able to perch on a nearby rooftop with an AR-style weapon and why Trump’s team wasn’t warned about a potential threat.
    

            Republican lawmakers in particular have been upset with the lack of answers, and many have called for Cheatle’s resignation.
    

Cheatle has said that “the buck stops with me,” but there has also been finger pointing between the Secret Service and local law enforcement over who had responsibility for what and whether all the resources needed were present.
    

            She is expected to say in her remarks Monday that the agency’s mission “is not political.”
    

            “It is literally a matter of life and death, as the tragic events on July 13th remind us. I have full confidence in the men and women of the Secret Service. They are worthy of our support in executing our protective mission.”
    

            Here’s what to watch for:
    

            The shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was spotted multiple times with a rangefinder, a hunting device similar to a pair of binoculars that calculates distance, prior to the shooting. Further, police had circulated a photo of him they had taken.
    

            A source told CNN that about 19 minutes before the shooting occurred, law enforcement was trying to locate Crooks, but they could not find him until he was on the roof.
    

            Butler Township Manager Tom Knights told CNN police responded to a call of a “suspicious male” around the same time that Trump arrived for his Pennsylvania rally on Saturday - at least ten minutes before he took the stage for his speech.
    

            However, members of Trump’s team weren’t told that law enforcement was trying to locate Crooks as they were preparing the former president to take the stage.
    

            There was also no conversation about whether Trump should have delayed his entrance, according to sources who were with him at the rally.
    

            “We would have never let him go out there if we thought there was a threat to him,” one source present with Trump told CNN.
    

            A Secret Service source familiar with the incident told CNN that Crooks had been “deemed a suspicious person, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that there was any indication that he was an immediate threat” or had a weapon until just before the shooting.
    

            Suspicious people aren’t uncommon at events like Trump rallies – even on Saturday, “a guy tried to come in with a goat” and a woman showed up “riding a horse with a giant Trump flag,” and both were also deemed suspicious, the Secret Service source said.
    

            Crooks fired several shots at Trump from a roof roughly 150 yards away from Trump’s podium. He fired from the roof of a building that was also occupied by a local sniper team on the second floor and served as a staging area for tactical support teams at the rally.
    

            Cheatle told ABC News last week that a sniper team was not positioned on the roof of the building due to its slope.
    

            “That building in particular has a sloped roof, at its highest point,” Cheatle told ABC News. “And so, there’s a safety factor that would be considered there that we wouldn’t want to put somebody up on a sloped roof. And so, the decision was made to secure the building, from inside.”
    

            If the slope of the roof didn’t stop the shooter’s ability to open fire, why did it stop law enforcement from staging there? Secret Service snipers, including the ones who killed Crooks, were also staged on a rooftop with a much steeper incline without a problem.
    

            Despite its location, the building also wasn’t in the security perimeter.
    

            In an interview with CNN, Cheatle said the perimeter “encompassed the area that we needed to secure the event that we had on that day.”
    

            A senior law enforcement official told CNN on Saturday that the Secret Service did not have drone support at the rally, though it does have drone capabilities generally. The source said the agency utilized counter-sniper teams in place of drones.
    

            Trump’s security detail had complained it was not being given enough resources and personnel by the Secret Service over the past two years, something the agency acknowledged this weekend.
    

            A spokesperson for the Secret Service said in a statement Saturday that the agency has not provided certain resources in the past but has instead provided other security measures including from local partners.
    

            A Secret Service official told CNN that examples of these changes included having local sniper teams in place when the Secret Service could not provide its own or having hand-held magnetometers and other measures established at certain events where larger, walk-through magnetometers weren’t available.
    

            Meanwhile, the nature of an alleged Iranian plot to kill Trump also became known last week. And while there is no evidence connecting it to the shooter, it raises the question about the level of security at Trump events.
    

            Asked whether the Secret Service had increased the security it provides to the former president as a result, the director said, “We have been doing that over a series of several months, to include on that day.”
    

            Cheatle would not, however, say whether all elements of the former president’s detail were increased as a result of the threat from Iran.
    

            Cheatle will be under pressure from lawmakers to deliver more about the motive behind the shooting.
    

            The emerging profile of Crooks more than a week after the shooting has left authorities puzzled about a motive for his assault. Investigators are speculating that his intentions may have been less politically motivated and more about attacking the highest-profile target near him.
    

            The investigation remains in its early stages, officials caution. Still, in some ways, Crooks seems similar to the dozens of other young men who’ve wreaked havoc across the US with high-powered assault-style rifles in recent years. He had few close friends, he would often go shooting at a local firing range, and he didn’t seem to display strongly held views that would suggest a politically driven assassination, according to CNN interviews with law enforcement and a review of notes from a briefing to Congress.
    

            At the same time, it has been discovered that he visited the rally site twice after it was announced and may have even flown a drone over the area on the day of the shooting.
    

            Cheatle is a nearly three-decade veteran of the Secret Service, serving in various field offices and vice presidential details including then-Vice President Joe Biden’s detail. Cheatle left the Secret Service in 2021 as the Assistant Director of the Office of Protective Operations - a role she held when the Secret Service scrambled to protect then-Vice President Mike Pence from rioters on January 6, 2021.
    

            Multiple Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have called on Cheatle to resign.
    

            “I don’t understand her decision-making process, and I don’t think she’s fit to lead at this critical time,” House Speaker Mike Johnson told Fox News last week.
    

            Rep. Brendan Boyle, a Pennsylvania Democrat, also said Cheatle needs to leave.
    

            “I’m very sorry to reach this conclusion: I have no confidence in the leadership of the United States Secret Service. I hereby call on Kimberly Cheatle to resign,” Boyle said on X.

            Welcome to a special edition of 5 Things, where we catch you up on the latest developments in President Joe Biden’s stunning exit from the 2024 race.
    

            Here’s what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.
    

      Your day is busy. 5 Things is your one-stop shop for the latest headlines, plus other stories and videos that people are clicking on. Sign up here for the 5 Things newsletter.
    

            President Joe Biden has ended his reelection bid and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him. “It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,” Biden wrote in a letter. “While it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down,” he added. Biden said he will finish his term and speak to the nation later this week in more detail. In a follow-up post, Biden praised Harris and urged Democrats to unite behind her. “It’s time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this,” Biden wrote. His departure marks the first time a US president has dropped out of a reelection run in decades, recalling memories of President Lyndon Johnson deciding against seeking a second full term in 1968.
    

            Vice President Harris said in a statement that she was “honored” to receive President Biden’s endorsement and intends to “earn and win” the Democratic nomination. While it remains unclear if Harris will go unchallenged, she has already received a groundswell of support from Democratic lawmakers backing her ascension to become the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead the ticket of a major political party. The makeup of the ticket now rests with the roughly 4,700 delegates who will vote for a new standard-bearer at the Democratic National Convention in August. CNN has so far been able to identify more than 500 endorsements for Harris from Democratic delegates — and analysts say that number will grow as the party continues to coalesce around her 2024 campaign.
    

            With the election less than four months away, Harris must now quickly narrow her focus on a handful of potential running mates. Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn, a close ally of President Biden’s who has endorsed Harris, weighed in on several possible options for her to select as a running mate if she gets the nomination. The South Carolina Democrat said he likes Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and noted that North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper is in play. Some Democrats hope there will be an open race for Harris’ running mate with a focus on other Democratic governors, including Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Speculation is also swirling around Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who joined a campaign staff call for Harris on Sunday night, sources told CNN.
    

            Minutes after President Biden announced his exit from the race, former President Donald Trump described him as going “down as the single worst president by far in the history of our country.” Trump’s campaign managers echoed his remarks with a blistering statement tying Harris to the Biden administration’s policies. Trump went on to suggest that the next debate move from the agreed-upon host network, ABC, to Fox News. Sources say Trump’s team is planning a series of negative advertisements going after Harris’ record — not only under the Biden administration but also during her time as a prosecutor and attorney general in California. Trump’s campaign and allies also plan to argue that Harris is the person in the administration responsible for the border crisis, a key theme in GOP messaging this year.
    

            Vice President Harris has raised $49.6 million in grassroots donations for her campaign since Biden endorsed her Sunday, campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said. Additionally, the Biden-Harris campaign amended filings with the FEC to rename its principal committee and declare Harris a candidate for president — meaning Harris could take control of the Biden-Harris campaign account, which had nearly $96 million cash in hand at the end of June. However, newly filed campaign reports show the Trump team entered July and the general election showdown with a bigger war chest of available cash. Still, Trump on Sunday issued an urgent fundraising appeal calling on donations from “one million pro-Trump patriots.” The message blasted out via text said: “If we’re going to win back the White House, it will all be because of the momentum we built at this very moment — right here, right now!”

CNN_32,A boy was found wandering on a North Carolina road. A police dog helped reunite him with his family,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/22/us/north-carolina-boy-found-k9/index.html,2024-07-22 18:05:00,us,"
            On July 7, emergency dispatchers in North Carolina received a call from a passerby that a child was walking by himself on a Union County road.
    

            When deputies responded, they were unable to locate the child’s home or parents due to the boy being both autistic and non-verbal, according to a release from the Union County Sheriff’s Office.

            It was then that bloodhound Remi and his handler, Deputy B. Belk, decided to try a “reverse” K-9 track – something “out of the norm” for a K9 to do, Lieutenant Public Information Officer James Maye told CNN.
    

            “Normally, they track from where a person left to try to find where that person is currently. This time we were doing it reverse,” Maye said.
    

            To obtain the child’s scent for Remi to track, Belk used “a piece of sterile gauze to collect the scent from (the child’s) forearms and the back of his neck,” the sheriff’s office said. In about 15 minutes, Remi was able to lead the child back home, about a half mile away in a nearby neighborhood.
    

            When deputies arrived, the home’s garage door was open and they determined the boy, approximately six years old, left “in a secretive manner that would not have alerted his parents.”
    

            The deputies found there was no criminal offense and left tips to help the family prevent a similar incident from happening again, the sheriff’s office said.
    

            Now that deputies have seen Remi and other dogs can do this, the technique will be implemented in future K-9 training. “I’ve been around for 10 or 12 years. I’ve never heard anything like this being done. It’s not something that these guys train on normally, but it is something they’re going to instill in training from here on out,” Maye said.

            Remi is just one year old and has been with the department since he was a puppy. He was trained internally by its canine handler, Maye said.

CNN_33,"Ryanair, Europe’s biggest airline, says airfares will be ‘materially lower’ this summer",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/22/business/ryanair-fares-lower-summer/index.html,2024-07-22 18:31:00,us,"
            Ryanair said Monday that it expects airfares during the busy summer travel season to be “materially lower” than last year as the low-cost carrier reported a plunge in profits.
    

            Europe’s biggest airline by passenger numbers, comparable in size to Delta Air Lines in the United States, said its average fare fell nearly 15% in the April-to-June quarter from the same period in 2023, to €41.93 ($45.65) from €49.07 ($53.42).
    

            Ryanair (RYAAY) attributed that dip in the first quarter of its financial year, in part, to the timing of the Easter break this year, some of which fell over March.
    

            “While Q2 demand is strong, pricing remains softer than we expected, and we now expect Q2 fares to be materially lower than last summer,” Ryanair’s chief executive Michael O’Leary said in a statement, referring to the crucial July-September period. The airline previously thought fares would be “flat to modestly up,” he added.
    

            In a call with investors Monday, Neil Sorahan, the airline’s chief financial officer, said there was “a bit of push back” on fares from consumers, who were spending more cautiously, according to a Reuters report.

            Ryanair reported a 46% fall in profits in the first quarter of the year, to €360 million ($392 million), despite a 10% rise in the number of passengers.
    

            Shares in the airline were trading more than 15% down at 6.20 a.m. ET, with other European airlines also feeling the chill. Shares in British carrier EasyJet were down 8%, and IAG, which owns several airlines including British Airways, had shed 4.4% by the same time.
    

            Ryanair’s latest forecast for fares contrasts with its warning some five months ago that it might have to raise them as much as 10% during the summer, partly because of delays in aircraft deliveries by crisis-hit Boeing.
    

            Boeing has been battling a raft of safety and quality concerns in recent months. In January a piece of fuselage on a 737 Max 9 plane, operated by Alaska Airlines, blew out mid-flight. Since then, further problems have come to light with some 737s, disrupting Boeing’s production schedule.
    

            On Monday, Ryanair said its passenger numbers increased to 55.5 million in the first quarter “despite multiple Boeing delivery delays.” But it also noted that it had seen “an improvement in the quality and frequency” of deliveries from the airplane maker during that period.
    

            For the entire financial year, which runs until the end of March 2025, Ryanair expects its passenger numbers to grow to around 200 million from 184 million — that’s comparable to the roughly 190 million passengers that took Delta flights last year.

CNN_34,It’s becoming harder to get — and keep — a car,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/22/economy/car-loan-repos-rejections/index.html,2024-07-22 18:00:00,us,"
            When Greg Cook’s car of 12 years, a 2010 Honda Fit, up and quit on him in May 2022, he knew it would land him “between a rock and a hard place.”
    

            He couldn’t afford to go without a car: He knew he’d be out of work soon — federal funding ran out for the Covid-19 response position he held for two years — and that the job hunt would be challenging because he relocated to a smaller, more affordable (but more remote) town in Oregon after losing his steady performing arts job to the pandemic.
    

            “When I’m filling out an application, one of the questions I’ve noticed is, ‘Do you have reliable transportation to get to and from work?’ ‘Can you commute?’” said Cook, 56.
    

            But without consistent work, he feared he couldn’t afford a car.
    

            Cook did the math, made a pros and cons list, and bought a new car. He locked in a low rate, but that was one of the few bright spots: Since that time, not only have the dozens of jobs applications been unfruitful; but Cook, like many other Americans, was slammed by exponentially rising prices.
    

            His car — the monthly payment, the fast-rising insurance, fuel and maintenance costs — takes up a 30% share of his monthly budget.
    

            Still, he can’t afford to lose it, so he’s using what odd jobs he picks up and the savings he built for a rainy day to keep current on the six-year loan.
    

            “It’s sort of like grabbing a few pennies out of a piggy bank every few days and eventually that piggy bank weighs a little lighter,” he said. “And there seem to be more days ahead than there are pennies.”
    

            Cars or trucks are lifelines for many Americans, but after three-plus years of painfully high inflation and now a slowing economy, they’ve become liabilities.
    

Delinquencies are climbing at rates not seen since the Great Recession, defaults have grown and repossessions have jumped 23% from last year, new Cox Automotive data shows.
    

            And buying a car is no cakewalk either: Credit is increasingly harder to come by and rejection rates are spiking.
    

            Fewer people are applying for credit and an increasing share are being rejected, according to the June credit access survey released last week by Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
    

            The survey, which is conducted every four months, found that the credit application rate slipped to 41.2% in June from 43.4% in February and the overall rejection rate increased to 21.4% from 18.7%.
    
Outgoing president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Loretta Mester speaks to Richard Quest about her outlook for interest rates.

            While the increase was broad-based across age groups and credit scores, the area seeing the biggest spike in rejection rates was auto loans, which shot to 18.5%, its highest on record.
    

            The one-two punch of elevated inflation and decades-high interest rates — the latter being a Federal Reserve-induced antidote for the former — have diminished consumers’ appetites for loans on many big-ticket items.
    

            That’s certainly been visible in the automotive industry, where loan originations were down year-over-year throughout 2023, said Jeremy Robb, senior director of economic and industry insights at Cox Automotive.
    

            Car sales did pick up a little bit in the first quarter of this year, he said, “but not a whole lot.”
    

            “Everyone’s been waiting and hoping to see interest rates come down,” he said. “And I think we got a little bit of a head fake early this year — we thought inflation was coming down more quickly — and people thought rates would come down, but that didn’t really happen.”
    

            One favorable development for the car shopper has been falling prices, especially for used cars, Robb said.
    

            Vehicle prices soared in 2021 amid fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic and its jumbling of global supply chains. In their case, the semiconductor chip shortage (a result of manufacturers reassigning capacity to consumer tech because the auto factories shuttered amid the pandemic and lower demand) led to limited production of enough cars to meet the sharp rebound in consumer demand.
    

            Although slightly cheaper cars help the affordability equation for consumers and could stir up interest, that doesn’t necessarily mean that lenders are more willing. Instead, consumers have been presented with a higher bar, including requirements for a heftier down payment and a higher credit score, he said.
    

            More restrictive lending typically equates to approval rates going down and rejection rates rising.
    

            “Lenders are wary of consumer balance sheets and just the overall economy,” he said. “Most economic trends have been OK, but they’re not great … Lenders don’t want to lend to people if they’re fearful they won’t get their money back.”
    

            Job growth has remained steady, but the unemployment rate has ticked up for three consecutive months and was at 4.1% in June, its highest since November 2021.
    

            Through the first half of this year, car repossessions are up 23% from the first six months of 2023 and 14% from 2019 levels, according to Cox Automotive data released earlier this month.
    

            Such a spike, while unnerving, might not appear as foreboding as it seems, Robb said.
    

            When the pandemic hit and fiscal stimulus flowed freely in the early months to help prop up American households and the broader economy, consumers were able to stay current on their bills. And many lenders were more amenable to working with customers who fell behind.
    

            As the economy recovered, repossessions started picking back up and returning to pre-pandemic levels.
    

            “I don’t want to diminish the fact that repossessions are higher and default rates are higher and delinquencies on automotive loan payments are also higher,” he said. “But a lot of the trends we’re seeing have gotten back a little bit toward normal.”
    

            Delinquencies have accelerated at a much greater pace, nearing what was seen during the Great Recession; however, defaults haven’t shown as steep a rise, Robb said.
    

            “There are more people who clearly find a way to make the payments that they’re behind on and get current some way on their loan so that they don’t default,” he said.

            A British-Canadian couple who were attempting to sail across the Atlantic have been found dead on an island off the east coast of Canada.
    

            Brett Clibbery, 70, and his wife, Sarah Packwood, 60, had been sailing on their 42-foot sailboat the SV Theros, but their bodies were found in a lifeboat that washed up on Sable Island, Nova Scotia, according to a statement from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), published July 12.
    

            The couple left Halifax Harbour, Nova Scotia on June 11 en route to the Azores, a group of Portuguese islands in the mid-Atlantic, around 2,000 miles away.

            They were reported missing on June 18 and their bodies were found on July 10.
    

            It is not clear why the couple abandoned the Theros and got into a lifeboat. An investigation is ongoing, the RCMP said.
    

            CNN has contacted the RCMP for comment.
    

            Sable Island is a 27-mile long sandbar around 186 miles southeast of Halifax. It is known as “the graveyard of the Atlantic” and there have been more than 350 recorded shipwrecks there since 1583, according to the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic.
    

            Clibbery’s son James paid tribute to his father and Packwood in a post on Facebook.
    

            “They were amazing people, and there isn’t anything that will fill the hole that has been left by their, so far unexplained passing,” he wrote.
    

            “Living will not be the same without your wisdom, and your wife was quickly becoming a beacon of knowledge, and kindness. I miss your smiles. I miss your voices. You will be forever missed.”
    

            Clibbery and Packwood described themselves as adventure travelers and documented their trips on a YouTube channel named Theros Adventures.

            The ill-fated voyage was part of what the couple called their “Green Odyssey,” which Clibbery said was intended to show that it is possible to travel long distances without burning fossil fuels.
    

            “We have an electric boat,” said Clibbery in a video posted on YouTube on May 13. “We charge the engine with solar panels.”
    

            The couple met by chance at a bus stop in London in 2015 when Clibbery was in Britain to donate a kidney to his sister, they told The Guardian newspaper in an article published in 2020.
    

            The pair met every day for the few weeks after their first encounter, before Clibbery helped Packwood to care for her dying mother and she then looked after him after his kidney operation.
    

            They stayed in touch after Clibbery moved back to Canada and Packwood visited him in Salt Spring Island near Vancouver, where the Theros was docked, in spring 2016.
    

            “He took me on my first ever yacht trip and I loved it,” Packwood told The Guardian. “Brett proposed to me in the main cabin of the boat.”

CNN_38,Oscar Piastri wins his first ever F1 Grand Prix in Hungary in tense race highlighted by McLaren team drama,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/22/sport/oscar-piastri-hungary-grand-prix-f1-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-22 18:47:00,world,"
            Australia’s Oscar Piastri won his maiden Formula One Grand Prix on Sunday, but probably not in the circumstances he would have dreamed.
    

            The McLaren driver qualified second and snatched the lead at the start of the Hungarian Grand Prix from teammate Lando Norris and looked set to take claim victory after driving a commanding race.
    

            However, Norris came in for his second pit stop earlier than Piastri, ‘undercutting’ his teammate and eventually emerging ahead after the Aussie had pitted three laps later.
    

            McLaren’s plan appeared to be to allow Piastri to pass Norris and retake the lead that he had earned once he caught up him using his fresher tires, but he was unable to close the gap. Norris meanwhile resisted calls from his race engineer to slow down and let Piastri past, knowing that he had the pace advantage in the latter stages of the race.
    

            It seemed as though McLaren was headed towards an embarrassing intra-team conflict that likely would have been avoided by simply pitting Piastri first, but Norris eventually eased up to let Piastri through on lap 68 of 70 to give McLaren its first one-two finish since 2021.
    

            Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton crossed the line in third to claim a record-extending 200th career podium.
    

            Though the celebrations felt somewhat subdued, it was still a career milestone for Piastri.
    

            “It’s very, very special,” said the 23-year-old. “This is really the day I dreamed of as a kid, standing on the top step of an F1 podium.
    

            “Obviously, a bit complicated at the end, but I put myself in the right position at the start, and thank you to the team for an amazing effort and amazing car.”
    

            Piastri won a sprint race in Qatar last season, though Sunday marked his first official Grand Prix victory, becoming the fifth Australian to achieve the feat. He is also the first driver born in the 2000s to win a race.
    

            He admitted that the last few laps made him “nervous” and lamented his lack of pace in the latter stages of the race, but said that he “was still in the right position to make it happen, so well-executed from the team.”
    

            It was a frustrating day for Norris, who saw the lead slip away at the start of the race after qualifying on pole position, before being forced to hand P1 over to his teammate.
    

            His race engineer, Will Joseph, pleaded with him over team radio for multiple laps, urging him to “do the right thing” before Norris eventually gave in.
    

            “It’s tough, but I know what Oscar’s done for me in the past,” said the Briton. “I think this is a little bit different but, yeah, at the same time, I got told to let him past and I did. It’s always tough when you’re fighting for a win, and a win means so much to me and also to him.
    

            “Yeah, I just had to try put myself in his shoes and understand it that way. Every driver’s selfish and you have to be selfish in this game, but when you’re just thinking of your own benefits, you’re only thinking of the good things. But, of course, I put myself in his shoes and I realized I had to do what was right.”
    

            Norris – who also congratulated Piastri on his win – won his first Grand Prix in Miami earlier this year and closed the gap on championship leader Max Verstappen, who was involved in one of the race’s most dramatic moments.
    

            Chasing Hamilton for third, he made contact with his long-time rival after locking up and going too deep into turn one, briefly vaulting the rear of his car into the air.
    

            This came after several heated radio exchanges of his own, with the Dutchman expressing his frustration at his lack of pace and what he believed was a poor strategy from his Red Bull team. He eventually finished fifth behind Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc.
    

            Verstappen said after the race that he had no intention of apologizing to his team for his rant and that the group should focus on improving.
    

            “I don’t think we need to apologize,” he said. “We just need to do a better job. I don’t know why people think that you cannot be vocal on the radio. This is a sport, you know? If some people don’t like that, then stay home.”

            Portugal’s Nuno Borges played the match of his life to comfortably beat Rafael Nadal 6-3 6-2 in the final of the Swedish Open and claim the first ATP title of his career.
    

            Borges’ victory in his maiden ATP Tour final – against Nadal on clay, no less – lifts him to a career high of No. 42 in the world.
    

            “I don’t know what to say. I think I was wishing for this moment for a while already,” Borges said in his post-match interview, per the ATP.
    

            “It’s crazy, in tennis, it doesn’t happen when you expect it sometimes. I know we all wanted Rafa to win, a part of me wished that too, but something even bigger inside of me really pushed through today. Through all the emotions, through all the ups and downs.
    

            “It wasn’t about playing my best tennis, it was just coming up in the big moments where I wanted, and I couldn’t have played better. I’m just really happy overall. I really don’t know what to say, I’m very emotional.”
    

            Nadal, who climbs 100 places to world No. 161, was playing in his first final since the 2022 French Open, but two mammoth three-set victories in the previous two rounds had perhaps taken their toll on the 38-year-old.
    

            The Spaniard has struggled with injuries in recent years and previously said this season would likely be his last on tour. However, Nadal revealed after losing in the first round of the French Open that he is open to continuing his career should his body continue to improve.
    

Nadal skipped Wimbledon this year to avoid switching to grass in order to have longer to prepare for the Paris Olympics, which will be played on the Roland Garros clay.
    

            The 22-time grand slam champion is due to compete in the singles and doubles with defending French Open and Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz.
    

            The Olympic tennis tournament begins on July 27 in Paris.

CNN_40,Faith Kipyegon on motherhood and the quest for history,https://edition.cnn.com/sport/faith-kipyegon-motherhood-paris-olympics-spc/index.html,2024-07-22 17:22:00,world,"
            In northern Kenya, under a sunny May sky that offers a rare respite during the worst rainy season in recent memory, Faith Kipyegon pursues a singular goal: “It’s history I’m looking for,” she says.
    

            But for the 30-year-old middle distance superstar, success is no longer simply measured in medals and records; it’s also about the profound journey of motherhood and her status as one of track and field’s greatest role models.
    

            Having won a gold medal in the 1,500m at the 2016 Rio Olympics, Kipyegon’s return to the pinnacle of athletics after the birth of her daughter, Alyn, in 2018, has been nothing short of spectacular. Training in Kaptagat, a highland haven for elite athletes, alongside marathon legend Eliud Kipchoge, she prepares for the Paris Olympics with unwavering focus. Yet her daily grind is enriched and challenged by the joys and responsibilities of motherhood.
    

            “She changed my life and my mentality,” Kipyegon says of her daughter. “I now realize that I have someone who looks up to me as a role model.” This shift in perspective has fueled her drive, leading her to another Olympic gold, at the 2020 Tokyo Games, and three world titles.
    

            In 2023, Kipyegon cemented her legacy as one of the greatest middle-distance runners of all time, breaking three world records across three different distances (1,500m, 1 mile, 5,000m) in less than two months — all while raising her daughter.
    

            Kipyegon and a string of top athletes are continuing to prove that elite sport and motherhood are not incompatible. “[Jamaican sprinter] Shelly Ann Fraser Pryce came back after maternity leave, and [US runner] Allison Felix, and we met in Tokyo at the 2021 Olympic Games,” she recalls.
    

            At those Games, Felix won a gold and a bronze and Fraser-Pryce won silver to become the most decorated 100m sprinter in Olympic history. “I think we motivate young women to know that you can go on maternity leave and come back stronger than before,” Kipyegon suggests. “They realize that it’s not the end of your life, but it can be the beginning of your life.”
    

            Training with Kipchoge, a mentor and friend, has given Kipyegon a new perspective on running and pushed her to new heights, “I don’t know how to express it, he’s just a unique athlete,” Kipyegon says.
    

            “I have grown as an elite athlete and as a person. To be alongside Eliud all of the time and to hear what he’s saying about motivation and about hard work … I think it has really changed my mindset and changed my goals,” she says.
    

            Having spent much of the 2024 season recovering from a soft tissue injury, Kipyegon returned to action at the Kenyan Olympic trials in June, winning both the 1,500m and 5,000m races. She followed that up on July 7 at a Diamond League meet in Paris with a performance that defied belief, breaking her own 1,500m world record with a time of 3:49.04 (she remains the only woman to have run below 3:50).
    

            “Everybody expects you to perform well and to be on top of the world,” she says, reflecting on whether she’s feeling any pressure to defend her Olympic title. “It’s a big event and everybody’s dreaming of getting that gold medal — well Faith is also dreaming of getting that gold medal.”
    

            Kipyegon’s story is not just about athletic prowess; it is a testament to resilience and inspiration. The eighth of nine children, she grew up in the rural village of Ndabibit, in western Kenya, walking and jogging several miles to and from school each day.
    

            She shot to prominence in 2011, aged 17, when she won the World Junior Cross Country Championships, running barefoot. Those beginnings laid the foundation for her view that true success stems from within. “It’s mentality, the hard work you put in and being patient, I think that drive the success of an elite athlete,” she says.
    

            As she gears up for Paris, Kipyegon is acutely aware of the significance of her quest to win a third consecutive gold in one event, a feat only a handful of athletes in any sport have achieved. “Going to Paris and remembering the history I’ve talked about and getting that gold medal, it’ll be a huge history for me,” she says.
    

            Kipyegon carries with her the hopes of a nation famed for its running stars, and the legacy of countless runners who have paved the way. “I am always proud to represent Kenya,” she says. “It’s heritage, the many athletes we have from around our country … To wear the Kenya singlet, it’s really beautiful and magical.”
    

            With the Olympic Games upon us, Kipyegon stands poised to etch her name in the annals of sports history. Her journey from a young girl running barefoot to an Olympic champion is proof that with resilience, dedication and a bit of Faith, anything is possible.

CNN_41,Eliud Kipchoge: The two-hour marathon man has unprecedented Olympic glory at his feet,https://edition.cnn.com/sport/eliud-kipchoge-profile-paris-olympics-spc/index.html,2024-07-22 17:17:00,world,"
            It’s 5:55am on a wet May morning in northern Kenya. The sun is yet to rise, but a group of runners emerge from a mud path onto the side of a road. They briefly pause, each tightening laces or adjusting a watch; then, without warning, the group sets off into the darkness at a blistering pace. Soon all evidence of them has disappeared, save for their shoe prints in the dirt.
    

            This is what Olympic preparation looks like for arguably the greatest distance runner of all time, Eliud Kipchoge.
    

            The run concludes 30 kilometers later, back where it began, at the training camp where the 39-year-old is gearing up for what could be his final bow on the Olympic stage. Kipchoge stands, once again, on the precipice of history, aiming to be the first person to secure three gold medals in one of the most iconic Olympic disciplines, the marathon.
    

            The training camp set up by Kipchoge and his management team Global Sports Communication feels more to the tastes of Rocky Balboa than Ivan Drago. There are few modern comforts and little more than a small TV room and the company of their fellow athletes to keep the residents occupied.
    

            “Discipline is sacrificial of personal pleasures,” Kipchoge tells CNN, reflecting on the daily routine that has shaped his adult life. “I always wake up at 5:45 in the morning, for the last 22 years, and that’s what discipline has meant to my mind.”
    

            Perhaps the biggest sacrifice for Kipchoge is time spent away from his wife Grace and their three children when he’s in camp. “It’s really difficult, but all in all, Grace has adapted well … my family and kids are the reason I wake up in the morning, without them I would be a much lesser person,” Kipchoge told NNRunningTeam.com in a 2022 interview.
    

            Kipchoge’s commitment and daily acts of discipline have been the bedrock of his success, building a mental strength that he believes is paramount in the marathon. “The mind is what drives the body,” he asserts. “If the driver is lazy and if the driver doesn’t have enough energy to drive you, then you cannot go anywhere.”
    

            Kipchoge racks up around 200-220 kilometers in training every week. His schedule features track and road sessions, alongside a group of elite training partners, all under the watchful eye of his long-time coach, Patrick Sang.
    

            The intense routine is fueled by a diet of traditional Kenyan food, including the fabled ugali,  a carbohydrate made from maize flour and water.
    

            For Kipchoge, recovery is just as crucial as training. “After a long run, I sometimes take an ice bath, then just relax for another two-and-a-half hours, have a massage, lunch, and an afternoon sleep,” he explains. With so much riding on Paris, life here has been stripped back to the basics.
    

            Middle distance superstar Faith Kipyegon has trained alongside Kipchoge since 2019. “To be alongside Eliud every day and hearing what he’s saying about motivation and about the hard work we always put in, early in the morning, and going for a run together and just enjoying sport together, I think it has really changed my mind set and changed my goals,” she says.
    

            Eliud Kipchoge is no stranger to rewriting history. In 2019, in Vienna, he shattered one of the most formidable barriers in sports by becoming the first person to run a marathon in under two hours. “Breaking the two-hour (mark) was great for me, in making history and telling the world that we are not limited at all in any barrier, in any profession.”
    

            This achievement was a group effort, reflecting Kipchoge’s philosophy that running, traditionally seen as an individual sport, thrives on teamwork. “We had a great team in Vienna, from the technical team to athletes, coaches, and performance staff,” he says. “We bring our minds together, we think together, and we make history together.”
    

            With the Games upon us, Kipchoge remains laser-focused on clinching his third consecutive gold medal in the marathon. “My goal is to win for the third time. My goal is still to run and inspire the next generation,” he says. This pursuit is not just about personal achievement but about demonstrating the power of longevity and dedication in sports.
    

            For Kipchoge, the Olympics are also a platform for showcasing Kenyan excellence and promoting the country’s image globally. “Olympics is the soft spot to meet world leaders in sport and politics, and to sell our country,” he says, highlighting the broader impact of his participation. “This is the soft power, for us to tell people what’s inside Kenya.”
    

            Historically, Kipchoge says, not enough has been done to leverage the positive image that Kenyan athletes are projecting around the globe. “After huge success in the Olympics, I think it’s high time for politicians to use the platform for development, to sell the country.”
    

            After weeks of protests in the country, and with political and social tensions escalating, the Olympics could arrive at a crucial moment for Kenya, leveraging the unique power of sport to unite the nation.
    

            Eliud Kipchoge’s influence extends far beyond his sporting accolades. A deep thinker, he has addressed the Oxford Union, met with presidents and worked tirelessly to develop his foundation, which aims to give more children across the world access to education. His story is one of breaking boundaries, rewriting what we thought humanly possible.
    

            Like many athletes coming towards the end of a glittering career, the question of how he will be remembered isn’t far from Kipchoge’s mind. His legacy, built on the foundations of discipline, teamwork and an unyielding pursuit of excellence, promises to endure long after he hangs up his running shoes. “I want to be remembered by making this world a running world,” he says. And through his unparalleled achievements, irrespective of the result in Paris, Eliud Kipchoge is well on his way to doing just that.

CNN_42,Hundreds of US flights are canceled for the 4th straight day. Here’s the latest on the global tech outage,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/22/us/microsoft-power-outage-crowdstrike-it/index.html,2024-07-22 19:32:00,us,"
            Hundreds of US flights were canceled early Monday, as airlines work to recover four days after a global tech outage caused massive delays and left travelers stranded at airports around the nation.
    

            More than 700 flights into, within or out of the United States were canceled by 7:30 a.m. ET Monday, and more than 800 flights were delayed, according to flight tracking site FlightAware.
    

            While most airlines have brought their cancellation numbers down, more than 600 of Monday’s canceled flights were from Delta Air Lines, according to FlightAware.
    

            Delta declined to comment on the numbers, but in an update to customers Sunday afternoon, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said the company is working to restore operations after the outage.
    

            The “largest IT outage in history” – prompted by a software update for Microsoft devices late Thursday into the early hours of Friday – brought down computers and technical systems across the world, causing disorder at airports, outages for 911 services and challenges at health care facilities.
    

            “In particular one of our crew tracking-related tools was affected and unable to effectively process the unprecedented number of changes triggered by the system shutdown,” Bastian said in the statement.
    

            The outage affected an estimated 8.5 million Windows devices – less than one percent of all Windows machines, according to a Saturday blog post from Microsoft. But the effects were ubiquitous, with airlines, banks, businesses, schools and governments, along with some health and emergency services, across the world affected.
    

            Costs from the outage could top $1 billion, Patrick Anderson, CEO of Anderson Economic Group, told CNN. But it’s unclear if – and how – any customers affected will be compensated.
    

            Here’s what we know about the outage and its continued effects.
    

            The outage was related to a software update rolled out by CrowdStrike, a major US cybersecurity firm. The software – used by numerous Fortune 500 companies, including major global banks, health care and energy companies, as well as by the US government –detects and blocks hacking threats.

What is CrowdStrike, the company linked to the global outage?


            CrowdStrike told customers early Friday the outages were caused by “a defect found in a single content update of its software on Microsoft Windows operating systems,” according to a post on X from CEO George Kurtz. The issue was identified and isolated, and engineers deployed an update to fix the problem, Kurtz said.
    

            The company’s engineers took action to address the problem, according to an advisory viewed by CNN, which told customers to reboot their computers and perform other actions if they were still having technical issues. The issue is specific to Falcon, one of CrowdStrike’s main software products, and is not impacting Mac or Linux operating systems, according to the advisory. Crowdstrike says Falcon is designed to protect files saved in the cloud.
    

            The company said the outage was not caused by a security incident or a cyberattack.
    

            Kurtz later apologized to customers and said the company is “deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption.”
    

            In an update posted to LinkedIn late Sunday, CrowdStrike said “a significant number” of the 8.5 million devices were back online and operational.
    

            On Sunday, more than 1,800 US flights were canceled and more than 9,900 delayed, according to FlightAware. Major hotels, including Marriott International and some Hiltons, were impacted both in regard to payment processing and delays to check in-processes.
    

            US-based carriers American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Allegiant Airlines, SunCountry and Frontier Airlines all reported issues on Friday.
    

            American Airlines said Friday morning it was able to “safely re-establish” operations. By Friday night, United said “most of our systems have recovered,” but cautioned there may still be some flight delays or cancellations as a result of the issues.
    

            Delta Airlines paused all its flights Friday morning while its systems were offline, and more than 3,500 Delta and Delta Connection flights were cancelled through Saturday, according to the airline. More than 1,200 Delta flights were canceled on Sunday, after the carrier canceled 1,208 flights on Saturday, according to FlightAware.


            Delta also announced that it would not be allowing unaccompanied minors to travel until July 24 due to the outage.
    

            Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg spoke with Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian Sunday afternoon as the air carrier continues to struggle with a high number of flight cancellations, according to the department.

            “We continue to receive reports of unacceptable disruptions and customer service conditions at Delta Air Lines, including hundreds of complaints filed with our Department. I have made clear to Delta that we expect the airline to provide prompt refunds to consumers who choose not to be rebooked, and free rebooking and timely reimbursements for food and overnight hotel stays to consumers affected by the delays and cancellations, as well as adequate customer service assistance to all of their passengers,” Buttigieg said in a statement.
    

            Other airlines were getting back on track over the weekend, including one of the world’s largest operators, Turkish Airlines, which said Saturday, “The global technical issue has been resolved. All our operations have returned to normal.”
    

            The same day, Jetstar Japan, Hong Kong Express and Cebu Pacific airlines said their operations are gradually being restored after disruptions due to the global tech outage.
    

            Even with the flawed computer update rolled back, it’s not a quick fix for airlines, which have computers at thousands of gates that will need to be individually rebooted, David Kennedy, cofounder of cybersecurity company Binary Defense, told CNN on Saturday.
    

            “It’s not just as simple as rebooting. There’s a lot more steps and complexities in this that are involved,” Kennedy said. “There’s just not enough people at those airports, at those locations to go and do it.”
    

            Amid the travel chaos, Buttigieg said earlier in a social media post Saturday he received reports of some airlines only offering flight credits to passengers for canceled flights.
    

            “Let me be clear — you are entitled to get your money back promptly if your flight is canceled and you don’t take a rebooking,” Buttigieg said.
    

            The widespread usage of CrowdStrike’s software meant the outage penetrated numerous industries, including emergency communications, government services and health care.

            Large hospital systems, including Mass General Brigham in Massachusetts, Penn Medicine in Pennsylvania, Mount Sinai Health System in New York all reported Friday they were affected by the outage.
    

            Emory Healthcare in Atlanta said it had delayed “procedures at ambulatory surgical centers and hospitals are delayed until our systems are stabilized.”
    

            Some cancer centers, including Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and New York’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, also paused certain procedures and scheduled appointments.
    

            Several blood banks likewise experienced disruptions.
    

            And in a few areas, including Arizona and Alaska, 911 services were briefly disrupted before being restored.
    

            Government agencies, including Social Security offices and local Department of Motor Vehicles offices, also temporarily paused their operations due to the outage.
    

            Public transportation in Washington, DC, and Pennsylvania were also affected by the outage but restored operations Friday.
    

            And mail carriers UPS and FedEx said while they remained operational, they expected service delays Friday.

CNN_43,Global markets rise after Biden exit,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/22/investing/global-markets-rise-in-bidens-wake/index.html,2024-07-22 19:51:00,us,"
            Global markets made solid gains after President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential election Sunday and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.
    

            European stocks saw an uptick and premarket trading in the US was higher following Biden’s announcement.
    

            Dow futures rose 40 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures were up 0.5% and Nasdaq future were 0.8% higher. European markets were higher, and Asian markets closed mostly lower. US Treasuries rose slightly early Monday, trimming yields, and the dollar was softer against major currencies.
    

            Significant doubt about Biden’s ability to beat former President Donald Trump led Wall Street to begin to price in a Trump victory in November. That became apparent with so-called Trump trades, in which investors bought up stocks they believed Trump’s tariff-heavy agenda could benefit — and they likewise sold off stocks related to green energy and other industries traders believed Trump’s policies could hurt.

Biden drops out of presidential race and endorses Harris


            Meanwhile, a large number of economists have predicted Trump’s policies would make America’s inflation problem worse, and he would balloon the US deficit. As Trump’s fortunes appeared to advance in recent weeks, US Treasury prices fell and yields rose, which they often do in anticipation of higher inflation.
    

            With the Democratic party now apparently coalescing around Vice President Kamala Harris as its likely nominee, some of those Trump trades could begin to unwind — or at least go on hiatus until new polling begins to show whether or not Harris appears to stand a better chance against Trump than Biden did.
    

            With fewer than 100 days until the US election in November, Sunday’s upheaval could have sent uncertain investors into a worry spiral. But “the fact that Biden endorsed Kamala Harris reduces uncertainty,” said Jay Hatfield, CEO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors. He expects a muted market reaction instead.
    

            “There may be a small unwinding of the Trump trade on Monday as Vice President Harris is perceived to have a slightly better chance of winning,” Hatfield added.
    

            Last week was exceptionally rough for markets. The S&P 500 notched its worst three-day performance of 2024 and Europe’s STOXX 600 logged its worst weekly performance since October.
    

            Some analysts worry that market churn could continue as we get closer to the election.
    

            “Markets are increasingly focused on the US presidential election in November,” wrote Deutsche Bank’s Henry in a research note on Monday. “But there’s heightened uncertainty about the outcome, particularly after President Biden has just become the first incumbent President to withdraw since Lyndon Johnson in 1968.”
    

            Moreover, the S&P 500 has declined in every September since 2020, he noted. Over the last three years, September was the worst month of the year for the index.
    

            Still, markets remain unusually strong. The S&P 500 has been higher for 28 of the last 38 weeks, something we haven’t seen exceeded since 1989.
    

Stocks tumbled toward the end of last week as a turbulent election cycle and a global tech outage rocked technology stocks in particular.

            Five people were killed after a gunman entered a home for the elderly in Croatia on Monday and opened fire, according to the country’s public broadcaster.
    

            A man with a firearm entered a private home for the elderly in the town of Daruvar, about 75 miles east of the capital Zagreb, and opened fire on the people who were present, Croatian Radiotelevision (HRT) reported.
    

            Five of the victims died immediately and the number of injured is still unknown, according to HRT. State news agency HINA has reported that some of those injured are still receiving medical assistance.
    

            The gunman ran away but was later arrested near a cafe, according to HINA.
    

            The investigation is ongoing and police have not provided additional details, HRT said.
    

            “We are appalled by the murder of five people” in the home for the elderly, Croatia’s Prime Minister Andrej Plenković said in a post on social media.
    

            “We express our condolences to the families of the victims and hope for the recovery of the wounded. I expect the competent authorities to determine all the circumstances of the terrible crime,” Plenković said.
    

            Croatia’s Deputy Prime Minister Davor Božinović, Minister of Health Vili Beroš, and social policy minister Marin Piletić are travelling to Daruvar, the prime minister added.

CNN_45,Why Delta is still canceling flights as other airlines return to normal,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/22/business/delta-canceled-flights-computer-problems/index.html,2024-07-22 20:45:00,us,"
            Three days after a computer update problem caused more than 5,000 flight cancellations around the world, things are pretty much back to normal — except at Delta Air Lines.
    

            Atlanta-based Delta canceled 1,500 flights on Friday, or more than a third of its schedule. That’s more than any other airline in the world, according to flight tracking service FlightAware. It grounded nearly 3,000 more flights over the weekend, and early Monday had already canceled 700 more flights, or about 60% of flights canceled by all airlines worldwide. Most other US airlines had only 1% of its flights canceled, compared to roughly one out of every six scheduled Delta flights.
    

            In a note to customers Sunday, Delta CEO Ed Bastian apologized for the disruptions and attributed the problem to the computer program affecting its “crew tracking” software.
    

            “One of our crew tracking-related tools was affected and unable to effectively process the unprecedented number of changes triggered by the system shutdown,” he wrote in a note to customers. “Our teams have been working around the clock to recover and restore full functionality.”
    

            While many airlines large and small had the CrowdStrike problem affect computers that were supposed to check in passengers, it appeared that Delta might have been the one airline that had its crucial crew scheduling software affected.
    

            The problems with the flight groundings and delays produced nightmares for travelers throughout the weekend. And they were only one part of the “largest IT outage in history” that was caused by the CrowdStrike, which shut down an estimated 8.5 million computers running Windows software worldwide, disrupting hospital operations, package deliveries, banking and retail transactions.
    

            CrowdStrike said late Sunday that “a significant number” of those affected computers “are back online and operational.” But in the case of affected airlines, it is not just computers that need to be fixed. It can take longer to get crews needed to fly planes in the right cities to again staff flights.
    

            The problems at Delta are similar to the problems that occurred at Southwest Airlines over the end-of-year holiday travel period in 2022 when it had to cancel nearly 17,000 flights over the course of more than a week. In that instance the problem was attributed to its crew scheduling system, which Southwest unions criticized as “antiquated” and which Southwest executives vowed to fix in the wake of the service meltdown.

CNN_46,Venice tourism tax nets millions for the city,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/22/travel/venice-tourism-tax-millions-raised/index.html,2024-07-22 20:20:00,world,"
            Venice officials have hailed a temporary entrance fee to the city a success, as they experiment with measures aimed at controlling the number of people who come to visit.
    

            A 29-day €5 reservation entrance fee and reservation experiment, which began on April 25 and ran on selected days until July 14, brought in €2,425,310 (around $2.64 million), according to Venice mayor Luigi Brugnaro. The city initially expected to collect around €700,000 (about $762,163) when the plan was introduced, the mayor had said in April.
    

            A total of 3,618,114 individuals made reservations, of whom 1,398,084 were exempted from payment because they stayed in hotels.
    

            Other exemptions included 651,254 workers who travelled to the city on days the fee was in place, as well as 466,819 students and 217,589 residents who were not required to pay the entrance fee.
    

            Additionally, 78,224 people were exempted because they were related to residents, and 107,146 were exempted for “other” reasons including being born in the city, religious activities such as the papal visit, and those participating in cultural events, according to data released by the city of Venice.
    

            “From a first reading of the data it appears that day-trippers and tourists prefer Saturday to Sunday, and that during all 29 days of experimentation a peak attendance day, equal to that recorded on 30 April 2023, was not reached,” the city said in a statement, adding that the number of people coming to the city on “red flag days” gradually decreased over time.
    

            “The experiment worked and we can move forward. A more in-depth analysis of the data collected in the autumn,” Brugnaro said at a press conference Friday.
    

            A CNN team on the ground in Venice noted that local residents told them that the crowds seemed noticeably smaller than normal and that while still busy, the local residents felt that crowds leading up to the city’s summer event, the Redeemer Festival, haven’t been as bad as previous years.
    

            The entrance fee officially ended July 14, but the mayor’s office said they will now determine if they should reinstate it during busy times of the year. No official date to do so has yet been announced.

            “It’s a positive balance: The first 29 days of experimentation have finally given the city a tool that has allowed us to know how many people would objectively arrive in Venice and will be able to give us a way to act accordingly,” tourism councillor Simone Venturini said in a statement.
    

            The mayor of Venice and two aides are currently under investigation for corruption tied to allegedly approving a 3.7-million-square-foot commercial property development by a Singapore developer in exchange for $164 million, according to police. Brugnaro has publicly denied the allegations, but one member of the council has resigned. The CNN team noted a banner calling for the mayor to resign.

            NBA legend LeBron James has been selected as Team USA’s male flag bearer for the Opening Ceremony of the Paris Olympic Games, the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee announced on Monday.

            Alongside a female flag bearer who will be announced on Tuesday, James will be front and center in a unique event.
    

            The Opening Ceremony will be held along the River Seine, marking the first time that the ceremony has not taken place inside a stadium. The Parade of Nations – which typically features national delegations of athletes entering the Olympic Stadium on foot – will take place on the water itself, with boats carrying the 10,500 athletes through the center of the city.
    

            The ceremony begins at 1:30 p.m. ET on July 26 and will be broadcast on NBC.
    

            “It’s an incredible honor to represent the United States on this global stage, especially in a moment that can bring the whole world together,” James said in a Team USA statement. “For a kid from Akron, this responsibility means everything to not only myself, but to my family, all the kids in my hometown, my teammates, fellow Olympians and so many people across the country with big aspirations.
    

            “Sports have the power to bring us all together, and I’m proud to be a part of this important moment.”
    

            The 39-year-old was chosen for the role by his fellow US Olympians. Per Team USA, more than 350 athletes (out of the 592 headed to the Games) will participate in the ceremony.
    

            The Los Angeles Lakers superstar is the first male basketball player to carry the American flag and third basketball player to be selected for the honor after Dawn Staley (2004) and Sue Bird (2020).
    

            James will be making his fourth Olympic appearance when he takes to the court in Paris, as he looks to help the USA retain its gold medal in the men’s competition as part of a star-studded squad that features former MVPs Kevin Durant, Steph Curry and Joel Embiid.
    

            The men’s team begins Olympic competition against Serbia on Sunday.
    

            Despite winning all of its warmup games, preparations for Team USA have not always been smooth, with the squad notably being pushed to the final buzzer by South Sudan in a breathless 101-100 victory.
    

            The American delegation will be on the second-to-last boat in the Parade of Nations, as the US will host next Olympics in LA in 2028. They will be followed by 2024 host nation France.

            A ransomware attack has shut down the computer system of the largest trial court in the country, officials with the Superior Court of Los Angeles County said.
    

            The cybersecurity attack began early Friday and is not believed to be related to the faulty CrowdStrike software update that has disrupted airlines, hospitals and governments around the world, officials said in a statement Friday.
    

            The court disabled its computer network systems upon discovery of the attack. A preliminary investigation shows no evidence that users’ data was compromised, according to the statement.
    

            The court system remained closed Monday as it continues to try to recover, CNN affiliate KCAL reported.
    

            The Superior Court of Los Angeles County is the largest unified superior court in the United States, serving the county’s 10 million residents over 36 courthouses. Nearly 1.2 million cases were filed and 2,200 jury trials were conducted in 2022.

CNN_49,Netanyahu’s visit to the US could be crucial to a ceasefire deal. But does he want one?,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/22/middleeast/benjamin-netanyahu-washington-dc-visit-mime-intl/index.html,2024-07-22 21:36:00,world,"
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will land in Washington on Monday to far less fanfare than he would have expected just a day earlier.
    

            His highly-anticipated visit – chock-full of meetings with top US officials and a prized address to Congress – will now undoubtedly be overshadowed by US President Joe Biden’s stunning decision to drop out of the presidential race. But as detailed ceasefire negotiations aimed at turning a framework agreement into a final deal stretch into their third week, Netanyahu’s visit will still be critical to the prospects of a ceasefire in Gaza.
    

            Senior US officials say a deal is within reach, but the prospects of a deal may hinge on the answer to one key question: Does Netanyahu actually want a deal?
    

            The conventional wisdom in Israeli media, politics and on the streets of Tel Aviv would tell you that the answer to that question is no – that Netanyahu has much more to gain by prolonging the war and much more to lose by ending it.

Netanyahu may be forced to choose between his government’s survival and a ceasefire deal


            The war has allowed Netanyahu to delay his share of accountability for the failures leading up to the October 7 attacks, rebuffing calls for new elections with stiff wartime resolve. His party’s prospects in the next election have actually improved in recent months. And the right-wing coalition partners keeping him in power have threatened to bolt if Netanyahu cuts a deal that ends the war.
    

            Even Biden has said “there is every reason” for people to believe Netanyahu is prolonging the war in Gaza in order to stay in power.
    

            There are also indications that Netanyahu is throwing up eleventh-hour obstacles to reaching a deal. He reneged on a key Israeli concession regarding allowing Palestinians unrestricted access to northern Gaza that was included in Israel’s latest ceasefire proposal and now appears to be insisting on Israel maintaining control of the Philadelphi Corridor, a 14km strip of land that serves as a buffer zone on the border between Egypt and Gaza. And publicly, his rhetoric has undermined confidence in Israel’s commitment to reaching a deal that could end the war.
    

            And yet, Netanyahu and his negotiating team have also steadily engaged in negotiations, exchanging proposals with Hamas and bringing the two sides closer than ever to a potential deal. A growing share of the Israeli public, led by hostage families, is demanding the government strike a deal. And Netanyahu’s allies insist he is earnest in his desire to strike a hostage release deal – just the right deal, one that could allow Israel to resume fighting in Gaza.
    

            That tension will be inescapable as Netanyahu heads to Washington, where he has often sought to bolster Israel’s standing in the US as well as his own political standing at home.
    

            While Netanyahu will look to showcase the support he still has in Washington (and a standing ovation from a majority of lawmakers in Congress should do the trick), his visit will also be an opportunity for top US officials and lawmakers to push, prod, nudge and cajole him toward a deal – in both public and private.
    

            Chief among those eager to make that case will be the US president, who will meet face-to-face with Netanyahu this week for the first time since Biden flew to Israel in October in a dramatic show of wartime support.
    

            The warmth and sympathy that filled the air during that October visit is likely to be replaced by something much frostier.

Ex-Israeli military spokesman blames Netanyahu  for ‘loss of international trust’ during war


            Biden has grown steadily more critical of Israel’s war in Gaza – where more than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health – and Netanyahu has resisted US pressure, often publicly thumbing his nose at the White House.
    

            Even as he has maintained strong support for Israel, Biden became the first president since Ronald Reagan to withhold some US munitions to Israel – suspending shipments of 2,000-pound bombs in May amid concerns about civilian casualties in Gaza.
    

            Netanyahu, meanwhile, has not only resisted US calls to rein in Israeli military operations in Gaza, but has used his defiance of the White House’s calls for restraint to bolster his political standing in Israel – including in a speech just days before his trip to the US in which he talked up his refusal to bow to Biden’s pressure to wind down the war and abandon a planned offensive in Rafah.
    

            Biden’s decision to drop out of the presidential race just two days before he sits down with Netanyahu will unquestionably shift the dynamic between the two men even further – exactly how remains to be seen.
    

            Netanyahu will be the first foreign leader to sit down with the now effectively lame duck president – albeit one who still has six months in office during which he will continue to steer US foreign policy.
    

            Loosened from the constraints of electoral politics and with a keener eye on his legacy, how will Biden now approach Netanyahu, the future of the war in Gaza and US policy toward Israel? And to what extent will Netanyahu feel compelled to heed Biden’s pressure?
    

            As the Israeli prime minister weighs that new dynamic, Netanyahu – a keen observer of US politics – may be looking to someone else as he decides whether to take a leap toward a ceasefire: former US President Donald Trump.
    

            Trump has a track record of unflinching support for Israel and has been critical of Biden’s efforts to rein in Israel’s conduct in Gaza. During his speech at the Republican National Convention, he warned that the hostages “better be back before I assume office, or you will be paying a very big price.”
    

            But Trump in April also urged Israel to get its war in Gaza “over with, and get it over with fast.”
    

            And Netanyahu no longer enjoys the cozy relationship he once had with Trump.
    

            “The first person to congratulate Biden was Bibi (Netanyahu). And not only did he congratulate him, he did it on tape,” Trump told CNN analyst Barak Ravid in 2021. “He was very early — like, earlier than most. I haven’t spoken to him since. F**k him.”
    

            Netanyahu will have plenty of opportunities to assess whether that sentiment still stands as he meets with Trump allies in Washington this week. There are currently no known plans for him to meet with Trump.

CNN_50,Israeli settlers attack foreign activists and Palestinian farmers in West Bank,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/22/middleeast/west-bank-attacks-qusra-intl/index.html,2024-07-22 21:31:00,world,"
            Masked Israeli settlers attacked a group of Palestinian farmers and foreign activists accompanying them for protection in the West Bank town of Qusra on Sunday, according to victims of the attack and videos obtained by CNN.
    

            Eight activists were participating as part of a Palestinian grassroots campaign called Defend Palestine, which calls on international volunteers to travel to the Israeli-occupied West Bank to protect Palestinians from Israeli settler attacks.
    

            Two Americans and a German national were taken to hospital with suspected fractures after the attack, their campaign said, adding that another American volunteer suffered minor injuries. One of the Palestinian farmers was hospitalized.
    

            Three of the foreign victims, Vivi Chen, David Hummel, and Jedda, who declined to give her last name, spoke with CNN about the attack from hospital in the West Bank city of Nablus, where they were receiving treatment.
    

            They said they were accompanying Palestinian farmers to their olive fields, which they haven’t been able to access since October because of attacks by Israeli settlers. At some point, the group was approached by several young settlers on a hill.
    

            “They sort of stood there for a while and then they came up to our group of international volunteers and they started hitting us with these thick wooden sticks almost like baseball bats,” Chen said.
    

            Videos recorded by the activists show them trying to retreat as they were attacked. One of them immediately falls to the ground, another tries to shield himself with his arms as he is struck, and at least one is kicked in the leg and hit with a rock hurled by an attacker.
    

            One woman fell down the hill and was also struck with a rock. The settlers then “smashed her phone and she lost her documents and cards,” Chen told CNN.

            “We were doing nothing,” the Hummel said. “Our hands were up and we were backing up and trying to protect each other. So eventually, we tried to keep moving back because we had been hit so many times.”
    

            Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 war and soon started settling Jews on the land. There are currently more than 700,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank. The international community however considers the area to be occupied and Israeli settlements there illegal. The Palestinians want the territory for a future independent state.
    

            The International Court of Justice (ICJ), the United Nations’ top court, said Friday that Israel’s presence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is illegal, in an unprecedented opinion that called on Israel to end its occupation. It called on Israel to cease new settlement activity, evacuate settlers and make reparations for the damage caused.
    

            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) acknowledged the attack on Sunday, saying in a short statement to CNN that “a number of masked Israeli civilians assaulted a group of foreign citizens while they were planting trees in the area.”
    

            The IDF said it condemns any acts of violence, adding that its soldiers were sent to the scene and that it will operate to maintain security in what it considers its jurisdiction. It added that soldiers were dispatched to the scene and fired warning shots into the air, causing the attackers to flee.
    

            But the activists said that when the soldiers arrived, they immediately pointed their guns at a Palestinian man who was accompanying the volunteers and fired shots in his direction.

            “He was our friend and everyone was screaming, ‘No, no! He’s our friend, he’s our friend!’ And they shot live bullets at him,” the activists said. The IDF didn’t respond to CNN’s question about the alleged targeting of the Palestinian volunteer.
    

            The injured activists were taken for treatment by the Palestinian Red Crescent to a hospital in Nablus.
    

            Pictures taken at the hospital showed the victims with multiple cuts and bruises across their bodies. The face of Hummel, the German activist, was severely swollen on the right side.
    

            Mohammed Khatib, an organizer with the Defend Palestine campaign, said: “The attack today, not even 24 hours after the ICJ ruled that Israeli occupation is illegal and that settlers enjoy impunity when exercising violence, serves as further proof for the dire need for international civil protection in Palestine.”
    

            Chen said the group didn’t expect to encounter violence but was “aware of settler violence” against Palestinians.
    

            “Our injuries are very minor compared to what the Palestinians face every day,” she said.
    

            Sunday’s assault followed a separate attack on Saturday in the West Bank, south of Hebron. A video obtained by CNN shows Israeli settlers attacking a Palestinian family with sticks and beating some of them to the ground before a soldier fires a warning shot and the video ends.

CNN_51,Energized Democrats quickly consolidate around Harris,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/kamala-harris-democratic-nomination/index.html,2024-07-22 22:41:00,politics,"
            Vice President Kamala Harris is rapidly consolidating support from a broad swath of the Democratic Party — including lawmakers, governors and influential labor and advocacy groups — as she seeks to effectively box out any rivals and lock down the party’s nomination to take on Donald Trump.
    

            In her first half-day as a 2024 presidential candidate, Harris raised $49.6 million in online donations, campaign spokeswoman Lauren Hitt said — a huge haul that underscored grassroots enthusiasm for a shake-up to the Democratic ticket. Democratic donation-processing site ActBlue called it “the biggest fundraising day of the 2024 cycle.”
    

            Meanwhile, Harris locked down the support of several Democrats who had been seen as potential rivals. And with independent West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin saying Monday he will not run, a credible challenger for the party’s 2024 nod has yet to emerge.
    

            As of Monday morning, Harris has endorsements from more than 30 Democratic senators, nearly 80 House members and several governors — including potential vice president contenders such as Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, North Carolina’s Roy Cooper, California’s Gavin Newsom and Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro. Those numbers were rapidly growing.
    

            She also has the support of the political arms of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional Hispanic Caucus and Congressional Progressive Caucus, as well as two key labor unions, Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of Teachers.
    

            And several state delegations to next month’s Democratic National Convention — Tennessee, North Carolina and South Carolina — announced that they are backing Harris.
    

            Support for the vice president came across the party’s ideological spectrum — from moderate populists, including Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, one of the most endangered Democratic incumbents on the ballot this fall, to progressives, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
    

            Democratic congressional leaders had remained quiet so far — but there were signs that could soon change. Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark and California Rep. Pete Aguilar, the second- and third-ranking House Democrats, endorsed Harris on Monday morning.
    

            Joe Biden’s 1:46 p.m. ET Sunday announcement that he would not seek a second term ignited a frenetic push by Harris to consolidate the support of a party that had been in crisis in the weeks since the president’s dismal performance during his June 27 debate with former President Donald Trump.
    

            Harris knew what Biden had decided: She’d had multiple phone calls with Biden on Sunday, a person familiar with the matter said. Once the announcement came, Harris — wearing a hoodie from her alma mater, Howard University, workout sweats and sneakers — made more than 100 phone calls over 10 hours.
    

            Alongside her family and staff, the vice president’s calls included lawmakers, governors and leaders of influential labor, advocacy and civil rights groups.
    

            Those calls included former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, as well as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The Clintons, in a statement Sunday, endorsed Harris; Obama did not, deferring to the party’s process.
    

            Harris also called her pastor, Amos Brown III, who, along with his wife, prayed over her, the source said. She ate pizza with anchovies — Harris’ go-to topping — for dinner.
    

            In those phone calls, Harris made clear that while she was grateful for Biden’s endorsement, she planned to earn the Democratic nomination in her own right. That echoes the statement she released following Biden’s announcement to step aside.
    

            “I am honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,” she wrote.
    

            Harris’ supporters were also mobilizing.
    

            The group Win With Black Women periodically holds Zoom calls — but the one that took place Sunday evening had a different tone, with 44,000 people joining, according to its leaders.
    

            Longtime Democratic operative Donna Brazile said that she was in the process of gathering delegates to support Harris. “I need all of you to sign your delegate pledge forms now,” Brazile said on the call. She said voter registration and fundraising will be key in the days ahead.
    

            Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser also spoke on the call.
    

            “I know what it’s like to be in the crosshairs of Donald Trump,” she said. “We have to defend our sister.”
    

            Former Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Joyce Beatty and Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett were also among the speakers.
    

            Though some Democrats have held off on announcing endorsements, no serious challenger has emerged to take on Harris for the nomination ahead of the Democratic National Convention, which starts August 19 in Chicago.
    

            Any challenge might need to materialize even faster: Prior to Biden’s departure from the race, the party had set up a virtual roll call to begin the first week of August. There are no signs at this point it intends to abandon those plans.
    

            Manchin, who had left the party earlier this year and is not seeking reelection, said Monday he will not rejoin the party and seek its nomination.
    

            CNN has previously reported the West Virginia senator was considering re-registering as a Democrat to throw his hat in the ring. But in an interview with CBS News on Monday, Manchin said he will not be a candidate.
    

            “I could not believe that there was not going to be a primary process or a mini process. Other countries do it,” Manchin said, adding that he believes Harris is too liberal but could be forced to the middle if she faces a challenge.
    

            New York City Democratic Mayor Eric Adams announced his support for Harris in an interview with MSNBC on Monday, reversing course just hours after he told CNN, “there’s a process and we’re going to follow that process,” to determine the party’s nominee.
    

            “We need real, clear, leadership, and she understands it,” Adams told MSNBC. “She was in the position of looking over the border issue, so she understands some of the things that we need to do.”
    

            And he offered a stirring endorsement of Harris’ fitness to lead the ticket, urging advisers to “let her be her.”
    

            As of mid-morning Monday, as the swell of support for Harris continued to build, the biggest question might have been who she will choose as a running mate.
    

            Beshear, the two-term Kentucky governor, announced his support for Harris on MSNBC on Monday morning — and said he is open to joining Harris as her potential running mate, noting it’s “flattering to be a part” of the conversation about the vice-presidential nomination.
    

            He also offered a window into how he’d play the traditional attack-dog role of a running mate. At multiple points in the interview, Beshear attacked Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, who has family ties to Beshear’s home state of Kentucky.
    

            “Let me just tell you that JD Vance ain’t from here,” Beshear said, referring to his home state, taking issue with how Vance described Appalachia in his best-selling memoir “Hillbilly Elegy.”
    

            Beshear also attacked Vance for past comments expressing support for strict restrictions to abortion access, while touting Harris’ record of supporting protections for reproductive health care.
    

            “JD Vance calls pregnancy arising from rape ‘inconvenient,’” Beshear said. “No, it’s just plain wrong. He suggests that women should stay in abusive relationships. Now listen, a domestic abuser isn’t a man, he’s a monster, and no one should support anyone having to stay in those relationships.”
    

            Cooper, the North Carolina governor who endorsed Harris on Sunday, also appeared on MSNBC on Monday, but deflected questions about whether he would be open to becoming her running mate.
    

            “I think it’s really important that we do keep the focus on her this week. The vice-presidential conversation needs to occur later,” Cooper said. “I want to make sure that Kamala Harris wins. I’m going to work for her all over this country and do what I can to make sure we stop Donald Trump.”

CNN_53,"Six killed after gunman opens fire in Croatian care home, local media reports",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/22/europe/croatia-shooting-care-home-intl/index.html,2024-07-22 22:33:00,world,"
            At least six people died after a gunman entered a home for the elderly in Croatia on Monday and started shooting, according to the country’s public broadcaster.
    

            A man with a firearm entered a private home for the elderly in the town of Daruvar, about 75 miles east of the capital Zagreb, and opened fire at those who were present, Croatian Radiotelevision (HRT) reported.
    

            Several people were also injured during the shooting, HRT said, without providing the exact number.
    

            Five of the victims died immediately, according to HRT. State news agency HINA has reported that some of those injured were receiving medical assistance in the hours after the shooting.
    

            The gunman ran away but was later arrested near a cafe, according to HINA.
    

            The investigation is ongoing and police have not provided additional details, HRT said.
    

            “We are appalled by the murder of five people” in the home for the elderly, Croatia’s Prime Minister Andrej Plenković said in a post on social media, before the death of the sixth victim.
    

            “We express our condolences to the families of the victims and hope for the recovery of the wounded. I expect the competent authorities to determine all the circumstances of the terrible crime,” Plenković said.
    

            Croatia’s Deputy Prime Minister Davor Božinović, Minister of Health Vili Beroš, and social policy minister Marin Piletić are travelling to Daruvar, the prime minister added.

CNN_54,Mass protest on Spanish island Mallorca calls for ‘limits on tourism’,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/22/travel/mass-protest-on-spanish-island-mallorca-calls-for-limits-on-tourism/index.html,2024-07-22 22:04:00,world,"
            Thousands of people took to the streets to protest against mass tourism on the island of Mallorca on Sunday as pushback against holidaymakers in Spain continued.
    

            The demonstration calling for limits on tourist numbers saw protestors carrying signs that read, “Tourists we love you when you don’t buy our land,” and “Your paradise is our nightmare,” while marching through the city of Palma de Mallorca, located on the south coast of the island.
    

            Around 50,000 people took part in the protest on Sunday, which began at around 7 p.m. local time time (1 p.m. ET) according to organizers Menys Turisme, Mas Vida (Less Tourism, More Life), although police put the figure at around 12,000, RTVE reported.
    

            The organizers claim the island’s tourism model “impoverishes workers and enriches only a few.”
    

            They demanded an “alternative tourism model,” alongside “access to decent housing,” the “improvement of public services,” and the “conservation and regeneration of natural areas.”
    

            The demonstration included around 110 groups and social movements, according to Spanish public broadcaster RTVE.
    

            It came amid growing tensions over the impact of tourism on local areas in Spain.
    

            The Balearic Islands, made up of Mallorca, the largest of the islands, Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera, attracted 14.4 million foreign visitors last year, according to the Spanish National Statistics Institute.
    

            Earlier this month, protesters demonstrating against mass tourism in Barcelona sprayed visitors with water and marched through the city, chanting: “Tourists go home.”
    

            The Balearic Islands issued new rules banning drinking in the streets in key tourist areas on the islands of Ibiza and Mallorca, with an exception for terraces and other licensed areas, back in May.
    

            In April, a hunger strike was called by locals in the Spanish Canary Islands, protesting against excessive tourism, which protesters said is pricing out locals and leading to environmental damage.

CNN_55,Harris marches toward Democratic nomination as potential rivals endorse her,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/kamala-harris-democratic-nomination/index.html,2024-07-22 23:56:00,politics,"
            Vice President Kamala Harris is marching to the Democratic nomination as broad swaths of the party — including potential rivals, lawmakers, governors, influential labor and advocacy groups and more — line up behind her bid to take on Donald Trump.
    

            No credible challenger had emerged by late Monday morning, nearly a full day after President Joe Biden had announced his exit from the race and his endorsement of his vice president.
    

            And the party’s best-known governors, several of whom had been seen as potential challengers, announced their support for Harris — making clear that the biggest remaining question about the 2024 Democratic ticket is who Harris will choose as her running mate.
    

            Four governors of must-win Midwestern states — Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer, Minnesota’s Tim Walz, Wisconsin’s Tony Evers and Illinois’ JB Pritzker — endorsed Harris on Monday. They followed Sunday endorsements of Harris from Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, North Carolina’s Roy Cooper, California’s Gavin Newsom and Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro. Many of those governors could be considered for the party’s vice presidential nomination.
    

            In her first half-day as a candidate, Harris raised $49.6 million in online donations, campaign spokeswoman Lauren Hitt said — a huge haul that underscored grassroots enthusiasm for a shake-up to the Democratic 2024 ticket. Democratic donation-processing site ActBlue called it “the biggest fundraising day of the 2024 cycle.”
    

            Meanwhile, the cascade of endorsements for Harris’ candidacy that had begun Sunday afternoon was accelerating on Capitol Hill. Harris has the support of more than 30 Democratic senators and more than 80 House members — numbers that had grown rapidly throughout Monday morning.
    

            She also has the support of the political arms of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional Hispanic Caucus and Congressional Progressive Caucus, as well as two key labor unions, Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of Teachers.
    

            And several state delegations to next month’s Democratic National Convention — Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Louisiana, New Hampshire and Maryland — announced that they are backing Harris.
    

            Support for the vice president came across the party’s ideological spectrum — from moderate populists, including Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, one of the most endangered Democratic incumbents on the ballot this fall, to progressives, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
    

            Democratic congressional leaders had remained quiet so far — but there were signs that could soon change. Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark and California Rep. Pete Aguilar, the second- and third-ranking House Democrats, endorsed Harris on Monday morning.
    

            The hour-by-hour endorsements of Harris from Democratic governors, senators, Cabinet officials and state delegations is unfolding by design, with the hope of reaching a majority of delegates by Wednesday, two people familiar with the process tell CNN.
    

            “It’s a coordinated drumbeat,” a senior Democratic aide working on the effort said. “That sound Democrats hear is the party uniting around the vice president.”
    

            Joe Biden’s 1:46 p.m. ET Sunday announcement that he would not seek a second term ignited a frenetic push by Harris to consolidate the support of a party that had been in crisis in the weeks since the president’s dismal performance during his June 27 debate with former President Donald Trump.
    

            Harris knew what Biden had decided: She’d had multiple phone calls with Biden on Sunday, a person familiar with the matter said. Once the announcement came, Harris — wearing a hoodie from her alma mater, Howard University, workout sweats and sneakers — made more than 100 phone calls over 10 hours.
    

            Alongside her family and staff, the vice president’s calls included lawmakers, governors and leaders of influential labor, advocacy and civil rights groups.
    

            Those calls included former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, as well as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The Clintons, in a statement Sunday, endorsed Harris; Obama did not, deferring to the party’s process.
    

            Harris also called her pastor, Amos Brown III, who, along with his wife, prayed over her, the source said. She ate pizza with anchovies — Harris’ go-to topping — for dinner.
    

            In those phone calls, Harris made clear that while she was grateful for Biden’s endorsement, she planned to earn the Democratic nomination in her own right. That echoes the statement she released following Biden’s announcement to step aside.
    

            “I am honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,” she wrote.
    

            Harris’ supporters were also mobilizing.
    

            The group Win With Black Women periodically holds Zoom calls — but the one that took place Sunday evening had a different tone, with 44,000 people joining, according to its leaders.
    

            Longtime Democratic operative Donna Brazile said that she was in the process of gathering delegates to support Harris. “I need all of you to sign your delegate pledge forms now,” Brazile said on the call. She said voter registration and fundraising will be key in the days ahead.
    

            Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser also spoke on the call.
    

            “I know what it’s like to be in the crosshairs of Donald Trump,” she said. “We have to defend our sister.”
    

            Former Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Joyce Beatty and Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett were also among the speakers.
    

            Though some Democrats have held off on announcing endorsements, no serious challenger has emerged to take on Harris for the nomination ahead of the Democratic National Convention, which starts August 19 in Chicago.
    

            Any challenge might need to materialize even faster: Prior to Biden’s departure from the race, the party had set up a virtual roll call to begin the first week of August. There are no signs at this point it intends to abandon those plans.
    

            Manchin, who had left the party earlier this year and is not seeking reelection, said Monday he will not rejoin the party and seek its nomination.
    

            CNN has previously reported the West Virginia senator was considering re-registering as a Democrat to throw his hat in the ring. But in an interview with CBS News on Monday, Manchin said he will not be a candidate.
    

            “I could not believe that there was not going to be a primary process or a mini process. Other countries do it,” Manchin said, adding that he believes Harris is too liberal but could be forced to the middle if she faces a challenge.
    

            New York City Democratic Mayor Eric Adams announced his support for Harris in an interview with MSNBC on Monday, reversing course just hours after he told CNN, “there’s a process and we’re going to follow that process,” to determine the party’s nominee.
    

            “We need real, clear, leadership, and she understands it,” Adams told MSNBC. “She was in the position of looking over the border issue, so she understands some of the things that we need to do.”
    

            And he offered a stirring endorsement of Harris’ fitness to lead the ticket, urging advisers to “let her be her.”
    

            As of mid-morning Monday, as the swell of support for Harris continued to build, the biggest question might have been who she will choose as a running mate.
    

            Democratic lawyers are beginning their work conducting a deep, yet truncated, vetting process for potential vice presidential hopefuls, two people familiar with the matter told CNN, with siloed teams being established for the leading prospective candidates.
    

            Cooper, Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly are among the Democrats who have been asked to submit information about their finances, family histories and other personal details, two people familiar with the process said. They are part of a group that includes about 10 names, nearly all of whom are elected officials.
    

            A handful of Democratic lawyers, including those who have worked on vice presidential vetting processes in the past, are involved in this effort.
    

            The audition process is also playing out in public, with Cooper and Beshear appearing on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Monday — with the intent that Harris was watching. An aide said she caught at least part of the conversations.
    

            Beshear, the two-term Kentucky governor, announced his support for Harris — and said he is open to joining Harris as her potential running mate, noting it’s “flattering to be a part” of the conversation about the vice-presidential nomination.
    

            He also offered a window into how he’d play the traditional attack-dog role of a running mate. At multiple points in the interview, Beshear attacked Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, who has family ties to Beshear’s home state of Kentucky.
    

            “Let me just tell you that JD Vance ain’t from here,” Beshear said, referring to his home state, taking issue with how Vance described Appalachia in his best-selling memoir “Hillbilly Elegy.”
    

            Beshear also attacked Vance for past comments expressing support for strict restrictions to abortion access, while touting Harris’ record of supporting protections for reproductive health care.
    

            “JD Vance calls pregnancy arising from rape ‘inconvenient,’” Beshear said. “No, it’s just plain wrong. He suggests that women should stay in abusive relationships. Now listen, a domestic abuser isn’t a man, he’s a monster, and no one should support anyone having to stay in those relationships.”
    

            Cooper, the North Carolina governor who endorsed Harris on Sunday, also appeared on MSNBC on Monday, but deflected questions about whether he would be open to becoming her running mate.
    

            “I think it’s really important that we do keep the focus on her this week. The vice-presidential conversation needs to occur later,” Cooper said. “I want to make sure that Kamala Harris wins. I’m going to work for her all over this country and do what I can to make sure we stop Donald Trump.”

            Shoko Miyata, the captain of Japan’s women’s gymnastics team, has withdrawn from Paris 2024 after allegedly breaking the team’s code of conduct by smoking and drinking alcohol, according to the Japanese Gymnastics Association (JGA).
    

            The legal smoking and drinking age in Japan is 20 and the JGA’s code of conduct prohibits gymnasts from doing either during team activities, regardless of age. Miyata is 19.

            “Both parties discussed the matter and decided to withdraw [Miyata] from the Olympics,” JGA executive director Kenji Nishimura told reporters at a press conference on July 19.
    

            Nishimura said that one incident of smoking took place “in a private place at a certain location in Tokyo” and a separate incident of drinking took place “in a room in the Athlete Village of the National Training Center.”
    

            “She engaged in smoking and drinking due to numerous pressures from the competitive targets that had been set,” Nishimura added.
    

            Miyata, who won bronze on the balance beam at the 2022 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, was due to captain Japan’s women’s team of debut Olympians.
    

            CNN is trying to reach Miyata for comment. She has not publicly commented and appears to have deleted her social media accounts.
    

            The country’s women’s team is trying to win its first team medal since the 1964 Tokyo Games.
    

            “We would like to apologize from the bottom of our hearts for the great inconvenience and worry this has caused you,” JGA chief Tadashi Fujita said. “We are truly sorry.
    

            “It’s not just Ms. Miyata’s responsibility. I believe the entire Gymnastics Association is responsible. Ms. Miyata must atone for the crime she committed, though, we will do our utmost to support her, so she can take a new step toward the future.”

CNN_57,Al Sharpton describes call from Harris on Sunday – and how different this was from the last time they spoke,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/al-sharpton-describes-harris-call/index.html,2024-07-23 00:57:00,politics,"
            When the Rev. Al Sharpton’s phone rang Sunday night, on the line was Vice President Kamala Harris, who just hours prior had received the most consequential phone call of her political career.
    

            In Sharpton’s telling, the vice president sounded perhaps almost taken aback by the events of the past day. “I had no idea it was going to happen,” Harris said, according to Sharpton, who spoke with CNN Monday.
    

            But Harris was also emphatic and upbeat as she made clear to the civil rights activist about her new campaign for the presidency: I’m going to go all-in.
    

            The tenor and contents of that conversation between Sharpton and Harris could not have been in starker contrast from their previous chat at the ESSENCE Festival of Culture earlier in the month. As President Joe Biden was hanging on for his political life, fielding growing calls from Democrats to drop out of the 2024 race, Harris had pleaded with Sharpton to stick with the president.
    

            She was, Sharpton said, emphatically loyal, imploring the reverend to continue to have Biden’s back and not join the chorus demanding Biden ditch his campaign.
    

            “She kept telling me – stay with Joe,” Sharpton recalled.
    

            Harris’ brief conversation with Sharpton late Sunday, lasting all about a handful of minutes, was one of dozens upon dozens of calls that the vice president made in the immediate hours after learning of Biden’s decision to drop out as she is looks to quickly coalesce the party behind her.
    

            Biden has officially endorsed Harris and handed off the reins of his reelection campaign to the vice president. Harris will visit Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday afternoon to meet with staff at the office that until Sunday had been the Biden-Harris campaign headquarters.
    

            “One day down. 105 to go,” Harris said on X. “Together, we’re going to win this.”

            A Russian court has sentenced Alsu Kurmasheva, a Russian-American journalist, to six-and-a-half years in prison, state news agency TASS reported Monday.
    

            The hearing, which was held behind closed doors, found Kurmasheva guilty of spreading false information about the Russian army, making her just the latest US journalist to be convicted in the country in recent months.
    

            Kurmasheva’s charge was handed down in the city of Kazan on Friday, the same day that a court in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg convicted Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich of espionage and sentenced him to 16 years in prison, following a trial condemned by his newspaper and the United States as a sham.
    

            The convictions of Kurmasheva and Gershkovich on the same day – both in rapid, closed-door trials – have raised questions about whether the Kremlin is intending to use journalists in a prisoner swap with the US. When asked about this possibility earlier Monday, spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “I have no answer to this question. I leave this question unanswered.”

            Kurmasheva, a Prague-based journalist for the US-backed Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), was detained in October 2023 after allegedly failing to register as a foreign agent, while on a trip to visit her mother in Russia. She was formally accused of spreading false information in December – charges her family and employer deny.
    

            RFE/RL CEO Stephen Capus called Kurmasheva’s conviction “a mockery of justice” and demanded her immediate release.
    

            “It’s beyond time for this American citizen, our dear colleague, to be reunited with her loving family,” Capus said in a statement, adding that “the only just outcome is for Alsu to be immediately released from prison by her Russian captors.”
    

            Pavel Butorin, Kurmasheva’s husband, reacted to the court’s decision, telling CNN: “My daughters and I know Alsu has done nothing wrong. And the world knows it too. We need her home.”
    

            Before her conviction, Butorin told CNN he was “so confident that she would get back to us that I bought Taylor Swift tickets” for August this year. “Little did we know that she would be arrested and taken away from us.”
    

            Butorin told CNN that Kurmasheva had traveled to Russia to see her mother in May 2023, but was detained at the airport when trying to return home to Prague in early June. After her passports were taken, she was fined and placed under de facto – and then formal – house arrest for months, before being charged in December.
    

            Butorin had asked that the US government also declare Kurmasheva as wrongfully detained, as it has done for Gershkovich – the first American journalist to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since the Cold War.

            Nearly all McDonald’s US locations will continue to sell the “$5 Meal Deal” after people flocked to the promotion amid rising food prices.
    

            Since its launch in June, the limited time offering is “resonating with our millions of customers,” and the company claimed the move was siphoning off business from its competition, according to an internal McDonald’s memo obtained by CNN. As a result, 93% of US locations will keep the deal on menus through August.
    

            McDonald’s launched the “$5 Meal Deal” in late June intended to be for one month only. The meal includes a McDouble cheeseburger or a McChicken sandwich, small french fries, four-piece Chicken McNuggets and a small soft drink.
    

            McDonald’s repeatedly talked about its propensity to raise menu prices without feeling the pain from customers pulling back until the first quarter of this year, when it reported weaker-than-expected sales. But the jump in food prices was not confined to just McDonald’s, with other chains also feeling a pinch. Diners are not going out to eat as often and spending less when they do, causing fast food sales to slow and restaurant traffic to dip.

            The $5 deal is “meeting the objective of driving guests back to our restaurants” and is even prompting some people to buy full-priced items, resulting in a greater lift of sales, the memo said.
    

            McDonald’s (MCD), which will release earnings on July 29, said in the memo that it would consider “further extending” the $5 deal beyond August.
    

            Specific financial data wasn’t revealed in the memo. Pacer.ai, a third-party analytics firm, said in a recent report that the deal boosted traffic to restaurants that proved “how well-received this special has been among McDonald’s fans.”
    

Starbucks, Wendy’s, Taco Bell and Burger King have also added meal deals in recent weeks to boost their bottom lines.

            US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle faced off Monday with angry lawmakers from both parties, who grilled her over the stunning security failures that led to the recent assassination attempt against Donald Trump.

Lawmakers grill Secret Service director over Trump assassination attempt


            Cheatle acknowledged that there were “significant” problems at Trump’s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, where the former president was shot in the ear, and she didn’t downplay the historical and political significance of the event.
    

            Before Trump took the stage at the rally, the director said, the Secret Service had been notified “between two and five times” that there was a suspicious person in the area.
    

            Yet one by one, as members of the House Oversight Committee tried to pry loose new information about the security breakdown and what is being done to ensure it never happens again, Cheatle repeatedly stonewalled lawmakers’ efforts to get answers and pointed to the ongoing FBI investigation.
    

            The director also remained defiant in the face of bipartisan calls for her immediate resignation.
    

            Here are key takeaways from Monday’s hearing so far:
    

            Right off the bat, Cheatle acknowledged that the Trump assassination attempt was “the most significant operational failure at the Secret Service in decades.” She later said it was the worst moment for the agency since the unsuccessful assassination attempt targeting President Ronald Reagan in 1981.
    

            But even with that historic failure under her watch, Cheatle was insistent that she won’t step down.
    

            A bipartisan chorus of lawmakers called for her to resign her post. The criticism was sharper from Republicans, but Democrats also prodded Cheatle to let go. Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna pointed out that the Secret Service director who ran the agency when Reagan was shot eventually resigned from his post. (That director resigned eight months following the assassination attempt.)
    

            “Do you really, genuinely, in your heart, believe that you being in this role is what’s right for America at this moment?” Khanna asked.
    

            “I will remain on, and be responsible to the agency, to this committee, to the former president, and to the American public,” Cheatle replied, touting her nearly 30-year record working up the agency’s ranks.
    

            Earlier in the hearing, she said, “I think I am the best person to lead the Secret Service at this time.”
    

            Under tough questioning from GOP Rep. Nancy Mace, Cheatle conceded that the incident was a “colossal failure.” Mace ripped into Cheatle, telling her, “you’re full of sh*t today” because of her uncooperative posture throughout the hearing.
    

            Rep. James Comer, the GOP chairman of the committee, pressed Cheatle over whether, prior to the shooting, Trump had been given all the security he requested.
    

            Cheatle said that “for the event on July 13, the assets that were requested for that day were given.”
    

CNN previously reported that there were previous events where the Secret Service denied requests from Trump’s security detail, though the agency instead, in some instances, provided other security measures from local law enforcement.
    

            GOP Rep. Jim Jordan also pressed Cheatle on whether she lied to the nation because – the morning after the shooting – the top spokesperson for the Secret Service forcefully denied allegations that the agency had rejected any requests for additional security.
    

            “For the event in Butler, there were no requests that were denied,” Cheatle said.
    

            “Well, maybe they got tired of asking,” Jordan said.
    

            Cheatle frustrated lawmakers Monday as she walked a tightrope with her testimony, giving carefully worded answers and plenty of non-answers to tough questions.
    

            The top Republican and Democrat on the House Oversight Committee peppered Cheatle with some of the biggest questions that are still unresolved: Were any Secret Service agents on the roof where gunman Thomas Crooks fired shots at Trump? Did Crooks fly a drone over the area before the rally began? Why wasn’t he stopped when people spotted him on the roof with a rifle?
    

            In response to these questions, and more, Cheatle pivoted away and didn’t directly answer. Regarding Crooks’ possible drone, she confirmed that this is what the FBI told her, but said it was still being probed.
    

            “We are just nine days out from this incident, and there’s still an ongoing investigation,” Cheatle said on a few occasions throughout the hearing. She also said, “I’m not going to get into specifics of that day.”
    

            Cheatle revealed some details – like the fact that she has spoken with the counter-sniper who killed Crooks and that her agency didn’t reject any requests from Trump’s campaign for additional security at the specific rally in Butler.
    

            “We need to have confidence that if the FBI’s leading this investigation, that they’re leading a credible investigation,” Comer told Cheatle directly. “Because there’s some of us sitting up here that don’t have a lot of confidence in the FBI.”
    

            Democratic Rep. Shontel Brown later told Cheatle, “You’re not making this easy for us,” after a series of non-answers. Other lawmakers from both parties said they thought Cheatle was less forthcoming and candid in her sworn testimony at Monday’s hearing than she was in her recent TV interviews.
    

            Before Trump took the stage on July 13, the Secret Service had been notified “between two and five times” that there was a suspicious person in the area, Cheatle said.
    

            She said the agency was still looking into the apparent communication breakdown – which led to Trump going onstage even amid these reports of a suspicious person, and as rallygoers saw Crooks with a gun in the immediate moments before the shots rang out.
    

            “I have to assume that they did not know that there was a threat when they brought the president out on the stage,” Cheatle said.
    

            However, there’s “a distinction between suspicious behavior and a threat,” Cheatle explained, “and at the time that this individual was identified, they were displaying suspicious behavior,” and those early reports about Crooks didn’t identify him as an active threat.
    

            In his opening statement, Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the panel, homed in on the gun violence that has plagued the US and labeled the Trump assassination attempt as a “mass shooting.”
    

            “Mr. (Corey) Comperatore, President Trump and the other rally attendees wounded in Butler are now members of a club no one wants to belong to — the thousands of people who have fallen victim to mass shootings,” Raskin said, as an aide held up a poster listing some of the recent mass shootings in the US.
    

            Some Democrats on the committee pointed out that Crooks used an AR-15-style weapon, which many Democrats have been trying to ban or at least restrict for people under 21, like Crooks.
    

            Rep. Gerry Connolly asked whether Americans having more guns makes Cheatle’s job “easier or harder.”
    

            “The job of the Secret Service is difficult every day,” Cheatle said, before Connolly cut her off, decried the proliferation of assault-style rifles, and chided the Secret Service director for “evading” the gun issue.
    

            Cheatle indirectly responded to allegations circling around right-wing media outlets and lawmakers that female agents were in part to blame for security failures at the Trump rally.
    

            Female agents who were part of Trump’s Secret Service detail were photographed shielding the former president after the failed assassination attempt. Some on the right have claimed that the women couldn’t properly protect Trump. (The Trump family has pushed back directly on that claim.)
    

            Asked by a Republican member about her efforts to “change the makeup of the Secret Service” because there was “too high a percentage are men,” Cheatle said she hires only “the best and brightest.”
    

            “I am hiring the best qualified candidates that put in an application that want to work for our great organization,” she responded.

CNN_61,How Harris is preparing to contrast her record as a prosecutor with Trump’s as a felon,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/harris-strategy-against-trump/index.html,2024-07-23 01:54:00,politics,"
Kamala Harris has spent much more of her life as a prosecutor than as a senator or vice president – and that is exactly how she is now going to run against Donald Trump.
    

            In sessions that were quietly underway at the Naval Observatory even before Joe Biden’s disastrous debate, Harris and her inner circle had already landed on the plan to look past whoever Trump picked as his running mate and focus almost exclusively on the former president.
    

            The vice president had expected that to be part of her role making the case for Biden. But it became clearer and clearer over the last month that she was likely going to be making the case for herself.

What are your questions about the presidential election now that Biden is out?


            Now that Biden has stepped aside — and with even more of her potential opponents planning to endorse her by the end of the day Monday — over a dozen advisers and close allies told CNN they think her candidacy will lean heavily on her background as a district attorney, attorney general and cross examiner in Senate hearings.
    

            It is simple, they say: prosecutor versus felon.
    

            The strategy will be a return to the “prosecutor for president” framework of her 2020 presidential campaign, which included her slogan taken from her days standing up in court as a young assistant district attorney: “Kamala Harris, for the people.” In those days, her team was stretching the rhetoric. But this year, the GOP nominee has been found guilty in a New York hush money trial, liable for battery in a civil case, and faces two other criminal cases related to subverting the 2020 election.
    

            Advisers believe that this is a way not just to raise up her own life story, but to make her come across as fighting for Americans while Trump is trying to serve himself. It’s also a strategy to play up attributes like strength, intelligence and toughness that are part of being a prosecutor but can also be of a commander in chief.
    

            Her supporters are raring to see her do it.
    

            “As a former prosecutor, Vice President Harris has a lot of experience holding convicted felons accountable,” said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a former primary opponent in the 2020 Democratic race who quickly endorsed Harris after the news of Biden’s decision broke. “She was fighting on behalf of abused women. She was in the trenches against giant banks. She was out in the middle of multiple fights every day as a prosecutor and then attorney general in California.”
    

            Warren noted that she first met Harris before either got to the Senate, when she was then setting up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the then-California attorney general was taking on big banks over the mortgage crisis.
    

            “It’s such a beautiful juxtaposition,” said Mini Timmaraju, president of Reproductive Freedom for All. “Her whole career she’s been taking on tough cases and tough characters like Donald Trump. Her reputation has grown from her success in putting bad guys away. And now she has the chance to put the ultimate bad guy away for good.”
    

            During a stop in Fayetteville, North Carolina, last week – when Harris was still publicly defending Biden’s candidacy as his No. 2 – she road-tested some of the lines.
    

            “As many of you know, I am a former prosecutor. So, I say, let’s look at the facts, shall we?” she said, as she compared Biden’s record to Trump’s on boosting manufacturing jobs, helping seniors, protecting Obamacare and lowering prices on goods.

Trump’s team is already on the attack against Harris


            Harris has said that approach includes laying blame directly on Trump for the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state-level abortion restrictions that have followed.
    

            “The prosecutor approach is really about just deconstructing an issue,” Harris told CNN in an exclusive interview after a campaign stop in Las Vegas in April. “It’s presenting and reminding folks about the empirical evidence that shows us exactly how we arrived at this point. … He can’t hide from this stuff.”
    

            Several people involved in discussions and thinking about how she would campaign either with or without Biden pointed to one of the few ads from Harris’ primary campaign – before it sputtered out amid staff infighting and dried up fundraising.
    

            “She prosecuted sex predators. He is one. She shut down for-profit colleges that swindled Americans. He was a for-profit college – literally,” a narrator says, as footage of first Harris and then Trump goes by. “He’s owned by the big banks. She’s the attorney general who beat the biggest banks in America and forced them to pay homeowners $18 billion.”
    

            During the 2020 campaign, under attack from progressives who said that she had been too tough on crime, Harris soon abandoned that approach at the urging of her younger sister Maya, a former ACLU official and Hillary Clinton adviser who is extremely close to the vice president both personally and as an adviser.
    

            The past three weeks were strange ones for Harris. As Biden deliberated, fumed and tried to squint a way into reviving his reelection bid, she was not part of the main conversations. She knew she was not in control of her own fate: Biden would stick it out despite all the calls to leave and she’d have to stand by him, or he’d decide to go and she’d have to be ready to turn into a presidential candidate on a few minutes’ notice.
    

            Old friends and people wanting to be new friends reached out to her and close staff. She did not answer almost any of the calls or texts or emails, and neither did they. Several who were in conversation with her said she would not even engage the topic of the presidential race at all in private, very conscious not to have leaks that made her seem like she was scheming in any way.

Inside Biden’s unprecedented exit from the presidential race


            As the clock seemed to tick down on Biden, there were clear signs that she was huddling with those closest to her. On Friday afternoon, she made a surprise stop at a new ice cream store in Washington, DC, owned by supermodel Tyra Banks, her grandnieces in tow because they were in town. On Saturday, when she stepped out of the helicopter at Andrews Air Force Base to fly on Air Force Two to a fundraiser in Provincetown, Massachusetts, Tony West – who’s married to her sister Maya, and, in addition to being a former Justice Department official, is a longtime Harris political adviser — was in her cabin on the flight there and back where the door remained closed.
    

            Although Harris usually comes to chat with reporters who travel with her, typically keeping those short sessions off the record, she avoided that the past few days, careful not to get caught with even a facial expression that might leak.
    

            Part of the reason Biden decided to seek reelection in the first place was because of his wariness of Harris’ troubled start on the job, and his reservation about whether she could win was a central topic of discussion as he tried to hold on, people familiar with the conversations told CNN.
    

            Some of the frustration from people close to Harris for years was that Biden and some of his top advisers had not done enough to help boost the woman he had all but anointed as his choice for the future of the Democratic Party, keeping the spotlight too much on him. But part of what Harris had been trying to do as she recovered from her rocky start was steel herself for a day she knew could have come at any point, say people who have spoken to her.
    

            “She’s always been ready, from the moment she accepted to be his running mate. It’s been clear that he’s older, and might not complete two terms,” said Eleni Kounalakis, the lieutenant governor of California and a friend of Harris’ for years. “She always knew that this moment could come. And she’s been getting ready – very quietly, very deliberate out of respect for our country.”
    

            Harris spent most of Sunday taking in the news and making calls to key supporters in Congress. While some have been rushing to get delegates to sign on with the aim of locking Harris in as the nominee within days, a person familiar with the calls told CNN that the vice president herself reiterated to many she spoke with on Sunday that she is opposed to rushing a virtual roll call vote and will follow whatever process the party sets up. For all the endorsements rolling in, she wants to be seen as earning the nomination and not being coronated.

The delegates will decide the next Democratic nominee as a groundswell forms for Harris


            One of her biggest tasks ahead will likely be very quickly vetting and choosing a running mate. In just the past week of campaign stops, she has appeared with three of the most talked about possibilities: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.
    

            Harris got to hear Buttigieg from backstage on Saturday in Provincetown as he ripped into Trump running mate JD Vance and then said, “I can’t even begin to tell you how much more well off America is going to be with our vice president compared to the guy that they want to send in to be the vice president.”
    

            Others discussed include Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly.
    

            As of Sunday evening, people familiar with several on that list said no vetting requests had come in. Shapiro, Beshear and Cooper were among the people who got calls from Harris on Sunday.
    

            Harris wouldn’t just be the second woman at the top of a national ticket. She’s a half-Jamaican, half-Indian woman whose given names are Kamala and Devi, who identified so strongly with the American Black experience that she specifically chose Howard University for college. She’s also married to a Jewish man. Her candidacy is historic.
    

            But she has long been hyper-sensitive, as have some key people around her, to even inadvertent slights against her because she is a woman, or because she is a person of color. Even on the international stage, staff had grown weary of still having to gently correct some other governments’ protocol offices after they seated the vice president at dinners next to the wife of a foreign leader rather than the leader himself.
    

            People close to Harris are steeling themselves for vicious attacks, and also for the possibility that she is about to confront subconscious racism and sexism.

            They are also counting on Harris’ candidacy to drive a massive burst of enthusiasm from the base, both because it’s a shift from one of the most intense months of Democratic despair, and because, if she’s the nominee, the base will be represented in a way that many core party voters did not feel was the case from an 81-year-old White man whose most consistent Saturday evening activity was going to mass.
    

            With women across the country already highly engaged on abortion, several Democrats predicted a boost from elevating a woman who has been out front on this issue for years.
    

            “She’s just so much more robust and so much more authentic and so much more credentialed to speak about this,” Timmaraju said. “It’s the number one persuasion message in this campaign, and now you have the best advocate.”
    

            Still, the worries about what Harris has been handed have been spreading for weeks. No one knows how most voters will respond to her, but even in polls that show her doing better than Biden, she is still behind Trump. Among those alarmed at the potential repercussions if she loses: Connecticut Rep. Jahana Hayes, who in a meeting of House Democrats two weeks ago said she worried that Harris and Black women overall could end up bearing the blame for a loss that she thinks would be more the fault of Biden, Democratic infighting and overall dissatisfaction with the direction of the country.
    

            Hayes declined comment to CNN on Sunday night about her feelings after Biden dropped out.
    

            Laphonza Butler, another longtime friend now serving as senator from California, told CNN she thinks both Harris’ experience as vice president and Trump’s legal problems make for a very different situation from the last campaign, on which she was an adviser.
    

            “Just like a prosecutor, she is going to know her case inside and out. She is going to have her facts and her witnesses lined up and she is going to be talking to the jury, the American people,” Butler told CNN.
    

            After a January 2019 campaign launch that was so big that the Oakland streets were packed for blocks and helicopters circled overhead trying to estimate how many thousands were there, Harris quickly fizzled out. Splashy successes tended to be followed by weeks of missteps.
    

            Imagining a standard two-year primary campaign, former aides and friends alike saw at best a tortured slog. As hard as it will be for her to mount a campaign with just over 100 days before the election, several who know her told CNN that it may turn out to be the best news for her.
    

            “She’s at her best when she’s got a high sense of urgency and limited time. She’s at her best when she’s prosecuting the case and has a foe to call out, and she has the ultimate foe,” said a former Harris aide. “She’s a better sprinter than marathon runner, and I think that’s going to be advantageous.”
    

            Warren echoed that. “When the pressure is on, she gets calmer and more focused,” Warren said. And the Massachusetts senator said she hoped that she and other progressive leaders vouching for Harris would head off any cannibalizing from the left.
    

            One House Democrat in a seat where Trump won in 2020 urged Harris not to bow to some of the “woke” thinking that they said has dominated the party in recent years.
    

            “She can’t do this if she runs as a lawyer from California. She’s got to do this as someone who does the right thing, even if it pisses off progressives, someone who takes on crime whether it’s white-collar crime or street crime,” the lawmaker said. “She has a profile that hasn’t been exercised properly.”

            A Southwest Airlines flight on approach to Tampa, Florida, flew as low as 150 feet from the ground while it was still nearly five miles from the airport, flight tracking data from Flightradar24 shows.
    

            The flight from Columbus, Ohio, to Tampa last week ended up bypassing Tampa International Airport and landing in Fort Lauderdale. It’s the third reported case of a Southwest flight flying at what appears to be a dangerously low altitude this year.
    

            “Southwest Flight 425 safely diverted to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on July 14 after the Crew discontinued their planned approach into Tampa International Airport. The aircraft returned to Tampa after a short time on the ground in Fort Lauderdale,” Southwest said in a statement.
    

            The Federal Aviation Administration says it is investigating the incident.

            “Southwest is following its robust Safety Management System and is in contact with the Federal Aviation Administration to understand and address any irregularities,” Southwest’s statement said. “Nothing is more important to Southwest than the Safety of our Customers and Employees.”
    

            Flightradar24 says the previous three flights into Tampa flew at an altitude of 1,225 feet at the same point in their descent, a sign of how far off Flight 425 was from where it likely should have been. The weather at the time was poor, with thunderstorms in the area.
    

            The incident follows two other low altitude incidents involving Southwest flights this year.
    

            On June 19, Southwest flight 4069 descended to just 525 feet above the ground nine miles from its approach to Oklahoma City. On April 11, Southwest flight 2786 flew just 400 feet above the ocean off the coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai. At one point, that flight was descending at 4,000 feet per minute before climbing.

            Global markets made solid gains after President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential election Sunday and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.
    

            European stocks saw an uptick and afternoon trading in the US was higher following Biden’s announcement.
    

            The Dow rose 78 points, or 0.2% in early afternoon trading Monday. The S&P 500 was up 0.9% and the Nasdaq was 1.3% higher. European markets also closed higher, and Asian markets closed mostly lower. US Treasuries rose slightly, trimming yields, and the dollar was softer against major currencies.
    

            Significant doubt about Biden’s ability to beat former President Donald Trump led Wall Street to begin to price in a Trump victory in November. That became apparent with so-called Trump trades, in which investors bought up stocks they believed Trump’s tariff-heavy agenda could benefit — and they likewise sold off stocks related to green energy and other industries traders believed Trump’s policies could hurt.

Biden drops out of presidential race and endorses Harris


            Meanwhile, a large number of economists have predicted Trump’s policies would make America’s inflation problem worse, and he would balloon the US deficit. As Trump’s fortunes appeared to advance in recent weeks, US Treasury prices fell and yields rose, which they often do in anticipation of higher inflation.
    

            With the Democratic party now apparently coalescing around Vice President Kamala Harris as its likely nominee, some of those Trump trades could begin to unwind — or at least go on hiatus until new polling begins to show whether or not Harris appears to stand a better chance against Trump than Biden did.
    

            With fewer than 100 days until the US election in November, Sunday’s upheaval could have sent uncertain investors into a worry spiral. But “the fact that Biden endorsed Kamala Harris reduces uncertainty,” said Jay Hatfield, CEO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors. He expects a muted market reaction instead.
    

            “There may be a small unwinding of the Trump trade on Monday as Vice President Harris is perceived to have a slightly better chance of winning,” Hatfield added.
    

            Last week was exceptionally rough for markets. The S&P 500 notched its worst three-day performance of 2024 and Europe’s STOXX 600 logged its worst weekly performance since October, according to Deutsche Bank data.
    

            Some analysts worry that market churn could continue as we get closer to the election.
    

            “Markets are increasingly focused on the US presidential election in November,” wrote Deutsche Bank’s Henry Allen in a research note on Monday. “But there’s heightened uncertainty about the outcome, particularly after President Biden has just become the first incumbent President to withdraw since Lyndon Johnson in 1968.”
    

            Moreover, the S&P 500 has declined in every September since 2020, he said. Over the last three years, September was the worst month of the year for the index.
    

            Still, markets remain unusually strong. The S&P 500 has been higher for 28 of the last 38 weeks, something we haven’t seen exceeded since 1989, he noted.
    

Stocks tumbled toward the end of last week as a turbulent election cycle and a global tech outage rocked technology stocks in particular.

As Mr. Biden slipped in the polls after his debate performance, so-called “Trump trades” gained prominence as investors prepared for a Republican win. A new Democratic ticket could alter investors’ perceived election odds, with many expecting increased volatility as traders reconsider their strategies.
In after-hours trading late Sunday night, futures for the S&P 500 index rose slightly. Trading can be thin before the official market open, but the move, while small, is notable coming after one of the worst weeks for the U.S. stock market this year.
Treasury bond yields and the dollar were little changed. The dollar has slipped recently, in part because of comments former President Donald J. Trump has made criticizing a stronger dollar, which makes it harder for U.S. manufacturers to sell abroad. (A view shared by his running mate, Senator J.D. Vance.)The price of gold rose. Gold, which often serves as a haven for investors during bouts of market volatility and dollar weakness, hit a record last week.
Bitcoin, which has rallied on polls showing a lead for Mr. Trump, who has courted crypto companies with promises to end a regulatory crackdown, jumped more than 1 percent after Mr. Biden’s announcement.
Markets in Asia were mostly down early Monday. Along with the political upheaval in the United States, investors were digesting an economic policy announcement from China’s leaders. Stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen slipped in early trading on Monday.
Taiwan’s main stock index dropped sharply on Monday. Taiwan, which plays a central role in the global semiconductor supply chain, has been accused by Mr. Trump of taking “about 100 percent of our chip business.” TSMC, the world’s biggest maker of advanced computer chips, accounts for a large share of Taiwan’s market.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell slightly on Monday. Market analysts in Japan have said that the shared affinity between Mr. Trump and Mr. Vance for a weak dollar would weigh on Japanese stocks. The yen, which has recently slid to a nearly four-decade low against the dollar, has boosted the competitiveness of Japanese products like cars and manufacturing equipment sold overseas.“Mr. Trump’s economic policies are expected to ultimately lead to a weaker dollar and lower global stock prices,” Takahide Kiuchi, executive economist at Nomura Research Institute, wrote in a note on Monday. As traders parse the complicated web of policies that Mr. Trump has said he would implement, and now rethink his odds of victory as the Democrats revamp their ticket, “there might not be a clear direction in the short term,” Mr. Kiuchi wrote."
WaPo_1,Manchin weighs options after Biden exits presidential race,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/21/manchin-weighs-options-after-biden-exits-presidential-race/,2024-07-22 08:23:02.864516,,"Sen. Joe Manchin III (I-W.Va.) is considering re-registering as a Democrat to compete for the party’s presidential nomination in the wake of President Biden’s announcement Sunday that he will exit the campaign, according to a Manchin adviser.The adviser, Jonathan Kott, declined to share more details about Manchin’s plans at this stage. Manchin was the first elected official to signal an openness to challenging Vice President Harris in the wake of Biden’s announcement after the president endorsed Harris, as did some members of the Democratic establishment.Manchin, who will turn 77 next month, left the Democratic Party in May to register as an independent. The then-Democrat from a red state, who irked some of his fellow Democrats by cutting deals with Republicans, announced in the fall that he would not seek reelection to his Senate seat at the end of his term, hampering Democratic hopes of holding on to their Senate majority in 2024.Previously, Manchin had flirted with mounting a third-party presidential campaign this cycle as some Democrats, even before Biden’s halting June 27 debate performance, worried about the lack of enthusiasm for the president among a broad swath of Democratic voters. But in February, Manchin said he would “not be involved in a presidential run” as he did not want to be a “spoiler” in a race then presumed to be between Biden and former president Donald Trump.“I just don’t think it’s the right time,” Manchin said then. “Democracy is at stake right now.”Another long-shot candidate also announced her intention Sunday night to vie for delegates at next month’s Democratic National Convention, where the Democratic nomination will be settled.Marianne Williamson, a self-help author and motivational speaker who unsuccessfully ran for the 2020 and 2024 Democratic presidential nominations, also announced she would compete for the spot (after previously exiting the race and reentering).“I look forward to taking my message to the American people, and convincing Democratic delegates, that I am the best candidate to take us to victory in November,” she wrote on X.Manchin has long been a thorn in Democrats’ side, even as he also helped deliver Biden some of his signature policy achievements, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which included many sweeping climate change measures. (Manchin renamed that bill before finally supporting it.) The moderate has also clashed with Biden over energy policy and other matters, but has said he could not vote for Trump.Manchin’s reported consideration of a presidential bid was in sharp contrast to dozens of Democratic lawmakers who rushed Sunday to endorse Harris for the top of the Democratic ticket. Several Democratic governors who had been floated as possible candidates, in the event of a vacancy on the ticket, also endorsed Harris.In an interview Sunday morning with CBS News’s “Face the Nation,” before Biden’s exit from the race, Manchin said he would not run for a spot on the Democratic ticket.“No, this is a new generation, Margaret,” he told moderator Margaret Brennan. “We’ve got a lot of deep people on the bench to conserve, and they have proven their mettle by being in an executive position. Give them a chance to rise.”In another interview on Sunday morning, this time with CNN’s “State of the Union,” Manchin said he favored an “open process” to determine a replacement for Biden, who at that point had not yet made his announcement.Manchin said an open process, rather than handpicking a successor, would be the best way to showcase to voters the deep bench of talent in the Democratic Party. He mentioned two Democratic governors, Kentucky’s Andy Beshear and Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro, as strong potential candidates, but did not mention Harris.Both governors, Manchin said, “are operating with legislatures either evenly split or completely opposite their party affiliation. They haven’t divided their state. They haven’t made you pick a side and demonize the other side. They’ve brought people together.”Manchin said Trump’s running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), may appeal to voters in Manchin’s home state who feel left behind by the Democratic Party.“I think he has enough of a flavor there and everything,” Manchin said. “I grew up in another era of Appalachia, but I can see it. I’ve watched my state change like no other state for 80 years.”Douglas MacMillan contributed to this report."
WaPo_2,"Utah State player dies in apparent drowning after cliff diving, police say",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/21/new-mexico-state-football-player-cliff-diving/,2024-07-22 08:06:02.864516,,"Utah State said a man found dead underwater at an area reservoir was Andre Seldon Jr., a member of its football team.The university noted in a news release Saturday evening that, per the Cache County Sheriff’s Office, there was a search that day for a young man who was seen diving from cliffs at the reservoir and not seen resurfacing. Utah State said he was found by a dive team from the state’s department of public safety.“Our football program is heartbroken to have to endure the loss of one of our own,” interim coach Nate Dreiling said in a statement shared by the school.Seldon, a 22-year-old defensive back, recently transferred to Utah State after two seasons at New Mexico State. He started his college career with two seasons at Michigan, where he was a highly rated recruit playing in his home state.“So deeply saddened by this news!” Michigan Coach Sherrone Moore, who was an assistant when Seldon played for the Wolverines in 2020 and 2021, said Sunday in a social media post. “A great young man on and off the field! Praying for the Seldon family and here to support in anyway way possible! Gone way too soon!!”The Utah State University community is mourning the death of football student-athlete Andre Seldon Jr.Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and loved ones. pic.twitter.com/cIScmcewp5The Cache County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release Saturday that initial reports indicated someone was missing after diving from cliffs into the reservoir. A helicopter team was said to have assisted in a search and rescue mission, and the public was asked to avoid the area.A spokesman for the law enforcement agency said Sunday via email that, regarding its initial assessment of what may have happened at the reservoir, deputies had collected “statements from multiple other student athletes who were present during the accident as well as other bystanders who were not a part of the group.”The spokesman added that a factual finding of death would be made by the medical examiner’s office.“Our Office will continue to investigate this matter, however, as of today we have no factual information that this incident is more than a tragic accident,” the spokesman said. “We will continue to follow new evidence if it arises.”In a social media post Sunday, New Mexico State’s football program said the Aggies community was “devastated” by the news.Seldon transferred to Utah State after playing for Dreiling when he was New Mexico State’s defensive coordinator. Dreiling accepted the same job at Utah State earlier this year, then was named interim coach earlier this month when Blake Anderson was placed on leave. Anderson was fired Thursday for intervening in a potential domestic violence case following the arrest of one of his players, according to the Associated Press. By replacing Anderson, the 33-year-old Dreiling became the youngest head coach at the Football Bowl Subdivision level.Seldon was set to start classes this fall at Utah State, the school said Sunday.“Having had a previous relationship with Andre during our time together at New Mexico State, I can tell you he was an incredible person and teammate,” Dreiling said in his statement. “Our condolences and prayers go out to Andre’s family as we grieve with them over this tremendous loss.”"
WaPo_3,GOP eyes legal challenges as Harris assumes control of Biden’s war chest,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/21/biden-harris-campaign-dollars-legal-challenge/,2024-07-22 08:06:02.864516,,"As President Biden bowed out of the presidential race Sunday and endorsed Vice President Harris to be the Democratic Party’s nominee, he immediately dashed off a social media post asking his backers to show their support by giving to the Biden-Harris campaign committee.“If you’re with us, donate to her campaign here,” he wrote, posting a link to an ActBlue page accepting contributions for the Biden for President campaign.But as Biden tries to hand over the committee’s millions in remaining cash to Harris, Republican lawyers and operatives are saying “not so fast.”For weeks, Democratic lawyers and operatives — who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal party deliberations — had argued that elevating Harris to be the Democratic nominee was the easiest solution for the party. Rather than encouraging an array of candidates to compete in an open convention and setting off a scramble for financial support, they reasoned that anointing Harris would prevent a lot of legal headaches because her name is already on the paperwork filed with the Federal Election Commission that organized the Biden campaign committee.Within hours of Biden announcing his decision, the committee tried to make the handoff to Harris official — submitting an amended filing to the FEC changing its name to “Harris for President.”Several campaign finance lawyers aligned with Republicans argue that the campaign does not have legal authority to do that — and that the maneuver is all but certain to be challenged before the FEC or in a court of law.Charlie Spies, a prominent GOP campaign finance lawyer, said that both Biden and Harris would have to have been officially nominated by the Democratic Party at its convention next month before any kind of handoff could occur. In that situation, he noted, a provision in campaign finance law allows a vice-presidential nominee to take control of the campaign’s depository if the presidential nominee withdraws.“Biden can’t transfer his money to Harris because it was raised under his own name, and there is no legal mechanism for it to have been raised jointly with Harris before they were their party’s nominees,” said Spies, who advised the Republican National Committee before stepping down from that role earlier this year.The six-member FEC panel that would rule on such matters has long been evenly split between Republicans and Democrats — often preventing campaign finance rules from being enforced. Its partisan divide raises the possibility that commissioners could deadlock on the question of whether Harris can assume control of the campaign’s cash. Were that to happen, several lawyers said, the potential challenge would probably land in court.“Replacing a presidential candidate and handing over his committee to someone else is unprecedented under current campaign finance law,” Sean Cooksey, a Republican who is the FEC chairman, said Sunday. “It raises a host of open questions about whether it is legal, what limits apply and what contributors’ rights are.”Dara Lindenbaum, an FEC commissioner appointed by Biden, offered the opposite view: “The Biden for President Committee is the campaign committee for President Biden and Vice President Harris,” she said. “The funds stay with her so long as she remains on the ticket.”Biden’s decision to step aside and allow a younger generation of Democrats to lead the party is likely to ignite a flood of contributions. For Democrats, that gold rush of cash could not come at a more important time. New FEC filings on Saturday night showed that Donald Trump’s committees reported more cash on hand than Biden’s — erasing the president’s once enormous cash advantage, with Biden’s effort burning through cash far more quickly than Trump’s.Though there is excitement about Harris as the party’s potential nominee among some voters, delegates and donors, others still hope to see a robust competition for the nomination at or before the Democratic National Convention in August. An array of younger Democratic stars have been mentioned as potential competitors for the top slot or the vice-presidential slot, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear.In her own presidential campaign four years ago, Harris struggled to raise money and ultimately withdrew before a single vote had been cast. On Friday afternoon, she conducted a call with some of the party’s top donors on Biden’s behalf. But she showed up about 30 minutes late and was only available for a few minutes. The group had been summoned by tech executive Reid Hoffman, a major Democratic Party donor, and had expected to have a more interesting and informative conversation.“Basically all she said is we are going to win,” one donor said. “Everyone was pissed after the call. It was a complete waste of time.”The person noted that some California donors have long been disappointed with Harris, believing she was unprepared for the White House. Many of the party’s top donors, she added, hope Harris will now tack to the middle — instead of the left — and be more receptive to listening to a broader spectrum of voices about technology and regulatory policy.After Biden threw his support behind Harris on Sunday, some major Democratic donors said they believed the party and its big-dollar supporters would consolidate behind the vice president.“I think the party is behind her,” said Susie Tompkins Buell, a San Francisco philanthropist and co-founder of the Esprit clothing line. She said the mood was shifting even among other major party backers who were initially hesitant about Harris.“This moment of relief and freedom has put them behind Kamala, quite suddenly,” Buell said. “Everybody’s very excited about getting to work to make sure that this candidate has the time, the energy and the money to make this happen. It’s quite a beautiful thing.”Hoffman posted his support for Harris on X: “Kamala D. Harris is the right person at the right time,” he wrote. “Donald Trump and JD Vance are promising an agenda that will wreak havoc on the American people. Harris’s background and leadership growing the economy, fighting for bodily autonomy, and protecting our democracy uniquely position her to push back against Trump’s extremism.”Several campaign finance lawyers noted that, under federal election guidelines, when a presidential candidate withdraws from the race, the dollars in his or her campaign account usually are considered “excess campaign funds” that can be contributed to the Democratic National Committee or to an independent expenditure committee.Another potential wrinkle is that under federal limits, presidential candidates can raise $3,300 for their primary campaign and can also collect $3,300 for the general election. But if they withdraw or lose before making it to the general election campaign, they are required to return those general election contributions to donors — as Hillary Clinton did when she lost the 2008 primary to Barack Obama.Because Harris’s name was listed on the Biden campaign committee’s paperwork — and because she would still be running in the general election if she becomes the party’s nominee — former FEC chairman Trevor Potter said he does not think Harris would have to return those general election contributions.But, Potter added, “that has never been tested, because we’ve never had a situation like this.”Joshua Dawsey contributed to this report."
WaPo_4,Kamala Harris has a career of comebacks. She has 107 days to do it again.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/21/kamala-harris-political-career/,2024-07-22 08:01:02.864516,,"Throughout her history-making and often rocky ascent to the summit of American public life, Kamala D. Harris has shown an uncanny ability to revive her political fortunes.Now she is on the verge of a more momentous test: With just over 100 days before the presidential election, can she revive the fortunes of the Democratic Party?If Democrats choose Harris to replace President Biden atop the ticket, as Biden asked them to do when he announced his withdrawal from the race on Sunday, she would become the first Black woman, and first person of South Asian descent, to be nominated for the presidency by a major party. It would represent a remarkable comeback for a politician who not long ago seemed destined to join the long list of promising state elected officials who flame out on the national stage.Harris stands to become the leader of a party in crisis. Democrats are scrambling after  Biden’s unprecedented decision to decline the nomination only 15 weeks before the general election, with polls showing former president Donald Trump leading in key battleground states. Harris, like Biden, has an approval rating that has not cracked 40 percent this year — a worrisome sign that she may still be carrying the administration’s electoral baggage.On Sunday night, it was still unclear whether the party would coalesce around her as smoothly — or quickly — as she or Biden hope. In recent days, as Biden’s position became less tenable, some Democrats have urged an open nomination process rather than a coronation of the vice president. After Biden’s announcement, Harris said in a statement that she was “honored to have the President’s endorsement” and that “my intention is to earn and win this nomination.”Time is short: Democrats convene in Chicago next month for their convention, but plan to formally nominate their ticket by virtual roll call in early August.If Democrats do elevate Harris as their nominee, they will be placing an extraordinary bet that she is finally ready to deliver on her promise and overcome her uneven history as a campaigner. She has less than four months to win what could be one of the most consequential elections in American history, and must do so against an opponent  willing to stoke sexism and racism to win votes — and who is riding a new wave of adulation within his party after surviving  an assassination attempt this month.However events unfold, Harris and the Democrats are in uncharted territory, said Russell Riley, a presidential historian at the Miller Center at the University of Virginia. Former president Lyndon B. Johnson’s decision not to seek reelection in 1968 — a precedent some have cited in urging Biden to drop out — was announced just over seven months before the general election, setting up a timeline that was languid by comparison.“There is no direct historical analogy that I’m aware of,” Riley said.Historically unprecedented battles are not new to Harris, who has defied expectations, for good and ill, since her earliest days in politics.A former prosecutor who emerged from the ruthless world of San Francisco politics, Harris was once compared to former president Barack Obama. She was written off after her disastrous 2019 presidential bid but got a reprieve with her selection — and largely successful performance — as Biden’s running mate. After the election came a string of unflattering headlines about her alleged mismanagement of the vice president’s office and her sometimes maladroit communication of the president’s agenda, most notably on immigration.Yet in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade two years ago, Harris again seemed to find her footing, returning to her roots in the courtroom as she became the Biden administration’s most effective advocate for women’s reproductive rights.And as Democrats began to panic in June over their 81-year-old nominee’s infirmity after a catastrophic debate performance against Trump, many began to speak of Harris as a practical and perhaps exemplary alternative — a 59-year-old woman prepared to energetically press the case against the former president.Bill Carrick, a veteran Democratic strategist from California who worked for Harris’s principal opponent in her 2016 Senate race, said that watching the vice president barnstorm the country as a Biden campaign surrogate in recent months, he has noted a remarkable improvement.“She’s a better candidate now than she was either as district attorney or attorney general or the presidential candidate from 2019,” he said. “She’s exhibiting a lot of personality and a lot of substance. It’s pretty dramatic.”Ashley Etienne, former communications director to both Harris and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), said that if Harris becomes the nominee she is “almost going to have a clean slate” and needs to make the most of the coming months to tell her story to voters.“Think about the person who is only consuming Fox News,” Etienne said. “Some portion of those people you have to peel off, so she’s going to have to do some introduction and really lay out her own vision.”The Trump campaign has already begun its efforts to tie Harris to Biden, writing in a statement on Sunday, “They own each other’s records, and there is no distance between the two. Harris must defend the failed Biden Administration AND her liberal, weak-on-crime record in CA.”The daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father, Harris was born in 1964 and grew up in Berkeley, Calif. After attending Howard University and the University of California Hastings College of the Law (now known as the University of California College of the Law at San Francisco), she worked as a prosecutor of sex crimes, homicides and other serious offenses in Alameda County and San Francisco.It was a fateful course for her political identity. In 2003 Harris  challenged her old boss, San Francisco District Attorney Terence Hallinan, a leftist lion who, before winning office as the city’s top law enforcement official, had made a name defending countercultural figures such as Anton LaVey, the founder of the Church of Satan.In a three-way race, Hallinan came out ahead in the first round of voting, but Harris came in second and handily won the ensuing runoff election. She won reelection uncontested in 2007, and not long afterward began preparing to run in the 2010 race for attorney general. Her opponent was Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley, a Republican.At a time when the GOP’s statewide electoral prospects in California were not quite so dim, the race was a nail-biter. Harris trailed in the final weeks of the campaign, and as votes were counted on election night Cooley prematurely declared victory. By the next day, as the tallying continued, Harris gained the lead, and after several weeks of counting mail-in and provisional ballots, she won by a less-than-one-point margin.Harris spent six years as the Golden State’s top law enforcement official, focusing on the mix of consumer-protection issues and complex criminal investigations that make up a state attorney general’s portfolio. After longtime Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer announced her retirement in 2015, Harris stepped into the race as the favorite to succeed her, and without strong opponents she easily won.As the junior senator from California, she began to gain a national profile — particularly when she channeled Democratic outrage at the Trump administration in questioning his nominees and members of his administration.  Trump’s attorney general at the time, Jeff Sessions, memorably remarked that Harris’s questions “make me nervous.”Three years after entering the Senate, she joined more than than two dozen Democrats vying for the presidential nomination. Harris started strong, drawing  more than 20,000 people to her campaign launch in front of City Hall in Oakland, Calif.She later drew attention when she chided Biden during a debate for talking about compromises he had made with segregationist senators.“There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day,” Harris said, in what became the most memorable line of her campaign. “And that little girl was me.”But despite her promising start, she struggled to communicate a coherent message that resonated with voters and her bid eventually flatlined. She ran out of cash and withdrew from the race in December 2019.Some veterans of that campaign still have deep misgivings about Harris,  recalling a candidate who refused to prepare for events, was often plagued by indecision and would frequently lash out at staff.“It was the most frustrating period of my life as a political staffer,” one former aide recently said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal campaign dynamics.Biden, the primary’s eventual winner, had vowed to pick a woman as his running mate. Amid calls for racial  equality  after the killing of George Floyd by police, Biden’s allies stressed that he pick not just a woman, but a Black one.Eight months after her campaign for the White House had ended, and in the throes of the coronavirus pandemic, Biden announced Harris as his VP choice. The selection had personal undertones as well as political: Harris was a friend and colleague of Biden’s late son, Beau, when both were attorneys general.It was a successful ticket against Trump, but Harris, as vice president, got off to a rough start. She at times struggled in interviews, such as when she offered a garbled response when NBC’s Lester Holt asked whether she would visit the Southern border to address illegal immigration.By the time she reached the one-year mark, her office had also been rocked by a series of staff departures, including her chief of staff, her chief spokeswoman and her communications director. The resignations reignited questions about why Harris churns through top-level Democratic staff, an issue that has dogged her for almost all of her time in public service.To regain her footing, she brought on Lorraine Voles as chief of staff, who had served in senior roles with Vice President Al Gore and Sen. Hillary Clinton. And observers began to notice a change two years ago, when Harris homed in on conservatives’ efforts to strip away abortion access after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision.Biden, a lifelong Catholic, has struggled to forcefully articulate his party’s position on abortion. Harris, by contrast, had defended abortion access throughout her career and was well-positioned to take up what many Democrats now saw as a winning issue.As he stepped down from the top of the ticket Sunday, Biden tacitly acknowledged his conclusion that Harris is now better poised than he — or anyone else in the party — to meet the moment in a  vital confrontation with Trump.“My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala D. Harris as my Vice President. And it’s been the best decision I’ve made,” Biden said in a statement on  X. “Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this.”Ashley Parker and Josh Dawsey contributed to this report."
WaPo_5,Democrats scramble to endorse Harris and forestall nomination fight,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/21/democrats-scramble-endorse-harris-forestall-nomination-fight/,2024-07-22 08:26:02.864516,,"Top Democratic leaders rushed to endorse Vice President Harris on Sunday, moving to avoid any intraparty dissent over who might succeed President Biden as the party’s nominee following his shocking withdrawal from the campaign.Harris will have huge financial and political advantages as she works to secure the nomination. Biden endorsed her Sunday, and top officials with his campaign made clear that she will inherit his organization. But she still has hurdles to overcome before the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month.To become the first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to head a major-party presidential ticket, Harris will need to win the support of a majority of the nearly 4,000 delegates who pledged to support Biden at the Democratic National Convention. A majority of Democratic state party leaders voiced their support for Harris as the nominee on Sunday evening, and delegations from a handful of states endorsed her.If Harris, or any other candidate who may seek the nomination, does not have enough votes, the convention will become “open,” and Democrats may need to hold several rounds of voting before choosing a nominee. Contenders would jockey behind the scenes for delegate support, campaigning as if the contest were a mini-primary.1/4Some delegates have said they’d like to see an open, democratic process for picking a new nominee rather than immediately anointing Harris. In the days and weeks leading up to Biden’s decision, Democratic lawmakers had conversations about the best path forward. Options included getting behind Harris or using a more open process to choose a new nominee.Some key potential challengers to Harris, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, had previously made clear that they would not run against Harris, and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro endorsed her Sunday.But Harris may not have a totally clear path. An adviser to Sen. Joe Manchin III (I-W.Va.) said Sunday that the senator is considering re-registering as a Democrat to compete for the presidential nomination. The adviser, Jonathan Kott, declined to share more details about Manchin’s plans at this stage.And author Marianne Williamson, who has mounted previous long-shot campaigns to be the Democratic nominee, announced she will again seek the Democratic nomination, citing her desire for an open process.“No one should simply be anointed to the position of nominee,” she wrote on social media Sunday.During an all-staff Biden campaign call Sunday, the president’s campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, opened by restating Biden’s and Harris’s statements and saying the campaign will support Harris’s bid, according to two people on the call who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail private conversations.Rodriguez and Jen O’Malley Dillon, the chair of the Biden campaign, told staff Sunday that the campaign is built to beat Donald Trump “and that is exactly what we are going to do with Vice President Harris leading the way,” a Biden campaign official said. O’Malley Dillon said that everyone on the campaign would remain employed, the campaign official added.O’Malley Dillon emphasized the strength of Biden and Harris’s 2020 coalition and said the campaign will work to bring the same group of voters back into the fold in November to elect Harris. Even before the debate, Biden had shown softening support among key parts of the Democratic coalition, including among progressives, young voters and people of color. Biden-Harris voters in 2020 who said they were unsure about voting for him in 2024 have cited his age, the economy, immigration and his staunch support of Israel’s war in Gaza.Even as Democrats publicly debated whether Biden should step aside, Harris has been extraordinarily careful not to make any moves to prepare for a possible presidential bid. A number of Democratic donors independently organized an effort to start preliminary vetting of potential vice-presidential candidates, but Harris and her team weren’t involved.In the coming days, Harris will have to rally support among Democratic lawmakers and donors, search for a vice-presidential candidate and make her case to voters who are in many cases unsure of what she does. She’ll also have to begin convincing delegates that she’s the right nominee for the party.Daniel Hernandez, 34, a Tucson delegate who has helped the Biden-Harris campaign mobilize LGBTQ+ voters around the nation, was knocking on doors in the sweltering heat to help his sister win her own political campaign for state representative when he learned the news.“It’s really critical that we … make sure that Vice President Kamala Harris becomes the Democratic nominee because she has the best chance at beating Donald Trump in November,” he said. He added there are “a ton of great choices” being proposed for vice president, including Sen. Mark Kelly (Ariz.), Shapiro, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear or North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper.And Donna Secor Pennington, of Muskegon, Mich., a retired school social worker, said she was ecstatic about possibly having a woman at the top of the ticket, especially when it comes to issues of reproductive rights, which have proved to be a winning electoral issue for Democrats.“I don’t know if president — oh see I’m already calling her president — if Vice President Kamala Harris will pick a vice president at the convention,” she said. “But I’ll be supporting her.”Many delegates said they were shocked by Biden’s decision.Maryland delegate Jheanelle Wilkins, a state lawmaker and chair of the Legislative Black Caucus, said she was in disbelief when someone dropped Biden’s letter into a group chat. “I heard so much about the president sticking with the race,” she said. “So I truly thought that he planned to stay.”But, as the shock dissolved, Wilkins began texting other delegates about getting behind Harris.Former Houston mayor Sylvester Turner, a delegate and longtime Texas legislator, said he was still processing the news after days of receiving campaign texts and emails urging him and other mayors to remain committed to Biden. But, he said, he would also back Harris. “For what reason would we step away from the vice president?” he asked.National Democrats had planned to hold a virtual roll call in early August to solidify Biden’s nomination ahead of the Aug. 19 convention in Chicago, citing ballot access deadline concerns. It’s unclear whether they will proceed with that plan and attempt to coalesce support around Harris or if they’ll wait to hold a vote at the convention. On Sunday, delegates in five states — Louisiana, North Carolina, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Tennessee — endorsed Harris.Gilberto Hinojosa, chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, said delegates in his state plan to meet Monday evening to vote on an endorsement. He said that if an overwhelming number of “delegations across the country are wanting the vice president to be the nominee,” the party should move forward with a virtual roll call.“If there’s a big split, which I doubt, then we should leave it to the convention,” Hinojosa said. “But I’m not hearing that.”Biden and Harris have yet to address the nation about the changes at the top of the Democratic Party. She spent most of Sunday afternoon calling congressional Democrats to ask for their support, according to multiple people familiar with the conversations.Harris has called chairs of all House Democratic caucuses — the Congressional Black, Hispanic, Asian Pacific American caucuses, and the Progressive Caucus as well as the New Democrat Coalition — to ask for their groups’ support. Current and former aides have also worked the phones, calling congressional Democrats’ offices to shore up support for her.Many House Democrats refrained from endorsing Harris on Sunday because they wanted Sunday to be about Biden and what Democrats almost uniformly characterized as his selfless and even heroic act of stepping aside to give the party the best chance of defeating Trump in November, according to multiple people familiar with House Democrats’ thinking.Rep. Ann Kuster (D-N.H.), chair of the 100-member House New Democrat Coalition, said Harris called her Sunday. Kuster released a statement in strong support of Harris.“I think we go to the convention and we nominate Kamala D. Harris and then we choose a vice president,” Kuster said in an interview. “And we come roaring out of Chicago and beat Donald Trump.”But Biden’s swift endorsement of Harris spoke to the urgency with which Democrats feel they must unite behind a candidate less than four months until Election Day.“Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year,” Biden said. “Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this.”A few hours after Biden’s announcement, Harris issued a statement thanking Biden for his “selfless and patriotic act” and vowed to campaign vigorously and unite the Democratic Party in the 107 days until Election Day.“I am honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,” Harris said. “Over the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election. And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead.”Harris received endorsements from several high-profile Democratic lawmakers in the wake of Biden’s announcement. The Congressional Black Caucus is expected to endorse Harris, chairman Steven Horsford (D-Nev.) told The Washington Post. Harris, a former CBC member when serving in the Senate, called Horsford on Sunday afternoon after Biden endorsed her.“She wanted me to relay to the members of the CBC that have stood by the president and that have been behind her from the very beginning … that she intends to earn [the nomination] and win it,” Horsford said, adding that Harris sounded “very calm, very measured, very clear-eyed and resolved” during their conversation.Democrats who had been floated as possible candidates to fill a vacancy on the party’s ticket, should one occur, responded to Biden’s news with measured respect Sunday.Kelly, the senator from Arizona, unequivocally endorsed Harris, saying he “couldn’t be more confident that [she] is the right person to defeat Donald Trump and lead our country into the future.” Kelly also praised Biden for his “great humility” in making the decision not to seek reelection.Several other hopefuls did not name Harris — or touch on how the Democratic Party might replace Biden — but focused instead on praising the president’s record.Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D), who last week did not rule out the possibility that Biden could leave the race, warned Americans not ignore “the threat posed by Donald Trump’s potential return to the White House.”A Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll this month found 44 percent of Americans overall said they would be “satisfied” if Biden stepped aside and Harris became the Democratic nominee, including 70 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents.In that same poll, 29 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents volunteered Harris as their choice for the party’s nomination if Biden stepped aside, while 7 percent mentioned Newsom, 4 percent named former first lady Michelle Obama and 3 percent each named Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Whitmer. Half of Democrats didn’t name anyone.Recent polls find little difference between how Harris and Biden stack up against Trump. In a Washington Post average of 11 national polls after the first debate, Harris trailed Trump by 1.5 percentage points while Biden trailed Trump by a similar 1.9 percentage points. Four polls showed Harris polling slightly better than Biden, four slightly worse and three showed no difference.Jacqueline Alemany, Scott Clement, Erin Cox, Alice Crites, Molly Hennessy-Fiske, Meryl Kornfield, Patrick Marley, Nicole Markus, Tyler Pager, Yvonne Wingett Sanchez, Aaron Schaffer, Gregory Schneider and Laura Vozzella contributed to this report."
WaPo_6,"A new Field of Dreams rises in Oakland, the city major sports abandoned",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/21/oakland-ballers-minor-league-baseball/,2024-07-22 08:00:02.864516,,"OAKLAND, Calif. — In a city famously forsaken by professional sports, Opening Day could not come soon enough.Sure, it was just minor league baseball, but what were the majors good for anyway? Lately, all they did was break Oakland’s heart. And the city badly needed a win, on the diamond and off.Enter the Oakland Ballers, a team founded by a pair of Oaklanders who vowed to make something radically different from the succession of clubs that had abandoned the city in recent years. Aching for a fresh start, some of the country’s most passionate sports fans embraced the upstart squad, and they were counting down the days until its sold-out home opener.But before the first pitch could be thrown, the Field of Dreams needed finishing — the team’s rollout had gone so fast that its stadium, a renovated public park, was still under construction just 48 hours before the scheduled debut. The locker rooms had no lockers.Residents — fans — came to the rescue. Responding to a public plea for help, dozens of volunteers flocked to an industrial district in West Oakland to spend their weekend hammering and sweeping, practically willing the team and its park over the finish line.This is what it’s all about, thought Paul Freedman, a Ballers co-founder. The last-minute scramble, which took place over two days in June, was chaotic, but it captured the team’s community-first ethos. Those turncoats from the NFL, the NBA and MLB would never invite their supporters in to build the team’s clubhouse, and their billionaire owners definitely wouldn’t be working alongside them.“This was literally built by Oakland,” Freedman said, walking through the converted warehouse that now serves as team headquarters across from the field.For a place once called “America’s most abused sports city,” where the trust between fans and pro team management has been at an all-time low, this stuff matters.When the major league Athletics made their departure official earlier this year, it capped a painful years-long saga that alienated even the team’s most die-hard fans. The exodus also dealt a blow to the city’s psyche.Oakland, across the bay from San Francisco and perpetually in its shadow, was already having a hard year. With its political establishment in crisis, the budget a mess and concern over crime widespread, the city desperately needed something to rally around.Like the Oakland Roots and Soul, the city’s recently launched men’s and women’s soccer clubs, the Ballers aim to use sport as a salve, a way to heal wounds old and new. That might sound like a lofty goal for a team still finding its footing in the independent Pioneer League, and perhaps it is. But like all fans, Freedman is a true believer.“You count Oakland out at your own risk,” he said. “It’s always been a city that’s been second-guessed. Yet, somehow, this is the place where comebacks start.”Of all the teams to turn their back on Oakland, the A’s hurt the most.The Golden State Warriors, who decamped for San Francisco in 2019, always spanned the Bay Area, aligned with the region more than a city. The Raiders, who left for Las Vegas one year later, had already fled the city once before.But the A’s have played in Oakland — and worn the city’s name on their chests — since 1968, when the club arrived from Kansas City, Mo. They won legions of fans in the 70s and 80s, propelled by legendary players like Reggie Jackson and Rollie Fingers, Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire.And even as success became more elusive, the team still retained its charm. The “Moneyball” era, when the A’s found ways to win despite a limited budget, resonated in a city where so many are under economic pressure, trying to do the most with what they’ve got. And even the decrepit, possum-infested home field, the Coliseum, inspired devotion among a proudly blue-collar fan base.But the team announced in April that it would play its final game in Oakland later this year, before relocating to Sacramento for a few seasons while they await an eventual — although perhaps not definite — move to Las Vegas.“If it was a boxing match, the official was signaling for medical help” after the Warriors and Raiders departed, said Andy Dolich, a former longtime A’s executive and co-author of the book “Goodbye, Oakland,” which documents the city’s history of sports heartbreak.When the A’s move became official, Dolich said, it was “the ultimate K.O.: Knockout Oakland.”The team still has dozens of home games to play, but for hardcore fans, they might as well already be gone.“I was a lifelong A’s fan — until this year,” said Jorge Leon, president of the Oakland ’68s, the first-ever MLB nonprofit supporters group, which organizes events and promotes fan engagement.Leon and the ’68s, once a flag-waving drumbeating staple of the Coliseum’s bleachers, decided to boycott home games this season. Attendance, which had been dropping for years, hit a record low.Meanwhile, the team’s owner, John Fisher — whose quest for maximum profit has driven the relocation campaign, fans say — has become Public Enemy No. 1. Fisher has blamed Oakland officials for not forking over enough public funding to build the team a new stadium, but city leaders say he has been negotiating in bad faith.“It’s just greedy ownership,” said Leon, who helped popularize the “Sell the team” chants that became ubiquitous at A’s games last year.“They don’t see what they’ve got” in the fervent fan base, he said.Team supporters — or former supporters — talk about the move in strikingly intimate terms.“Have you ever lost anybody you’ve ever loved? Someone really close to you?” asked Bryan Johansen, a founder of the Last Dive Bar, a brand that celebrates the Coliseum fan community and is named after a loving moniker once used to describe the stadium.“I’ve got my wife and my son and outside of that, the A’s are the next thing in life,” said Johansen, who has a green and gold Athletics tattoo on his right forearm. “That’s how close emotionally I feel to that team. Them leaving is like losing a family member.”Freedman and his co-founder Bryan Carmel felt this pain, too. But they also saw an opportunity. Suddenly, here was a bona fide major league city, home to thousands of baseball-crazy residents, without a team to cheer for.“Bryan, I’ve got a crazy idea,” Freedman texted his longtime friend last year. “I love crazy ideas,” Carmel responded.And the Ballers were born.Freedman, an entrepreneur, and Carmel, a TV producer, attended high school together in Oakland in the 90s and bonded over sports. They saw a chance to reimagine the way a sports team is run — not as a money machine, but as an important civic institution.This vision helped them raise more than $4 million from local organizations and residents, a tiny fraction of what it costs to buy a team or a stadium in the big leagues, but it was enough to get the Ballers off the ground.“The Ballers is a baseball team, but it’s not a baseball team first,” said Casey Pratt, a Bay Area journalist who has spent his career covering the local sports scene. “It’s a community asset. It’s a way to bring people together.”The Ballers’ hastily-renovated home field sums up that spirit. If the Coliseum was baseball’s last dive bar, Raimondi Park is baseball’s best block party.It all came together improbably fast: The city approved the Ballers’ renovations of the historic municipal park in April, construction began in May and it hosted the first game in June. The team transformed the park from a field unfit for Little Leaguers, across from one of the state’s largest homeless encampments, into what could be a boon for a West Oakland neighborhood that has long suffered from disinvestment.“What I love about the Ballers is they embrace everything about Oakland,” said Anson Casanares, who was born and raised in the city and swapped his A’s fandom for the B’s this year. “They built this whole park so fast, and that’s really hard to do, especially in California and the Bay Area. It shows if you actually care, you can make it happen.”The 4,000-seat stadium is still a work in progress, but for now it has a DIY feel, with pop-up vendors and port-a-potties that even the players use. Eventually, the team envisions a mini Wrigley Field, a community gathering place that brings baseball back to its roots.The best seats in the house are $35 and it costs less than half that to sit in the bleachers, much cheaper than even the lowly A’s. Attendance so far has been uneven but a stream of special promotions continues to win new fans.“It’s essentially a street fair wrapped around a professional baseball game,” said Mike Shapiro, the president of the Pioneer League, which welcomed the Ballers into its lineup of mostly mountain state teams in small towns and cities. “It’s Americana. A lot of things in this country seem to be dissipating, but it’s one of those cultural icons that still exists.”The Ballers have found early success in the league, hovering near the top of the standings all season and seeing several of their newly-recruited players scooped up by MLB teams. Another, pitcher Kelsie Whitmore, made history when she became the first woman to play in the league.And the team itself recently made a historic announcement, unveiling a new ownership model that will give fans the opportunity to invest in the Ballers and receive in return voting rights on key organizational decisions — changes to logos, some front office hires and, crucially, any relocation plans.Freedman calls it “a real seat at the table” for baseball fans who have been mistreated for too long. So far, more than 3,000 people have reserved shares, ranging from less than $500 to more than $10,000. At the end of the day, he said, it’s fan buy-in that matters more than anything.As he spoke, on a recent warm evening, the Ballers were down big to the Northern Colorado Owlz, trailing 15-3 entering the bottom of the 9th inning. Still, fans beat their drums and chanted “Let’s go Oakland,” pushing the city of underdogs to pull off an impossible comeback.The Ballers batters responded with a hit, another hit and a homer, scoring four runs fast. Despite the surge, they came up short. But in a way, it didn’t matter.It was a summer night in West Oakland, and thousands had just watched a pro baseball game — and not for the last time, either. If the Ballers experiment works out, it would mean many, many more seasons of this. And that was victory enough."

WaPo_8,"Biden tweets instead of talks, as Elon Musk seizes on chaotic election",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/21/elon-musk-biden-x-instagram/,2024-07-22 08:00:02.864516,,"President Biden bypassed traditional media in making his stunning announcement that he won’t be on the 2024 ticket, instead posting a letter on X. Elon Musk immediately took a victory lap.“White House aides learned Biden was dropping out by reading X,” tweeted the billionaire social network owner. In a series of further posts in the hours after Biden’s announcement, Musk stressed the social network’s role as a direct channel to convey world events more nimbly than cable news and news sites.The digital delivery of Biden’s historic decision, which was simultaneously posted on Instagram, underscores how social media has reshaped the presidential bully pulpit, becoming the chief news vector for American voters in the most chaotic election cycle of the modern era.X, which has struggled since the world’s richest man bought it in October 2022, has reemerged as a primary source for an American public hungry for swift news updates — especially in the last tumultuous eight days, which included the assassination attempt on Donald Trump, a groundswell of prominent Democrats calling for Biden to drop out of the race, and a pageant-like Republican National Convention where Trump’s nomination was secured.In the almost 21 months since the Tesla CEO took over X, he has introduced changes to the platform that have effectively made it more difficult to separate fact from fiction online. Musk personally endorsed Trump in the hours after the shooting at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, raising questions about the neutrality of the platform as a source for news. Even though X had added custom icons for MAGA adherents to display their support of Trump during the Republican National Convention, the network was essential for Biden in seeking to get the word out on social media.“The last week has solidified the dominant role social media has for political communications and breaking news,” said Katie Harbath, a former Facebook public policy director who is now chief global affairs officer at Duco Experts, a tech consulting firm. “It comes with costs but it is the most efficient way to get news to the most number of people as fast as possible.”Biden was hardly alone in prioritizing social media to share news in recent days. Trump gave his first public response to his assassination attempt on his right-wing platform, Truth Social, where he also announced his choice of Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio as his running mate.Biden’s missive found a large audience online, amassing more than 180 million views and more than 700,000 likes in the first two hours it was online. His Instagram post gained over 1.1 million “likes,” and simultaneous posts on other Meta-owned social networks saw high engagement. Stories to keep you informed

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.In news coverage immediately after Biden’s announcement, journalists including CNN’s Wolf Blitzer remarked on the significance of the president making the announcement directly to his social media following rather than in a televised address from the Oval Office. Biden, who is recovering from covid, said he would “speak to the Nation later this week in more detail about my decision.” X CEO Linda Yaccarino posted that her social network is “where history happens,” in a tweet that was panned by some critics who noted it was also happening on Instagram, Facebook and other platforms. Musk called on leaders to “post directly” on X and “not hand the role to intermediaries.”“Mistakes will be made, but that’s what proves it’s real,” he wrote. “People want authenticity.”The risks of that approach were immediately evident, as conspiracy theories quickly ricocheted on X and other social media platforms immediately after the announcement. Trump’s allies stoked claims that the Democratic Party had staged a coup and questioned whether Biden authorized the post from his X account.“One candidate survived assassination,” tweeted venture capitalist David Sacks, who has organized a San Francisco fundraiser on Trump’s behalf and spoke on behalf of him at the RNC. “The other staged a coup. Your choice, America.”Misinformation researchers warned that Vice President Harris, whom Biden swiftly endorsed to become the Democratic nominee, was uniquely vulnerable to online attacks. Women of color running for office face higher rates of violent threats online, according to a study from the Center for Democracy and Technology.Other social media users posted silly, humorous and irreverent reactions to the news. Video clips of Harris saying “You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?” tore across X — a reference to a 2023 speech Harris gave urging young people to remember their parents and grandparents. Other coconut-themed content took off on social media, including amateur-created political spots for Harris and a post from a D.C.-based nightclub advertising “$5 Piña Kamala Coconut Shots all night long.” Others joked about the need for Harris to pick a White person to be her vice-presidential candidate.Even as social media increasingly shapes the election, top tech companies have made drastic changes to the ways their platforms handle news and politics. Social media platforms are becoming increasingly fractured and decentralized as liberals and conservatives flock to partisan corners of the internet to share and react to current events. X has made the most dramatic transformation, as Musk used the platform to espouse right-wing missives and shaped it into a destination in GOP politics, including for a chorus of powerful business and tech leaders who have also been using the platform to stump for the former president.The result is a platform where conspiracy theories and foreign disinformation spreads with fewer guardrails. After buying it, Musk removed all legacy check marks — Twitter’s years-old way to verify the identity of users — and also began selling the blue marks to anyone willing to pay $8 a month. He also fired Twitter’s trust and safety team, making it easier for harassment and abuse to spread across the platform without accountability.Musk also leverages X as a slingshot against his perceived opponents, and Sunday’s announcement was no exception as he directly taunted other Silicon Valley leaders who hadn’t endorsed Trump, including Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings.After the attempted assassination of Trump last weekend, liberals and conservatives alike flooded social media with partisan conspiracies. Such misinformation may only grow in the wake of Biden’s endorsement of Harris, said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel of the digital rights group Free Press.“In moments this hot and wild, misinfo will surge,” she posted on X."

WaPo_10,James Wood’s big moment blasts the Nationals to a sweep of the Reds,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/21/james-wood-home-run-nationals-sweep-reds/,2024-07-22 08:00:02.864516,,"Circumstance decided James Wood would bat with two outs and two on in the eighth inning of a tie game Sunday afternoon against the Cincinnati Reds. In a rare turn of events, Wood decided to swing at the first pitch.Before tension could build amid the patience typical of the rookie’s at-bats with the Washington Nationals, Wood cracked a go-ahead, three-run homer that never stood a chance of doing anything but clearing the wall in left field at Nationals Park — a fact exemplified by the stare Wood gave from outside the batter’s box as he admired it, his bat still in his hand as the ball landed. That opposite-field thump, which defined Wood’s rapid rise through the minor leagues, and seven solid innings from Jake Irvin gave the Nationals a 5-2 win and their first sweep since mid-June.“I just felt comfortable going up there — I had seen the guy yesterday,” Wood said of Reds left-hander Justin Wilson. “Sometimes [the first pitch] is the best one you’re going to see all day. Just got to be ready for it.”As Wood rounded the bases, his mind went blank. The teams’ proximity in the wild-card standings, though, was on his mind in the clubhouse. With five wins in their past six games, the Nationals have the same record as the Reds — 47-53.“We’re right there with them,” Wood said. “We’re trying to make a push, too, and every game is important.”“This is the time now where things can go two ways,” Manager Dave Martinez said. “Come out flat and you try to work your way to do something special, or you come out with a good running start. I’m glad the boys chose to get a good running start.”To call the moment by Baseball America’s top prospect a given, though, understates the jump he is making from Class AAA. In just his first three weeks in the big leagues, Wood has had plenty that could have derailed his season.Take that he was hitting seventh Sunday, under the guise that it might relax the ever-relaxed 21-year-old at the plate. Or that, since his first big league homer, he entered the eighth-inning at-bat 9 for his past 44 (.205). Or that, between Class AAA Rochester and Washington, Wood has shown a patient approach that benefited him in the minors but has resulted in a bunch of two-strike counts in the majors.Martinez spoke with Wood before the game and told him to be aggressive.“Teams come in, they’ve got a game plan. They find your weaknesses,” the manager said. “But you talk to him? He’s really smart. He understands what he wants to do. Today, it showed.”It didn’t matter that Wood had hit into two hard outs earlier Sunday — he has done so often enough in his young career to have an automated response of “That’s baseball.” In the second inning, the first ball he put in play left his bat at 107.2 mph, and he narrowly reached for an infield single after it ricocheted off Reds starter Andrew Abbott. In the fourth, he hit the ball even harder, a 109-mph laser to left field that, with Wood’s speed, could have gone for three bases if not for a diving catch by Will Benson. And in the sixth, Wood fell victim to another highlight when center fielder Stuart Fairchild leaped against the wall to rob him again.He sauntered back toward the dugout, expressionless. At least he was hitting the ball in the air — and swinging at the right pitches, connecting on fastballs. The first pitch Wilson threw was a high heater, delivered at 94.2 mph. Wood sent it out at 105.9 mph, 404 feet into the seats. As he walked into the dugout, he high-fived shortstop CJ Abrams, the motion knocking the “Uncle Slam” home run hat off his head.The Nationals were only in that position because of Irvin’s excellence; he allowed two earned runs in seven innings with seven strikeouts and no walks. After allowing six earned runs in each of his past two starts before the all-star break, he was back to his old self.“I think the break served as a nice little refresher,” Irvin said. “A reminder to stay grounded, be where your feet are and live in attack mode.”Irvin is used to running into trouble early, so a second-inning solo homer by Noelvi Marte didn’t stress him. Neither did the pressure of trying to hold up with a depleted bullpen, nor the usual lack of run support he has received, nor a brief visit from athletic trainer Paul Lessard in the third inning after he appeared to tweak something in his right leg while fielding a groundball. He got into better counts and used his four-seamer more than usual, generating weak contact.The Nationals struck back in the third, when a two-out double off the left field wall by Juan Yepez (1.007 OPS since arriving July 5) pushed Jacob Young to third. A few pitches later, Reds catcher Austin Wynns tried to catch Young between third and home but overthrew Marte at third base, allowing Young to score; Marte was charged with the error. Harold Ramírez, another midseason addition, singled Yepez home to give the Nationals a 2-1 lead before Irvin allowed another solo shot to Fairchild in the fifth. Wood accounted for the final three runs.“Electric,” Irvin said of Wood’s homer. “He’s something special.”"
WaPo_11,World leaders hail Biden’s ‘brave’ decision to end his 2024 campaign,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/21/biden-drops-out-election-world-reactions/,2024-07-22 08:35:02.864516,,"LONDON — World leaders expressed respect and admiration for President Biden on Sunday after he announced he was ending his reelection campaign, a momentous decision that reshapes the race for the White House and resonated far beyond Washington.Biden, a longtime member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee before ascending to higher office, developed and nurtured relationships with many world leaders over the course of decades.Israeli officials were among the first to offer their praise, with President Isaac Herzog thanking Biden for his “friendship and steadfast support” and hailing the 81-year-old as “a true ally of the Jewish people” in a post on X.1/4Since the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, Biden has been a staunch supporter of Israel’s war in Gaza, though he has also clashed repeatedly with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over humanitarian aid deliveries and the toll of the conflict on Palestinian civilians. Netanyahu, who is scheduled to land in Washington on Monday and address Congress on Wednesday, had no immediate reaction to Biden’s announcement.Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant thanked Biden for his “unwavering support” and said the president’s “steadfast backing” in the war against Hamas has been “invaluable.”Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid kept his response brief, posting an image of himself grinning and fist-bumping Biden alongside the caption: “Thank you.”Biden has also been a firm backer of Ukraine and its efforts to repel Russia’s 2022 invasion, supplying Kyiv with American weapons and diplomatic support despite mounting opposition from congressional Republicans.“He supported our country during the most dramatic moment in history, assisted us in preventing Putin from occupying our country, and has continued to support us throughout this terrible war,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was circumspect, noting that “a lot can change” in the four months until voters go to the polls in November. Russia will “pay attention and watch what happens next,” he added.In the United Kingdom, new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he respected Biden’s decision.Stories to keep you informed

One of his final stops was at Mayo Roscommon Hospice, where a plaque commemorates his late son Beau Biden, who died of brain cancer in 2015.“Mr President, Ireland will protect the piece of your son Beau’s legacy that you left in County Mayo,” Harris wrote Sunday.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called Biden’s decision “brave and dignified” and credited him for supporting Ukraine against Russian aggression. “A great gesture from a great president who has always fought for democracy and freedom,” Sánchez tweeted on Sunday.Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala described Biden’s move as a “difficult step” and expressed hope that a “good president” will emerge from a race between two “strong and equal candidates” in November.Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, commended Biden for another difficult decision in a long career of them and for making “democracy stronger.”Kosovo Deputy Prime Minister Donika Gërvalla-Schwarz, meanwhile, singled out Biden’s “leadership of the West.”As Biden endorsed Vice President Harris to take his place at the top of the ticket, and Washington wrestled with the sweeping implications of his decision to step aside from the race, Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics summed up the reaction of many: “Politics has never been so interesting,” he wrote on X.Seth reported from New York.

WaPo_12,Biden dropped out. This is how it happened.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/21/biden-drop-out-how-it-happened/,2024-07-22 08:00:02.864516,,"President Biden called Vice President Harris on Sunday to tell her directly.He spoke one-on-one with Jeff Zients, his White House chief of staff, and Jen O’Malley Dillon, his campaign chair.Zients then convened Biden’s White House and campaign senior staff for a 1:45 p.m. call, so that Biden could tell those who had worked closest with him he was abandoning his dream of a second term.As Biden spoke on that call, a letter announcing his intentions went live online. The chief of staff followed up with Zoom calls for the Cabinet and those in the White House with the rank of assistant to the president.“There is so much more to do — and as President Biden says, ‘there is nothing America can’t do — when we do it together,’” Zients wrote the entire White House team at 2:26 p.m.1/4There were mutterings that it was coming. But until it was done, many of the people who work for the campaign and the White House only assumed something had to happen — some pivot, some admission of reality — but they did not know what, when or how. The map was expanding in the wrong direction. The party had turned. The money was drying up. The polls in must-win states had gone from bad to worse.This story is based on interviews with more than a dozen Democratic insiders from the campaign, the White House and Capitol Hill, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.Biden huddled through the weekend with a small crew of family and advisers in Rehoboth Beach, Del.: White House counselor Steve Ricchetti, senior campaign adviser Mike Donilon, deputy chief of staff Annie Tomasini and senior adviser to the first lady Anthony Bernal, all of whom were at the president’s vacation house.Everyone else plowed forward, swearing publicly that none of that was happening, telling those that worked for them to not stop. O’Malley Dillon had laid down that marker Friday, when she went on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” and abruptly silenced the growing speculation that his exit was imminent. The feedback from door-knocks by campaign workers was good, she said. The campaign was humming. The president was determined.“He’s not going anywhere,” she said.That was followed by a tense high-dollar donor call Friday afternoon that left many of the party’s top money people fuming. Calling from the road, Harris joined the Zoom late for just a few minutes — boasted of the campaign’s efforts in Michigan and Wisconsin, expressed confidence in victory and then signed off, according to a person on the call. All the donor questions were left unasked and unanswered.Donors left frustrated because “it was like we didn’t have eyes and couldn’t see what was going on,” another person on the call said.It was a bold and definitive posture. Yet it was read by many inside the Democratic political world less as a final word, more like an extension of respect that the president was owed. This decision was always Biden’s to make. From the earliest days of the crisis, people close to Biden would contact those who went public with their dismay.He deserved “grace,” was their message. Give him his space.That created weeks of mixed signals, amid clearly deteriorating conditions. Ricchetti and Donilon were both full-steam ahead during the Republican convention all the way through Friday, said one person familiar with the conversations. Ricchetti got to the house Friday. Donilon arrived Saturday. They met Saturday evening, according to another person familiar with the events. Inside the campaign, the polls late last week had deteriorated further. The president, suffering from covid, was briefed on the data.“The poll numbers they got recently were very sobering for them,” this person said. “They wanted to stop the bleeding, to give him time to think about what he wants to say. … It was so relentless. Every day it was a new person.”The campaign continued to plan new trips and fundraisers for Biden on Saturday. A fundraising email for the Biden-Harris ticket was emailed out Sunday even after Biden had published his letter announcing his decision.In fact, Biden had all but made up his mind Saturday night, said the person briefed on the events. He then went to bed. When he awoke, he did one more gut check before moving forward.Biden made his decision feeling certain that he did not have a viable path forward. But he remained upset at Democratic lawmakers and party strategists who had begun to publicly come forward to push him out.A member of Congress said that Biden is “deeply betrayed and upset” at all the people he thought were friends. The member said Biden had been receptive to arguments about polling and his legacy, but it took him some time, and that most staff were not in the loop.Among much of the senior campaign leadership, the harsh reality had long ago been accepted. But people continued to speak on his behalf, routinely denouncing the anonymous sources describing what was happening.A congresswoman said Biden had “honest talks” with his team this weekend about the polling, which was seemingly getting worse by the day. Democrats on Capitol Hill were also restless. Dozens of lawmakers had held off on going public, both out of respect for the president and in fear of the political risks of doing so. But many were discussing the best way to come forward in the coming week if Biden did not exit the race by the weekend, according to several people familiar with the discussions.They were not, however, willing to bend to his will. Democrats in the Senate — where Biden served for 36 years — were being especially careful but had begun discussing whether to come out as a group or one after another, to arrange a number of senators to meet with Biden privately and urge him to exit or else warn that they would go public if he did not respond to their concerns, according to the people.A number of his aides said on Sunday they were upset by being kept in the dark, having been told Friday and Saturday to keep fighting for his candidacy. Some were even working on Sunday morning, preparing for the morning shows, and heading back to Wilmington for the week.As of Sunday afternoon, it was still unclear when exactly Biden would address the nation directly. He was still suffering from covid symptoms, including a hoarse voice, said one person familiar with the situation, and they suspected Biden and his team would wait until he sounded better for any public remarks.Among Democratic lawmakers, there is disagreement about the best path forward. Biden’s endorsement of Harris is likely to stymie discussion over whether another candidate would be better positioned to beat Trump. But before his endorsement, many lawmakers had concerns over Harris’s ability to take on Trump — in part because of mixed internal polling data, according to two Democratic senators — and were interested in exploring the possibility of an open convention.Others in Biden’s inner circle believe there is no option, no time to restart and restaff a campaign, which Harris will likely be able to inherit directly barring some legal challenges. One donor said there would be a push for an open process, and that Biden’s announcement of his endorsement of Harris had been a letdown.“People were thrilled for that brief period between the first Biden announcement and the second,” this person said.But that was tomorrow’s worry. Enough had already changed.“I need a drink,” one campaign staffer wrote in a text message, just after 2 p.m."
WaPo_13,Xander Schauffele shouts his versatility by soaring above at the British Open,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/21/xander-schauffele-british-open-champion/,2024-07-22 08:00:02.864516,,"TROON, Scotland — On a course adjacent to an airport, a 30-year-old golfer from San Diego seemed to leave the ground Sunday and commence gliding above as if oblivious to the fray below. His back nine, so artful and tranquil, felt almost as if he had used the runway just behind No. 10 to start floating overhead like one of those lazy-day planes, the engine barely audible but its hum clearly untouchable. In a callous sport with a furious week of weather, the clear winner wound up looking downright pristine.Among the many paths to winning golf majors, there’s the one where the mastery looks just about spotless, and that’s the one Xander Schauffele took to his deeply calm win at the 152nd British Open. It’s not just that his final-round 65 and his back-nine 31 stood as the best numbers of the 80 players at Royal Troon or that they provided a two-shot win at 9 under par after he started one shot back. It’s how it looked and felt, and it looked and felt like something even the imagination wouldn’t dare entertain. Schauffele wound up disconnected from a bunched leader board, from his bygone image as a chronic contender who couldn’t quite reign and from all known reasonable limitations going forward.“A wonderful next 10 years,” his father and first coach, Stefan, predicted without committing hubris or nonsense.The hard facts said Xander Schauffele, who couldn’t snare any of his first 27 tries at majors despite 12 top-10 finishes, went and snared two of the past three. They said he became the first male player since Brooks Koepka in 2018 to win two majors in one season and the first since Rory McIlroy in 2014 to win the PGA Championship and the British Open. They said he joined with a dizzying haste those in this era with two major titles — from No. 1 Scottie Scheffler to Jon Rahm to Collin Morikawa to Bryson DeChambeau to Justin Thomas, among others — but, better than that, he has joined players such as Morikawa and Zach Johnson among those whose two major titles include one here on the links, shouting his versatility.They said all that, but Sunday’s round said something else with its outlying cleanliness. It told of a guy whose breakthrough in May in Louisville had taken his trademark calm from considerable to mighty. With his game in the clouds on a gray day featuring cool air ideal for a long walk on the beach by the course, he found his way to No. 18, where he saw the “yellow leader boards” of his prior dreams, asked caddie Austin Kaiser to join him in his walk and said to himself, “You’re about to have your moment here.”He led by three. Two groups behind him still had to finish. This did not seem all that relevant. Asked later to rank his round, Schauffele said: “At the very tiptop. Best round I’ve played.”“Oh, my God,” Kaiser said. “It just keeps coming. Wow. He played unbelievably. This is probably the best round he’s ever played.”The back-nine birdies Sunday on Nos. 11, 13, 14 and 16, separating him from playing partner Justin Rose, third-round leader Billy Horschel, upstart Thriston Lawrence, a fading Scheffler and the rest, looked almost light and airy even from 16 feet (No. 13) and 13 feet (No. 14). They looked as if they were designed to ratify a post-win conversation Kaiser recalled from May among his buddies just after the PGA Championship, when one said to Schauffele, “Do you feel lighter?” Schauffele replied, “Yeah, I do.” His chip over a bunker to No. 16 looked frightening as he began it and gorgeous as he fashioned it. It said hello to the hole and cuddled four feet away.Even Rose’s caddie, Mark Fulcher, found it “nice to be able to not pay for a ticket and to watch it because it was fantastic.” He said of Schauffele: “He’s also quite nice, too. You’d almost like him to be a bit of a wanker,” but he’s “a top-notch guy.”“He seemed he was in control of everything,” Kaiser said of an event at which the wind off the Firth of Clyde left nobody in control of anything until it eased Sunday at last.“I thought [the breakthrough win] would help me,” Schauffele said in an on-course interview, “and it actually did. I had this sense of calm, a calm I didn’t have when I played the PGA.” He said at his news conference, “I kind of grabbed on to it, and there was no chance I was going to let go of it.”Rose shot a fine 67 to finish tied for second at 7 under, then said of Schauffele, “He plays with a freedom, which kind of tells you as a competitor that he’s probably not feeling a ton of the bad stuff.” Horschel shot a fine 68 to tie Rose, then said of Schauffele, “He’s the second-best player in the world.” As Schauffele lifted off, it almost became a secondary tournament as Lawrence impressed with a 68 to end up at 6 under, Russell Henley had a 69 to make 5 under, Shane Lowry recovered from his aching 77 of Saturday to shoot a 68 and get to 4 under, and Scheffler menaced one or two strokes back until he reached No. 9 and three-putted from 6 feet 7 inches to draw a double bogey and commiserating groans from the crowd bunched around.He wound up tied for seventh at 1 under as even he — the first player since Arnold Palmer in 1962 to win an unthinkable six events by this point of the year, one of those the Masters — became a muffled sideshow set against Schauffele’s undisturbed excellence. Suddenly, the subject went from Scheffler’s dominance to Schauffele’s completeness.“I don’t know if that’s true or not,” Schauffele said of the “complete” part, “but I’m definitely going to believe that’s true because here we are. ... It’s a completely different style of golf. It makes you play shots and have different ball positions. There’s so much risk-reward when the wind’s blowing 20 miles an hour and it starts raining [as it did Saturday]. There’s so many different variables that come into play. It truly is an honor to win this. To me, it’s big. To me, winning the Scottish Open [in 2022] was big because it meant my game could travel. So to double that up and win a major in Scotland is even cooler.”He had gone and won two majors of completely different tenor, one so sick with birdies in the sun that it required a score of 21 under to conquer and one so rife with windy inconvenience that it told something about sturdiness. He had done one with an admirable quash of trembling and one with an enviable depth of calm. “We knew that, though,” his father said. “See, that we knew because he had seconds in everything. So we knew the versatility, right?” He concluded: “Who is the greatest threat or potential for the next career Grand Slam? I would say, ‘Just look at the numbers.’”One of the numbers showed “65” on that dreamy yellow leader board late Sunday, its hand-placed letters carried the message “WELL PLAYED XANDER,” and a young man known as shy and affable held the claret jug before a phalanx of photographers. He kept smiling calmly, rather than his electric grins of Louisville. It appeared that, technically, he had come back to earth."
WaPo_14,"Ahead of Monday hearing, more lawmakers call on Secret Service director to resign",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/07/21/secret-service-congress-trump-rally/,2024-07-22 08:32:02.864516,,"The embattled director of the U.S. Secret Service, Kimberly Cheatle, is facing new calls to resign from what has become a bipartisan group of lawmakers after news that top agency officials repeatedly denied requests for additional resources and personnel sought by former president Donald Trump’s security detail.The Washington Post first reported on Saturday the news about the rejected requests — several times made in writing — as well as the agency’s acknowledgment that it had indeed denied some requests for additional security for Trump’s detail in the two years leading up to his attempted assassination at a rally in Pennsylvania after a spokesman had several days earlier insisted otherwise.Cheatle is scheduled to appear Monday morning at a House Oversight Committee hearing. Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), who chairs the committee, said on Fox News on Sunday morning that the hearing “will serve as the beginning of that process to get answers for the American people as to what went wrong with an agency that has a no-fail mission.”Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.) on Saturday became the first Democrat in Congress to call for Cheatle’s resignation. In a statement shared on social media, he wrote, “The evidence coming to light has shown unacceptable operational failures.”A gunman was able to fire rounds from an AR-15-style rifle from a rooftop about 150 yards from the former president at the July 13 rally. Trump was injured, a man in the crowd was killed, and two more were wounded. Cheatle has said several times that she will not resign but said that she takes responsibility for her agency’s failure to prevent the attack.On Sunday evening, Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas of the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Secret Service, appointed a bipartisan panel to conduct a 45-day review of the security failures leading to the assassination attempt on Trump. The four-member panel is made up of Janet Napolitano, former Homeland Security secretary; Frances Townsend, homeland security adviser to President George W. Bush; Mark Filip, a former federal judge who served on a similar review of the Secret Service in 2014; and David Mitchell, the former superintendent of Maryland State Police.President Biden ordered the independent investigation a day after the July 13  shooting. The findings and recommendations will be made public.Cheatle has been in extensive hearing preparation for the past two days and is not planning to resign immediately, according to two U.S. officials with knowledge of her preparation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) called on Biden to fire her.“We absolutely must ensure accountability so the American people can trust that this job will be done, that we will protect our presidents and former presidents. It’s the number-one job of the Secret Service, not anything else. And I think Director Cheatle has shown the world and said that she has different priorities,” he said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” “She needs to go.”The chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Michael R. Turner (R-Ohio), on Sunday described the security failures as “absolutely outrageous and incredible.”“Is this a failure of resources? Is this a failure of protocols or a failure of management? And it appears that now we know that it’s all three,” Turner, who is also calling on Biden to fire Cheatle, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”On Fox, Comer said the Secret Service has a budget of more than $3 billion, contending that it was “more than enough to provide adequate protection for the presidential candidate. So we have a lot of questions as to how they’re managing their money.”Other congressional committees are investigating the shooting as well. Rep. Mark Green (R-Tenn.), chair of the House Committee on Homeland Security, has requested documents, details and a briefing of the security plan for Trump’s Pennsylvania rally. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, announced a separate investigation.Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told Fox News’s “Sunday Morning Futures” that he plans to issue a preliminary report on his work as the top Republican on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.Ron Johnson said his Democratic counterpart on the subcommittee, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), “completely agrees with me that we must start doing transcribed interviews with all the witnesses now while memories are fresh.”Some Republicans gave oxygen to unfounded theories surrounding the assassination attempt.Ron Johnson raised the possibility of a second shooter, a theory that originated online and that conflicts with information released by law enforcement about the shooting.“I’m not an expert, … but we can’t trust the FBI and Secret Service to do an honest and open, transparent investigation,” he said.Eric Trump, one of the sons of the former president, said in an interview on “Sunday Morning Futures” that he has said “several times” that there should be more security for his father.There was “no politics involved,” he said, in the issue of growing concerns about Cheatle’s competence in leading the agency. But he then suggested without evidence that Democrats were somehow involved in the assassination attempt.Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Tex.) said on “Sunday Morning Futures” that he had spoken “months and months ago” to Trump’s detail, who told him that they were unsatisfied with the resources being provided by their agency and thought it was “politically motivated.”Trump advisers’ anger deepened after the agency publicly denied that any requests for additional security requested by Trump or his detail had ever been rejected.“I was in the meeting with the Secret Service director with the president this [past] week, and she has a lot to answer for,” Jackson said. “She lied to me in the meeting. I asked her specifically if they had backed down or denied resources for the president at any point, and she said no.”Josh Dawsey and Maria Sacchetti contributed to this report."
WaPo_15,"9 alternatives for Democrats, should they not choose Harris",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/21/replace-biden/,2024-07-22 08:32:02.864516,,"Democrats entered uncharted and uncertain territory Sunday after President Biden announced that he is ending his reelection campaign just weeks before the Democratic Party was set to formally nominate him.On the one hand, they got what many in the party wanted: Biden out. On the other, the process for what comes next is a big question — and a potentially difficult one.An avalanche of Democrats expressing concerns about Biden’s ability to defeat former president Donald Trump, as he did in 2020, caused Biden to act. The push began after his stumbling debate performance June 27 and amid a series of continued uneven public appearances and polls that showed Biden losing ground in key swing states and about half of Democrats wanting a different nominee.As for where we go from here?By far the most likely outcome is that the next in line — Vice President Harris — steps up. Democrats, including Biden, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and the Congressional Black Caucus, quickly sought to close ranks around her as the party’s nominee. But Barack Obama, for one, didn’t immediately endorse her.And not everyone is convinced that clearing the field for Harris is the best course, both because it would look like a coronation and because of uncertainty about the unpopular Harris’s own prospects. Harris’s approval rating has often been double-digits lower than her disapproval rating, and she polls little better than Biden against Trump, at least thus far. (Harris, for her part, says she intends to “earn” the nomination, without specifying what that means.)Beyond that, Democrats will need to slot in at least one additional candidate on the ticket, even if it’s just for vice president. Many names will probably circulate for both spots.Let’s run through the options, adapted from our previous list, in rough order of plausibility. To be clear, Democrats will turn to many of these names only if the party decides Harris isn’t up to the task; some of the would-be alternatives are even backing her already.The Michigan governor said she wasn’t interested, at least when this was in the realm of the hypothetical. But pressure might be brought to bear, given how many boxes she checks for the party.
She’s a female governor who hails from a crucial state where a poll Sunday showed Biden trailing by seven points. (Democrats probably need to hold Midwestern swing states, given their problems in other swing states). She has won both of her races there by around 10 points. Polling this year has shown her approval rating in Michigan between 54 percent and 61 percent. And she’s more experienced and has more of a national profile than a lot of other rising-star Democratic governors, such as Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore.
Harris aside, she probably makes more sense than anybody else — at least on paper.
Biggest pro: Swing-state popularity and experience.
Biggest con: Lack of apparent interest — at least yet.

Because of his relatively new status on the national stage, many have posited that Shapiro is more of an option for 2028. But it would seem hard for Democrats to ignore polls like one earlier this year showing that more than 3 in 10 Pennsylvania Trump supporters approve of him.

And if the party is looking for the antithesis of Biden’s inability to drive a message against Trump, it’s Buttigieg. His jousting with Fox News hosts and Republicans at congressional hearings is often shared widely in Democratic circles, as was a clip this past weekend criticizing GOP vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance. Buttigieg is a gifted messenger.
If there’s a big drawback with Buttigieg, it’s that he appears to be the wrong candidate to try to arrest the Democratic ticket’s budding problem with diverse — and especially Black — voters. He got very little support from such groups in 2020. And his tenure as transportation secretary hasn’t always been a smooth ride.

Newsom has some of the same attributes as Buttigieg in terms of taking the fight to Trump and the Republicans.
But he previously said he wouldn’t challenge Harris.

That’s owing to the fact that the Kentucky governor was up for reelection in 2023 and won in a very red state.
He’d be a big contrast to Biden on the age front (he’s just 46), and he has intriguing bipartisan appeal, having succeeded in his state without straying too much to the right. (We often see that Democratic governors in red states and GOP governors in blue states marginalize themselves with the national party by having to take positions that are out of sync.) He even played up his support for abortion rights during the 2023 campaign — something previously unthinkable.
He also reportedly is taking the kinds of steps you would expect from someone with national ambitions. And he would be a pragmatic pick, perhaps even more than Shapiro. But it’s not clear how he would play with liberal base voters whom Democrats need to inject with enthusiasm.
Biggest pro: The broadness of his potential appeal.

He has also won big — by double digits in 2018 and nearly 20 points in 2022. And he has clearly expressed interest in going national one day.

But he has shown some interest in going national. And one potential advantage he has if the race expands beyond Harris: He’s very wealthy — as in, in the billions. There are questions about just how practical it would be for a candidate to enter the race this late and be able to put together the funds to run a national campaign. The ticket apparently can’t get the Biden campaign’s money unless Harris is on it.

It’s difficult to see how Democrats would go with a pretty conservative Democrat — someone who, after all, saw fit to leave the party just two months ago. But perhaps there’s an argument to be made that nobody could have more crossover appeal. And Manchin has plenty of executive experience as a former governor.
It would be pretty shocking, though, and you could be forgiven for thinking Manchin is trying to make a point about not having a coronation.
Biggest pro: He apparently might actually run — the only person on this list who has indicated as much.
Biggest con: He’s out of step politically with the vast majority of Democrats.

Wes Moore, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. Raphael G. Warnock (Ga.).

Then there is Michelle Obama — the fantasy option for Democrats. The odds of her actually stepping forward appear minuscule.

But perhaps there’s an argument to be made that nobody could have more crossover appeal. And Manchin has plenty of executive experience as a former governor.It would be pretty shocking, though, and you could be forgiven for thinking Manchin is trying to make a point about not having a coronation.Biggest pro: He apparently might actually run — the only person on this list who has indicated as much.Biggest con: He’s out of step politically with the vast majority of Democrats.Other possibilities: If this process is swung open somehow, you could see other names pop up.

Harris vowed in a statement to defeat Donald Trump. Biden said in a letter to fellow Americans on Sunday that “it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President.” Harris was calling fellow Democrats on Sunday to shore up support.
WaPo_17,"The next big 2024 questions, post-Biden",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/21/campaign-moment/,2024-07-22 09:38:03.174739,,"Welcome to The Campaign Moment, your guide to the big developments in the 2024 election — and now the biggest development yet.(If you haven’t already, make sure to sign up for this newsletter here. I’d also be obliged if you would check out the Campaign Moment podcast.)I am ripping up my assumptions about the 2024 election, and you should too. It turns out it won’t be the much-dreaded rematch of 2020 that we have all spent months anticipating and planning for, after all.President Biden made the historic decision Sunday to end his campaign amid concerted pressure from his party to reconsider it. His decision comes weeks before Democrats are due to formalize their ticket in Chicago.The unprecedented move leaves Democrats an extremely abbreviated period during which to figure out what to do next.By far the likeliest outcome is nominating Vice President Harris. Many big-name Democrats quickly endorsed her, including Biden, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and a few big-name potential rivals. But it’s still early, and even how Harris would be nominated is up in the air.Here are the big questions I have about what lies ahead in the days and weeks to come.Who takes over?This is, of course, the big one. Harris is the strong favorite — both because she’s next in line and because that’s the expedient move, both politically and practically.It would be fraught to bypass the first female and first Black vice president, particularly with Democrats struggling to hold on to their dominance among Black voters. She also has easy access to Biden’s large campaign war chest, which was quickly turned over to her — a huge factor in all this. And after weeks of uncertainty, you can bet Democrats would like to just be done with the top of the ticket.But not everyone is closing ranks yet; Barack Obama didn’t quickly endorse Harris, for one. Sen. Joe Manchin III (I-W.Va.) is considering rejoining the Democratic Party and running.And it’s not exactly a no-brainer. Harris is not a popular vice president, and recent polls suggest she doesn’t perform much better against Donald Trump than Biden did. (The Post’s polling average shows her trailing by 1.5 points in polls conducted after the debate, compared to Biden’s 1.9-point deficit.) Her own 2020 campaign was a disappointment.I’m not getting the sense that too many in the party want to throw things open yet. But if they ultimately decide to — or if Harris falters — here’s my full list of plausible alternatives. Many of those same names will be in the mix for vice president, should the path remain clear for Harris, or as someone else’s running mate, if it doesn’t.What is the process?Harris signaled Sunday that she intends to “earn and win” the Democratic nomination. Exactly what it will mean to “earn” it, we don’t yet know.Ultimately, this will be up to Democratic National Convention delegates, who are no longer bound to Biden or any other candidate. But Democrats need to figure out what kind of process they’ll use to get to that point.They have a dilemma on this front. There is little time to figure things out — their convention begins Aug. 19 — but clearing the field for Harris risks looking like a coronation. And if she is just handed the nomination, it won’t do much to tamp down concerns about her prospects. Some, like Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) and Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.), are withholding support from Harris in favor of a brief contest of some sort.For now, the big questions are whether they will hold some kind of “mini primary”— and how that would even look — along with precisely when the ticket will be formalized. Party leaders have spent weeks saying they needed to virtually nominate Biden by Aug. 7 because of supposed uncertainty about ballot access. But some in the party had dismissed that as a pretext to jam Biden through.Sticking to that accelerated timeline would surely cut down on how robust the process is. And to the extent delegates actually have a choice, debating the nominee virtually rather than in person is far from an ideal setup.How does Harris play in the days to come?Just as we all watched the polls like hawks after Biden’s stumbling June 27 debate performance, so too will our gazes be fixed upon them in the days ahead. They will go a long way toward determining how confident Democrats will feel about Harris.Yes, she polls little better than Biden right now, and yes, her 2020 campaign didn’t go well. But vice presidents’ brands are often tied to the presidents they serve, and she now has a chance to reintroduce herself to a lot of people who didn’t pay much attention to her before. A Democratic optimist might also point out that running a primary campaign isn’t quite the same thing as appealing to general-election voters.The first poll conducted after Sunday’s news, from YouGov, showed 37 percent of Democrats supported Harris, 35 percent wanted someone else, and the rest were undecided. That is not resounding, but it reinforces her as the favorite.It’s plausible she gets a bump soon. Virtually every Democratic Senate candidate in the country has polled better than Biden, and often significantly better. That might suggest that a standard-issue presidential nominee without Biden’s age and acuity concerns might do better than him when the choice comes into focus.Harris’s biggest task now is capitalizing on this massive opportunity.What happens next with Biden?Biden quickly signaled he intends to continue serving, saying in his statement that he wanted to “focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president.” Republicans are calling for him to resign.Despite the arguments Republicans, including GOP vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance, make, Democrats saying that Biden should drop out because he can’t win isn’t the same as conceding he must resign.But there is no question that Biden’s recent performances and now his bowing out will seed questions about whether he is up to his day job. Some Democrats have gone further than just questioning Biden’s campaign prowess; Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) wrote that Biden didn’t appear to recognize him recently, while Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-Wash.) suggested Biden should resign.Some have also argued that Biden’s resigning would give Harris a leg up as an incumbent president. But she would also have to combine a very late campaign entry with taking over as leader of the free world, which is no small task.Beyond that, how much of a presence is Biden in the closing days of his presidency? Is he freed up now that campaign concerns aren’t front and center? And how much does he campaign for Harris?While an exit by a presidential candidate at this late juncture is unprecedented, we have seen a few somewhat analogous situations.They haven’t generally gone well for the party looking to make the switch.One is President Lyndon B. Johnson bowing out of his reelection bid in March 1968, shortly after Robert F. Kennedy jumped into the primary race. Hubert Humphrey (D) won the nomination after Kennedy was assassinated, and wound up narrowly losing the popular vote to Richard M. Nixon but losing the electoral college by a wide margin, 301-191.Four years later, Democrats had to replace vice-presidential nominee Thomas Eagleton two weeks after their convention amid disclosures about his having undergone electroshock therapy for depression. It’s the only comparable modern example of a switch of some kind this late. George McGovern’s (D) campaign soon replaced Eagleton with Sargent Shriver, before losing in a landslide to Nixon.We’ve also, of course, seen parties fret about the prospects of incumbent presidents without replacing them, including Gerald Ford in 1976 and Jimmy Carter in 1980. Both faced significant primary challenges; both times, the fretting party went on to lose.This is a small sample size featuring examples with key differences. And the 2024 polls remains close. But of course, feeling the need to do something this drastic is anything but a sign of strength for Democrats."

In a Washington Post average of 11 post-debate polls, Trump edged out Harris by 1.5 percentage points, only slightly less than his 1.9-point lead over Biden in the same polls.A Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll this month found 70 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents saying they would be “satisfied” if Biden stepped aside and Harris became the Democratic nominee.In that same poll, 29 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents volunteered Harris as their choice for the party’s nomination if Biden stepped aside in an open-ended question, while 7 percent mentioned California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), 4 percent named former first lady Michelle Obama and 3 percent each named Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D). Half of Democrats didn’t name anyone specific as an alternative to Biden.Earlier in July, the Economist and YouGov polled Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents on potential replacement candidates for Biden. Harris had the highest net approval rating out of the Democrats tested.Other potential candidates, like Whitmer and Newsom, had similarly low disapproval ratings, but a much larger share of Democrats did not know who they were.Beyond Biden, many other prominent Democrats have already rallied around Harris. However, she still needs to be selected by Democratic delegates to become the party’s nominee. Read more about the process here.Scott Clement and Reuben Fischer-Baum contributed to this report."

WaPo_20,Biden makes stunning decision to pull out of 2024 race,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/21/joe-biden-drops-out/,2024-07-22 10:59:03.054161,,"REHOBOTH BEACH, Del. — President Biden abruptly ended his reelection campaign Sunday, sending shock waves through the political world and plunging the Democratic Party into an unprecedented scramble to choose a new nominee to face former president Donald Trump.“It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,” Biden, 81, wrote in a letter he posted to social media Sunday afternoon. “And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.”In a separate social media post Sunday, Biden endorsed his vice president, Kamala D. Harris, to replace him as the Democratic Party’s standard-bearer ahead of its national convention Aug. 19-22.“Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year,” Biden said in a post shared on X. “Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this.”Biden’s exit leaves his party in an almost unprecedented position just months ahead of the Nov. 5 election. In a presidential race that has already been rocked by a felony conviction and an assassination attempt, the latest plot twist added to the sense of tumult that has gripped the nation’s politics this year.Even as the party appeared to be coalescing around Harris on Sunday, some lawmakers were advocating for a more open process to allow other potential candidates to compete for the nomination, further highlighting the turbulent impact of Biden’s decision. Harris, a former senator from California, would bring her own liabilities to the race against Trump, whom Democrats consider an existential threat to democracy. Her approval ratings have largely mirrored the decline of Biden’s since 2021, and her campaign in the 2020 presidential primary fell apart before voting began.Notably, former president Barack Obama did not endorse Harris in his statement, which praised Biden and suggested that Democrats would ultimately find “an outstanding nominee.”In a statement Sunday, Harris said she would be seeking to “unite the Democratic Party” and win the presidency.“I am honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,” she said.Harris, 59, is the first woman, Black person and Asian American to serve as vice president, and now she has the opportunity to become the country’s first female president. She received a rapid flow of endorsements Sunday from top Democrats, including dozens of lawmakers, multiple governors, key interest groups like the Service Employees International Union, former president Bill Clinton and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton.Biden’s allies and critics responded to his announcement by publicly gearing themselves up for a new, unpredictable battle for the White House.Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who had privately told Biden that his continued candidacy would harm Democrats’ chances, was among dozens of elected Democrats who praised Biden for stepping aside.“Joe Biden has not only been a great president and a great legislative leader but he is a truly amazing human being,” Schumer said in an emailed statement, which did not endorse Harris.Trump attacked Biden on Sunday and pledged to undo much of his legacy in a post to his social media platform, Truth Social.“Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve — And never was!” Trump wrote. “We will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly.”Several Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson (La.), called on Biden to resign the presidency immediately, arguing that if he could not continue his campaign, he should not remain in office. In his statement, Biden made clear that he plans to serve out his term.Biden’s announcement came as a shock to many of his aides and advisers, some of whom had appeared on television Sunday morning and insisted he was staying in the race. Biden, who is isolating with a case of covid, informed Harris, his chief of staff Jeff Zients and campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon of his decision on Sunday afternoon, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions. He told his senior White House staff of the decision at 1:45 p.m. The president’s statement was posted to X at 1:46 p.m.1/4“Last night, it was full speed ahead,” the person said, adding that Biden finalized his decision late Saturday with a small group of close aides.Before Biden’s announcement, Harris’s staff had started preparing for her debate with Republican vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a confidential process. Biden and Trump were scheduled to face off in a second debate on Sept. 10. It is unclear if Trump and Harris will do so. If Harris secures the nomination, she will have to select a running mate under a compressed timeline to ensure the Democratic ticket meets all state ballot deadlines.Before any of that could happen, Biden’s campaign apparatus began the process Sunday of morphing into a “Harris for President,” campaign, a process that will involve creating new iconography, reengaging donors and deploying Biden’s considerable campaign war chest to introduce Harris to voters.Biden’s campaign, headquartered in Wilmington, Del., held a call Sunday to let staff know that they were still employed and would continue their long-held mission to defeat Trump in November. O’Malley Dillon and campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez led the call.The Democrats’ predicament — a candidate dropping out after sweeping mostly unchallenged through the party primaries to become the presumptive nominee — is untested in the modern era. It caps weeks of delicate strategizing by party leaders on how to dislodge Biden, a proudly stubborn figure known to bristle at those who write him off. It signals the conclusion of a remarkable half-century political career that began when Biden won election to the Senate in 1972 as one of the youngest-ever senators and will now conclude in January with his service as the oldest-ever president.The Democrats’ process for choosing their nominee will be hurried and fraught with deep uncertainty and the potential for further intraparty turmoil. The Democratic National Convention is in four weeks in Chicago, although Democrats had initially planned to formally nominate Biden in a “virtual roll call” before the in-person gathering. Seeking to head off any sense of disunity, multiple state delegations to the Democratic National Convention said Sunday they would unanimously back Harris, giving her a jumpstart to securing the nomination.The president will leave office with notable accomplishments, especially for a one-term president in an era of deep division. He pushed through bills on infrastructure, climate change, health care, gun control and the semiconductor industry. He pulled the United States out of Afghanistan, rebuilt American alliances and led a coalition to defend Ukraine against Russia.At the same time, however, he suffered historically low approval ratings and was blamed for stubbornly high inflation, record migration at the U.S.-Mexico border and a chaotic withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan in 2021.His staunch support for Israel in the Gaza war sparked condemnation at home and abroad, and lingering concerns over his advanced age drove down his poll numbers, leaving him trailing Trump in many crucial swing states.In abandoning his reelection campaign, Biden joins two other incumbent presidents in modern history who chose not to seek reelection: President Harry S. Truman in 1952 and President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968. Those presidents’ announcements, however, came months earlier and gave their party far more time to regroup for the general election. Even so, Democrats lost both elections.Many Democrats considered Biden’s June 27 presidential debate against Trump shocking and catastrophic, as Biden sometimes struggled to complete sentences or marshal his thoughts. The president and his aides insisted for weeks afterward that he was staying in the race, likening the moment to other occasions in his long career when he had been counted out.Voters have long told pollsters they were concerned about Biden’s age and the debate was an inflection point, releasing a wave of Democratic anxiety that the Biden campaign had previously been able to keep in check.On July 2, Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.) became the first House Democrat to publicly call on Biden to step aside as the nominee, invoking Johnson’s decision 56 years earlier. “Under very different circumstances, he made the painful decision to withdraw,” Doggett said. “President Biden should do the same.”That kicked off an agonizing stretch for Democrats when every day or so, another congressional Democrat would issue a statement declaring their affection for Biden and admiration for his accomplishments, but adding that it was time for him to “pass the torch.”A native of Scranton, Pa., Biden entered politics more than five decades ago, winning a seat on the New Castle County Council in Delaware in 1970. He first ran for Senate in 1972, defeating a Republican incumbent, J. Caleb Boggs, in a scrappy, underdog campaign.Tragedy struck Biden’s life within weeks of his Senate election, when his wife, Neilia, and 1-year-old daughter, Naomi, were killed in a car accident while Christmas shopping in Delaware. His two young sons, Beau and Hunter, who were also in the car, were seriously injured. Biden pushed ahead, plunging into life in the Senate, raising his boys and getting remarried to his current wife, Jill — the first chapter in a long biography of tragedy and recovery.As Obama’s presidency wrapped up in 2016, Biden, who served as his vice president, agonized over whether to run to succeed him, but he ultimately opted against it as he continued to grieve after another personal tragedy: His elder son, Beau, had been diagnosed with brain cancer and died in 2015 at age 46.Trump then shocked the political world by defeating Hillary Clinton for the presidency, sending the Democrats into a brooding exile and dramatically raising the stakes for the 2020 campaign. Biden later said he was inspired to join that race after watching Trump decline to unequivocally condemn a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville in 2017. He won his primary and defeated Trump in a year when the campaign was upended by the coronavirus pandemic.Running for a second term, Biden pitched himself as uniquely equipped to defeat Trump after doing so in 2020, facing minimal opposition in the Democratic primaries even as voter concerns lingered about his age. His campaign focused heavily on abortion rights, promising to restore the federal right to an abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.“I will speak to the nation later this week in more detail about my decision,” Biden wrote in his Sunday letter announcing his withdrawal from the race.Svitek reported from Washington.

WaPo_21,Netanyahu goes to Washington in the shadow of Middle East disaster,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/22/netanyahu-congress-speech-israel-gaza/,2024-07-22 11:59:02.808384,,"You’re reading an excerpt from the WorldView newsletter. Sign up to get the rest free, including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know, sent to your inbox on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.The last time Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to Washington, hopes were high for peace — or, at least, one particular vision of it. It was September 2020, and Netanyahu appeared at a White House then home to Donald Trump. Through a pact brokered by the Trump administration, Israel was normalizing ties with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, two Arab monarchies that shared Israel’s antipathy toward Iran.The diplomatic feat was grandiosely titled the “Abraham Accords” and its promoters cast it as a civilizational breakthrough and the beginning of a new age — no matter that the two Gulf states had never been at war with Israel and already had substantial clandestine dealings with the Jewish state. “This day is a pivot of history,” Netanyahu proclaimed, alongside Trump and top officials from the UAE and Bahrain. “It heralds a new dawn of peace. For thousands of years, the Jewish people have prayed for peace. For decades, the Jewish state has prayed for peace. And this is why, today, we’re filled with such profound gratitude.”The deals generated some lucrative business links between Israel and the monarchies, and were padded by major U.S. arms sales to the Arab kingdoms. But even as more Arab countries warmed to the prospect of normalization with Israel, the new understandings did little to build peace in the context where it was needed most: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict.That was arguably by design: Netanyahu, a longtime opponent of a separate, sovereign Palestinian state, saw a pathway thanks to Trump to further integrate Israel into its neighborhood while placing the “Palestinian problem” on the back burner. Israel’s burgeoning crop of Arab partners, wary of Iran and frustrated with the dysfunctions within the Palestinian national movement, seemed content to go along with the process.Stories to keep you informed

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.Netanyahu was forced out of power but eventually returned at the helm of the most right-wing coalition in Israeli history. He showed up in September at the dais of the U.N. General Assembly with a map of Israel’s new connections in the region labeled “The New Middle East”; any trace of Palestine or Palestinian claims was wiped off the map.Then Oct. 7 happened, and the world changed. The war that followed militant group Hamas’s deadly strike on southern Israel has convulsed the region. Israel’s ongoing campaign against Hamas pulverized the Gaza Strip, led to tens of thousands of deaths and a sprawling humanitarian catastrophe. International legal action against Israel and its right-wing government have picked up: The International Criminal Court may issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in a matter of days for their role in allegedly starving Gazans; the International Court of Justice, the U.N.’s judicial arm, is hearing a case accusing Israel of carrying out genocide and separately ruled Friday that Israel ought to end its occupation of Palestinian territory and dismantle its settlements.That’s a political nonstarter for Netanyahu, under whose long tenure in power the Israeli settlement project has flourished and expanded across the West Bank. He comes to Washington this week ahead of a controversial speech to Congress, with months of trauma and ruin looming behind him, and a murky political future ahead of him.A clutch of Israel’s Arab neighbors, along with President Biden and his allies, have fitfully tried to negotiate a truce between the warring parties. Talks have yet to yield the cease-fire desired by Palestinians and much of the international community, or the wholesale release of Israeli hostages sought by a grief-stricken Israeli public. In private conversations, some U.S. and Arab officials blame Netanyahu — whose own position may be imperiled in the event of a cessation of hostilities — for deliberately thwarting an agreement.“Netanyahu is under pressure from all quarters. He has a coalition that is unhappy with him and [far-right] partners in Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir threatening to bring it down if he agrees to a ceasefire,” explained Michael Koplow of the Israel Policy Forum. “He has hostage families and the political opposition demonstrating in the streets in increasing numbers in favor of a ceasefire, and a security establishment that is also strongly in favor of a deal to pause the fighting and bring living hostages back home. Biden has been pushing unreservedly for a ceasefire and hostage agreement, and Israel’s regional partners all want the fighting to have come to an end months ago.”The wily Israeli prime minister’s trip to Washington is a gambit to relieve some of this pressure. Netanyahu’s “prime directive is maintaining himself in power, and he’s succeeding,” Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a veteran former U.S. negotiator, told me. He is “coming here to use Congress and the White House as props, in demonstration of his indispensability” to the Israeli public, Miller added, suggesting Netanyahu was “playing for time.” Republicans, eager to twist the knife into an already beleaguered Biden, will probably embrace Netanyahu and his defiant position on the war.“What Netanyahu is probably seeking is to make it to the end of the month and the parliamentary summer recess,” wrote Neri Zilber in the Financial Times. “The break stretches until late October, during which it is extremely difficult to topple or replace a sitting government. If Netanyahu makes it this far, the earliest an election could be held would be the first quarter of 2025.”By that point, there may be a new occupant of the White House, and Netanyahu probably expects a second Trump term to boost his own political fortunes — much as the first term did. But the Republican presidential nominee has shown less enthusiasm for Netanyahu in recent months, while the Abraham Accords — cast by Trump as his hallmark foreign policy accomplishment — seem an irrelevance in the current moment.Biden, meanwhile, is facing an insurgency from the left over Israel’s conduct of the war and the United States’ enabling of it. He has sought to enlist the Gulf kingdoms and some of Israel’s other Arab neighbors in an ambitious “day after” project for Gaza that would see a Palestinian technocratic entity jointly administer that territory and the West Bank, funding from the Gulf for reconstruction pour into Gaza and the Israelis and Palestinians reentering talks over a two-state solution.As the war drags on and Netanyahu remains in office, that vision for peace also seems doomed. The Knesset, the Israeli parliament, voted on Friday to reject the establishment of a Palestinian state — a symbolic move that underscored Netanyahu’s attitude ahead of his trip to the United States.“As long as Netanyahu is there, there’s no chance of any movement toward the ‘day after’ plan,” an Arab official involved in the talks over postwar Gaza told me, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the press.There’s no “pivot of history” in sight, in other words. That may be exactly how Netanyahu wants it."
WaPo_22,Asking Eric: Grandmothers in competition over unborn grandchild,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/07/22/asking-eric-grandma-competition-in-law/,2024-07-22 11:59:02.808384,,"Dear Eric: Our daughter is expecting her first child, our first grandchild, in a couple of months. Our daughter and son-in-law live about an hour closer to his family than they do to us.My daughter's mother-in-law (“Nancy”) is very involved in the couple's life and has a very strong personality. My son-in-law and Nancy are extremely close and our daughter has spent a tremendous amount of time with Nancy as a result, much more time than she has spent with us.Additionally, there is not even a cordial relationship between Nancy and me. My concern is that when the baby is born Nancy will be able to have a much stronger relationship with the baby than we will, due to being physically closer, very assertive and extremely involved in all aspects of their life.We have been told that things will work out once the baby is born. We have also been told to be assertive and clearly discuss our visiting. I want to feel wanted and not someone who has to always ask for time with the baby. I am at a loss as to what to do.— Grandmother To BeGrandmother: Having a nemesis can be fun, sometimes, but it gets exhausting. Nancy is never going to replace you in your grandchild’s life. Moreover, despite her assertiveness, I doubt she wants to. I know it feels like you’re in competition with her, but try to separate your fears from your possibilities.It's completely reasonable to be anxious about how your relationship with your first grandchild is going to develop, especially considering that you're not as close, geographically, as other branches of the family. Don't put so much of that anxiety on Nancy. Nancy's just living her life, as annoying as that may be.You will have years and years to build a special, unique relationship with your grandchild that works for you, the logistics of your life, and the love you have to give. Give yourself time and try to be open to the fact that all the relationships in this family unit are about to change.With regard to the visits, it sounds like your daughter and son-in-law are asking for clear communication. Their new home life with a small human who will have a demanding sleep schedule is going to be complicated enough. It will probably help them to have advance notice about who's planning to drop by on a given day.Think of it this way, with your visits communicated in advance, they become special events and things for all involved to look forward to. Give them the benefit of the doubt here. You’re wanted — and if it’s really in doubt, ask them, just to be sure.Dear Eric: While volunteering at my children’s school another mother asked me, “Why do you wear makeup?” She followed that rude question with, “I think it sends the wrong message.”I was completely flabbergasted and didn’t know how to respond. Somehow, I felt as if she was judging my morality and that my presence was not welcome around the students. How should I have responded?— Left Holding the Makeup BagMakeup: When I read your letter, I actually said aloud, “Oh, absolutely not.” So, you have my sympathies and my respect for not causing a scene at the school.You could have asked, in response to her statement that your makeup sends the wrong message, “And what message would that be?” That is, if you wanted to see her contort herself into a pretzel justifying the supposed salaciousness of blush and eyeliner. Most nosy people can't really articulate their bad opinions beyond “it's just what I think.”But sometimes the best response is to let people be loud and wrong and away from you.She was trying to shame you based on her notions about makeup, but you wear makeup for your own reasons. Maybe you see it as artistic expression. Maybe you want to enhance your beauty. Maybe you just like it. All reasons are valid. It’s your face. If she doesn’t like it, she can look at something else.Dear Eric: This is in response to Present Not Accounted For, who questioned the convenience of having “babysitters” in the letter-writer’s current location, and then asked “Who needs babysitters?”Who needs babysitters? Parents with kids! Parents after divorce who consider the proximity to kids who can watch their children responsibly as one of their main criteria when choosing a new place to live!Reader: I agree, to an extent. The letter-writer was, to my mind, weighing the options available for their own happiness. Naturally, that happiness will be connected to the happiness of their kids. But the needs of the kids and the needs of the parent aren’t in conflict here.When making life changes, finding a path that benefits the whole system is the ideal.(Send questions to R.

WaPo_23,Miss Manners: Should I have swapped my plane seat with an older passenger?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/07/22/miss-manners-swap-plane-seats/,2024-07-22 11:59:02.808384,,"Dear Miss Manners: I took a 15-hour overseas flight that began around midnight. I sat by a window, and both seats next to me (the middle seat and the aisle seat) happened to remain unoccupied. The cabin lights dimmed after the meal, and everyone began settling in to sleep.At that point, a somewhat older lady (maybe aged 60), who was seated across the aisle in the center section, came and sat in the empty aisle seat in my row. She leaned over to me and quite humbly asked a question in broken English. After multiple repeats, she finally confirmed that she was asking to take my window seat and suggesting that I either take her seat in the center section or sit in one of the two empty seats in my row.She indicated that she has a neck issue, and presumably wanted the window seat so she could rest her head against the wall, as I was planning to do. I told her I would prefer to keep our assigned seats, and I had hardly finished saying this when she nodded vigorously and seemed very embarrassed to have even asked.However, I began to doubt whether I should have given her my seat. In the morning light, I noted that she was older than I first estimated, maybe 70 or so. I am a healthy male in my 40s. I was torn between guilt and irritation. I paid slightly extra for the window seat because I prefer it, especially if I’ll be sleeping. I also don’t like switching around seating.But maybe for this older woman, the polite thing would have been to give up my seat. What should I have done?That this exchange was conducted calmly on both sides is a relief to Miss Manners. We have all read about such cases turning into midair scuffles and worse. No, you need not give up the seat you bought. People with economy tickets do not ask people in business class to trade seats, and people in business class do not ask that of those in first class.And yet … Being sympathetic is an important virtue. You felt that.If you could have made a small sacrifice to accommodate another passenger, it might have been worth it. But an uncomfortable night on a 15-hour flight may not be considered a small sacrifice.So you acted reasonably. But now Miss Manners wonders whether you could have suggested that the lady take the aisle seat, recline it slightly (with permission from the person behind) and then lean against the empty middle seat.Dear Miss Manners: Now that the weather is warm, my wonderful neighbor is outside more often. I had not seen her without a winter coat for quite a while, and it turns out she has lost a significant amount of weight.I think it is great — good for her. I would be nothing but supportive if she mentioned this to me. But if she doesn’t, what do I say when I see her? Maybe just, “Wow, you look great?”She looks very different. It seems weird to act like I don’t notice when the change is so dramatic.You say “Hello.” What Miss Manners considers weird is the notion that it is callous not to critique people’s bodies.New Miss Manners columns are posted Monday through Saturday on washingtonpost.com/advice.

WaPo_24,Carolyn Hax: Husband blows off conversations about their sexless marriage,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/07/22/carolyn-hax-sexless-marriage-husband/,2024-07-22 11:59:02.808384,,"Adapted from an online discussion.Dear Carolyn: I’m a woman in my 40s and am in a mostly sexless marriage. The past six or seven years, it has been once or twice a year. I have talked to my spouse about it, and he will blow it off with a joke or get annoyed that I’m bringing it up again. I still enjoy his company in other ways, but I feel as if we are more friends and co-parents than a married couple. Much of the time I think this is enough, but I also think I’m too young to be celibate for the rest of my life.I don’t really know where to go from here. How do you decide whether this is enough or whether you should start over?By the way, I’m as sure as I can be he’s not cheating; he just has zero interest anymore and doesn’t seem to want to change that.— Mostly CelibateMostly Celibate: Before you deal with the sexless marriage, deal with the talkless marriage. Or truthless:“This is important to me. Please don’t blow me off with jokes; that’s not fair to either of us.” Or: “I understand this is uncomfortable, but I believe I have a right to an answer, or at least an honest discussion. This is our lives we’re talking about.”If you still get nowhere, then that’s the bigger issue. Couples can be forced out of physical intimacy for a bunch of reasons beyond their control: illness, injury, medications, trauma, low drive or interest, etc. But they can get through it on the strength of their emotional intimacy, which is the true heart of a peer marriage.So if your spouse won’t even tell you the truth, then you’re headed to a loneliness even more profound than the one you’re feeling now. Plant your flag there and don’t budge. That’ll tell you whether you have a life partner, a pal, a roommate or an ex.Re: Sexless Marriage: Perhaps your husband has a medical problem and is too embarrassed to discuss it with you, because he feels like a failure.— AnonymousAnonymous: One possibility, yes. All the more reason not to let the yuk-yuk response pass for a legitimate answer. When we give difficult topics patience and respect, they become easier to discuss than hold in. Thanks.Other readers’ thoughts:· Been there. Turned out my husband had the testosterone level of a 4-year-old. Took a lot of pushing for him to tell a doctor, too embarrassed to talk about sex. I finally told him that, if he didn’t, I would make an appointment and discuss it. Turned our lives around. At first he used the patches but went to weekly shots.· It might be worthwhile to start bluntly with: “This is weird to talk about, but we have different sex drives. That’s not a value judgment on either of us, but it can get really awkward if we can’t talk about how to handle it.” Society looks down on men who aren’t interested in sex, so he may be making jokes to deflect. There’s also the other (potential) elephant in the room: “I also want to be able to cuddle, but I don’t want either of us to feel like I’m angling for sex every time.” Because that happens, too.· Sounds like my marriage. I finally asked my husband whether he was gay, and he said yes. It broke a dam, cleared a LOT of things up and we decided to stay together (we had been married for 33 years, three kids) because we really liked each other. Maybe this could/should be your question."

WaPo_26,A Chinese actor was enslaved in a compound running online scams,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/22/myanmar-cyberscams-china-trafficking/,2024-07-22 13:00:02.881006,,"For Xu Bochun, left down and nearly out in Shanghai by pandemic layoffs, a month’s work as a movie extra in balmy southwest China sounded like easy money.It turned out to be anything but.Armed men kidnapped the aspiring actor, then 37, last year after he showed up for what proved to be a fake part and marched him at knifepoint through jungle and across the border into northern Myanmar. There, he was beaten and sold to a criminal group running cyber scams, targeting victims with fake investment schemes and online romance. He was forced to spend three months duping people out of their money until his family paid a ransom for his release in October.Xu was one of at least 48,000 Chinese nationals that worked in a lawless, isolated corner of Myanmar called Kokang until a Beijing-led crackdown there last year. He provided screenshots of his initial chat messages about the movie part, photos of the cash ransom payment and Chinese police documents about his case to support his account.His experiences are similar to those of six other people interviewed by The Washington Post who were trafficked or misled into traveling to Myanmar, including from Thailand and Taiwan. All responded to similarly fraudulent job postings, some asking for candidates with experience in web management or online advertising, before being kidnapped. The U.N. Human Rights Office estimated in a report last August that more than 200,000 people are still being forced to work as scammers in Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, the epicenter of this global, multibillion-dollar criminal industry, run predominantly by Chinese criminal gangs.Accounts from those who escape, the United Nations and human rights groups say, offer a window into this new iteration of global human trafficking and the digital platforms fueling it. The problem has not been met with a global or even regional response, the groups add, even as victims continue to be recruited from more than three dozen countries, predominantly through social media apps like WeChat, Telegram and Facebook. The U.S. State Department said in June that forced labor in scam compounds has continued to grow. Citing the expansion of scamming operations, its latest Trafficking in Persons report put both Cambodia and Myanmar on its blacklist, opening the door to possible penalties and sanctions.“There has been an extreme uptick in sophistication and reach of these recruitment networks,” said Jacob Sims, a visiting expert on transnational crime at the United States Institute of Peace.In June 2023, Xu was living job to job, scouring casual work groups on WeChat when he came across an offer of 10,000 yuan ($1,380) for an acting gig in the tourist town of Xishuangbanna, on China’s border with Myanmar.Stories to keep you informed

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.Xu signed up, despite the ad offering few details.On arrival, Xu and a handful of other people from across the country gathered in a hotel and were then taken by car to an unlit street near the mountains. The setting immediately seemed off. Ten men in camo and hiking boots, knives hanging from their belts, appeared out of the dark. One tried to calm everyone down while the rest stood in menacing silence.“It’s not a big deal,” the man said, according to Xu. “We are still going to give you part-time work, it just won’t be the work you thought you’d be doing.”After taking everyone’s luggage, phone and identity cards, the men marched them down overgrown mountain paths in the pitch black, then drove them on dirt bikes. They eventually reached a wire fence — the border — with a gap big enough to wriggle through one at a time.Uniformed guards at checkpoints in Myanmar showed little interest in them as they were transported from the border — so long as drivers handed over one to two thousand Chinese yuan in cash.“The whole way we were yelling to sound the alarm, calling ‘save us.’ They understood too. They’d say ‘Chinese?’ But nobody cared,” he said. “They only recognized money, not people. It was a lawless place.”On arrival in Laukkaing, the capital of the Kokang region, Xu felt he had been transported back 40 years to a far-flung town only just emerging from poverty. Then, sticking out from among the run-down buildings and dirt roads, he spotted signs of extreme wealth, flashy sports cars and a handful of palatial hotels.Xu’s first stop in what he called a “supply chain” of criminality was a walled compound on the outskirts of town used by traffickers to hold abductees before they were sold on to scammers. Beneath a roof of plastic sheeting that blocked out the sun, 70 to 80 young Chinese men squatted shackled in the mud as 20 armed guards enforced silence by meting out beatings with plastic pipes.Every day, scam “agents” would come in search of new workers for their operations, Xu said, while the traffickers would bring in 15 to 20 new arrivals, mostly from China. Many were in their 20s or 30s. Some were teenagers.Xu, who was considered old, was held for an unusually long 10 days. His legs grew numb from beatings, he said. There were no showers or toothbrushes and the beds were stained with blood.“They were training us to obey like slaves,” he said.The traffickers robbed them by forcing captives to unlock accounts on online payment services like WeChat Pay and Alipay and transfer cash out. They would then use the apps to apply for personal loans to ensure a steady supply of funds.Five or six days after arriving — Xu had lost count — he said he saw four people shot dead when they tried to grab guns from the guards.“I don’t know their names, don’t know where they were from, don’t know if they were Chinese, I just know they were cheated into going there,” Xu said. “I bet their families don’t even know they were in Myanmar, don’t know that they died.”In July, Xu was eventually sold to a scamming outfit run from the Red Lotus Hotel. It was owned, he said, by Liu Abao, a nickname for Liu Zhengxiang, a patriarch of one of the three crime families that ruled over Kokang, according to U.N. officials, Chinese court records and analysts.In January, Myanmar police handed Liu to the authorities in China, where he is awaiting trial on suspicion of violent crimes including illegal detention. He could not be reached for comment.Xu’s team on the seventh floor of the hotel targeted people in Southeast Asia. With four phones each logged into 20-odd Instagram and Facebook accounts, they would rely on machine translation to send messages to hundreds of potential victims from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. every day.After establishing a rapport, they would switch to WhatsApp or Line messaging apps and try to interest the mark in buying Tether coins, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrencies which is pegged to the dollar. Anyone who agreed got sent a link to a fake platform built to look like a crypto exchange.At Red Lotus, beatings were a tool to enforce a frantic work pace. Xu regularly failed to meet targets. The most severe punishment was reserved for people who tried to escape or contact families back home.Once every couple of weeks, the bosses would gather the workers — under strict supervision — to send messages of reassurance to family members. Only approved text and photos were allowed.That itself was another ploy, according to Xu. The scammers wanted families to know just enough that they were ready to pay a ransom if needed.It was in one of these sessions that Xu was able to send a single line of text to a childhood friend, alerting him to his captivity. At first, nothing happened. In late September, over Mid-Autumn Festival, Xu again briefly contacted his friend, only to discover that Chinese police had refused to look at his case, citing a lack of evidence.Eventually, Xu’s family gathered enough proof for police in Yunnan to start negotiating for his release. Handling the process were brokers from overseas Chinese business associations in Kokang who approached scam ringleaders to negotiate terms.Xu’s captors initially didn’t want to let him go. He begged them to accept the deal, saying that he was too old and unsuited to scamming. “People like me are just a waste,” he recalled telling the boss while bowing repeatedly. “If you let my family buy me back, you’ll definitely make more money.”After his family agreed to pay 620,000 yuan ($85,300) in cash, his boss relented. His mother handed stacks of bills to intermediaries in a hotel room near the border. Xu was returned to Chinese authorities at Qingshuihe port, a border crossing on Kokang’s southern tip recently upgraded by Chinese investment.Police on the border took two tubes of blood — one to check for drugs, the other to check for infectious diseases — and interrogated him for 10 days. Then he was flown to Nanjing, the eastern Chinese city where he attended university, for another full day of questioning.When Xu was finally let go — his mother first had to pay Chinese police to cover his travel expenses — he learned that his mother had sold her house to pay his ransom.Though the scam compounds in Kokang have been closed, new centers continue to crop up all over the region and in burgeoning hotspots, including Dubai.“There must still be so many people waiting to be saved,” he said."
WaPo_27,Hunter Biden drops lawsuit over Fox News ‘mock trial’ miniseries,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/07/22/hunter-biden-drops-fox-lawsuit/,2024-07-22 14:00:02.900629,,"Hunter Biden has withdrawn a lawsuit against Fox News over a miniseries that used his sexually explicit photos in a “mock trial” dramatization of a fictitious criminal prosecution of the president’s son.Biden’s legal team filed a “notice of voluntary dismissal” Sunday, less than three weeks after his case was initiated in federal court in New York — and on the same day President Biden announced he was dropping his bid for reelection.Lawyers did not say why they had withdrawn the case.Hunter Biden, 54, a former lobbyist who has struggled with substance abuse, has faced a welter of legal problems. Last month, he was found guilty in Delaware of lying about his drug use to buy a gun; in September he will face trial on tax evasion charges in California.But “The Trial of Hunter Biden,” a six-part miniseries released on the Fox Nation streaming platform in 2022, portrayed an imagined courtroom prosecution of Biden on charges of violating bribery and foreign-agent laws that he has never faced in real life.The show relies partially on documents found on a laptop that Biden is said to have abandoned at a Wilmington, Del., repair shop in 2019 — he has maintained that some may have been hacked or stolen from him instead — including some intimate images.In his suit filed July 1, Biden accused Fox of unlawfully enriching itself by using his image, inflicting emotional distress and illegally publishing his intimate photos in violation of New York’s “revenge porn” law.Fox said at the time that it had removed the miniseries from its streaming platform after receiving a legal warning from Biden’s lawyers in April. But it otherwise defended the production and said the lawsuit was without merit.“Hunter Biden is a public figure who has been the subject of multiple investigations and is now a convicted felon,” the company statement said. “Consistent with the First Amendment, Fox News has accurately covered the newsworthy events of Mr. Biden’s own making.”Fox representatives did not comment further on the suit’s withdrawal."

WaPo_29,‘House of the Dragon’ recap: Assisted living — and dying,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/2024/07/22/house-dragon-recap-season-two-episode-six/,2024-07-22 15:01:02.771274,,"Over eight “Game of Thrones” seasons and a season and a half of “House of the Dragon,” the lessons have been clear: You die alone, few are to be trusted, and even if you’re brave and true, you’re liable to be Red Weddinged.But in a surprisingly tender “Dragon” episode, we got a few small respites from bloodshed and warmongering for a different lesson: Sometimes people just need a little help to get back on their feet.Most notably, Rhaenyra finds that while everyone around her — from her increasingly rebellious son Jace to her distrusting war council — is losing faith, her trusted adviser Mysaria has her back. Not only that, but Mysaria offers brilliant strategy in the war effort, and in a new twist, brings Rhaenyra some romantic relief.Dragon-scourged King Aegon, now out of his coma, is terrorized by his brother, but gets unexpected comfort from Sneaky Larys, who feels slighted by Aemond. He’s now Aegon’s only real supporter, even if Larys is still mostly looking out for Larys.Daemon, still despondent and hallucinating at Harrenhal, benefits from his new friendship with owl-lady Alys Rivers. Alys promises Daemon’s luck will change, and sure enough a death in Riverrun puts Daemon back in contention to raise an army for Rhaenyra — or himself.And when you’re a humble shipwright with no prospects for the future, you could somehow befriend a dragon — the ultimate power companion. You can’t trust anybody in Westeros, but as long as it serves both parties, unexpected alliances can put you back on track. Friendship is magic, y’all!Let’s recap how it played out:Team DaemonDaemon, still in a waking nightmare at Harrenhal, continues having visions of things he did or should have done. He remembers King Viserys (welcome back, Paddy Considine, you’ve been missed) confronting him after Daemon made a bad joke about his dead newborn nephew, calling him “Heir for a day.” Viserys, furious, reveals he’s chosen a new heir, Rhaenyra.Daemon later runs outside as if to leave Harrenhal, but he’s stopped by Alys, who tells him that those who pursue the crown are probably least suited for it. Alyce says that Daemon only needs the support of Grover Tully, the head honcho of the Riverlands; his sub-houses will fall in line. “In three day’s time, the winds will shift,” she promises.Daemon dreams again about Viserys, but this time, he is there to help his brother mourn the death of his wife, Aemma. Daemon hugs his brother, even kisses his head, and says, “I’m sorry. I’m here now.”Ser Simon awakens Daemon. He has sorrowful (but great) news: Grover has died. His grandson Oscar is now Lord Paramount Plus and free to align with Daemon. Not-so-mysteriously, Alys was there to minister to Grover at the end and it’s been three days. Daemon cries, presumably with gratitude.Team Alicent, Aegon and (for now) AemondTeam Green’s Lannister forces, led by Jason Lannister, arrive at the Golden Tooth, where House Lefford is forced to offer hospitality to some 8,000 troops. They want an escort from Aemond and his dragon Vhagar to march on Harrenhal, but Aemond is furious that anyone thinks they can summon him.Instead, Aemond instructs Jason’s brother Tyland to form an alliance with the Triarchy, a bunch of sea mercenaries. Though Alicent distrusts the Triarchy, Aemond thinks breaking the sea blockade is their best bet. As for the Greyjoys, they have not yet taken sides, but may be seeking Alicent’s hand in marriage as an alliance move. The dowager queen is like, “Ew, no.”Aemond sends Criston Cole straight to Harrenhal before Daemon can raise an army. Cole is understandably reluctant, but Aemond essentially says, “I’ll meet you there with my dragon … you know, whenever.” After the council meeting, Aemond tells Alicent she’s relieved of her duties, which should give her more time for “domestic pursuits.” Even as she’s being fired, she takes a moment to touch Aemond’s face, asking if he hasn’t gotten enough revenge for losing an eye.Later, Alicent runs to the courtyard with her enormous green sleeves flapping to tell her brother, Gwayne, goodbye as he heads to battle with an increasingly depressed-looking Cole. Alicent says she’s been writing to her father, Otto, but hasn’t heard back. She also isn’t hearing much from her 16-year-old son Daeron. Gwayne observes that unlike her other two boys, Daeron is intelligent and kind.It turns out that Mysaria’s plan to help Rhaenyra was to send small rowboats loaded with food and flying the Targaryen banner to King’s Landing. The arrival of food at the starving city shifts public favor back to Rhaenyra and stirs up passions. We even see Hugh the blacksmith punch someone out for a bag of food.When the crowd sees Alicent and Helaena emerge from the Sept in royal garb, a riot starts. People start throwing trash and mob the two queens, just as they did at the funeral procession. Someone grabs Alicent and a guard chops off their hand. The two queens manage to get into a carriage and escape the melee relatively unscathed.Larys makes a play to be named Hand of the King now that Cole is off to war. Aemond calls Larys a toad and tasks him instead with finding Otto; he wants to reinstate his grandfather as the Hand. “His devotion to his family has never been in doubt,” Aemond reasons.Aemond visits his ailing brother, who is beginning to be aware of his surroundings. As soon as Aegon sees Aemond, he recoils in fear. “What do you remember?” Aemond asks him. Aegon says he remembers nothing. “You challenged Meleys. It was foolish,” Aemond says, soothingly. The threat is clear: Talk and your brother will finish the job.Larys, still stung from Aemond’s rejection, also visits, and delays Aegon’s medication so they can have a lucid conversation. He delivers some facts: Aegon will never be whole again. But his mind remains, and even as they pity Aegon, people will always underestimate him. “This will be your advantage,” Larys tells Aegon. Larys is plotting here, but he’s also tearful as he recounts his story of being born with a clubfoot. Aegon cries, too. “Help me,” he asks Larys.New faces (briefly)Ser Steffon Darklyn has been on the sidelines since the rule of Viserys. He finally appears center stage when Rhaenyra invites him to be part of her Big New Plan. She notes that he’s of noble birth, sharing common blood with the Targaryens: How would he like a shot at riding Seasmoke, one of the dragons with no rider?Darklyn is humble, but not crazy enough to refuse. He takes the risk, partaking in a ceremony in the dragon pit. At first, Seasmoke seems amenable, dropping his head and waiting patiently. Ser Steffon moves forward slowly and carefully, finally saying, “I’ve done it!” Has he, though? Seasmoke lets out a blast of fire that incinerates Steffon and kills one of the robed officiants. The attempt is a literal hot mess and Seasmoke escapes.Team RhaenyraRhaenyra, horrified and disappointed by what happened to Ser Steffon, is not about to let council member Lord Bartimos tell her what a bad job she’s doing. When he criticizes Rhaenyra’s leadership, she slaps him in the face and muses that she needs to work on making people fear her. To that end, she starts carrying a sword like a pimp cane, adding to her swagger. Mysaria likes this look. She also brings good news: The plan to foment disharmony in King’s Landing is working.Rhaena, stuck for now at the Eyrie, uncovers a secret. While she’s watching Rhaenyra’s kids and babysitting tiny dragons, she finds a patch of burned land indicating that there’s a full-grown dragon in the area. Lady Arryn confirms that this is true, but says that the dragon is wild, therefore not much of a defense for the Vale.Meanwhile, Alyn reluctantly accepts an assignment to go to sea with his biological father, Corlys. He may lack experience, but Corlys says, “I was younger than you when I took my first command.” (Hey, I know a “Hamilton” reference when I hear one.) Alyn’s brother Addam doesn’t know why Alyn isn’t more pleased, and thinks he should enjoy his good fortune. But it’s Addam whose fortunes take a massive turn: While he’s on the beach, the loose dragon Seasmoke flies toward the coast and chases him down. Addam runs away, terrified, but Seasmoke continues to approach, almost as if he’s seeking out a particular person. You know what comes next, right? Addam is about to start flying first class!Back at Dragonstone, everyone thinks Rhaenyra needs Daemon to win the war. “Daemon, Daemon, Daemon,” she cries to Jace. (Hey, I know a “Brady Bunch” reference when I hear one.) When she confers with Mysaria later, she says that she and Daemon were two halves of a whole person. But now, Rhaenyra thinks, she’s probably lost him. Mysaria opens up as well, telling Rhaenyra that her father abused her, impregnated her and left her for dead. She says she hasn’t trusted anyone since, but Rhaenyra is different. Rhaenyra, deeply touched, goes over to hug Mysaria. The hug lingers — and then they’re kissing.The kiss is interrupted by news that Seasmoke has been spotted over Spicetown (best chicken wings in Westeros!) and someone is riding the dragon. Rhaenyra, fearing the other side has stolen her dragon, rushes to mount Syrax and find out who Seasmoke chose. We close on her flying out of Dragonstone."

To win the nomination in the first round of voting, a candidate needs the support of at least 1,976 delegates out of nearly 4,000. As of Monday evening, 2,214 delegates from at least three dozen states had endorsed Harris, according to a survey of delegates by the Associated Press. Harris kicked off her campaign earlier Monday with an appearance at its Wilmington, Del., headquarters, where she previewed her campaign message of being a former prosecutor running against a felon. “I will proudly put my record against his,” Harris said of Republican nominee Donald Trump. She also welcomed a surprise phone call from President Biden, who — in his first public remarks since dropping out of the race — urged the campaign staff to rally around Harris. “Embrace her, she’s the best,” Biden said."
WaPo_31,Secret Service director to testify before Congress about Trump rally,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/07/22/secret-service-director-kimberly-cheatle-testimony-trump/,2024-07-22 16:59:02.794696,,"U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle is set to testify Monday morning before the House Oversight Committee, little more than a week after the assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump, the GOP nominee for president. The hearing will mark Cheatle’s first time testifying before Congress in nearly three decades with the agency.According to her prepared remarks, Cheatle is expected to once again take responsibility for the security failures at Trump’s July 13 campaign rally in Pennsylvania. A gunman is alleged to have gained access to an unsecured roof, where he opened fire with an AR-style rifle, injuring Trump, killing one man and seriously wounding two others.“The Secret Service’s solemn mission is to protect our nation’s leaders. On July 13th, we failed,” Cheatle plans to testify, according to a copy of her prepared remarks. “As the director of the United States Secret Service, I take full responsibility for any security lapse.”She said the agency is fully cooperating with the FBI’s criminal investigation into the shooting, as well as additional reviews by Congress, the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General and an independent bipartisan panel announced Sunday.“We must learn what happened, and I will move heaven and earth to ensure an incident like July 13th does not happen again,” she plans to testify. “Thinking about what we should have done differently is never far from my thoughts.”"
WaPo_32,"Heat pumps, EV chargers and more: U.S. unveils $4.3 billion in local climate funds",https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/07/22/biden-epa-local-climate-projects/,2024-07-22 16:59:02.794696,,"The Environmental Protection Agency on Monday announced an investment of $4.3 billion into community-driven projects in an effort to ramp up local climate action across the country.The funding will go to 25 recipients across 30 states, ranging from projects involving forest management to household energy efficiency. It will also help states, cities and territories develop climate action plans to meet local sustainability goals.Details about the latest funding were shared with the media on an embargoed basis Friday, two days before President Biden’s announcement that he was dropping his reelection bid. The funding reflects how the Biden administration is rushing to distribute climate money before the November election. This month, the Energy Department unveiled $1.7 billion for retooling 11 auto factories to make electric vehicles and their components.EPA Administrator Michael Regan joined Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro on Monday at an event in Pittsburgh to unveil the grant funding. Shapiro is among the Democrats reportedly being considered as a potential running mate for Vice President Harris, whom Biden has endorsed to replace him.“I have always said we have got to reject the false choice between protecting our planet and protecting our jobs. We can [and] we must do both,” Shapiro said at the event. He added that he was grateful to Biden and Harris “for what is now the second largest federal investment in Pennsylvania history.”Monday’s announcement is the second phase of the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants Program, the latest such investment from the Biden administration. The first phase was an allocation last year of $250 million to help local governments cut climate pollution and advance clean economies, Regan said. The funding for these projects comes from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, Biden’s signature piece of climate and economic legislation.The grants “put local governments in the driver’s seat to develop climate solutions that work for their communities,” said John Podesta, the president’s senior adviser for international climate policy.The projects could reduce emissions by as much as 150 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents by 2030, the administration said. By 2050, the reductions could rise to 971 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, the same as the emissions caused by energy use in about 5 million homes over 25 years. Officials hope these projects will not only create jobs but serve as models for future initiatives.The 25 projects — from states, a tribe, local governments and coalitions — were chosen from more than 300 applications for almost $33 billion in funding. The selections were based off the potential reduction of emissions, the ability to track these reductions and the diversity of industries represented.Among the selected projects is a Pennsylvania grant program for decarbonization programs across the state, measures in Nebraska to reduce agricultural emissions and waste, and an effort to build electric vehicle chargers for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles along a highway in the Northeast.The grants also include $500 million for the air management district in Southern California, which will be used to help decarbonize the region’s transportation and freight sectors, including at busy ports in Long Beach and Los Angeles, Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) announced Monday.Money will also go to Alaskan coastal communities to replace residential oil burning systems with electric heat pumps.This is the “product of bringing everybody on the front lines of the climate crisis into the conversation of how we take on this important work,” said Ali Zaidi, the White House national climate adviser.Though officials can’t predict what will happen to this initiative come November, Regan said they plan for recipients to receive the money “as early as this fall.”"
WaPo_33,How can I get healthier hair? Here’s what the science says.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/07/22/make-my-hair-healthier/,2024-07-22 18:59:03.084934,,"My hair has been dry and brittle lately. How can I take better care of it? And what can my hair tell me about my health?You may not know this, but your scalp has its own microbiome. It’s a special part of the microbiome that exists elsewhere all over your skin, contending with a high density of hair follicles and their oil-producing sebaceous glands.The scalp microbiome contains many common bacteria but is also home to a number of fungi, like the Malassezia species that is associated with seborrheic dermatitis, an inflammatory condition of the scalp causing red, itchy skin and dandruff. Which microbes inhabit your scalp is influenced by your age, sex, hair texture, the environment — including moisture, UV exposure and air pollution — and your behaviors, such as bleaching or coloring your hair or wearing a head covering.Most dermatologists agree that the first step toward healthy hair is a healthy scalp, and how you care for it can affect the health of your hair at every age. This means using “gentle” or “sulfate-free” hair care products that you massage onto your head — not scrub into a voluminous lather — with warm instead of scalding water. For many people, it also means not washing your hair every day.The right frequency to wash your hair depends on the individual — washing daily can strip away the skin’s oils leading to brittle hair or an overly dry scalp (for women, sebaceous gland production drops after menopause, so what worked in your 30s may not be what works best in your 60s). The American Academy of Dermatology recommends washing once weekly or every other week for African Americans.On the other hand, you don’t want to go too long without washing, as the oil from the scalp’s sebaceous glands can eventually irritate the skin. To give an extreme example: In 2015, scientists looked at a group of Antarctic geological investigators who did not bathe for three months. After the expedition, Malassezia fungi on the geologists’ scalp microbiomes increased about sevenfold, and this correlated with itching and dandruff.All these conditions that impact your scalp microbiome and hair health change over time. So if you’re not thrilled with how your hair feels, try switching up your washing routine — even if the habit was ingrained since childhood — as an experiment for a few weeks. You might surprise yourself what a difference it makes.Hair loss or thinning: As we age, our hair becomes thinner and more brittle, and both men and women start to bald, typically in different patterns, around the scalp. Though these changes are normal — due to alterations in the stem cells of our hair follicles and hormonal shifts such as with menopause — they can feel distressing because of how deeply they can impact our perception of ourselves.Men tend to start to notice balding or hair thinning as early as their 20s. By their 50s, about half have experienced hair loss. Symptoms in women can show up a bit later — by age 70, half of women notice some degree of hair thinning.Topical minoxidil has been shown to be effective in male and female pattern hair loss, also known as androgenetic alopecia, but you need to give it about six months to see possible results. Small studies have found oral minoxidil, which may be prescribed off-label for hair loss, to be as effective as topical minoxidil by some metrics, but not by all. Larger studies are still needed to understand who might best benefit from these therapies.Other causes of hair loss are autoimmune conditions, such as alopecia areata, or drugs. Drug-induced hair loss is almost always reversible because this tends to only affect hair in the “growing” phase. In the case of chemotherapy, these drugs target rapidly dividing cells often seen in a tumor — and our hair gets caught in the line of fire because they are a part of the body where our cells are normally rapidly dividing. How we style our hair is also linked to hair loss: Wearing a tight ponytail or using a hair straightener or curling iron are all culprits.Lastly, some infections can cause our hair to fall out — patchy hair loss, for example, could be a sign of a fungal infection of the scalp. When in doubt, snap a picture and send it to your health-care provider.Coarse, dry hair: Thyroid disease — both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism — can lead to changes in hair texture, increased breakage and hair loss. This is usually accompanied by other signs of thyroid dysfunction that can include changes in bowel habits and even heart rate or blood pressure. Nutrient deficiencies — such as from vitamin D, iron or folate — may be linked to hair abnormalities, but these should be evaluated and diagnosed by a physician before taking unnecessary supplements. (While we’re on this subject, I’ll answer a common query: No, there’s no evidence that taking prenatal vitamins when you’re not pregnant will help your hair grow faster.)Premature gray or white hair: Certain stem cells in our hair follicles contain melanin that provide pigment to our hair — but many people lose these stem cells with age. If and how fast we “go gray” is largely determined by our genetics, but smoking and alcohol use have also been shown to speed up the rate at which our hair loses color.Stress also appears to play a big role in graying hair. A study published in Nature in 2020 found that activation of the sympathetic nervous system — commonly associated with the “fight-or-flight” response — depletes the melanin-producing stem cells in our hair follicles.But how quickly stress can impact your hair has become a bit mythologized. For instance, an old legend claims that sudden psychological stress turned Marie Antoinette’s hair white the night before she encountered the guillotine during the French Revolution. However, this is unlikely to have occurred. Depletion of melanin, even if rapid, will affect new hairs that will grow from the follicle — it would not transform the visible hairs already protruding out of the scalp. The graying hairs that we observe among American presidents over their four-year terms is a more realistic timeline.Humans have about 5 million hair follicles on our bodies. While 80 to 90 percent of our hair is in the “growing” phase of their life cycle at any one moment — a phase that can last about two to six years — each hair eventually enters a shedding period at the end of the cycle. It may sound wild, but because of this, it’s normal to lose around 100-200 hairs per day from the scalp. Our bathroom drains can attest — help your plumber and get drain protectors.Much of the time, changes in hair are nothing scary. But if your hair starts falling out in clumps, or the skin underneath the hair appears red and irritated, talk to your physician. Excessive hair loss may be a sign of telogen effluvium, a condition in which at least half of the scalp hair transitions out of the “growing” phase and becomes easily pulled from the scalp. Telogen effluvium can happen when the body experiences major stressors such as after a surgery or if you’re malnourished."

Theo’s wife gave birth to a beautiful baby last week. He’s going to be taking well-deserved parental leave for the next several weeks. A name you should know well, Marianna Sotomayor, will be filling in for Theo while he’s gone. Congrats, Theo! Send tips to earlytips@washpost.com. Thanks for waking up with us.In today’s edition … the Secret Service director will appear before House Oversight to answer questions about the assassination attempt on Trump … Republicans prepare legal challenges over handing campaign cash to Harris … but first …It might not be too early to call Vice President Harris the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. Support for Harris snowballed rapidly in the hours after President Biden announced yesterday he would bow out of the 2024 race amid intense pressure within his party. Some have called for an “open process” to choose the next nominee, but the party is quickly coalescing around Harris.Most critical to Harris’s path to winning the nomination next month at the Democratic convention in Chicago: No viable candidate has stepped forward to challenge her. Starting up a presidential campaign to challenge Harris in mere weeks would be a nearly impossible feat.Potential challengers including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper have endorsed Harris. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has said she won’t challenge Harris.Sen. Joe Manchin (I-W.Va.) is the only one so far who has opened that door, saying he’s considering becoming a Democrat again to run, our colleagues Liz Goodwin and Amy Wang report. But we are extremely skeptical he would actually run for president this year.Harris is working to reconnect with her former colleagues on Capitol Hill. She spent most of Sunday asking for their support and pledging that she will do her best to “earn” and “win” the nomination next month.Harris called Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.). She also called nearly all the chairs of House Democratic caucuses — the Black, Hispanic, Asian Pacific American and Progressive caucuses as well as the New Democrat Coalition — to ask for their support. Members of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition didn’t receive a call as of late last night.Harris, as well as her current and former staffers, also called rank-and-file members to either thank them for their support or ask them to publicly get behind her.But key leaders in the party haven’t yet endorsed her, including House and Senate Democratic leaders, former House speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Obama.The leaders of the party are waiting to see where the chips fall. They are reluctant to make it look like a coronation by party elites, especially as the base expresses fury that donors and elected officials were pushing Biden out. Pelosi told colleagues in the California delegation this month that Harris should win by popular approval, fearing that crowning her the nominee could anger Democratic voters. (But she also told members that if the time came, the delegation should promptly defend and whip support for Harris.)Rep. Annie Kuster (D-N.H.) said Democratic members of Congress aren’t ignoring the will of primary voters.“They voted for Biden-Harris,” Kuster told us.The bigger question, aides we speak to say, is who will be the vice-presidential nominee.Leigh Ann and our colleagues reported over the weekend that Democratic donors had started a vetting process independent of the campaign. They had already contacted Shapiro and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear. And they are interested in Cooper, Whitmer and Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona.In recent weeks, Harris has appeared with many of the Democrats who are being viewed as potential running mates should she take over the top of the ticket. A day after the debate, Harris was in Nevada with Kelly. She has twice appeared at campaign events in North Carolina with Cooper, and she campaigned with Shapiro last weekend in Pennsylvania.Former president Donald Trump has to recalibrate his attacks, and he has already started. In a rally over the weekend, before Biden announced he was stepping aside, Trump devoted some of his stump speech to attacking Harris, mixing in gender stereotypes.“I call her Laughing Kamala. Have you watched her laugh? She is crazy. You know, you can tell a lot by a laugh. No, she’s crazy. She’s nuts,” Trump said.Republican attacks against Harris are quickly coming into focus, none more than “Border Czar Kamala.” Biden put Harris in charge of diplomatic efforts with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, known as the Northern Triangle countries, to try to alleviate migration to the U.S. southern border. But Republicans are misconstruing her role and attacking her as being in charge of the border, hoping to make it a key weakness in her candidacy.House Republicans may take a vote this week on GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik’s resolution that would condemn Harris’s role as “border czar” and show that she “owns this border crisis.”As for Biden, House Republicans labeled the president’s decision to step aside as proof he is unfit to serve and quickly began calling for him to resign, we report with our colleague Mariana Alfaro.Kamala Harris has a career of comebacks.

By Dan Diamond.Harris will make her first public appearance this morning since Biden announced his withdrawal from the race. She’ll speak on the South Lawn of the White House to celebrate NCAA championship teams.This morning, the director of the Secret Service, Kimberly Cheatle, will appear before the House Oversight Committee, where she’ll face questions over her agency’s failure to prevent the assassination attempt against Trump. Some House lawmakers — a majority of Republicans — have called on her to resign. We’ll be watching for whether she shares any new details about the agency’s response to the attack.Cheatle is expected to say this, according to prepared remarks: “I take full responsibility for any security lapse. As an agency, we are fully cooperating with the FBI’s investigation, the oversight you have initiated here, and conducting our own internal mission assurance review at my direction. Likewise, we will cooperate with the pending external review and the DHS Office of the Inspector General.”Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) is also expected to officially announce members to a bipartisan task force established to investigate the assassination attempt on Monday, which should be formalized with a House vote later this week.At 8 p.m., Fox News will air the first joint interview with Trump and his newly minted running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio. The interview took place before Biden announced he was leaving the race. We’ll see whether host Jesse Watters asks any challenging questions — such as probing Vance about his prior criticisms of Trump.As Biden tries to hand over the committee’s millions in remaining cash to Harris, Republican lawyers and operatives are saying “not so fast,” our colleague Maeve Reston reports.“Several campaign finance lawyers aligned with Republicans argue that the campaign does not have legal authority to hand off the campaign to Harris — and that the maneuver is all but certain to be challenged before the FEC or in a court of law.”“Charlie Spies, a prominent GOP campaign finance lawyer, said both Biden and Harris would have to have been officially nominated by the Democratic Party at its convention next month before any kind of handoff could occur,” Maeve reports.Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a key backer of Biden during the past tumultuous weeks, warned about Republican legal challenges resulting in Democrats losing access to state ballots. But Democratic campaign finance experts dismiss the legal challenges, Maeve reports.Dara Lindenbaum, an FEC commissioner appointed by Biden, offered the opposite view: “The Biden for President Committee is the campaign committee for President Biden and Vice President Harris,” she said. “The funds stay with her so long as she remains on the ticket.”The last time Harris ran for president, she drew on her cred as a former prosecutor to attack Trump. Now she may get a second chance — and this time, she’ll get to lob her attacks against an actual felon, our colleague Ashley Parker notes.“Harris’s team spent Sunday reacting to the news from Biden — who put out a statement supporting her as the Democratic nominee to replace him — and preparing her own bid,” Ashley writes.“But in the weeks following the stumbling June 27 presidential debate that sparked Biden’s eventual downfall, former advisers and people close to Harris — a former San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general — said that embracing the role of prosecutor in chief against Trump would certainly be a key part of her message and appeal.”When Harris was running for president in 2020, her slogan was “Kamala Harris, for the people” — the line she used to introduce herself in California court, Ashley notes. And one of her key ads then explicitly drew a contrast between herself and Trump, with the narrator intoning: “She prosecuted sex predators; he is one. She shut down for-profit colleges that swindled Americans; he was a for-profit college — literally.”Our colleages Hannah Recht and Emily Guskin took a look at 11 post-debate polls pitting Harris against Trump. They found little difference between how she and Biden stack up against him.

WaPo_36,"12 NFL training camp storylines, from Aaron Rodgers to new-look kickoffs",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/22/nfl-training-camp-2024/,2024-07-22 18:14:03.084934,,"NFL teams have started to report to training camps, meaning the countdown to the start of the regular season in September has begun in earnest. As the real games get closer, a notable rule change could grab the spotlight.Team owners ratified one of the most consequential rule changes in NFL history this offseason when they approved a “hybrid” kickoff format. It is designed to make the kickoff relevant again while simultaneously making the play safer.Players, coaches and fans face a major adjustment. The new alignment, with 21 players lined up on one half of the field and only the kicker on the other side to start the play, could be jarring at first. The would-be tacklers on the kicking team and blockers on the receiving team, beginning only five yards apart, cannot move until the ball reaches a returner or touches the ground. From there, the proceedings are intended to resemble a play from scrimmage.The hopes are that the return rate will increase dramatically and big plays will be plentiful. Coaches can get creative with their returns and coverages. Some teams might even have a non-kicker take the kickoff, aiming to get another capable tackler on the field. Teams began working on the play during the spring, but now that work intensifies.Here are other storylines that will be in focus before the season kicks off:Aaron Rodgers’s 2023 season lasted just four plays before the four-time MVP suffered a torn Achilles’ tendon in his left leg in his debut with the New York Jets. The Jets’ inability to remain in playoff contention kept them from having to make a decision on whether to allow Rodgers to play late in the season after he sped through his recovery to get back on the practice field.Now he returns to prepare for a new season. He must demonstrate that he still can be an upper-tier quarterback in a season in which he turns 41. The Jets, after making offseason moves to fortify their offensive line and bolster their wide receiver corps, must show they can put a team around Rodgers worthy of contender status.The drama undoubtedly will continue following an offseason in which Rodgers was mentioned as a running mate for independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., then missed the Jets’ mandatory minicamp while reportedly on a trip to Egypt.It might be spectacular. Or it might be spectacularly disappointing. Either way, it should be captivating.All NFL drafts are about the quarterbacks, to some extent. This year’s was about the quarterbacks more than ever: A record-tying six were chosen in the opening round, all within the first 12 selections.The Chicago Bears already have named No. 1 pick Caleb Williams their starter. They gave him a reasonable chance for rookie-season success by taking wide receiver Rome Odunze with the No. 9 choice after adding wideout Keenan Allen and tailback D’Andre Swift to an offense that already included wide receiver DJ Moore and tight end Cole Kmet.The Washington Commanders’ Jayden Daniels and the Denver Broncos’ Bo Nix also could be Week 1 starters. The timeline is less clear for Drake Maye with the New England Patriots and J.J. McCarthy with the Minnesota Vikings. Each of those teams added a potential temporary veteran starter, the Patriots with Jacoby Brissett and the Vikings with Sam Darnold. The Atlanta Falcons’ curious selection of Michael Penix Jr. at No. 8 leaves him backing up Kirk Cousins (more on that later).The progress of each of the prized rookies during training camp will provide the first hint as to whether this class of quarterbacks will fulfill its outsize promise.The Pittsburgh Steelers reached the AFC playoffs last season even while going through Kenny Pickett, Mitchell Trubisky and Mason Rudolph as starters at quarterback. They remade the position in the offseason by signing Russell Wilson as an inexpensive free agent and trading for Justin Fields as the Bears opted to let him go for next to nothing to clear the way for Williams.It will make for an interesting camp. Wilson will be attempting to show he still can resemble the nine-time Pro Bowl pick he was with the Seattle Seahawks before two turbulent seasons with the Broncos. Fields will be trying to demonstrate the Bears gave up on him too soon. Coach Mike Tomlin must pick the starter, with Wilson widely considered the front-runner.Cousins left the Vikings to sign a four-year, $180 million contract in free agency with the Falcons. Rather than use the No. 8 pick to improve the roster around him, the team selected his eventual replacement. The NFL later stripped the Falcons of a fifth-round draft pick and fined them $250,000 after determining they violated tampering rules in their dealings with Cousins and two other players connected to their free agent signings in March.It should make for an intriguing practice field dynamic in training camp and beyond.The Patriots parted ways in January with Bill Belichick after 24 seasons and six Super Bowl titles, then used a succession clause written into Jerod Mayo’s contract to move quickly to promote him from linebackers coach to head coach. A new era is underway in Foxborough, Mass., as the Patriots open their first training camp of the post-Belichick era and Mayo faces the decision about whether to start the season with Maye or Brissett as the starter at quarterback.Jim Harbaugh returns to the NFL with the Los Angeles Chargers after coaching Michigan to the College Football Playoff championship during a turbulent season in which he served a pair of three-game suspensions and the NCAA investigated allegations of improper scouting and sign stealing.Harbaugh coached the San Francisco 49ers to three appearances in the NFC championship game and a Super Bowl appearance in a four-year span from the 2011 to the 2014 seasons. He inherits a Chargers team with franchise quarterback Justin Herbert already in place. Much will be expected.The Falcons interviewed Belichick twice but passed him over by hiring Raheem Morris as their coach. The Commanders spoke to Belichick but opted for Dan Quinn. No team other than the Falcons is known to have interviewed Belichick during a hiring cycle in which eight teams chose new coaches.He will work in broadcasting for the time being but has not ruled out a return to coaching, and his availability could be alluring next offseason to the owner of any team that has championship aspirations.Quarterback Lamar Jackson won his second MVP award last season, and the Baltimore Ravens secured the AFC’s top playoff seed. But they lost to the Kansas City Chiefs in a mistake-filled performance in the AFC championship game in Baltimore, the second time in a five-year span that they failed to reach the Super Bowl despite being the conference’s No. 1 seed in an MVP season for Jackson.The Ravens added tailback Derrick Henry during the offseason, hoping he has enough left to be a major asset as Jackson makes another attempt to reach his first career Super Bowl.Sean Payton, the former Super Bowl-winning coach for the New Orleans Saints, returned to the NFL last season and went 8-9 with the Broncos. Payton benched Wilson in December in favor of Jarrett Stidham, who started the final two games. The NFL Players Association told the Broncos and the NFL’s management council in November that the team’s threat to bench Wilson if he did not agree to adjust his contract was illegal and violated the collective bargaining agreement.The Broncos released Wilson, drafted Nix and traded for Zach Wilson in the offseason. Payton must settle the quarterback situation and attempt to get the Broncos headed in the proper direction.The Chiefs’ second straight Super Bowl title was followed by an offseason of tragedy, off-field misbehavior and turmoil. A shooting at the team’s post-Super Bowl celebration in Kansas City resulted in one person being killed and nearly two dozen others being injured. Wide receiver Rashee Rice was involved in a six-vehicle crash on a Dallas expressway and faces charges for his role in the incident.Kicker Harrison Butker generated controversy with his remarks during a commencement address at Benedictine College in Kansas, leading the NFL to say it disagreed with the views he expressed. The Chiefs released defensive lineman Isaiah Buggs after he was arrested on a domestic violence-burglary charge, weeks after he turned himself in at the same Alabama jail on misdemeanor animal cruelty charges. Voters in Jackson County, Mo., rejected a sales tax measure that would have provided public funding to partially pay for renovations to Arrowhead Stadium.Now the Chiefs will attempt to return the focus to on-field matters as they begin their bid to try to become the first team to win three straight Super Bowls.The NFL banned the hip-drop tackle, citing the high injury rate of the technique, over the objection of the NFLPA. The adjustment period for players begins during training camp, and preseason games will provide the first glimpse of how the officials will enforce the new prohibition."
WaPo_37,"Jared Kushner’s grandparents relied on aid and shelter as refugees, documents show",https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2024/07/22/jared-kushner-grandparents-refugees-aid-shelter/,2024-07-22 18:00:03.084934,,"“Bussel, David and his daughter Esther Lotker from Novogrudok, currently in New York are sought by Nachum Kushner.”The ad, in Yiddish, appeared on page two of the May 17, 1946, edition of the Forward, the nation’s largest Jewish newspaper. It was one of dozens under the title “Jewish Survivors Seeking Their American Relatives.”Nachum Kushner was the great-grandfather of Jared Kushner, former president Donald Trump’s son-in-law and White House adviser. A hatmaker from what is now Belarus, Nachum survived the Holocaust with his daughters Rae (Jared’s grandmother) and Lisa by tunneling out of the Novogrudok ghetto and living among resistance fighters in the forest. In the same woods, Jared’s grandfather, Joseph Berkowitz, who had escaped from a work camp, hid with his siblings.Seven decades later, their grandson became a top official in an administration that sharply restricted immigration and cut the number of refugees the country admits to its lowest level ever. Trump, in his current presidential campaign, has pledged to suspend the refugee program, ban refugees from Gaza, and turn back asylum seekers.New details about Kushner’s family history reveal the extent of the aid and shelter his grandparents received upon their arrival in the United States as desperate, nearly penniless refugees.After the war, Joseph and Rae found each other in Budapest and married in August 1945. They and the other surviving family members were then smuggled from Soviet-controlled Eastern Europe into American-occupied Italy. Unable to continue to Palestine, as originally planned, they entered a displaced persons camp.It was there that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration placed the ad for the Kushners. Survivors were desperate to find their families, and NGOs were hoping to find visa sponsors for the stateless refugees in their care. Each week, the Forward ran hundreds of free ads and broadcast the listings over the radio.The Kushners were looking for David Bussel, an 80-year-old retired garment worker in the Bronx who had left Europe in the 1880s. He was the uncle of Joseph Berkowitz, who later took his wife’s last name, Kushner. The following Monday, the Kushners ran another ad for Nachum’s relative Leah Gross, who had immigrated to New York in 1901.They found them both.“We wanted to leave for Israel, but at the time it wasn’t possible,” said Rae Kushner in a Yiddish-language testimony recorded in 1972 at Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust memorial and museum. “We wanted to go to Africa, but it was difficult to enter. Until we were able to connect with America.”Still, the Kushners had to wait for Congress to pass the Displaced Persons Act in the summer of 1948 to get their visas. “My husband had two uncles and an aunt in America,” Rae said. But while the Kushners waited in Italy, all three relatives died, she said.After Bussel died in January 1948, it fell to his son Harry, a Bronx physician, to sponsor the Kushner family, which by then included a newborn daughter, Jared’s aunt Linda. With the help of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), the family of five set sail from Genoa on March 16, 1949.But while the ship was at sea, Harry Bussel rescinded his sponsorship. The HIAS file stated, “He does not know the family” and “assumes no responsibility.” When the family arrived on March 29, 1949, according to the file notes, they had two dollars to their name and no one to take them in.The Kushners were referred to a shelter.By the time of his death in 1985, Joseph with his wife Rae owned a New Jersey real estate empire of more than 4,000 properties. During his time in the White House, Jared Kushner kept a photo of his grandparents in his desk drawer, finding inspiration in their survival and rags-to-riches story.Their first toehold in America was a room at Capitol Hall, a once-elegant hotel turned shelter at 166 West 87th Street on New York’s Upper West Side.It was one of 14 Manhattan hotels run by a coalition of aid groups called United Services for New Americans that temporarily housed many of the 140,000 Holocaust refugees admitted to the United States from 1946 to 1953. Families with no one waiting for them at the docks were referred to one of the hotels or to a 400-bed HIAS shelter in the former Astor Library, which is now the Public Theater.Echoing New York City’s current policy for arriving asylum-seeking families, the Kushners were given a room for 60 days, a food allowance, laundry service and help with clothing, medicine and other incidentals.“Dusty and dingy” is how Joseph Berger described Capitol Hall in a New York Times essay last year. Berger, a retired Times reporter, stayed in the hotel when he came to New York in 1950 with his Polish Jewish family at the age of five. Images of recent migrants sleeping outside a Manhattan hotel spurred him to reflect on the similarities between the two waves of immigration.Today, Capitol Hall serves as transitional housing for homeless New Yorkers. Nearby, the Riverside Terrace Residence and the Belnord Hotel house mostly Latin American migrant families.Last year, Mayor Eric Adams warned that the arrival of more than 170,000 migrants would “destroy the city.” Trump said at a recent rally in the South Bronx, “They want to get us from within. I think they’re building an army.”Jared Kushner, who is not officially involved in his father-in-law’s presidential campaign and has said he doesn’t plan to join a second Trump administration, has mostly remained quiet on the issue of immigration. An exception came in 2022, when he criticized Trump’s political rival Ron DeSantis for using asylum seekers as “political pawns” after the Florida governor chartered flights of migrants to blue states.But Jared’s uncle Murray Kushner, the 73-year-old chairman of the Kushner Real Estate Group, recoils at what he called “Trumpian casting of aspersions of immigrants and refugees as murderers and killers.” In an interview at his company headquarters in Jersey City, he said he was struck by the similarities between Trump’s rhetoric and the postwar American antisemitism directed at his parents.“They were also afraid of taking us in,” Rae Kushner said in her Yad Vashem testimony. “They thought we were no longer human, that we were animals.”When President Harry S. Truman in 1946 pushed for Congress to allow more refugees from Europe, conservative groups such as the American Legion resisted what they saw as a threat to the country’s “racial composition.” A Gallup poll at the time found that 72 percent of Americans opposed increasing immigration, as Congress was contemplating at the time.“The opponents of [displaced persons] legislation, trading in timeworn Judeo-Bolshevik conspiracy theories,” wrote historian David Nasaw in his 2020 book “The Last Million,” “suggested that those who had lived in the Soviet Union or Soviet-dominated Poland and been liberated by the Red Army were more than likely to be Communist sympathizers or clandestine operatives.”The bill that Congress passed in 1948 called for rigorous vetting of refugees and excluded anyone who had not entered American, British or French zones before the end of 1945. This barred 90 percent of Polish Jews, like the Kushners, who were seen suspiciously by Cold War America. Not only had they been liberated by the Red Army, but Nachum Kushner had been jailed by the Soviet secret police for six weeks in 1945 for bartering for salt, according to his 1972 Yad Vashem testimony. To get around the restrictions, the Kushners presented themselves to American officials as German Jews, and Joseph Berkowitz became Joseph Kushner, pretending to be his father-in-law’s son, according to Andrea Bernstein in her book “American Oligarchs.”The Kushner’s HIAS file indicates the family regularly visited with case workers at the Hotel Marseille on 103rd Street and Broadway. The largest hotel housing survivors, it had a nursery, medical facilities, a kosher kitchen and a center with free clothing. The lobby had the feel of a postwar European train station, with a dozen languages spoken and dramatic reunions.Despite the sense of hope, many of the residents remained in survival mode. “I have to keep telling them that they needn’t take bread to their rooms hidden in their clothes,” Ralph Astrofsky of the United Services for New Americans said in a 1940s radio interview.The Kushners were no different. “They seemed to believe that they could get what they need or want by exercising pressure on us,” a case worker wrote. “They also tried to obtain everything at once as if they would not get everything they were entitled to.”But the file also said the Kushners had “a tremendous drive to establish themselves and start off again.” The case worker said Joseph Kushner took on a tremendous amount of responsibility for the family.It’s that drive and grit that made it into Jared’s 2022 memoir, “Breaking History.”“Two days after arriving, my grandfather showed up early at a construction site in Brooklyn, willing to work hard,” Jared wrote, without mentioning the shelter stay. “My grandfather was a simple, quiet man who had no formal schooling. But he spoke six languages, and he lived the American dream.”The case file shows that two weeks after their arrival, Joseph was unemployed. Still, the overall story is true. Four years after arriving with just $2, Joseph pooled his savings from working as a laborer with other Jewish immigrants to start building New Jersey homes.While Murray Kushner said nothing can compare to the Holocaust, he sees today’s migrants as not so different from his family. “They’re looking for an opportunity to raise children and to be successful,” he said. “They’re all grasping at something. They just need an opportunity.”"
WaPo_38,A Harris-Trump race would pit ex-prosecutor vs. recently convicted felon,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/22/harris-trump-prosecutor-felon/,2024-07-22 18:00:03.084934,,"Kamala D. Harris leaned into her background as a former prosecutor to attack Donald Trump in her first presidential bid in 2020 — a message that attracted little support in the Democratic primary as Harris, short on money, ended her campaign before the first votes were cast.Now, with the Democratic Party rapidly coalescing behind her following President Biden’s sudden withdrawal from the campaign on Sunday, Vice President Harris is getting another chance to make her case in the court of public opinion — and this time, against a recently convicted felon.“There is a clear discernment between Kamala D. Harris and what she represents and her background and someone who has been convicted of 34 felonies and still has multiple indictments he has to go through,” said Bakari Sellers, a former South Carolina state representative and longtime Harris supporter.In May, a Manhattan jury found former president Donald Trump guilty of 34 felony charges of falsifying business records in a case related to a hush money payment to an adult-film star. He also faces three outstanding cases — including one state case in Georgia involving election interference and a federal case in Washington involving Trump’s role in the events leading up the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. A third case on charges of mishandling classified documents was thrown out last week by a federal judge; a Justice Department special counsel has filed notice of his intent to appeal.Harris’s team spent Sunday reacting to the news from Biden — who put out a statement supporting her as the Democratic nominee to replace him — and preparing her own bid. But in the weeks following the stumbling June 27 presidential debate that sparked Biden’s eventual downfall, former advisers and people close to Harris — a former San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general — said that embracing the role of prosecutor in chief against Trump would certainly be a key part of her message and appeal.“This is someone who can clearly and forcefully articulate the case against Trump,” said Jim Margolis, a senior adviser to Harris’s 2020 presidential campaign. “That’s the prosecutor in her. And she’s someone who in a debate can move with the conversation and strike back hard — no notecards, just brainpower.”Asked about the prospect of a prosecutor-versus-felon matchup, the Trump campaign linked Harris to the Biden presidency, arguing that Harris is responsible for everything from Biden’s border policy to “Bidenomics” to “a weak foreign policy that has led to war and chaos around the world.”“No one has lied about Joe Biden’s cognitive decline and supported his disastrous policies over the past four years more than Cackling Co-Pilot Kamala D. Harris,” Trump campaign spokeswoman Caroline Sunshine wrote in a statement. “While Biden kowtows to California liberals, Kamala D. Harris actually is one.”Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), Trump’s newly announced running mate, said in a statement Sunday that “Joe Biden has been the worst President in my lifetime and Kamala D. Harris has been right there with him every step of the way.”Harris made the prosecutor pitch during her failed 2020 campaign. Her slogan at the time — “Kamala D. Harris, for the people” — was what she used to introduce herself in California court. And one of her key ads then — which has since re-emerged and gone viral — explicitly drew a contrast between herself and Trump, with the narrator intoning: “She prosecuted sex predators; he is one. She shut down for-profit colleges that swindled Americans; he was a for-profit college — literally.”“He’s tearing us apart — she’ll bring us together,” the ad concludes, noting that Harris is “in every possible way the anti-Trump.”At the time, Harris withdrew from the Democratic primary before the first nominating contest. She was roundly viewed as a poor candidate, who churned through staff members — a problem she also had early in her tenure as Biden’s No. 2 — and couldn’t articulate an affirmative case for herself as much as she could a case against Trump.In the wake of the 2020 police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and a subsequent summer full of Black Lives Matters protests, her tough-on-crime prosecutor background also became something of a liability among her party’s more liberal members.Now, however, with nearly four years of experience as Biden’s vice president and in a potential matchup with an actual felon, allies hope the message will have more resonance. The Biden campaign’s internal polling has found that attacking Trump as a “convicted felon” is effective, a Harris ally said.“Her ability to unpack an argument and understand both sides of an argument and then reconstruct it in a way that the average person can understand is an incredible skill set to have,” said Ashley Etienne, who served as communications director to Harris in the vice president’s office. “That was the benefit of her being a former prosecutor and how that translated to the job of vice president.”Appearing on CBS’s “Face The Nation” this month, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) anticipated that Biden would probably be replaced with Harris, offering a glimpse of her strengths — he described her as “very vigorous” — but also sharing a preview of how Republicans plan to attack her as farther left than Biden.“She’s for the Green New Deal. She’s for Medicare for all. She’s more like Bernie Sanders on policy,” Graham said at the time.Kellyanne Conway, a 2016 Trump campaign manager and confidante, said, “If Democrats had confidence in Kamala’s competence, they could have swapped him out for her a long time ago.”Harris allies say that her image as prosecutor should be viewed broadly, and that they expect Harris to forcefully make the case on issues including reproductive rights — an area where Biden, an Irish Catholic, was more reticent — and an unchecked Supreme Court stocked with three Trump appointees.“She’s certainly doing that regarding reproductive rights,” said Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). “She can also make the case for what I would describe as this out-of-control Supreme Court and how dangerous it would be for Trump to get any more nominees onto that court.”In the wake of the 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade, which established a constitutional right to abortion, it was Harris far more than Biden who energetically traveled the country, pressing the case for a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body.“She will give a much more full-throated attack on abortion rights being under assault in this country, and she will also really articulate, in a way that’s really authentic, why this is so important,” said Nancy Zdunkewicz, founder of Z to A Research, a Democratic polling firm. “Kamala is a really great communicator on this, and it is our most powerful attack.”Abigail Disney, a filmmaker, Disney heir and longtime Democratic donor, announced this month that she was withholding donations to Democrats until Biden bowed out of the race and suggested Harris would be a capable alternative. In response to email questions from The Washington Post after her statement about freezing her donations, Disney hailed Harris as someone who “has been grotesquely underestimated by a Democratic Party establishment that has historically been less supportive of the women of color in their ranks even in spite of the loyalty with which women of color have supported them.”Some of Harris’s most powerful moments came during her time serving as California’s junior senator. From her perch on the Senate Judiciary Committee, she earned plaudits as a tough questioner, with pointed interrogations of Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh and Attorney General William P. Barr going viral.At the time, Trump described Harris’s questioning of Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing as “nasty,” saying she did “a horrible thing.”“I got such a big kick out of watching Bill Barr squirm,” said Hirono, who served on the Judiciary Committee with Harris. “She’s very persistent. You can see the prosecutor in her. She’s very smart, she’s funny, she’s caring, she’s witty.”More recently, several Democrats publicly and privately pointed to Harris’s comments this month at the Essence Festival of Culture, one of the largest annual gatherings of Black women. Speaking about the Supreme Court’s decision that Trump has absolute immunity for “core” official acts by a president, Harris simplified the complicated topic — displaying what allies says is a signature skill — and laid out why she says a second Trump term, with him largely immune from prosecution, would be especially dangerous.“The United States Supreme Court essentially told this individual who has been convicted of 34 felonies that he will be immune from essentially the activity he has told us he is prepared to engage in if he gets back into the White House,” she said, warning that Trump has boasted of his plans to “weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies” and “talked about being proud of taking from the women of America a most fundamental right to make decisions about your own body.”This ability to communicate in plain English will be key for a Harris candidacy, said Etienne, who added that the vice president will be at her most potent if she is not just attacking Trump, but simultaneously offering a unified vision for the nation.“That’s the fine line you’ve got to walk — you can lean in and pull out a lot of adjectives to describe him, but is that really going to grow your base of support?” Etienne asked. “People want to be inspired, and adjectives about Trump aren’t inspiring. But asking me who I want to be in the next 20 years and asking me what type of country I want to leave for my daughter can actually inspire me.”"
WaPo_39,What to know about the Democratic convention now that Biden’s out of race,https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/07/22/dnc-convention-2024-chicago-harris-biden/,2024-07-22 18:00:03.084934,,"President Biden’s decision to end his reelection bid means Democrats must now quickly find a new candidate. The Democratic National Convention’s rules committee has called a Wednesday meeting to discuss the process for picking a new nominee.Although many in the party quickly endorsed Vice President Harris as the nominee-apparent — as Biden did — Democrats still must make a formal nomination, either through virtual vote that would lock in a new nominee in early August, or in an “open” convention.It means that the convention could have a more significant impact on the 2024 presidential election than expected. If a virtual roll call doesn’t show a clear majority backing Harris, the party will likely hold a mini-primary at the convention. The convention may also serve as the venue for the formal announcement of a new vice-presidential nominee.“If the overwhelming delegations across the country are wanting the vice president to be the nominee, I think we should go ahead and have the virtual roll call vote,” Gilberto Hinojosa, chair of the Texas Democratic Party and a member of the rules committee, said. “If there’s a big split, which I doubt, then we should leave it to the convention.”Democrats will likely try to settle the nomination before the convention because some states have August deadlines to get on the ballot for the general election, while early voting begins in some places in September, The Post reported.The convention will run from Aug. 19 to Aug. 22.It will be in Chicago. Evening activities such as official proceedings and prime-time programming will take place at United Center, the home of the Chicago Bulls and Chicago Blackhawks. Daytime events will be held at McCormick Place, the sprawling lakefront convention center, according to convention organizers.The Windy City hosted the 1968 Democratic National Convention — the last time the party was forced to pick a presidential candidate because its incumbent had opted not to seek reelection.Networks and channels such as ABC, CBS, CNN and C-SPAN will cover the event. The Democratic National Convention’s YouTube channel will broadcast the events live.Harris is the favorite, with many in the party quickly rallying behind her in the wake of Biden’s decision to opt out of the race.On Sunday, chairs for the 57 state parties and territories said they are endorsing Harris. Delegations from Louisiana, New Hampshire, Tennessee, North Carolina and South Carolina also endorsed Harris, and a handful of prominent governors, including California’s Gavin Newsom and New York’s Kathy Hochul, expressed support. At least 15 Democratic senators and 120 House Democrats have lined up behind the vice president.But Harris has said she will seek to “earn and win” the Democratic presidential nomination. She has not yet received the endorsements of some prominent party leaders, and her approval ratings have largely mirrored the decline of Biden’s since 2021.The names of  potential challengers making the rounds include  Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, The Post has reported. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), who in recent weeks has been floated as a possible candidate, has now endorsed Harris for the top of the ticket. An adviser to Sen. Joe Manchin III (I-W.Va.), meanwhile, told The Post he is considering re-registering as a Democrat to compete for the party’s nomination.Jaime Harrison chairs the Democratic National Committee. In a statement posted on social media after Biden’s announcement to not seek reelection, Harrison said Democrats would “undertake a transparent and orderly process to move forward as a united Democratic Party with a candidate” who can beat Trump.Harrison previously served as an aide to Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), a Biden ally, and as the head of the South Carolina Democratic Party. He also ran a competitive but ultimately unsuccessful campaign against Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), shattering fundraising records by raising $57 million in less than three months.Harrison said he was “emotional” about the news that Biden is ending his reelection campaign, praising Biden as a “transformational president.”“I’m emotional because I am still — still — riding with Biden,” Harrison said at a meeting of the Democratic National Convention Credentials Committee. “I still support my president. And we will get through this, my friends, as we always do.”"

But 43 percent also said they skipped or delayed a recommended screening, including for breast cancer, cervical cancer and colorectal cancer.The respondents cited multiple reasons for doing so: anxiety about medical tests, pain concerns, cost, lack of time or not believing a screening was necessary.In addition, only 42 percent of the participants said they were “very confident” about which health screenings they needed. Many women also had trouble finding pertinent information, with 31 percent of Gen Z women saying it was hard for them to find relevant health information.Some 63 percent of respondents said it was hard to prioritize their health.Women who discussed screenings with doctors were more likely to go ahead with a screening appointment, but not everyone had such conversations.The survey also found that commitment to health screenings varied with race. Black women were more likely to say regular health screenings were important and less likely to skip or delay one. However, they were also less likely to have had a conversation with a medical professional about key screenings.The findings can have serious health consequences, a report on the survey notes. “Regular health screenings play a vital role in improving the health and well-being of women,” the survey report says.This article is part of The Post’s “Big Number” series, which takes a brief look at the statistical aspect of health issues.

WaPo_41,"With Michael Phelps’s coach by his side, France’s Leon Marchand eyes history",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/22/leon-marchand-paris-olympics/,2024-07-22 18:00:03.084934,,"On Jan. 17, 2004, at an otherwise unremarkable, early-season swim meet in Auburn, Ala., a 30-year-old Frenchman and two-time Olympian named Xavier Marchand climbed the starting blocks for the men’s 200-meter individual medley. A couple of lanes over stood a towering, 18-year-old American phenom named Michael Phelps, already the world record holder in that event. Marchand had a good idea what was coming.Their career trajectories were moving inexorably in opposite directions: Marchand, having relocated to Auburn in hopes of reaching a third Olympics that summer, would fall short of that goal and soon retire. Phelps, guided by coach Bob Bowman, would win six gold medals at the 2004 Athens Games, the starting point for the most decorated Olympic career in history.Some two minutes after launching themselves into the water, Phelps touched in first place, three seconds ahead of the runner-up. Marchand was a distant sixth, nearly nine seconds behind Phelps.Now, two decades later, consider the cosmic circles — great circles of life, of fate and of history — coming closed this summer at the 2024 Paris Olympics, which fall on the 100th anniversary of the watershed 1924 Paris Games.Marchand, now 50, married another French Olympian, Celine Bonnet, and had a son, Leon — who, despite his parents’ reservations, born of a shared, lived appreciation of the sport’s brutal demands, eventually found his way into the same chlorinated waters. Though he would quit the sport for two years at age 7, saying the water was too cold, he would return — this time to stay.Like his father, Leon Marchand would find his way to America. In 2021, at 19, he would reach out to Bowman — Phelps’s former coach — via email and soon join Bowman’s nascent Arizona State program, winning 10 NCAA titles before he was done.A year later after arriving in the United States, Marchand would become a world champion in his father’s best event, the 200 IM, and claim a second gold in the longer version, the 400 IM.A year after that, at the 2023 world championships in Fukuoka, Japan — with Phelps in the building as a commentator for Peacock’s streaming broadcast — Leon Marchand would obliterate the legend’s last remaining world record by nearly a second and a half, winning the 400 IM in 4 minutes 2.50 seconds, one of three gold medals earned by Marchand at that meet.“Uh-oh,” Phelps said into his microphone that day as Marchand turned at the wall for the closing freestyle leg. And a few moments later: “It’s gone.”Beginning Saturday at Paris La Défense Arena just outside of the French capital, with his Olympian parents in the stands, neither of whom reached the podium in their combined three Summer Games, the younger Marchand, 22, will climb the starting blocks as arguably the dominant male swimmer in the world, a gold medal threat in four individual events and the face of the Paris Games.“I think I’m well prepared for it,” Leon Marchand said during an interview this year when asked about the massive expectations and pressure on his shoulders at an Olympics in his home country. “It’s going to be a factor, for sure. It’s not going to be only about swimming now. … My well-being is essential.”As for Xavier Marchand, an Olympian at Atlanta 1996 and Sydney 2000, he said he believes Leon inherited his mother’s suppleness and leg strength. “And I’d say he’s taken my mind,” he said in an email exchange, with his answers written in French then translated to English.Asked whether he recalled racing against Phelps all those years ago, he could summon no specific memories of his sixth-place finish in Auburn in 2004, which is believed to be the only time they raced each other in a 50-meter, Olympic-size pool.“At the time,” Xavier Marchand said, “I didn’t imagine — and I don’t think many [other] people did — that he would become the greatest champion in history.”Strangely, though, he has a much clearer memory of racing Phelps at a World Cup meet in Stockholm (in a 25-meter pool) in 2001 — when he was 27 and Phelps was 15 — and beating the future legend by nearly a second. Xavier Marchand’s email referencing that race, details of which were confirmed by a search of World Aquatics results, contained two emojis requiring no translation: flexed biceps and rolling on the floor laughing.Bowman received an email like dozens of others in his inbox every month from prospective trainees looking for a spot on his elite roster. But the name on this one jumped out: Leon Marchand.“I was like: ‘Marchand? Could this be Xavier Marchand’s kid?’” Bowman said, recalling the graceful French swimmer of the previous generation who stood out for his prominent sideburns and powerful breaststroke leg. “And sure enough, it was.”It was late spring 2021, and Bowman was in the process of building his Arizona State program into a powerhouse that would win an NCAA men’s championship three years later, with Marchand as its cornerstone. But now, in as much time as it took Bowman to do a quick scan of the young Frenchman’s times, he sent back a reply: “Yes, we would be very interested in having you.”The email to Bowman was one of many sent out that week by Marchand, who had decided to train in the United States because of the superior competitiveness and structure of its NCAA system and who appeared to be headed to California Berkeley until the school suddenly informed him it couldn’t offer him a full scholarship. Forced to reopen his search, Marchand hadn’t expected to find his perfect match so quickly.“What tipped the scales,” he would tell French reporters in 2022, “was the coach.”Bowman and Marchand carried on a WhatsApp conversation for the next several months — with the coach delighting his new charge by passing along some of Phelps’s training sets to try at home. The first time they met would be at the covid-delayed Tokyo Games in 2021, where Bowman served as a Team USA assistant coach and Marchand was a 19-year-old first-time Olympian who was just starting to gain recognition as a contender in the IMs. Marchand would compete in four events in Tokyo, with a best finish of sixth in the 400 IM.“We hugged right away,” Bowman recalled, “like we had known each other forever.”It was evident immediately to Bowman that Marchand had none of Phelps’s obvious physiological advantages, which included a 6-foot-4 frame and a wingspan said to be 79 inches. At 6-2 and 170 pounds, Marchand was neither exceptionally tall nor particularly strong and broad-shouldered.But once, when the French national team conducted “passive drag tests” on their swimmers — placing a tether around their torsos and dragging them, in a basic and stationary streamline position, through a 50-meter pool — Marchand blew away the lowest score team officials had ever recorded. In essence, he was built to glide through water.“He’s built like a torpedo,” Bowman said. “His hips and shoulders are the same width. That really helps.”Bowman wasn’t trying to create a chlorine-fueled clone of Phelps, knowing better than most that the latter’s combination of physiology, versatility and capacity for high-intensity, 10-times-a-week training probably would never be seen again. Their skill sets were different — Phelps was more of a freestyle/butterfly sprinter by nature, while Marchand’s best individual stroke is probably breaststroke — but their talents merged in the IM.The biggest similarity Bowman noticed was in the way they practiced. Once, at the end of a set of 500-yard freestyles, with Marchand hanging on the wall trying to catch his breath, Bowman challenged him to do one more — with the stopwatch running this time. Marchand asked Bowman what Phelps’s fastest time was in that race. Bowman told him — and Marchand beat it by five seconds. This past spring, at the NCAA championships, Marchand took gold in that race despite the freestyle being his third-best stroke.“Leon has done some practices that I’m pretty sure no one else in the world has ever done — just like Michael would do,” said Bowman, who left Arizona State this year to coach at Texas, where Marchand is expected to join him. “But where he’s most like Michael? On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is terrible and 10 is the best you can humanly do — Leon is like an 8.5 every day. He’s never a 2. He’s seldom a 10. But a high average every time.“And that’s what Michael did, year after year after year.”The breaking of any world record feels momentous in real time, a recalibratiion of the outer limits of human capability. But Marchand’s takedown of Phelps’s 400 IM standard in Fukuoka seemed downright tectonic. Not only was it Phelps’s last world standard, it had been the longest-standing world record in the sport. Phelps set it at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, at the height of his unprecedented powers. But he actually had held the record since 2002 — having rebroken it seven more times — making his reign the longest in the sport since World War II.Japanese media began referring to Marchand as “Shin-Kaibutsu” — “New Monster” — a nod to the “Kaibutsu” nickname by which Phelps was known there.Almost immediately, Marchand recognized the magnitude of what he had done — and the implications for the future. With Paris 2024 a year away, his life had just become more complicated, more public. The expectations on his shoulders grew exponentially.“I realized when I broke Michael’s record: ‘Well, the Paris Games are going to be different from what I imagined,’” he told French reporters this year. “I’m preparing myself mentally and physically for this.”Luckily for Marchand, he won’t have to navigate the Olympic circus alone. In Bowman, who joined the French coaching staff this summer, he will have at his side arguably the greatest such navigator in history, having guided Phelps through the madness at four Olympics. Bowman’s first move when arriving at the Olympic venue, he said, was to locate the side or back exits, so he would be able to direct his superstar swimmer away from the chaos on and around the pool deck.“I’m very good at saying no,” Bowman said. Of Marchand’s upcoming circus debut, Bowman said: “He has an idea [of how suffocating it will be]. But until you live through it, you don’t really have an idea.”While Marchand’s prowess in the IMs has made him an international superstar, swimming insiders are perhaps even more excited about the other events he is expected to swim at the Olympics: the 200 butterfly and the 200 breaststroke.Not only has no swimmer ever won both events in the same Olympics, no swimmer has medaled in butterfly and breaststroke races of any distance in the same Olympics. Of the handful who have attempted both strokes, only American Mary Sears, in 1956, even managed to make the finals in both, earning bronze in the women’s 100 fly and finishing seventh in the 200 breast.As for Marchand, his path to a historic double victory is daunting. In both races, he will have to vanquish the reigning world record holder: Hungary’s Kristof Milak in the 200 fly and China’s Qin Haiyang in the 200 breast. And because the events are on the same day, he will have to swim both the 200 fly and 200 breast in the preliminary heats on the morning of July 30, then swim both again in the semifinals that evening — and, assuming he advances, yet a third time in the evening finals July 31.“There are not many people who try this double. It’s a bit weird,” Marchand acknowledged. “But I like everything weird.”Not so long ago, such a thing scarcely seemed possible. In 2017, when the International Olympic Committee announced Paris as the host city for the 2024 Summer Games, it barely registered a shrug out of Marchand. At 15, the same age when Phelps made his first Olympic team, Marchand was merely a solid swimmer in the southern city of Toulouse. Few considered him a phenom, let alone a future superstar. That summer, Marchand ranked 31st in France in the 400 IM and 78th in the 200, and he failed to make the national team for the world junior championships.“At the time I was not really good at swimming … so I don’t think [Paris 2024] was really an idea in my mind,” Marchand said this past spring. “I think my technique was really good from the very beginning when I was young. But I was not really a racer; I didn’t want, really, to win. I was just, like, swimming every day a little bit to have fun.”Imagine everything it took — the genes of his Olympian parents, the drive and ambition to relocate half a world away, the twists of fate that put his career in the hands of Phelps’s former coach — to propel that non-racer to where he is now, with an entire nation resting its gold medal hopes on his narrow shoulders. In the history of Olympic swimming, France has produced just seven individual gold medalists, none of whom won multiple golds.The many thousands who pack Paris La Défense Arena will expect nothing less than the sight of Marchand atop the medal stand at least a couple of times, the strains of “La Marseillaise” filling the building, the parents weeping in the stands, the next great circle coming closed."
WaPo_42,How the Abercrombie crochet polo became the shirt of the summer,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/fashion/2024/07/22/abercrombie-crochet-polo/,2024-07-22 17:00:03.084934,,"NEW YORK — “I’m not one to normally ever risk having my nipples show unnecessarily,” said the TikToker @itsjust.campbell, “but I figured it’ll look pretty cool.”The nipple-revealer in question was a crochet shirt by Abercrombie & Fitch, the onetime mall stalwart known for its sexed-up take on Americana and a magazine that paired Bruce Weber images of preppy teen tawdriness with musings by philosopher Slavoj Zizek.And the creator was not alone in thinking it would “look pretty cool”: This summer, TikTok — and the streets of American cities — are filled with men, millennial and younger, who have made the $100 crochet polo a keystone of their hot-weather wardrobe.The Crochet-Style Button-Through Sweater Polo, as it is officially called, comes in a multitude of colors: white and orange, cream and blue and yellow, a tightly woven all black, a cornflower blue in a perforated design.Although they resemble designs popular in the 1960s and ’70s — which can still be found on sites such as Etsy and eBay — all are made of a combination of cotton and acrylic or viscose, a typical fabrication for fast-fashion pieces and, increasingly, designer goods.  Abercrombie may not consider itself fast fashion — and customers are flocking to the brand as an alternative — but there is little to suggest that its materials and design practices differ from those of Shein or Zara, other than the quantity of products made.On a recent visit to the label’s Midtown flagship, the musky oak scent of the brand’s perfume Fierce no longer clung to the air; there was no shirtless man with washboard abs at the door, enticing and intimidating shoppers like a lacrosse-captain siren. Such previous staples of the Abercrombie shopping experience are now gone, amid shake-ups in the design and C-suite that have amounted to what New York Magazine recently called the “unbranding” of Abercrombie & Fitch, focusing on generic designs in a wide range of sizing, and affordable go-tos such as wedding guest dresses and clothes for the dreaded in-office days of hybrid work schedules.The market seems to agree: The company’s stock has surged some 245 percent in the past year, Fortune reported in January. In the meantime, the media and brand-savvy consumers, exhausted by and skeptical of the constant rebranding of businesses such as Victoria’s Secret and J.Crew, have been puzzling over how to make sense of the transformation of a company better known for its scandalous designs and imagery and discriminatory hiring practices, detailed in the 2022 documentary “White Hot,” than its successes. Two years ago, writer Hanna Phifer wondered, “Since when did Abercrombie become The Row for people on a budget?”It may be hard to get your hands on the shirt of the summer: Two colorways were almost sold out in store, and the online stock reflects a similar degree of popularity.Elliot Duprey, a 23-year-old management consultant from Chicago who provides fashion and styling advice for men on TikTok, described the shirt as “easy to wear” — crucially, for young men who are eager to push the limits of their personal style but are hindered by light insecurity. “What’s acceptable for a straight man to wear?” Duprey mused of men’s thinking. “Especially in Chicago. It’s like, ‘What is no one going to say anything about?’ And like, at this point, [this style] has been around for long enough that it’s become this safe, slutty thing to wear.”The shirt is emblematic of two cultural shifts in fashion: one, the aforementioned remaking of Abercrombie from reviled retailer to your high school’s most villainous athletes, to unexpected basics problem-solver, and two, the rise of affordable, mainstream knockoffs of vintage or sustainable styles — pieces that became popular among those reacting against fast fashion’s dominance.Corey Robinson, chief product officer at Abercrombie & Fitch, wrote in an email that the brand first released the style five years ago in three colorways, “when classic 1950s menswear began trending.” But, Robinson wrote, “overall, the current trends are less preppy, so we’re seeing more success with our sweater polos than with our traditional pique polo.”“The response from our customers has been incredible, and we have greatly expanded our choices to be a key part of our menswear assortment today.” Search “abercrombie crochet shirt” on TikTok, and you’ll find countless guys giving it a spin. Most wear it layered over a plain cotton T-shirt or tank top, though several also try it without the underlayer. One man tries it over a black shirt, and then, through the magic of TikTok’s editing tools, appears to tug at the shirt and make it disappear, his bare chest peeking out between the shirt’s woven meanders. Spicy!Duprey still associates Abercrombie with its mall heyday — in our video interview, he was, incidentally, wearing a shirt riddled with oddball-shaped holes, by the John Waters-favorite Comme des Garçons, layered over a T-shirt — but he said he sees a number of shoppers searching for copies of clothes that look sustainable, or vintage. “A brand like Todd Snyder, which I really like, is also making these crochet polos,” he said. “But [Abercrombie] is taking it to a fast-fashion level, where it’s this very safe zone. They tell you what to buy and what to style it with on their website.”While generations of consumers have had a distaste for knockoffs, whether because of the monetary, social or intellectual cheapness of such pieces, Gen Z and millennials see them as “dupes,” which position copies as harmless, a hack or a score.The date at which the shirt was first introduced also points to the thinking behind Abercrombie’s strategy. It was in 2019 that the New York-based brand Bode began to take off, winning the Council of Fashion Designers of America’s Emerging Designer of the Year award. Crochet polos, some made from reused textiles, others from new fabrics, have been a staple of the brand, which designer Emily Adams Bode Aujla has stated was created to help men think of their clothing as heirlooms, or pieces to wear and repair for decades. Her shirts are more than six times the price of Abercrombie’s. Many are sold out.The same year that Bode began its hold on menswear, Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time In Hollywood” was released, unleashing a zest of zaddy-ish early-1960s styles. That trend was further cemented in a number of photoshoots — of football player Christian McCaffrey and actors Brad Pitt and Steven Yeun — in GQ styled by longtime menswear whisperer George Cortina, which emphasized a sexy, sleazy-hunk breed of masculinity with a touch of contemporary sensitivity. (Last year, the magazine even published a shoppable guide to wearing crochet polo shirts). In the meantime, vintage shopping has experienced an explosion in popularity, as shoppers tired of fast fashion’s low quality and middling designs — making the look of something old all the more appealing. By text message, Cortina said that he likes the crochet and knit tops for “their age and patina,” adding that they are also “v. photogenic.”As Robinson put it, “Our designers get their inspiration for our products by staying close to our customers and following their styling needs and trends.” Most brands do this, of course: Countless designers (including Bode) employ specialists to source vintage pieces as inspiration, and many vintage stores, especially those in New York and Los Angeles, make additional revenue by renting out their pieces to designers who use them as source material for future designs.But the timing here — a period of five years from indie designer creation, cinematic and magazine mythmaking and the boom in vintage — is most revealing. Duprey calls it “the cerulean sweater trickledown,” referencing the monologue from “The Devil Wears Prada” in which a magazine editor traces a high runway collection to a discount bin sweater. Abercrombie has concentrated much of its energy on sending products to influencers who have a smaller number of followers, a tactic deployed by fast-fashion brands such as Shein and Fashion Nova. That may make style seem more accessible, but it also removes shoppers further and further from the source material — whether that’s a well-designed (but extremely expensive) shirt, or a moment of vintage or film imagination.As fast fashion’s clutches tighten around more and more businesses, we get further from the sources of real style. But perhaps we are too precious about style. These days, most of us just want to wear a spiffy-looking shirt without having to watch several movies and listen to a bunch of albums to figure it out."
WaPo_43,Biden flips the script — and Republicans forget their lines,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/22/gop-response-biden-withdrawal-confused-weak/,2024-07-22 18:00:03.084934,,"On Sunday morning, House Speaker Mike Johnson declared that President Biden absolutely, positively had to run for another four years as president. “It’s not possible to simply just switch out a candidate who has been chosen through the democratic, small-d democratic process,” he told ABC News’s “This Week.”On Sunday afternoon, Johnson proclaimed that Biden absolutely, positively could not remain in office for even one more minute.“He must resign the office immediately,” the Louisiana Republican said in a statement.Confused? The Republicans certainly are.They wanted desperately to campaign against Biden this fall, and their party’s nominee, Donald Trump, had built his entire campaign around beating an opponent he could portray as old and feebleminded. But Biden upended everything Sunday with these words: “I believe it is in the best interest of my party and my country for me to stand down.”His opponents seemed not to know what to do. The Republican response was confused and weak. They accused Democrats of a coup and a conspiracy to hide Biden’s “dementia.” They called for invoking the 25th Amendment and teed up legal challenges. But mostly they responded, in what was clearly a coordinated if illogical plan, by insisting that Biden resign immediately. “If Joe Biden can’t run for re-election,” Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) wrote in a typical formulation, “he is not capable of serving as president for the next six months and needs to resign NOW!”That’s the best they’ve got? By that reasoning, Republicans also would have required the immediate resignation of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968 — and George Washington in 1796. But, of course, there is no logic. If Biden resigned, they’d get President Harris six months sooner.Just a few days earlier, ebullient Republicans had departed their convention in Milwaukee confident that they were united behind their flawed nominee while Democrats were disenchanted with theirs. But Biden’s patriotic sacrifice flipped the script.Democrats of all varieties — progressives and centrists, party veterans and insurgents, Black, White, Latino and Asian American — have rallied around Vice President Harris, Biden’s choice to succeed him. Nobody came forward to oppose her (except perhaps Sen. Joe Manchin, who isn’t even a Democrat, and gadfly Marianne Williamson). Assuming that overwhelming embrace continues, Democrats will be nominating the vigorous, 59-year-old vice president to run against the erratic, 78-year-old Trump, the oldest major-party nominee in history.Until now, voters faced a choice between two deeply unpopular options: Trump may be a felon, a liar and a threat to democracy, but Biden, they feared, was cognitively unfit. Now it’s disoriented Republicans who must ask: What now?Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), a speaker at Trump’s convention, has an idea. She responded to Biden’s withdrawal by announcing the existence of a “soft civil war” involving “the deep state,” in which Democrats, the intelligence community and the news media staged a “coup” against Biden, following “the assassination attempt on Trump for the crime of winning.” (Trump’s assailant was a registered Republican, with no known political motive.) She further reasoned that Biden must have dropped out because his family “must have gotten the price they demanded for the presidential library.”Trump couldn’t quite bring himself to stop campaigning against Biden on Sunday. “Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve — And never was!” he wrote in one post on Truth Social after Biden withdrew. “Crooked Joe Biden is the Worst President, by far, in the History of our Nation,” he wrote in another. Finally, he complained that “we have to start all over again” and said Republicans were the victims of “fraud.”He’ll no doubt come up with some abuse for Harris, though so far he has focused mostly on calling her “laughing Kamala” and “crazy.” He will inevitably find ways to stoke some Americans’ fears of having a woman of color as president, but (Joe Biden stage whisper here) those people were already voting for Trump.For now, Republicans seem to think their best response is to demand Biden’s immediate resignation, which GOP lawmakers did with military precision on Sunday. Rep. Richard Hudson (N.C.), chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in his version: “Every House Democrat must now answer: is the president fit to serve the rest of his term?”They can ask the question — the answer is “yes” — but a better question might be whether some of the Republican loons asking the question are fit to serve.Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) joined those calling for invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Biden from office. Perhaps nobody told them that this decision would be up to Harris.Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) joined Greene in declaring a “coup.” Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) joined those proclaiming a “cover up.” It took particular gall for House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) — who, like most House Republicans, voted to overturn Biden’s election victory — to accuse Democrats of undermining democracy and “trashing the primary choice of 14 million of their own voters.” (The delegates who represent those 14 million voters will now vote on Biden’s replacement.) Johnson, in his ABC interview, said it would be “unlawful” and cause “legal trouble” for Democrats to replace Biden. (Legal experts see no such troubles.)Already, some Republicans are recognizing that whinin’ about Biden isn’t going to be a winning strategy. Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), head of the House GOP conference, announced that she would introduce on Monday “a resolution condemning Kamala Harris’ role as Joe Biden’s ‘Border czar’” — a moniker Republicans invented for Harris.Good! Let’s have that debate. Border crossings are down dramatically, and Trump killed the bipartisan legislation that could have fixed the problem permanently. We weren’t talking about such things before because we were all talking about Biden’s age and mental state.Biden, in his selfless gesture, has returned this campaign to what it must be about: The singular menace of Donald Trump.What do you think President Biden should do with the rest of his time in office? Share your responses with us, and they may be published in The Post."
WaPo_44,A week of nonstop breaking political news stumps AI chatbots,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/22/ai-chatbots-breaking-news/,2024-07-22 19:59:02.680756,,"In the hour after President Biden announced Sunday that he would withdraw from the 2024 campaign, most popular AI chatbots seemed oblivious to the news. Asked directly whether he had dropped out, almost all said no or declined to give an answer. Asked who was running for president of the United States, they still listed his name.For the past week, we’ve tested AI chatbots’ approach to breaking political stories and found they were largely not able to keep up with consequential real-time news. Most didn’t have current information, gave incorrect answers, or declined to answer and pushed users to check news sources.Now, with just months left until the presidential election and bombshell political news dropping at a steady clip, AI chatbots are distancing themselves from politics and breaking news or refusing to answer at all.AI chatbot technology burst onto the scene two years ago, promising to revolutionize how we get information. Many of the top bots tout their access to recent information, and some have suggested using the tools to catch up on current events. But companies that make chatbots don’t appear ready for their AI to play a larger role in how people follow this election.Hours after the July 13 shooting at former president Donald Trump’s rally in Butler, Pa., some popular AI bots were confused about what — if anything — had happened. ChatGPT said rumors of an assassination attempt were misinformation. Meta AI said it didn’t having anything recent or credible about an assassination attempt.Stories to keep you informed

Two dead in listeria outbreak linked to deli meat. Here’s what to know.They similarly struggled immediately after Trump named J.D. Vance as his running mate last Monday and when President Biden tested positive for the coronavirus on Wednesday.Chatbots are designed to give conversational answers and keep people engaged. Names and links to sources for answers range from nonexistent to hidden, though some companies are starting to make them more visible. Even when AI does include a source, it adds it after the fact, said Jevin West, a professor and co-founder of the Center for an Informed Public at the University of Washington.“The public needs to know we’re in a stage still where most of the citations and sourcing are post-hoc and going to lead to problems,” West said. He noted that, for now, we “need to rely a little bit more on some of the more formally trained gatekeepers,” meaning the mainstream media.Some chatbots handled breaking news and sourcing better than others. Microsoft’s Copilot tended to have the correct information fastest in our tests, with heavy linking to original sources. Still, the company is being cautious about politics and putting in guardrails ahead of the election.“Out of an abundance of caution we’re redirecting election-related prompts in Copilot to Bing search to help ensure users are getting information from the most authoritative sources,” said Microsoft spokesperson Donny Turnbaugh.Asked on Sunday who was running for U.S. president, Copilot said: “Looks like I can’t respond to this topic.” It did correctly answer direct questions about Biden dropping out almost immediately.Google’s AI Overview answers don’t typically show up for questions about breaking news. Instead, the site skips straight to showing its usual Google News links. However Gemini, its separate AI chatbot, was sometimes able to answer news questions in tests. Gemini does not yet include links to its sources.The company announced late last year that it would restrict some election-related queries on its AI tools. If you ask Gemini about politics, it says, “I can’t help with responses on elections and political figures right now” and links users to Google search. Google said it’s working on improving the experience as it gets more feedback.Perplexity is another AI chatbot with access to real-time information, and it has come under fire for how it pulls from real articles and reporting. It is not blocking or redirecting political inquiries, but the company says it’s prioritizing authoritative sources such as government websites for election-related questions.In our tests, when asked “Was Trump shot?” hours after the July 13 rally, Perplexity said that “there are no reports of Trump or anyone else being shot or injured.” It did include other accurate information about the incident with links to sources. By later in the day, it was answering correctly.Asked on Sunday who is running for president, Perplexity listed Biden. Perplexity includes disclaimers in some answers that are incorrect, such as when it said on Wednesday that Biden did not have covid: “It’s important to note that the current health of public figures can change rapidly.”“For breaking news, we recommend reading trusted news outlets. They are best-equipped to offer real-time updates on timely topics since they are actively reporting on the news,” said Sara Platnick, spokesperson at Perplexity. She noted that less than 3 percent of Perplexity’s searches are related to current events.Meta AI — which appears in Messenger, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — seemed to have the most stringent limits on political news. Asked about Trump’s running mate, it generated an accurate answer that named Vance, but then quickly deleted and replaced it with a message that said “Thanks for asking” and linked to voting information. The company has been open about distancing itself from news on its platforms.Asked about Meta AI’s approach to breaking news, the company directed us to blog posts announcing the tool that mention only non-news uses. However, if you ask Meta AI what you should use it for, it includes asking for news updates.Instead of declining to answer about current events, OpenAI’s ChatGPT denied anything happened. Five hours after the Trump rally shooting, it said there was no assassination attempt. But by the next day, it had an accurate answer and a disclaimer confirming an assassination attempt and telling people to check other sources for the latest information. Immediately after Biden dropped out, it said he was still running, but it had the correct information an hour later.ChatGPT is not a real-time product, and the amount of time it takes to update can vary, said company spokesperson Liz Bourgeois. However, the company expects that to change as it makes more deals with media organizations.Despite what the companies want people to ask a chatbot, there are valid reasons people would turn to AI during a breaking news situation. Tech companies have gone out of their way to bake these bots into existing search features, making them an automatic first stop for many without even realizing it. Meta AI, for example, is the default search tool across Meta’s apps in the United States.In the immediate aftermath of a news event, there’s often an information vacuum, West, the professor at the University of Washington, said. Hungry for updates or conversation, people turn to social media or search engines — and try to sort through multiple news sources to find the latest. An AI bot that can give a pat, instant answer can seem like an alluring option.“They’re incredibly good at communication,” West said. “They’re not being optimized necessarily for truth.”"
WaPo_45,The Biden campaign is over. Should President Biden remain?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/22/biden-campaign-is-over-should-president-biden-remain/,2024-07-22 19:51:02.680756,,"Welcome to Monday, which has me reflecting on where we were four weeks ago today. It was before the debate. Before an attempted assassination. Before a presidential covid case. And before … what we’re going to talk about today. What wild development is coming next? Send campaign predictions and other tips to dan.diamond@washpost.com.Today’s edition: New details on Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s medical care following an assassination attempt earlier this month. A highly anticipated study suggests that bird flu  isn’t fueling asymptomatic infections among people.                             But first …The president’s fitness, reconsideredPresident Biden on Sunday ended his reelection campaign and threw his support behind Vice President Harris, a historic decision that upended the U.S. political landscape. Biden’s withdrawal came about three weeks after botching his debate against Trump — a prime-time performance so bad it fueled questions about whether the 81-year-old Biden was competent enough to remain in his current job, too.The questions about Biden’s presidential fitness have now been supercharged, I wrote in The Washington Post last night. Republican leaders immediately said that if Biden isn’t fit to run again, he’s not fit to serve now.“He must resign the office immediately,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) wrote in a tweet.The White House vowed: Biden isn’t going anywhere.“He looks forward to finishing his term and delivering more historic results for the American people,” spokesman Andrew Bates wrote in an email Sunday. Bates said that Biden, who has been recovering from a covid case in Delaware, would continue to focus on priorities such as creating jobs and fighting abortion bans.Congressional Democrats also said the president should serve out his term.“Joe Biden continues to do the work the American people want him to do — moving our country forward every day,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said. “MAGA extremists’ calls for him to step down are ridiculous.”The president has repeatedly said his heath is good and he’s up for the job.Americans’ doubts about Biden’s fitness were bad and have grown worse.A CBS News-YouGov poll conducted last month found that 72 percent of registered voters believed Biden lacked the mental and cognitive health to serve as president — up from 65 percent before the debate — compared with 49 percent who felt the same of Trump.There has also been an array of recent stories, in The Washington Post and elsewhere,  detailing Biden’s slip-ups in office and on the campaign trail, with the president appearing to be more frail and forgetful in recent months. Actor George Clooney, a high-profile donor, was among the allies who urged the president to drop out of the race, saying that Biden alarmed him at a recent fundraiser.So should Biden step down? Administration staff have said the White House infrastructure insulates Biden as president, with a team of senior advisers who shield him from the weaknesses that were exposed on the campaign trail.Health and policy experts also have drawn a line between campaigning for office — where a presidential candidate must crisscross the country, firing up voters and courting donors — versus making decisions in a structured environment.“A lot of the worry has been about his ability to serve out four years after a grueling campaign,” said Ezekiel Emanuel, a University of Pennsylvania bioethicist who advised the Biden administration on its covid response and other health issues. And Biden’s White House is “making good decisions and policies,” he added.Meanwhile: The tables have turned on the health question.While Donald Trump has made his own share of verbal flubs and misstatements, the GOP nominee benefited from comparison with Biden, who is three years older. Voters had generally expressed more concern about Biden’s age and fitness than Trump’s.But now the 78-year-old Trump is suddenly on track to be the oldest major candidate on a presidential ballot — 19 years older than Harris.And speaking of Trump’s health …Trump releases letter detailing medical care since assassination attemptTrump required no stitches after a gunshot grazed his ear at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania earlier this month, The Post’s Maegan Vazquez reports, citing a memo from his former White House doctor.The letter signed by Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Tex.), a political ally whose actions as a medical provider have come into question over the years, provides the most detailed public account of Trump’s care following the assassination attempt.A closer look: Jackson stated that Trump sustained a 2-cm-wide wound from the bullet that initially caused bleeding and swelling. The wound has begun to “heal properly,” though there is still intermittent bleeding that requires a bandage, he added.Along with treating his wound, Jackson said medical staff at Butler Memorial Hospital in Butler, Pa., “provided a thorough evaluation for additional injuries that included a CT [scan] of his head.” He noted that Trump will have further evaluations, including a comprehensive hearing exam, “as needed.”New study suggests bird flu isn’t fueling asymptomatic infections in humansA much-anticipated study of Michigan farmworkers who had no symptoms of bird flu — but were exposed to dairy cows infected with H5N1 virus — found that none of the workers had antibodies to the virus, suggesting that the disease is not spreading in asymptomatic people, our colleague Lena H. Sun reports.An ongoing study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services collected blood samples in June from 35 people who work on two Michigan farms with infected herds; fewer than half reported using masks or goggles, the CDC said in an update Friday.Tests showed their blood had no antibodies to the H5N1 virus, which “suggests these people were not previously infected,” the CDC said.Meanwhile, two additional poultry workers in Colorado were confirmed to have bird flu last week and a third was presumed positive in the ongoing  outbreak, according to the CDC. The presumed total number of human cases since April is now 11: four in dairy workers, seven in Colorado poultry workers.Meanwhile …Insurance agents and brokers can no longer make changes to Obamacare enrollments made through the federal marketplace unless they are already associated with that consumer’s particular policy, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced.The federal regulator will now require agents who can’t prove their association to take additional steps to make enrollment changes, even if they have consumer consent. The changes took effect immediately.Why it matters: In the first six months of 2024, CMS said it received 73,884 complaints of unauthorized plan changes and 134,368 complaints of unauthorized enrollments. The agency suspended 200 agents or brokers for suspected fraud or abusive conduct related to the unauthorized enrollments or plan switches between June 21 and July 10.We wrote about the growing problem earlier this year. For a deeper dive, check out the full report here.Windows outage sends hospitals scramblingA software outage affecting Microsoft Windows users on Friday created a cascade of chaos and inconvenience affecting the nation’s hospitals, The Post’s Hannah Ziegler, Taylor Telford and Daniel Gilbert report.The disruption, triggered by a faulty update from the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, left providers grappling with inaccessible machinery and medicines, along with a wave of missed appointments and canceled surgeries.One crucial lingering challenge for hospitals: Third-party vendors such as MRI image processors and blood-testing labs may take longer to apply the CrowdStrike fixes. “Patients are still impacted because other companies may not be remediated this quickly,” said B.J. Moore, chief information officer at Providence Health and Services. “The blast radius of this impact is big.”📅 Welcome back, Congress! The House is in session today, and the Senate resumes tomorrow.

WNBA players Sue Bird and Dawn Staley have carried the flag in past Games. A female flag bearer will be named Tuesday.The flag bearers are chosen by a vote of the American athletes at the Paris Olympics.Friday’s ceremony will be unique because it’s the first to be held outside of a stadium. Instead of walking in a parade, athletes will stand on river barges that will sail along the Seine toward a port across the river from the Eiffel Tower, where they will enter a temporary arena that will serve as the ceremony’s setting.The USOPC expects more than 350 of its 592 athletes in Paris to take part in the ceremony.This is James’s fourth Olympics. He helped the U.S. win gold medals at the 2008 and 2012 Games and a bronze in 2004.“It’s an incredible honor to represent the United States on this global stage, especially in a moment that can bring the whole world together,” James said in a statement released by the USOPC. “For a kid from Akron, this responsibility means everything to not only myself, but to my family, all the kids in my hometown, my teammates, fellow Olympians and so many people across the country with big aspirations. Sports have the power to bring us all together, and I’m proud to be a part of this important moment.”"
WaPo_47,Would Trump privatize weather forecasting? What to know.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/22/project-2025-weather-service-trump/,2024-07-22 19:00:02.680756,,"Among the stakes in the upcoming U.S. elections: Weather forecasts, who delivers them and what they say about links between extreme conditions and climate change.A conservative proposal drafted by the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 has ignited an intense debate this month by proposing that a Republican administration privatize weather forecasting now done by government agencies. The plan would break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the parent agency for the National Weather Service, describing it as “one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry.” Meanwhile, a separate Republican proposal introduced in the House last year calls for transforming NOAA into an independent agency akin to NASA, a plan critics say could expose it to political influence.Even as Donald Trump’s campaign has said it had no part in Project 2025, it’s widely seen as a blueprint for a possible second Trump administration. Private weather companies have not endorsed the calls for “commercializing” Weather Service data. Still, as the prospects of a second Trump presidency rise, meteorologists and climate scientists are voicing concern over what these proposals would mean for the millions of people they are working to inform and protect.During Trump’s term, scientists said they were sidelined, muted or forced out by the hundreds and raised concerns that the administration misrepresented their research on the coronavirus and reproduction — as well as on hurricane forecasting, environmental advocates said.“It does worry me what the future will hold”  for staff at NOAA and the Weather Service, said JoAnn Becker, president of the National Weather Service Employees Organization. The union represents 4,000 workers at those agencies.“There’s a lot of questions and no answers yet,” Becker said. “We just want to do our work protecting lives and property no matter who is president.”Government agencies, including NOAA and the Environmental Protection Agency, have for months been preparing for the possibility that Trump will return to the White House by strengthening safeguards around scientific integrity and job security.In a 2019 incident that became known as Sharpiegate, Trump used a marker to incorrectly suggest Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama — a scandal that underscored the potential damaging impacts of political meddling. An investigation later found political influence led NOAA to release a statement improperly backing Trump, and ultimately undermining its own forecast. Some have looked to such clues from Trump’s four years in the White House to try to glean what may come in a second term.Now, some scientists’ concerns stem from Project 2025, a 900-page document drafted by right-wing policy experts and former Trump officials. It calls for breaking up NOAA, whose climate research it calls “harmful to future U.S. prosperity.” It suggests the Weather Service should “fully commercialize its forecasting operations,” because its data is already used widely by private companies.The report bases that proposal on an assertion that “forecasts and warnings provided by the private companies are more reliable than those provided by the NWS.” The report cites a consultant report that analyzed forecast accuracy and found the Weather Service ranked behind private-sector meteorologists, who use government-funded observations to inform predictions shared via TV and radio stations, weather websites and smartphone apps.That includes outlets such as AccuWeather, the Weather Channel and Weather Underground — channels that help the Weather Service distribute its severe weather watches and warnings to a wider audience.But it was not immediately clear what it might mean for the Weather Service to run more like a business. The agency tracks data on everything from land and sea temperatures, precipitation and atmospheric conditions.A Project 2025 spokeswoman declined to make Thomas Gilman, who wrote the report’s recommendations for NOAA and the Weather Service, available for comment. Gilman served in the Trump administration as chief financial officer of the Commerce Department, which is the cabinet-level parent agency of NOAA and the Weather Service.Weather Service spokeswoman Susan Buchanan said the agency does not comment on “speculation” over how a future administration could change its operations.So far, some in the weather industry oppose the idea.AccuWeather chief executive Steven R. Smith said NOAA’s “foundational data” helps inform AccuWeather’s own forecasting software, artificial intelligence and meteorologists, and that “it has never been our goal to take over the provision of all weather information.”Smith said the company “does not agree with the view … that the National Weather Service should fully commercialize its operations.”Whether Trump agrees is not clear.Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said the former president “has nothing to do with Project 2025” and pointed to the Republican Party’s official platform. The platform makes no mention of weather or climate, and Cheung did not respond to further questions about the campaign’s position on NOAA or the Weather Service.Some former Trump administration officials say they don’t share Project 2025’s visions for federal weather agencies, nor would they expect Trump to embrace them during a second term.“There is 0% chance that anything in Project 2025 related to NOAA or weather will ever be considered or implemented,” Ryan Maue, a meteorologist who briefly served as NOAA’s chief scientist under Trump, wrote on X.Stuart Levenbach, who served as NOAA chief of staff under Trump, said the administration made no efforts to privatize the Weather Service, though it did pursue increased funding for buying weather data generated by private-sector companies, including data on ocean surface winds, space weather and Earth’s atmosphere.Under Trump, NOAA also worked to combat overfishing and other harms caused by Chinese fishing operations, speed up permitting processes that consider endangered species impacts and streamline the licensing processes for commercial satellites, Levenbach noted in a 2021 farewell letter to agency staff that he shared with The Washington Post.Trump’s initial pick to lead NOAA was former AccuWeather CEO Barry Myers, though the Senate never confirmed his appointment and he withdrew it two years later.While Myers never joined the agency, former NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service deputy director Andrew Rosenberg said the appointment suggests a more commercial approach to weather forecasting may have always been in the Trump playbook.But Maue and Levenbach pointed to an alternate proposal floated by Republicans in Congress and supported by former NOAA officials who served during Republican administrations. They want to separate NOAA from the Commerce Department and develop it into an independent agency within the executive branch.The idea was the subject of a House bill and hearing last year. Such independence could have prevented Sharpiegate, for example, Neil Jacobs, the acting NOAA administrator at the time, told a House committee last year.The “disparate goals” of the Commerce Department and NOAA “have had a demonstrably adverse impact” on the scientific agency, Levenbach and retired Rear Adm. Tim Gallaudet, another top NOAA official under Trump, wrote in an opinion column in the Hill last year.“An independent NOAA will ensure that America will better weather the storms in our future,” they wrote.But others have expressed concern that — though NOAA could benefit from more resources and may not be a logical fit within Commerce — making the agency stand alone could remove layers of bureaucracy that ultimately insulate it from politics.“You make NOAA separate, it’s a tiny little agency and [it becomes] subject to political whims both on the Hill and in any given administration,” Rosenberg said."
WaPo_48,The top 12 storylines to watch as NFL training camps begin,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/22/nfl-training-camp-2024/,2024-07-22 19:00:02.680756,,"NFL teams have started to report to training camps, meaning the countdown to the start of the regular season in September has begun in earnest. As the real games get closer, a notable rule change could grab the spotlight.Team owners ratified one of the most consequential rule changes in NFL history this offseason when they approved a “hybrid” kickoff format. It is designed to make the kickoff relevant again while simultaneously making the play safer.Players, coaches and fans face a major adjustment. The new alignment, with 21 players lined up on one half of the field and only the kicker on the other side to start the play, could be jarring at first. The would-be tacklers on the kicking team and blockers on the receiving team, beginning only five yards apart, cannot move until the ball reaches a returner or touches the ground. From there, the proceedings are intended to resemble a play from scrimmage.The hopes are that the return rate will increase dramatically and big plays will be plentiful. Coaches can get creative with their returns and coverages. Some teams might even have a non-kicker take the kickoff, aiming to get another capable tackler on the field. Teams began working on the play during the spring, but now that work intensifies.Here are other storylines that will be in focus before the season kicks off:Aaron Rodgers’s 2023 season lasted just four plays before the four-time MVP suffered a torn Achilles’ tendon in his left leg in his debut with the New York Jets. The Jets’ inability to remain in playoff contention kept them from having to make a decision on whether to allow Rodgers to play late in the season after he sped through his recovery to get back on the practice field.Now he returns to prepare for a new season. He must demonstrate that he still can be an upper-tier quarterback in a season in which he turns 41. The Jets, after making offseason moves to fortify their offensive line and bolster their wide receiver corps, must show they can put a team around Rodgers worthy of contender status.The drama undoubtedly will continue following an offseason in which Rodgers was mentioned as a running mate for independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., then missed the Jets’ mandatory minicamp while reportedly on a trip to Egypt.It might be spectacular. Or it might be spectacularly disappointing. Either way, it should be captivating.All NFL drafts are about the quarterbacks, to some extent. This year’s was about the quarterbacks more than ever: A record-tying six were chosen in the opening round, all within the first 12 selections.The Chicago Bears already have named No. 1 pick Caleb Williams their starter. They gave him a reasonable chance for rookie-season success by taking wide receiver Rome Odunze with the No. 9 choice after adding wideout Keenan Allen and tailback D’Andre Swift to an offense that already included wide receiver DJ Moore and tight end Cole Kmet.The Washington Commanders’ Jayden Daniels and the Denver Broncos’ Bo Nix also could be Week 1 starters. The timeline is less clear for Drake Maye with the New England Patriots and J.J. McCarthy with the Minnesota Vikings. Each of those teams added a potential temporary veteran starter, the Patriots with Jacoby Brissett and the Vikings with Sam Darnold. The Atlanta Falcons’ curious selection of Michael Penix Jr. at No. 8 leaves him backing up Kirk Cousins (more on that later).The progress of each of the prized rookies during training camp will provide the first hint as to whether this class of quarterbacks will fulfill its outsize promise.The Pittsburgh Steelers reached the AFC playoffs last season even while going through Kenny Pickett, Mitchell Trubisky and Mason Rudolph as starters at quarterback. They remade the position in the offseason by signing Russell Wilson as an inexpensive free agent and trading for Justin Fields as the Bears opted to let him go for next to nothing to clear the way for Williams.It will make for an interesting camp. Wilson will be attempting to show he still can resemble the nine-time Pro Bowl pick he was with the Seattle Seahawks before two turbulent seasons with the Broncos. Fields will be trying to demonstrate the Bears gave up on him too soon. Coach Mike Tomlin must pick the starter, with Wilson widely considered the front-runner.Cousins left the Vikings to sign a four-year, $180 million contract in free agency with the Falcons. Rather than use the No. 8 pick to improve the roster around him, the team selected his eventual replacement. The NFL later stripped the Falcons of a fifth-round draft pick and fined them $250,000 after determining they violated tampering rules in their dealings with Cousins and two other players connected to their free agent signings in March.It should make for an intriguing practice field dynamic in training camp and beyond.The Patriots parted ways in January with Bill Belichick after 24 seasons and six Super Bowl titles, then used a succession clause written into Jerod Mayo’s contract to move quickly to promote him from linebackers coach to head coach. A new era is underway in Foxborough, Mass., as the Patriots open their first training camp of the post-Belichick era and Mayo faces the decision about whether to start the season with Maye or Brissett as the starter at quarterback.Jim Harbaugh returns to the NFL with the Los Angeles Chargers after coaching Michigan to the College Football Playoff championship during a turbulent season in which he served a pair of three-game suspensions and the NCAA investigated allegations of improper scouting and sign stealing.Harbaugh coached the San Francisco 49ers to three appearances in the NFC championship game and a Super Bowl appearance in a four-year span from the 2011 to the 2014 seasons. He inherits a Chargers team with franchise quarterback Justin Herbert already in place. Much will be expected.The Falcons interviewed Belichick twice but passed him over by hiring Raheem Morris as their coach. The Commanders spoke to Belichick but opted for Dan Quinn. No team other than the Falcons is known to have interviewed Belichick during a hiring cycle in which eight teams chose new coaches.He will work in broadcasting for the time being but has not ruled out a return to coaching, and his availability could be alluring next offseason to the owner of any team that has championship aspirations.Quarterback Lamar Jackson won his second MVP award last season, and the Baltimore Ravens secured the AFC’s top playoff seed. But they lost to the Kansas City Chiefs in a mistake-filled performance in the AFC championship game in Baltimore, the second time in a five-year span that they failed to reach the Super Bowl despite being the conference’s No. 1 seed in an MVP season for Jackson.The Ravens added tailback Derrick Henry during the offseason, hoping he has enough left to be a major asset as Jackson makes another attempt to reach his first career Super Bowl.Sean Payton, the former Super Bowl-winning coach for the New Orleans Saints, returned to the NFL last season and went 8-9 with the Broncos. Payton benched Wilson in December in favor of Jarrett Stidham, who started the final two games. The NFL Players Association told the Broncos and the NFL’s management council in November that the team’s threat to bench Wilson if he did not agree to adjust his contract was illegal and violated the collective bargaining agreement.The Broncos released Wilson, drafted Nix and traded for Zach Wilson in the offseason. Payton must settle the quarterback situation and attempt to get the Broncos headed in the proper direction.The Chiefs’ second straight Super Bowl title was followed by an offseason of tragedy, off-field misbehavior and turmoil. A shooting at the team’s post-Super Bowl celebration in Kansas City resulted in one person being killed and nearly two dozen others being injured. Wide receiver Rashee Rice was involved in a six-vehicle crash on a Dallas expressway and faces charges for his role in the incident.Kicker Harrison Butker generated controversy with his remarks during a commencement address at Benedictine College in Kansas, leading the NFL to say it disagreed with the views he expressed. The Chiefs released defensive lineman Isaiah Buggs after he was arrested on a domestic violence-burglary charge, weeks after he turned himself in at the same Alabama jail on misdemeanor animal cruelty charges. Voters in Jackson County, Mo., rejected a sales tax measure that would have provided public funding to partially pay for renovations to Arrowhead Stadium.Now the Chiefs will attempt to return the focus to on-field matters as they begin their bid to try to become the first team to win three straight Super Bowls.The NFL banned the hip-drop tackle, citing the high injury rate of the technique, over the objection of the NFLPA. The adjustment period for players begins during training camp, and preseason games will provide the first glimpse of how the officials will enforce the new prohibition."
WaPo_49,Biden and his team reach the right decision,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/22/presidents-advisers-insulated-democracy-election/,2024-07-22 20:00:02.852779,,"In an extraordinary act of patriotism and self-awareness, President Biden announced Sunday he would step away from his own reelection campaign. Although he had seemingly cut himself off from seasoned voices in his party and was portrayed as huddled in his bunker, in the end he did listen to the overwhelming number of senior Democrats, donors and ordinary voters. He put his party and country first. There will be plenty of time to recount his immense accomplishments. However, for now we can ask: How did it come to this?Given Biden’s history, it is not surprising that he become habituated to tuning out experts, pollsters, party members — really anyone who doubted him. Over a lengthy career, Biden has been counted out and underestimated; he had defied pundit expectations. (“You were wrong about 2020. You were wrong about 2022,” he angrily told reporters. “We were going to get wiped out. Remember the red wave?”) The New York Times put it this way: “The comeback-kid mythology that Mr. Biden has built over a half century in politics is colliding with a new reality, where he is not being held up as a fighter who overcomes obstacles but is accused by his critics of putting his own ego ahead of the country.”But it is folly, of course, to run a race without the full and complete support of one’s party, including congressional surrogate and donors. If you cannot convince, for example, members of the Democratic House Caucus of your viability how are you to convince skeptical voters and donors?That chip-on-the-shoulder attitude and reflexive disbelief of criticism (call it confirmation bias on steroids) for a time kept him determined to run the race, despite signs his poll numbers were dropping. While he remained convinced his problem was “one bad night,"" in fact each appearance exposes his hoarse voice, his defensiveness, his lack of verbal acuity and his frail appearance. Far too often, Biden showed short-temperedness, anger, impulsiveness and unjustified stubbornness in calls meant to calm Democratic doubters. Reality has a way of intruding.Naturally, Biden has sought counsel in his tightknit family. And while the story has yet to be revealed it was there that he was able to process the decision. The Post reports: “Family members have flashed through a range of emotions, people close to them say — sadness, anger, determination — and are deeply frustrated by what they see as the betrayal and second-guessing of a man who has spent a half-century as a dedicated leader of the Democratic Party."" And yet the result was a selfless decision that ultimately put country and his own legacy first.It was a remarkable decision for a family that has devoted its life to politics. Postponing defeat so often seems easier than leveling with a loved one; the perspective a family member has of a father, husband and grandfather often departs sharply from how other people view him. And yet a family as practiced in media and politics as this must have seen that each rickety performance confirms critics’ assessment, erodes the president’s legacy and freaks out voters.Beyond the Bidens, some Democrats, even those closely aligned with Biden, have focused their anger on the role of the inner circle of Biden advisers who, they claim, shielded him from news conferences and interviews, refused to see a capable president become an unsteady and fragile candidate, cheered his defiance and enabled him to hang on to the detriment of his  own legacy. CNN singled out Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti in this group: “That tight circle has alarmed many Democrats who are questioning whether Biden is receiving realistic data about the plight of his candidacy.” But in the end, according to Politico reporting, they presented him with devastating polling from swing states and dreadful fundraising numbers.Whether they played a role to convince him to bow out is uncertain. But they too must have realized that they eventually would be judged harshly, if not cruelly, by history. They stood to bear a good deal of the blame for preventing the party from constructing a ticket with a realistic shot at winning, downplaying awful polling and propounding the fiction that the rest of the party would eventually fall in line.Perhaps they could have acted sooner, or even convinced him not to run. But we should not be surprised that when one reduced one’s circle to only true believers, especially when those closest to you want badly to remain in proximity to power and defy second-guessing, good decision-making breaks down. The situation is not limited to politics.“Does every team need a skilled contrarian? Maybe so, based on new research from Stanford Graduate School of Business,” a Stanford Business School report warned in 2015. “‘It’s important for teams to have a devil’s advocate who is constructive and careful in communication, who carefully and artfully facilitates discussion,’ says Lindred Greer, a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford GSB.” The report continued:However, if you have systematically excluded any devil’s advocate — or worse, come to view well-presented doubts as betrayal — you will be left with those who lack the ability or will to tell the leader he is wrong. Future presidents should be careful: When you can trust so few people, there may be something amiss.In sum, Biden had gotten to this unsustainable position largely because of his own history and outlook and the understandable defensiveness of aides and family. However, Biden and his inner circle eventually managed to recognize that the potential consequences of maintaining a faltering campaign — a devastating November loss, permanent damage to democracy, crushing down-ballot loses — could irreparably mar his legacy and endanger America.Biden therefore stands to go down as one of the most accomplished modern presidents, but also one of the most selfless. Instead of a tragic demise, this episode might be seen as his finest hour. He already began the smooth transition by endorsing Vice President Harris. Now, she and the party can come to together to defend democracy. Nothing is more important."
WaPo_50,‘Catalina’ is a singular achievement,https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/07/22/karla-cornejo-villavicencio-catalina-novel-review/,2024-07-22 21:30:02.801601,,"When a debut novel is published, the new title inevitably tempts comparison to the back list of other authors. When the writer is Latin American and formerly undocumented, the suggestion might be the latest undocumented memoir or the work of Latino icons: Gabriel García Márquez or Octavio Paz; Isabel Allende or Juan Rulfo. Always Bolaño. (Oddly, the musician storytellers — Victor Jara, Violeta Parra, Ruben Mendez del Castillo — never seem to make this reference list, even though their stories have inspired millions.)But Karla Cornejo Villavicencio’s debut novel requires no comparative exhortation. It is a singular, owned, undaunted achievement.“Catalina” recounts a year in the life of a self-aware, undocumented Harvard senior who’s been coming of age since she was 5. Wry and perspicuous, the protagonist of the book’s title suffers no illusions as she approaches the end of her collegiate career. She is not reminiscent of Scout Finch. She isn’t Holden Caulfield, nor Esperanza Cordero. The question is not to whom one compares Catalina, but who will follow her.Catalina is a miracle baby, having survived a horrible car crash that killed her parents in Ecuador. At 5, she was sent to live with her undocumented grandparents. She describes her childhood and subsequent path to the Ivy League with wry detachment, reporting a system that sets her up for sainthood instead of success, even at Harvard. “Throughout my childhood I ruminated intensely on why I was brought to America. Nobody explained it to me … Perhaps my Grandparents sent for me. Perhaps they were getting old and realized that if they raised me, I might take care of them …That seems like a cynical calculation but I understood the role cynical calculations play in survival.”She is in seventh grade when she hears about the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, or the Dream Act, and, by 20, knows the score. With no clear path to citizenship, the question is what Catalina will do next.“Four years at Harvard had been presented to me like a trip to Disney World to a terminally ill child and the end was coming,” she thinks. “I could not be legally employed after graduation.” She resolves the problem by only taking unpaid internships. “So long as I was enrolled in school and lived with my grandparents,” Catalina explains, “I could do as many unpaid internships in media as I wanted. They could be like Pokemon cards.”Early on, we meet Catalina’s grandfather. He is her muse, guardian of her walk to school, maker of homeland memories. “Everything I know about Latin America comes from my Grandfather … If a place in the world could be accused of being too much,” she says, “of not taking off one item of clothing or accessories before leaving the house, of in general being the opposite of Coco Chanel, that is the Andes, which simultaneously houses rainforests, desert, mountains, beaches and snow, cartels, and people who love Jesus so much that they put themselves through crucifixion.”“Catalina” is Villavicencio’s second book. Her first, “The Undocumented Americans,” was a National Book Award finalist for nonfiction. Her literary career thus far journals with candor her own experiences (her story has many parallels to Catalina’s) intertwined with deep reporting about other undocumented people and a different kind of crucifixion.I can relate to Villavicencio’s fictionalization of Harvard, to a point. I’m a Harvard graduate, from a working-class Mexican family and American by way of the Sonora borderlands. My class entered Harvard’s gate amorphous and walked out star material: connected, employable, electable. My dad used to tell my brothers and me that we’re Americans of Mexican descent, accent on American.When Catalina walks through Harvard Yard, the accent is on her resilience. My advantage when I was a student there was my American citizenship. Catalina is not worried about her status. In fact, for someone without a future to speak of, she’s resolute about her deserved place in the universe: Yeah, I’m undocumented. Y que?No, Catalina’s worry is about transcendence. Her goal is not to elucidate art. It’s becoming art, to be art, to own the process, as she was taught. “My Grandfather taught me how to pick a lock with two bobby pins; he taught me the extradition laws of major Latin American countries, and France, Germany and Switzerland.” Her grandfather taught her about Marxism and how to make Nescafé taste good. These things, he told her, were “simply what you had to know as a cultured person.” Catalina learned “to rely on my own scruples to make things happen. I would have to become a writer myself.” When she’s recruited by a high-profile Hollywood filmmaker and Harvard alum to star in a documentary about her own life, the joining of idealism and objectification becomes her chimera.Catalina’s journey plows a road of longing — for a place in a world that does not want her back or, at best, is confused by her mere existence. There is no room for yearning in this world, only observation and next steps. The triumph for Villavicencio is her illumination of Catalina’s aspiration. In this, she has composed a great lyrical novel that transcends origin. It is neither American nor Latin American nor Pan American. The spotlight on Catalina’s searching heart is of Villavicencio’s own making. It is her original bel canto, in her superlative voice.Marcela Davison Avilés is a multimedia producer and writer based in the San Francisco Bay Area.By Karla Cornejo VillavicencioOne World. 224 pp. $28"

On Sunday alone, Delta recorded more than 1,300 cancellations and some 1,600 delays, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware.The technical problem was traced to an update issued for systems that run on Microsoft Windows by the security firm CrowdStrike, the company said in a blog post. Its software is widely used around the world by businesses seeking to defend themselves from hackers. The problems Friday affected only computers on the Windows operating system, CrowdStrike said, leaving Apple computers and those using Linux unaffected.In a Sunday blog post, Delta CEO Ed Bastian said the outage had affected an important tool related to crew tracking, and it was unable to effectively process the “unprecedented” number of changes triggered by the system shutdown.Stories to keep you informed

WaPo_52,"Food safety tips for chicken: Don’t wash it, clean your hands and more",https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2024/07/22/wash-chicken-food-safety-cook-salmonella/,2024-07-22 21:15:02.801601,,"When we talk about safely preparing food at home, we often stress the importance of washing and cleaning as we go. With raw poultry, however, experts make an exception: They say never wash your chicken.That’s because chicken can be contaminated with pathogens, including salmonella, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says causes more foodborne illnesses than any other bacteria. The CDC also notes that each year about 1 million Americans get sick from eating contaminated poultry.The risk is at its greatest when raw chicken is prepared for cooking, especially when people choose to wash it, says Meredith Carothers, food safety specialist for the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service. But that’s not the only time you should be careful. Here are some essential food safety recommendations for handling chicken.Rinsing chicken is among the leading causes of cross-contamination, according to the USDA. Splashing water can spread bacteria by sending contaminated droplets onto sponges, sinks, faucets, counters and tools. While the USDA has long recommended home cooks not wash raw poultry, many continue the practice.“We realized that we are losing an entire population when we say do not wash your chicken,” Carothers says. “This is a practice that likely won’t change for lots of people. This is how they learned how to cook from their mothers, their grandparents. It’s seen as necessary by a large group of people.” So Carothers says the USDA now offers recommendations for how to protect yourself if washing your chicken feels essential.If you insist on rinsing your chicken, use as little water as possible to reduce splashing, she says. Immediately clean the sink and the surrounding area with hot, soapy water and then sanitize with a bleach solution or a commercial sanitizer (see below). Wash your hands thoroughly, scrubbing with soap for at least 20 seconds.Sanitizing the sink is essential because so much food prep happens there, including handling produce and washing other dishes and utensils, says Hillary Ayers, a family and consumer sciences agent with the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences Extension Orange County.Keep in mind that rinsing or soaking chicken does not destroy bacteria. Only cooking to the proper temperature (see below) will kill the pathogens that can cause salmonella-related illness, Carothers says.Store poultry in a refrigerator set to 40 degrees or below. Chilling or freezing drastically slows pathogen production.Carothers recommends cooking or freezing chicken within two days of buying it, as grocery store refrigerators are colder and therefore more effective at delaying the proliferation of bacteria.If the chicken is frozen, slowly thaw it in the refrigerator, preferably covered and placed on a plate or tray to catch any potential leaks. A low shelf in the back of the refrigerator is best.Never thaw chicken on the counter. If you’re in a hurry, defrost it by placing it in airtight packaging and completely submerging it in cold water, changing the water every 30 minutes. It also can be thawed in a microwave. If chicken is thawed in the refrigerator, it can be kept refrigerated for another two days or even refrozen. Chicken thawed in the microwave or in cold water should be cooked immediately.Each time you touch raw chicken, immediately wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with hot, soapy water. Even the most fastidious cooks can contaminate their kitchens by touching common items, such as a phone, cookbook, magazine, soap pump, spice or flour containers, knobs and faucets.To cut down on hand-washing and avoid cross contamination, first gather, measure and prep any ingredients you plan to use on the chicken. Once the chicken is cooking, wash down the kitchen and then start working on the sides or salads, Ayers says. This way the raw chicken and other foods are never sharing tools, countertops, cutting boards or sinks.If your dishwasher has a sanitize setting and your tools are dishwasher-safe, you can clean them this way.If that’s not an option, use hot, soapy water to clean tools or surfaces, rinse them thoroughly with clean water and pat them dry with a clean towel or allow them to air dry. Then, to sanitize, make a solution of 1 tablespoon of liquid chlorine bleach with 1 gallon of water, according to the USDA. For plastic or wood cutting boards, pour the solution onto them and let stand for several minutes. For utensils, dunk them in the solution. Then, rinse and dry. You can also use commercial sanitizers, but check the label to be sure they are safe to use with cooking tools and kitchen surfaces.Carothers advises against using vinegar or lemon juice as sanitizers (or for rinsing chicken). Both combat only some of the bacteria that may be present.To wipe counters and tools, Ayers urges using either paper towels that can immediately be tossed or using clean cloth towels and immediately putting them in the washing machine to be washed with hot soap and detergent.For additional peace of mind, boil a kettle of water and pour it over the sink and sponges. It’s not essential, but it is beneficial, Ayers says.Undercooked chicken can also cause food poisoning. Never rely on the color of the meat or juices. Temperature is your ally here. To get an accurate reading, insert an instant-read thermometer into the thickest part of the meat, avoiding the bone, fat or gristle. The USDA recommends cooking chicken to at least 165 degrees to kill harmful bacteria and prevent foodborne illness.While some recipe developers suggest cooking chicken breasts to a lower temperature and holding them there for a certain amount of time to ensure the pathogens are killed, Carothers says 165 degrees is a better bet for safety.Dark meat — legs and thighs — is more forgiving (and cheaper). It can remain tender and juicy even when cooked to higher temperatures, but don’t take it past 195 to 200 degrees.Perishable foods should not be left at room temperature for more than two hours, one hour if the ambient temperature is more than 90 degrees. Bacteria thrive between 40 and 140 degrees, so the more time the food remains at warmer temperatures, the more likely it is to cause foodborne illness. For large whole chickens or turkey, Carothers recommends cutting the bird into pieces or slicing meat before refrigerating it to ensure that all of the meat quickly cools."
WaPo_53,Israel orders evacuation of former Gaza safe area; U.N. aid convoy fired on,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/22/israel-gaza-hamas-humanitarian-evacuation/,2024-07-22 21:06:02.801601,,"JERUSALEM — The United Nations said Monday that Israeli troops fired on an aid convoy traveling along an agreed-upon route inside Gaza, as the military ordered Palestinian civilians to leave an area previously designated as a safe zone.The developments came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu traveled to Washington, where political turmoil was creating further uncertainty about U.S.-Israeli relations at a crucial moment for the Gaza war.Past attacks by Israeli forces on aid workers have strained relations between Netanyahu’s government and the Biden administration, which has provided Israel with a steady stream of weapons throughout the war.After nine months of conflict, relief groups describe Gaza as one of the most dangerous places to operate in the world, even as the need there grows. Famine is looming, according to a U.N.-backed assessment, and Israel’s Health Ministry said Friday that it has detected a strain of the polio virus in Gaza’s sewage as a sanitation crisis mounts.On Monday, Israel’s army ordered the evacuation of an area that it had previously designated as a safe zone for civilians, saying it was planning operation against Hamas militants who have used the area to launch rockets toward Israel.The area in question includes the eastern sector of Khan Younis, part of the humanitarian zone that included Mawasi, where the Israeli military estimates that some 1.8 million Palestinians are sheltering, with families packed in so tightly that their tents stretch right to the shoreline.Images from inside Gaza show thousands of people clutching their possessions as they push through streets crammed with people and debris, seeking to escape areas that Israel said would soon see military action.Iman al-Zeer, 34, a mother of four who was reached by phone in a section of Khan Younis that was included in the evacuation order, said she was unable to leave due to heavy gunfire.The Gaza Health Ministry said 37 people have been killed and 120 wounded so far on Monday. The local civil defense force said members of one of its ambulance crews were wounded as they tried to reach casualties at the Bani Suhaila roundabout in eastern Khan Younis.Stories to keep you informed

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.Zeer said she could hear the sound of intense shelling and airstrikes close by. “We were listening to the sounds of the screams of people as they fled,” she said. “Whenever we try to move, we are shot at. It’s impossible for us to move, because we would have to walk toward Bani Suhaila.”Philippe Lazzarini, head of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) that aids Palestinian refugees, said Monday that Israeli forces fired upon one of the organization’s convoys a day earlier as it waited for the Israeli army to greenlight its onward movement to the battle-scarred north.“The teams were traveling in clearly marked UN armoured cars & wearing UN vests. One vehicle received at least five bullets,” Lazzarini said in a message posted to X. “Those responsible must be held accountable.”The Israeli military did not respond to a request for comment about the incident. Louise Wateridge, a spokeswoman for UNRWA, said that, by chance, she had been sitting in the front passenger seat of the vehicle that was fired upon. The bullets appeared to have come from an area of IDF operations to the east, she said, and left fragments on the back seat.“We were incredibly lucky that there was nobody in the back seat. This is the first mission I’ve ever been on in the Gaza Strip where there was nobody in the back seat. But it shouldn’t come down to luck,” she said.She added that there were no visible military targets in the area and that the volley of bullets cracked through the air after a displaced Palestinian mother passed the vehicle, carrying a baby in her arms while three young children trudged behind her in the baking heat.“They were there really moments before,” Wateridge said. “They would have been in the firing line, and for what?”More than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel’s military operation began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children.Netanyahu’s tense relationship with Biden has deteriorated greatly in recent months as Israel has defied numerous White House entreaties to increase the flow of humanitarian aid in Gaza and do more to protect civilians. The administration put a hold on 2,000-pound bombs to Israel in May, citing their use in populated areas.Israeli military officials say the most intense phase of their war against Hamas is nearing an end. But on the ground in Gaza, Palestinian and foreign medics say they have witnessed a surge in mass-casualty attacks by Israeli forces in recent weeks. The casualties have overwhelmed hospitals that could barely cope with the sheer number of unhealed wounds they were treating from previous attacks, aid groups say.Analysts cast the shift as part of an Israeli strategy to pressure Hamas in ongoing diplomatic negotiations aimed at securing a cease-fire and the release of the more than 100 hostages still held by the group. As U.S.-backed talks in Cairo are reportedly gaining momentum, the Biden administration is pressing a reluctant Netanyahu to accept a deal. He denies that he is obstructing the process.Netanyahu has been accused by critics of prolonging the war for his own political benefit, a charge he denies. He remains adamant that Israel must fight until Hamas has been destroyed, a goal his own generals have said is unachievable.U.S. administration officials denied, before Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race, that Netanyahu had been significantly emboldened by criticism of the president’s physical ability to do his job. But they acknowledged that Biden’s mounting problems have coincided with a hardening of the prime minister’s position. Netanyahu recently came forward with last-minute demands that U.S. negotiators feared would stymie the Cairo talks, according to diplomats familiar with the discussions.The Israeli army said Monday that two more hostages, Alex Dancyg, 76, and Yagev Buchshtav, 35, have been killed in the Gaza Strip. “The circumstances of their deaths in Hamas captivity are being investigated by all relevant professional bodies,” military spokesman Daniel Hagari said. “The IDF and other security agencies will continue to support the families of the hostages as needed.”The Hostages Families Forum, an umbrella group representing loved ones of the more than 250 hostages kidnapped by Hamas and other armed groups on Oct. 7, described the news as “devastating.” Buchshtav, it said, “was a humble and unassuming man who loved life” in the kibbutz from which he was taken. “Hostages who were held captive with him reported that [Dancyg] spent his time in captivity giving history lectures to fellow captives.”“Their death in captivity is a tragic reflection of the consequences of foot-dragging in negotiations. We reiterate our demand to the Israeli government and its leader: Approve the deal immediately.”Lior Soroka in Tel Aviv and Steve Hendrix in Jerusalem contributed to this report."
WaPo_54,Frankie Luvu wants to put a charge into the rebuilding Commanders,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/22/frankie-luvu-washington-commanders-linebacker/,2024-07-22 21:00:02.801601,,"There is little real estate left on Frankie Luvu’s body for more art. The elaborate designs, all intentionally placed, are markers of his past and clues to his future. But one of the smallest tattoos seems to encapsulate Luvu the best.Just below his left ear, in an area barely visible with his helmet on, is a rectangle with a bolt in the center. Luvu’s battery is always charged, with an aggressive playing style and seemingly insatiable energy that make him an ideal fit for the Washington Commanders’ latest attempt at a rebuild.The team handed Luvu one of the largest contracts — a three-year deal worth up to $36 million with incentives — during its offseason spending spree, signaling faith he could help establish its new foundation.“Frankie just jumps off the tape — the way he plays, his play style, his mind-set, his mentality,” General Manager Adam Peters said in March. “… I didn’t know much about Frankie … other than watching him play and saying, ‘I want that guy on my team.’ But you do research, and all his teammates absolutely love him. He’s a great leader.”As Peters and others in Washington quickly learned, Luvu is hardly just an “effort” or locker-room glue guy, euphemisms that at times seem to diminish a player’s ability. The 27-year-old American Samoa native has a varied skill set, with the size (6-foot-3, 236 pounds), length and athleticism to make him a commodity.​​“He always shows up on tape,” said Greg Cosell, a longtime analyst and producer for NFL Films. “He can do everything. … I think he’s one of the most overlooked really good linebackers in the league who can pretty much do whatever you ask him to do.”And in his seventh year in the NFL, Luvu believes he’s just getting started.“Oh yeah, I’m still young,” he said during a Zoom interview this offseason. “I don’t count myself as a vet yet.”When the Commanders signed Luvu and made him a foundational piece of their defense, Dan Quinn lauded his versatility, a trait the coach has valued from his time with the stars of the Seattle Seahawks’ “Legion of Boom” defense to his years with Dallas Cowboys unicorn linebacker Micah Parsons.Finding another Parsons or K.J. Wright wasn’t the goal. But in Luvu, Quinn may have landed a coveted Swiss Army knife that can plug the run, give receivers fits in coverage, create havoc while blitzing and resemble a human wrecking ball — with control. Or, as Quinn calls him, “an impact hitter.”“And our team needs more hitters,” Quinn added.Jesus, Frankie Luvu lolStraight car crash and lets his friends clean it up pic.twitter.com/q7UqH6iobVQuinn has loaded Washington’s roster, especially the back end, with versatile defenders, including safety Jeremy Chinn, defensive back Quan Martin and rookie nickelback Mike Sainristil.Luvu reacts like a skill player, with the force of a defensive end and the want-to of a special-teamer trying to earn a roster spot. Should Washington need it, he might even have the background to jump in as an emergency kicker; he was on American Samoa’s under-17 national soccer team and was the kicker for his high school football team in addition to playing safety and linebacker.“Frankie was a DB by trade,” said Joe Salave’a, the former NFL defensive tackle who recruited and coached him at Washington State. “When you project a Poly kid, it’s rare that you get a kid that’s remained a skill position kid. So, with Frankie, he continued to get bigger and better, so he ended up being a linebacker. The kid is ferocious. He arrives to the ball with bad intention, and it wasn’t hard to spot him on the field.”Salave’a, now at the University of Miami, played eight seasons in the NFL, including his last three with Washington. When he turned to coaching, he helped Mike Leach rebuild Washington State’s program by recruiting a number of athletes who, like himself, were from American Samoa, a collection of seven islands and atolls in the South Pacific that has just a few flights each week to the United States. Luvu became one of the more prominent athletes to come through the Polynesian pipeline, as it became known.He credits Salave’a for much of his success. As a 17-year-old, Luvu left American Samoa with a single suitcase for Pullman, Wash., to play for the Cougars. The nearly 5,500-mile trip was his first to the mainland.“Coach Joe Salave’a played a huge part in that,” Luvu said. “I feel like a lot of kids, man, when you leave the island, you’re trying to get that structure and somebody that could pull you in the line and have you going in the right direction. … So Coach Joe was that kind of parent. … I had offers from other colleges, but I wanted to build something up there in Washington State.”After three seasons with the New York Jets and another three with the Carolina Panthers, Luvu became a free agent again this offseason, and Salave’a again served as one of his guides. He urged Luvu to “capitalize on his opportunity” and knew the linebacker would be a good match with Quinn.Salave’a and Quinn became friends nearly two decades earlier, when Quinn worked alongside Dick Tomey on the San Francisco 49ers’ defensive staff. Tomey coached Salave’a at Arizona and gave him his first coaching job at San José State.“If you are focused, if you’re locked in and if you show up with consistency and continue to work even when you don’t receive immediate results, you’re going to have an opportunity [on Quinn’s team],” Salave’a said. “I think Frankie is a great match for his new head coach.”Luvu doesn’t believe he’s a true NFL veteran despite playing six seasons and working his way up from being a college free agent to earning his keep as a special-teamer to proving his mettle as a defensive starter.He may never consider himself one of the “old heads,” as he calls them, because he’ll always feel there’s more to learn and new people to learn from.Salave’a taught his players to be sponges on the field and off — to listen and be willing to receive instruction, and then act on it. In Carolina, Luvu often picked the brains of linebackers Thomas Davis, Luke Kuechly and Shaq Thompson, absorbing lessons from film or by studying their routines.Among Luvu’s most prominent teachers was Kevin Greene, the late Hall of Famer who parlayed his 160 career sacks into a second career as a linebackers coach for the Green Bay Packers and then the Jets. Greene, Luvu said, preached the finer details of being a professional.“One thing he told me coming in as a rookie was about the law of attraction: What you put in is what you’re going to get out,” Luvu said. “And he was very hard on how you eat, how you sleep, how you train. Everything will be affected, and it will come to light when it’s time. So, that’s like my motto. That’s what I live by.“There’s numerous times in practice where, if I were to do this certain technique, he would be like, ‘All right now, rook, get your grill in there!’” Luvu added. “We’d be watching tape at the end of practice — I watched extra tape with him — and he’s doing his workout in the back with his little cardio and he’d just toss me the remote and I’m going through [Ryan] Kerrigan’s film, who is now one of our assistant coaches.”Kerrigan, Washington’s all-time sacks leader, joined the Commanders’ staff in 2022 as an assistant defensive line coach. He was one of the few assistants retained by Quinn, who paired him with linebackers coach Ken Norton Jr.“I was literally just with [Kerrigan] before I came home and got on the film a little bit,” Luvu said, “and he was helping me out, and I told him, ‘Bro, this is crazy that I was sitting with Kevin Greene watching you and now you’re coaching me.’ It’s just full circle. I got goose bumps.”When Thompson went down with a season-ending injury, Luvu took over inside and assumed the green dot on his helmet, given to the defense’s chief communicator. He had played inside a bit in college, but playing the “Mike” in the NFL made him the quarterback of the defense, responsible for relaying the plays to his teammates and ensuring everyone was on the same page.To get up to speed, Luvu spent even more time watching film with Thompson and Panthers safeties Vonn Bell and Xavier Woods, including on their days off.“That’s when I started putting myself in Shaq’s shoes and I’m like, ‘Oh, these guys, they put a lot on their plate with what they got to go through,’” Luvu recalled. “But I think moving to that spot and really seeing the whole picture helped me to be more versatile. You can just plug me anywhere.”Over the past two seasons, Luvu was the only linebacker with more than 200 tackles (he had 236), at least 10 sacks (he had 12.5) and three forced fumbles. He also had nine passes defended and a 33-yard pick-six.In Washington, he will be used in multiple spots and in multiple ways. But alongside “Mike” linebacker Bobby Wagner, Luvu’s pass rushing talents figure to be used even more.Glimpses of that were on display during the Commanders’ offseason practices, when defensive coordinator Joe Whitt Jr. preached to his players a mind-set of “arriving violently” and creating a unit that will “feed the studs,” finding ways to help its playmakers excel.Luvu, as his new teammates attested during their spring workouts, is one of those studs.“Man, his energy is contagious,” Wagner said. “… He’s a guy you can’t not notice when he’s out there.”"
WaPo_55,The remarkable contrast between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/22/harris-trump-differences-presidential-election/,2024-07-22 23:00:02.774224,,"Almost immediately after President Biden announced his decision to withdraw from the Democratic Party’s nominating contest, some of his snarkier supporters began workshopping a new line of attack against Republican nominee Donald Trump: Can you get over how old this guy is?The parallel to the criticism that drove Biden out of the race in the first place is intentional, of course. But it’s not wrong. Trump now goes from being the (relatively) young major-party contender to the (obviously) old one — even if the person he faces in November ends up not being the (relatively) sprightly Vice President Harris.If the Democratic nominee is Harris, which seems likely, this is one of myriad points of contrast that didn’t exist when the matchup was Biden vs. Trump. The overall dynamics of the contest are likely to remain the same — the election will be a referendum on the former president — but the distinctions between Trump and Harris may be what tilts a close race in one direction or the other.Distinctions such as:It’s worth doubling down on this particular distinction because it is probably the most consequential (and one that would almost certainly apply to any Democratic nominee).A week ago, the Republican convention rolled into Milwaukee, Trump’s campaign giddy  after he emerged nearly unscathed from an attempt on his life and appeared to be coasting to a rematch against a candidate seen broadly as doddering. It was hard for Republicans to criticize Biden’s frequent verbal fumbles in 2020 because Trump’s, particularly as president, were more significant. This year (and particularly after the June 27 debate) Trump’s weird comments and asides got far less attention than Biden faced every time he spoke.That will continue over the next few months as Biden closes out his presidency, but the electoral stakes are negated. Instead, Trump is likely to face someone two decades younger than him (Harris is 59; Trump is 78) without the same habit of missteps and rambles. Now it will be Trump who will be scanned for signs of decline. It’s no longer “the guy who fell climbing stairs” against “the guy who was overly cautious going down a ramp at West Point.” Now it’s just the latter guy.It is likely to be just one guy in total.This year’s presidential contest was already shaping up to be an echo of 2016, two unpopular candidates seeing whose base was most likely to show up in force on Election Day. Should Harris be the Democratic nominee, it mirrors 2016 in the gender split between the parties, too.Some significant portion of the opposition to Hillary Clinton’s candidacy eight years ago was rooted in misogyny. That will almost certainly be a factor in opposition to Harris, as well.But the landscape has shifted. Harris has taken the lead in the administration’s efforts to protect national access to abortion, the Supreme Court’s repeal of which is directly attributable to Trump. For obvious reasons, many voters concerned about access to abortion will find Harris a more sympathetic messenger than the former president.The other shift since 2016 is that there are more points of valid criticism of Trump’s treatment of women. A month before the 2016 election, the “Access Hollywood” tape was released, spurring a flurry of allegations from women who complained they had been forcibly kissed or touched by Trump. Last year, one such incident led to a significant financial judgment: A jury determined that Trump had raped — using the judge’s language — writer E. Jean Carroll.Oh, there was also his criminal conviction on charges of having falsified business records to obscure his technically-only-alleged sexual encounter with an adult-film actress while his youngest son was still an infant. But that plays into another divide between the two candidates.Once Biden’s withdrawal was announced and Democrats consolidated (still incompletely) around Harris, her supporters noted the applicability of her pre-Senate career: Harris is a former district attorney and state attorney general. Trump’s relationship with government prosecutors, of course, is as a target.When Harris was (ultimately unsuccessfully) seeking the Democratic nomination in 2020, she used this contrast as an argument for her candidacy.I prosecuted sex predators. Trump is one.I shut down for-profit scam colleges. He ran one.I held big banks accountable. He's owned by them.I'm not just prepared to take on Trump, I'm prepared to beat him. pic.twitter.com/bg4xZ4uLneAgain, this was before the spate of criminal charges targeting Trump and before the lawsuit from Carroll. It was before Trump tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election and before he took classified documents to Florida after leaving office. The landscape has shifted since this ad was released, in a way that makes the contrast sharper.Trump’s response to his indictments in Manhattan and in Fulton County, Ga., was at times to highlight that the prosecutors who obtained the indictments were Black. More than once, he explicitly accused them of being racist against White people. Which, of course, is a contrast in its own right.One of the underappreciated aspects of American demography is that younger Americans are more likely to be Asian, Black, Hispanic or mixed-race than are older Americans. In other words, talking about the political views of younger Americans and those of non-White Americans is often talking about a lot of the same people.Harris — young only by the standard of the 2024 presidential contest to this point — is a reflection of America’s increased diversity. She is Black and South Asian, one of 10 percent Americans of a mixed racial background. (About 15 percent of U.S. residents younger than 18 are multiracial.) It is not the case that this guarantees Harris significant support from Black, South Asian or other non-White voting groups, certainly, but it does draw a sharper contrast with Trump.It may also play into Trump’s explicit efforts to characterize White Americans as embattled.At its convention, the Republican Party was relentless in targeting Biden and his record in office. Harris was mentioned more than she had been in 2020, but the focus was on making the political case against the incumbent.Suddenly, that’s largely gone. Harris, as Biden’s vice president, can be criticized for the administration’s perceived failures or for her work as vice president (both real and exaggerated). But she also remains at a distance from much of it. The administration’s positions on the Afghanistan withdrawal or the war in Gaza are much easier to tie to Biden than to Harris.We’re in an unusual situation. The candidate likely to be running as a continuation of the incumbent administration is someone who has not herself served as president. The candidate running as the challenger to the incumbent has a record in office. Harris can present herself as a blank slate to voters in a way that Trump cannot, an inversion of recent incumbent-challenger patterns.All of these distinctions ignore the most obvious, of course: that the election will be between a Democrat and a Republican with very different visions of the United States and of the presidency. That was always the case. The transition from Biden to (presumably) Harris means that the choice being made by voters in November now unfolds along several other dimensions, too."
WaPo_56,"For Caeleb Dressel, the only way past the fear is through it",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/22/caeleb-dressel-mental-health-paris-olympics/,2024-07-22 22:45:02.774224,,"This is Caeleb Dressel: a seven-time Olympic gold medalist who holds American records in the 50- and 100-meter freestyles as well as the 100-meter butterfly. In other words, an absolute swimming legend.This is also Caeleb Dressel: “Every time I step onto the blocks, I’m scared.” In other words, he’s an elite athlete who grapples every day with being just that.If the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Olympics were the Mental Health Olympics, then the Paris Games that begin this week are merely the sequel. Simone Biles, the unmatched and iconic gymnast who couldn’t get her brain to allow her body to pull off her normal routine in Tokyo, is back for another try. Noah Lyles, one of the world’s fastest sprinters who broke down after winning bronze in the men’s 200 meters in Tokyo — overcome by all he had, mentally, overcome — returns for more medals. The searing, quadrennial spotlight is back, and athletes are stepping into it with a mix of excitement and trepidation that is better understood now.Enter Dressel. In Tokyo, he swam in five events. He won gold in all five. Yet when the U.S. trials began last month, there was no guarantee he would qualify for the team. During his eight-month break from the sport, he wasn’t sure he would get back in the water again.“It was definitely a thought of whether or not I would return,” Dressel said during a Zoom call this month from the U.S. swim team’s training camp in Croatia. “There were just many, many months where I wasn’t sure what I was going to do. It wasn’t a question I was asking myself, because it wasn’t something I was really thinking about.”Which makes his standing as a three-time Olympian — not to mention a threat for more medals — all the more unlikely. Swimming isn’t like, say, basketball, a sport in which a player could take off months or even years and feel relatively confident that her or his jump shot would return. In swimming, months away from training are months others are putting in the work. There’s no snap-of-the-fingers way to catch up.Though he did not go into specifics about his mental health issues, Dressel acknowledged he is a different person and athlete now than the Tokyo version. At the trials last month in Indianapolis — after he won the 50-meter freestyle, meaning he had qualified in two individual events and put himself in position to swim two relays as well — he spoke eloquently and longingly about the days when he was 10 and it was just him and the water and his buddies, none of the rest of this stress.At 27, he’s working on it all.“I feel like I’ve gotten a better relationship with myself — and the water, for that matter,” Dressel said. “But then again, the water’s never really been a problem. It’s some of the baggage that comes with it. So there’s things I’m still working on, things I still need to work on and things I’ve gotten much, much better at. I’m still working on things. There’s parts that I absolutely love about the sport. I adore the water. It’s one of my favorite relationships that I have. It’s always fun in the water. And then there’s things that I don’t like, things I hate about the sport.“So I’m just working on really digging into the parts of the sport that I love and working around and working through the things that I don’t particularly enjoy about the sport.”Dressel will be examined as a person dealing publicly with mental health struggles because he is an Olympic athlete and this is an Olympic year. But put swimming aside: He said he simply needed to deal with what ate at him, what wore him down, because he is a human being. He is a husband to Meghan and a father to infant son August. The son of a veterinarian, he gains comfort from Rems, his 9-year-old cat, and Jane, his 6-year-old English lab.He has taken to therapy and has made it a priority for himself and his team to talk regularly so they notice “red flags” that might trigger his issues. He has found joy in training. Even on the days he might not swim as fast as he wants — and he is grappling with the idea that he never again will match his personal bests — elements of the sport actively make him happy again.So back to the pool. And getting on the blocks. And being among the most decorated Olympians in these Games. And being … scared. He has learned that beating it back doesn’t help. He has learned that embracing it is more productive, not to mention more honest. He will use, as he said, “the tools in the toolbox” each time he makes that climb, almost certainly beginning Saturday in the 4x100-meter freestyle relay.“Just being okay with that and acknowledging that emotion and knowing that it’s worked for me — but I think just pinpointing that and giving it a name — has been a lot more comforting for me,” he said. “But [also] not getting rid of what I feel like … made me great.“Yeah, every time I step on the blocks, it’s scary — whether or not I’m thinking that I could lose or I can embarrass myself or I could let someone down. It’s just thoughts that come with it, and it’s just something I think that’s innately in my genetics or system.”Which, even before the Paris Olympics begin, is a reminder — and not just about Caeleb Dressel. More than 10,000 athletes are assembled for these Games. Even the best among them have issues of their own. Talking about them isn’t a sign of weakness. It’s a path to strength. “The obstacle,” Dressel said, “doesn’t seem as, as … scary.”"
WaPo_57,Milan-Cortina Olympics organizers confident sliding track will be on time,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/22/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics-sliding-track/,2024-07-22 22:44:02.774224,,"PARIS — The head of the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics said he is optimistic a sliding track will be finished in time for those Games, avoiding the possibility of having to move bobsled, luge and skeleton competitions to a track outside of Italy.In a Monday morning interview, Milan-Cortina CEO Andrea Varnier said he was surprised at how much work had been completed on the $87 million sliding center when he visited earlier this month.“Basically, you have almost the entire shape of the [track] built,” he said.Located just outside of the mountain town of Cortina, the sliding center has been a huge concern for Milan-Cortina organizers, the International Olympic Committee and Italian politicians as delays in finding contractors to rebuild an abandoned track left potential builders with little time to complete the project safely. Concerned about the timeline and useless costs, IOC leaders urged Varnier to move the sliding sports to existing tracks in either Innsbruck, Austria or St. Moritz, Switzerland.But doing so would make Milan-Cortina the first Winter Olympics to hold events to another country, something many Italian politicians protested. So in February, the company that oversees construction for the 2026 Games found a builder who promised to complete a track by next March, in time for the testing necessary for the Olympics.Varnier said that in addition to laying out the basic framework of the concrete run, builders had completed a 50-meter segment to test a new refrigeration system that will not use ammonia. He said the tests were successful.“We are confident,” he said. “Nonetheless we are we are still evaluating alternative plans for tracks that are not in Italy. Of course, that will be a big defeat for the country if they decided to go [and build the track] and then at the next spring, we have to decide to go somewhere else.”Varnier is in Paris to present an update of the Milan-Cortina Games to IOC members this week.“Of course, for us at this point, it will be much better being in Cortina because we are now building the village that includes space for all these athletes,” he said. “In the end, it will be so much better for the athletes themselves [to not be in another country].

On July 13th, we failed,” Cheatle told members of the committee. “As the director of the United States Secret Service, I take full responsibility for any security lapse.”The hearing marks Cheatle’s first time testifying before Congress in nearly three decades with the agency. She has been director since September 2022.A gunman gained access to an unsecured roof less than 150 yards from the stage of Trump’s campaign rally in Pennsylvania, where he opened fire with an AR-style rifle, injuring Trump, killing one man in the crowd and seriously wounding two others.Cheatle said the agency is fully cooperating with the FBI’s criminal investigation into the shooting, as well as additional reviews by Congress, the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General and an independent bipartisan panel announced Sunday.“We must learn what happened, and I will move heaven and earth to ensure an incident like July 13th does not happen again,” she testified."
WaPo_60,What coconut trees and Charli XCX’s ‘Brat’ have to do with Kamala Harris,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/22/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-brat-summer-meme/,2024-07-22 23:28:02.968246,,"“You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?”This is the question that Vice President Harris is asking — in video clips posted all over social media.A seemingly random line from a 2023 Harris speech and the coconut emoji have quickly become synonymous with supporting her as the party’s Democratic nominee after President Biden announced he’s dropping out of the presidential race — and the meme factory went into overdrive.Audio and videos of the coconut tree line, many of them paired with a Charli XCX song from her album “Brat,” are taking off.Even if you are chronically online, the discourse right now can be hard to understand. Here’s what to know about the Harris coconut tree memes as the memes proliferate — and potentially become a rallying cry for the critical youth vote.As one creator on TikTok described the coconut tree and Charli XCX mashup: “If Kamala runs and wins historians will have to study the significance of what this edit did for America.”In May 2023, Harris gave a speech at a White House event about creating educational and economic opportunities for Hispanic Americans, stressing the need to focus on young people while also understanding the wider community around them because “none of us just live in a silo.”She explained how her mother, the late cancer researcher Shyamala Gopalan Harris, would also try to remind her children to be aware of the context that they were born into. “She would say to us: ‘I don’t know what’s wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?’” Harris said.She let out a deep energetic laugh before adding: “You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.”Searches for “Kamala” and “coconut tree” were already spiking amid pressure for Biden to step aside. But after Biden’s announcement, it seemed many Democrats got on board — including Harris herself, whose rapid response team changed its bio to “Providing context.”As the endorsements started rolling in for Harris, so did the coconut emoji, memes and remixes.Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) posted that “we are ready to help” with a photo depicting the hustle to get coconuts from a tree.Madam Vice President, we are ready to help. pic.twitter.com/y8baSx44FLTiara Mack, a Democratic state senator in Rhode Island, posted “Coconut Tree summer” alongside a coconut and palm tree emoji. Emily’s List — the political action committee focused on electing Democratic women — and many other supporters have added the tree and the coconut to their social media handles.Harris’s impromptu dance moves, her unbridled laughter and her repeated use of abstract phrases — such as “What can be, unburdened by what has been” — has already fueled an army of young online supporters (sometimes called the #KHive, short for Kamala Hive).One of these supporters, Ryan Long, a 22-year-old college student, earlier this month spent hours remixing viral clips of Harris to a Charli XCX song. “In the current society, you feel really helpless,” Long previously told The Washington Post. “It’s hard to get politically engaged. All you can do is you can make edits, you can make tweets. It’s a way people can do their best to not support [Donald] Trump with the resources we have.”To be sure, the fruit — yes, a coconut is a fruit — can also be used as an offensive term with racial overtones, though largely this does not seem to be the case in the viral meme. Divisive terms such as “coconut” are sometimes used by those outside and within Black and Asian communities to suggest that like a coconut, an individual is Brown on the outside but perceived as White or Eurocentric on the inside.A British Asian woman was charged for a racially aggravated public order offense in London in November after holding a sign depicting Britain’s then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Home Secretary Suella Braverman as coconuts at a pro-Palestinian rally.In short, the summer’s hot trends — Harris’s rise and Charli XCX’s June album release — are converging.Many of the videos of Harris’s coconut tree speech have been paired with a song from the album, “Apple,” which also has a dance called the #AppleDance that is popular on social media. Many content creators are likening Harris’s style to the ethos of “Brat summer” — which has been used to describe when people are being unapologetically themselves.On Sunday, Charli XCX herself appeared to endorse Harris — declaring that “kamala IS brat.”Harris’s official rapid response team quickly changed its Twitter account to the distinctive typeface and lime green shade (known as “brat green”) that’s on the album. The account also reposted a screenshot of a conversation on X between Trump supporters, discussing how the Harris campaign is spinning her quotes “over Charli xcx songs and Gen Z loves it.”Graphic designer Hayley Gilmore said on X on Sunday: “If Kamala Harris doesn’t come out at the convention to the Brat Coconut Tree remix is it really worth it?”If Kamala Harris doesn’t come out at the convention to the Brat Coconut Tree remix is it really worth it? pic.twitter.com/k1cEzZTSk7Lime green T-shirts — the color of the “Brat” album with the caption “Coconut Tree x Brat Summer” — have been spotted on Fire Island in New York.Coconut Tree x Brat summer #kamalaharris #brat #fireisland #fyp In  an interview posted this month, Charli XCX broke down her own definition of what it means to be a “brat.”“You are just that girl who is a little messy and maybe says dumb things sometimes, who feels herself but then also maybe has a breakdown but parties through it. It is honest, blunt and a little bit volatile. That’s ‘Brat,’” she said.Taylor Lorenz contributed to this report."

Harris has received a rapid flow of endorsements from top Democrats, including from several who had been mentioned as other possible replacements for Biden. Harris called Biden’s record “unmatched in modern history” at the outset of an event Monday honoring championship college athletic teams — Harris’s first public appearance since Biden left the ticket. Later Monday, Harris is traveling to campaign headquarters in Delaware."
WaPo_62,Fox pundits rehash attacks on ‘radical and incompetent’ Kamala Harris,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/07/22/kamala-harris-fox-news-pundit-attacks/,2024-07-23 00:44:02.838869,,"For four years, Fox News’s star commentators have derided Vice President Harris as an extremist California liberal who is politically unpopular and unsuccessful in her policy work as vice president.Those lines of attack flared up again Sunday night, when the network’s conservative prime time hosts and guests took shots at Harris’s personality and record in the hours after President Biden endorsed her as his replacement at the top of the 2024 ticket.“Kamala is even more radical and incompetent than old Joe Biden,” said Jesse Watters, who labeled her a “California socialist” and declared her “even more unpopular than the most unpopular president in American history.”Sean Hannity, who has been an on-air ally and off-air adviser to Donald Trump, described her as having a “horrendous” and purportedly “far-left” track record, insisting that voters “seem to detest Kamala Harris.”Laura Ingraham decried the vice president as a “puppet of the globalists” who replaced “the old puppet of the globalists.”“No one who truly loves this country, no one who truly wants the best for the American people, would ever subject us to someone like Kamala Harris,” Ingraham said. “They know that Harris is incompetent, just as they knew that Biden is incompetent.”Watters also described Harris as being something of a pawn for the Democratic establishment. “Kamala is probably easier to manipulate than Joe Biden,” he said.Several Fox hosts accused Harris of being part of “a coverup,” as Watters put it, complicit in hiding the extent of Biden’s decline. “Right up until the last minute, she’s been lying to the American people,” Ingraham said. On Hannity’s show, former Trump White House official Kellyanne Conway said Harris “led the chorus of liars.” Fox host Mark Levin took an even grander and conspiratorial tone, saying Harris “violated the constitution every day since she’s been vice president of the United States” by not invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the president, and therefore “should never be anywhere near the Oval Office.”Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary who is a regular contributor on Fox, called Harris “a San Francisco liberal who failed” to stop the flow of migrants at the Southern border after Biden tapped her to work on an effort aimed at addressing the root causes that lead people to flee Central America for the United States.Critics on the right have long danced around the topic of Harris’s race by imputing her rise to affirmative action or “DEI,” the acronym for the diversity, equity and inclusion programs that have drawn fire from conservatives.Watters — who last month theorized that Democratic insiders planned to have Harris take over during a second Biden term for what he called “a DEI presidency” — predicted that any Democrat who challenges her for the nomination “is going to trigger an identity politics bloodbath.” His guest, investor Jason Calacanis, warned that “the DEI candidate concept just is not going to work.”There’s a history of Fox-affiliated pundits facing backlash for making inappropriate comments about Harris, particularly about her relationship with former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown in the 1990s. Pundit Tomi Lahren apologized in 2019 for “a wrong choice of words” after tweeting, “Kamala did you fight for ideals or did you sleep your way to the top with Willie Brown?” Two years later, conservative radio host Jesse Kelly used a crass sexual reference on then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson’s show to describe how Harris launched her career in politics.1/4Carlson, for his part, repeatedly mispronounced Harris’s first name on air during the 2020 race, drawing a correction from one of his guests, who said it was disrespectful. “For somebody who’s going to be on the national ticket, pronouncing her name right is actually kind of a bare minimum,” Democratic strategist Richard Goodstein said while Carlson laughed.On Sunday, some Fox commentators preferred to linger in the perceived uncertainty surrounding the race — suggesting that Michelle Obama, who has repeatedly shut down any speculation that she would run, or some other candidate may yet seize the nomination.“I don’t even know if it’s going to be her,” Hannity said of Harris. “I think other leaders in the Democratic Party have different plans.”"
WaPo_63,RFK Jr. floated a job in a Trump White House as he weighed endorsing Trump,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/22/rfk-jr-floated-job-trump-white-house-he-weighed-endorsing-trump/,2024-07-23 00:44:02.838869,,"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. held talks this month with former president Donald Trump about endorsing his campaign and taking a job in a second Trump administration, overseeing a portfolio of health and medical issues, according to four people familiar with the matter.The discussions, which began hours after the attempted assassination of Trump at a rally on July 13, did not result in an agreement amid concerns in Trump’s orbit about the complications about promising a job in exchange for a political endorsement, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.“All I will say to you is I am willing to talk to anybody from either political party who wants to talk about children’s health and how to end the chronic disease epidemic,” Kennedy said Monday in an interview, adding that Trump has been more open to him than the Democratic National Committee. “I have a lot of respect for president Trump for reaching out to me. Nobody from the DNC, high or low, has ever reached out to me in 18 months. Instead they have allocated millions to try to disrupt my campaign.”Kennedy said he planned to continue his campaign. “We are in it to win it,” he said.A person familiar with the conversations said a person who knows both men reached out to Kennedy Saturday night, hours after the assassination attempt on Trump, after Kennedy had done a series of cable news appearances to talk about the attack. Kennedy said he was open to speaking with Trump.Kennedy then received a group text that included a phone number used by Trump, prompting a phone call between the two men later that night after Trump had returned to his Bedminster, N.J., home, the person said.Kennedy and Trump agreed to meet in person in Milwaukee early last week during the Republican National Convention. Trump has been intrigued by Kennedy even as he publicly criticized him, the people familiar with the matter said.Their discussions included possible jobs that Kennedy could be given in a second Trump administration, either at the Cabinet level or posts that do not require Senate confirmation. The discussion also included Kennedy potentially leaving the race and endorsing Trump, the people said.The discussions surprised Trump and his aides. But there were concerns among some Trump advisers that Kennedy — a fervent critic of vaccines — would not be appropriate in such a job and that such an agreement could be problematic, the people said. Two of these people did not rule out the campaign eventually wanting Kennedy in the fold or potentially giving him a job in the administration if Trump wins.The conversations ended without any definitive conclusion, the people said.“President Trump met with RFK and they had a conversation about the issues just as he does regularly with important figures in business and politics because they all recognize he will be the next president of the United States,"" said Danielle Alvarez, a Trump spokeswoman.Trump and Kennedy’s private effort to cut a deal with each other contrasts with Kennedy’s public opposition to a second term for Trump or President Biden, who on Sunday bowed out of the presidential race and endorsed Vice President Harris.In comments from Massachusetts on Sunday, Kennedy denounced the “corporate” leaders that Trump included in his administration in 2017, along with similar people that Trump may consider to hire for a second term.“This is the swamp. These are swamp creatures,” Kennedy said. “And his pick as vice president is a salute to the CIA, to the intelligence community and to the military industrial complex.”Kennedy has previously called Trump’s suggestion that he would use the Justice Department to punish political opponents “reprehensible,” adding in an April CNN interview that “there are many things President Trump has done that are appalling.”“With the lockdown, the mask mandates, the travel restrictions, President Trump presided over the greatest restriction on individual liberties this country has ever known,” Kennedy said in May at a Libertarian Party meeting.Trump has also attacked Kennedy publicly, calling him a “Democrat ‘Plant’” and a “Radical Left Liberal.""Kennedy is polling below 15 percent in most five-way surveys of the presidential contest that includes both Trump and Biden, a cutoff that contributed to his failure to qualify for the CNN presidential debate in June.Public polls have shown Kennedy’s campaign currently takes votes from both Biden and Trump in roughly equal measures. A Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll this month found 9 percent of registered voters saying they supported Kennedy in a five-way race that also included the Green Party’s Jill Stein and independent candidate Cornel West. When forced to choose between Biden and Trump, 31 percent of voters who supported Kennedy chose Trump, while 23 percent chose Biden.Trump has repeatedly asked campaign advisers, guests at his Mar-a-Lago Club and others if Kennedy would help Biden or him in the presidential contest. He also posed the question for months if he should pick Kennedy as his vice president. “Trump-Kennedy,” he would say, has a nice ring to it. But many of his advisers were against the idea and Trump ended up choosing Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) as his running mate last week.One call last week between Kennedy and Trump was recorded by a videographer team following Kennedy, with portions posted online. In one excerpt, Trump says he shares Kennedy’s concerns that children have been harmed by the current mandated schedule of vaccines, which has been found safe and effective by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health authorities“I agree with you, man. Something’s wrong with that whole system,” Trump said to Kennedy, who has the call on speakerphone.“I want to do small doses, small doses,” Trump tells Kennedy. “Remember, I said you want to do small doses. Small doses. When you feed a baby, Bobby, a vaccination that is like 38 different vaccines, and it looks like it’s meant for a horse, not a, you know, 10-pound or 20-pound baby.""Trump has argued as far back as 2014 that children are being harmed by “1 massive dose"" — which is not the way that commonly mandated vaccines are administered — and that vaccines may contribute to autism. The CDC and other health authorities have studied the claim and concluded that “vaccines do not cause autism,” and that the current vaccination schedule is safe. Kennedy has continued to argue that the current science is not conclusive, that more testing is required and that there is a link between vaccines and a rise in chronic diseases like autism.Later during last week’s call, Trump encouraged Kennedy to “do something,” though it is not clear from the excerpt what they are specifically discussing.""I would love you to do something,” Trump said. “And I think it would be so good for you. And so big for you. And we’re going to win. We’re going to win. We’re way ahead of the guy.”Kennedy later apologized for what he said was a staff decision to post the video of the private phone call online. “I am mortified that this was posted,” Kennedy wrote on social media. ""I apologize to the president.”Kennedy met in 2016 with the then-president-elect in Trump Tower in Manhattan to discuss vaccine safety. “He asked me to chair a commission on vaccine safety. . . and scientific integrity,” Kennedy said after the meeting. The role never materialized, and Kennedy later blamed other officials in the Trump administration for shifting course."
WaPo_64,"Trump subverted democracy. His allies are pretending the left did, too.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/22/coup-democrats-republicans-trump-harris/,2024-07-23 00:06:02.838869,,"The important context for discussions of threats to American democracy is not the aftermath of June’s presidential debate but the aftermath of 2020’s presidential election.Then, President Donald Trump worked feverishly to retain power despite being rejected by the electorate overall and by the electorate in five states that he won four years before. American voters and voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were given a choice between Trump and Joe Biden, and they picked Joe Biden.More accurately, they chose slates of electors who supported Joe Biden. As those who’ve taken fifth-grade social studies know, the American president is formally selected not by voters but by members of the electoral college. That gave Trump the opportunity to spend the weeks between the November election and the January counting of electoral votes attempting to shift which electors were counted. It didn’t work, but not for lack of trying.This layer of intermediaries between voters and decisions is common in our system of representative democracy. It comes into play, too, in how the two major political parties select nominees for president. Voters who participate in party caucuses and primaries are voting on candidates, yes — but more immediately on the number of delegates those candidates are awarded for the party’s convention. It’s there that the nominee is formally determined, even if it’s usually a fait accompli. The convention is equivalent, in other words, to the counting of electors on Jan. 6.With that, then, you can already see how Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 Democratic nominating contest is not in any way akin to Trump’s post-2020 efforts, much less any sort of “coup.”The idea that the Democratic Party underwent a “coup” has been a popular one over the past 24 hours. After a senior Trump campaign official floated the descriptor, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) offered it directly in a post on social media.“Joe Biden succumbed to a coup by Nancy Pelosi, Barack Obama, and Hollywood donors, ignoring millions of Democratic primary votes,” he wrote. “Donald Trump took a bullet for democracy.”At the outset, we should make explicit that these are not good-faith arguments. Cotton does not deserve the benefit of the doubt that he is concerned about the votes of Democratic primary voters. The play is, instead, to try to erode one of the most significant arguments against Trump’s candidacy: that he did try to subvert democracy and that, returned to the White House, he would try to do so further. When your candidate is appearing at campaign rallies and praising Chinese autocrat Xi Jinping and his “iron fist” control over his population, it’s useful to have a way to suggest that your opponents are just as bad.But it is inescapably the fact that President Biden withdrew from the race voluntarily. Grudgingly and under pressure, certainly, but voluntarily. Right-wing commentator Erick Erickson, not known for his quiet reserve, equated Biden’s stepping aside with “all those people accidentally falling out of windows in Russia.” I suspect it is not the case that many of those defenestrations were a function of Russian officials ceding to public calls from members of the Politburo for them to take a swan dive.The most important consideration here is that Biden, while the incumbent president, wasn’t even the party’s nominee on Sunday when he withdrew. He was the presumptive nominee, the guy who earned the most delegates after the primary voting. But his poor performance in the June debate led to a reconsideration on the part of Democratic leaders that, it’s worth noting, brought them more in line with the actual Democratic electorate. In April, Pew Research Center found that more than 6 in 10 Democrats wanted a candidate besides Biden on the ballot in November. In late January, half did. Now they’ll have one, those primary votes from earlier this year notwithstanding.Now imagine that, instead of Biden withdrawing and Vice President Harris quickly consolidating support — including from Biden! — a Democrat had shown up at the convention and attempted to seize the nomination there. Imagine that he pressured the party’s Rules Committee to recognize not the delegates Biden had won but, instead, a slate of delegates promoting his own candidacy. This was required, he argues, because of rampant voter fraud, a claim for which he has no credible evidence. The Rules Committee declines to accede to his request, but the candidate — giving a public speech down the street from the facility where the convention is being held — tells thousands of supporters to march to the convention to protest.You presumably see where this analogy is going. But even then the situation wouldn’t be analogous, because it would be an attempt to hijack a nomination, not presidential power itself. It’s a step removed. If this Democratic Trump managed to cow the party into recognizing his nomination as valid, he’d still have to win in November — and it seems safe to assume that a lot of Democrats would stay home rather than give him their support.The analogy also works in the other direction. If Biden had decided — under pressure from his party — that Trump should retain the presidency, he could have, say, asked Harris to step down, appointed Trump as his vice president and then resigned. If powerful elements of Biden’s party demanded that Trump be president, if polling showed that most Democrats were happy to see someone other than Biden be president and if Biden decided to do this? Sure. Weird, but it’s hard to argue.That’s not how Trump approached his 2020 loss. Instead, he tried to cheat Biden voters in those five states out of their choice. He tried to short-circuit the effort to count electors. And then he suggested that the furious crowd near the White House direct their anger at the Capitol.It’s useful for Trump’s allies to pretend that Biden’s decision was comparable. It isn’t."
WaPo_65,"Democrats falling in line behind Harris, ending weeks of rancor about Biden",https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/07/22/kamala-harris-appearance-biden-drop-out/,2024-07-23 00:02:02.838869,,"REHOBOTH BEACH, Del. — The Democratic Party largely coalesced around Vice President Harris as its likely new presidential nominee on Monday, as she kicked off her campaign by promising to prosecute a forceful case against Republican nominee Donald Trump and defend the legacy of President Biden.Hours after she delivered remarks laying out some of the themes of her campaign, Harris secured pledges of support from a majority of Democratic National Convention delegates, a forceful show of unity behind her presidential campaign that signals she is likely to officially become the party’s nominee next month.“Over the next 106 days, we are going to take our case to the American people, and we are going to win,” Harris said during a visit to campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Del., where she was greeted by a group of energized staffers for Biden’s now-abandoned candidacy. Harris accused Trump of wanting to “take our country backwards to a time before many of our fellow Americans had full freedoms and rights.” She added, “we believe in a brighter future that makes room for all Americans.”Biden dialed into the impromptu meeting, using his first public remarks after dropping out of the presidential race Sunday to thank his staff and ask them to support Harris with “every bit of your heart and soul.”“The name has changed at the top of the ticket, but the mission hasn’t changed at all,” said Biden, who joined remotely from Rehoboth Beach, where he has been recovering from a case of covid. “We still need to save this democracy. Trump is still a danger to the community. He’s a danger to the nation.”The high-energy, highly unified setting reflected the broader sentiment across the Democratic Party, in which Harris’s swift ascendancy has upended an already tumultuous and unpredictable presidential race. After being exhausted by weeks of turmoil and infighting over Biden’s prospects, relieved and newly energized Democrats across the country rushed to embrace Harris’s candidacy and unite around the goal of defeating Trump.Less than 36 hours after Biden abruptly exited the race and endorsed Harris as his successor, hundreds of state delegates, the majority of Democratic lawmakers and governors, a group of state party chairs, and several influential interest groups threw their support behind Harris, as other potential candidates said they would not challenge her. Top congressional leaders followed suit, with Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and former House speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) expressing support for Harris on Monday.While a small number of Democrats have advocated an open, competitive process, Harris appeared to have an inside track Monday to quickly securing the nomination ahead of the party’s convention next month.1/4Harris sought to reflect that sense of unity by using her visit to Wilmington, where she paid tribute to Biden and announced that she had tapped his campaign chair, Jen O’Malley Dillon, to run her presidential bid.“I am a firsthand witness from being with him in the Oval Office, to the Situation Room and seeing him on the global stage with world leaders,” Harris told staff members, echoing a message she had delivered at the White House earlier in the day. “President Joe Biden fights for the American people, and we are deeply, deeply grateful for his service to our nation.”But even as Harris was laying out a campaign message focused on defending “freedoms,” the Trump campaign was gearing up to launch a full-scale assault against her by describing her as “Dangerously liberal” and a threat to Americans’ fundamental rights.“This is a new fight for American Independence,” Trump campaign senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles wrote in a memo that attacked Harris over inflation, immigration, electric vehicles and crime.Trump’s running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), went after Harris in his first solo campaign appearances on Monday. At an event in Radford, Va., he criticized Biden as “a quitter” and said that Harris “is a million times worse.”The memo and Vance’s appearances, which laid out some of the GOP’s main lines of attack on Harris, reflected how much Trump and his allies have been forced to regroup and reorient their strategy in the wake of Biden’s exit. After celebrating the extended infighting and discord that plagued Democrats in the aftermath of Biden’s halting performance at the June 27 debate, Trump’s allies watched Monday as Democratic leaders quickly fell in line behind Harris.“I’m excited to fully endorse Vice President Harris for the next president of the United States,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear (D) said Monday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program. “The vice president is smart and strong, which will make her a good president, but she’s also kind and has empathy, which can make her a great president.”Beshear sidestepped questions about whether he was angling to join Harris as a running mate, though he notably used his appearance to attack Vance, a kind of public audition that he and other top Democrats are engaging in as the party begins to shift its focus to who will share the ticket with Harris.Democratic Govs. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Wes Moore of Maryland also endorsed Harris on Monday, joining a growing list of potential rivals for the nomination that instead opted to endorse her candidacy. Govs. Gavin Newsom of California and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, each considered potential candidates, both endorsed Harris on Sunday.Democratic leaders on Monday unveiled a new virtual process for selecting a nominee to replace Biden that would conclude by Aug. 7, ahead of the nominating convention in Chicago next month. The dates for the virtual process will be announced on Wednesday.The private doubts about Harris’s vulnerabilities and less-than-impressive polling numbers largely remained unspoken Monday as Democrats appeared eager to consolidate around a candidate and head off a messy competition for the nomination 106 days before the Nov. 5 election. During her visit to campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Harris was greeted by more than 100 staff members who gave her a standing ovation. The room was covered in newly printed signs that read “Harris for President,” though at least one lingering “Biden-Harris” sign stood as a testament to how rapidly the presidential race had shifted.Campaign aides said more than 28,000 new volunteers had signed up to lend support, more than 100 times the typical number.  Harris, who has been traveling around the country, planned to continue her campaign travel this week.Trump had built an advantage in polls of key swing states and has at times appeared frustrated with Biden’s exit from the race, lamenting Sunday that he had to “start all over again” after long focusing on Biden. In a social media post Monday, Trump who often relies on insults and name-calling, called Harris “Dumb as a Rock.” The Republican National Committee’s research account on X — long accustomed to circulating clips of Biden looking old or confused — began attacking Harris during her speech to NCAA championship teams from the 2023-2024 season.The turn of events resulted in a rare instance of Harris hosting a White House gathering on the South Lawn by herself, a privilege typically reserved for presidents. While the sports-focused gathering was designed to be lighthearted and low-pressure, many were watching to see how Harris performed in a presidential role. During brief remarks, she called herself “a firsthand witness” to how Biden “fights for the American people.”Harris’s nascent campaign has tried to frame the rush of endorsements as a sign of her hard work to unify and energize the party.Harris’s operation raised a record $81 million in the first 24 hours after Biden dropped out and endorsed his vice president, aides said.  A group of tens of thousands of Black women gathered on a virtual call Sunday evening to showcase their support for Harris’s bid to become the first woman of color to be president.Harris spent more than 10 hours on the phone on Sunday, wearing a hoodie and sweatpants, calling dozens of officials across the country to secure their support, according to a person familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the internal process.The rapid political embrace of Harris marked a notable shift from a party that had previously questioned her strengths as both a candidate and as a vice president.Last year, multiple commentators called for Harris to be swapped out as Biden’s running mate, and several leading Democrats struggled on live television to answer what had become a hot-button question: Is Harris the best option for vice-presidential candidate?“He thinks so, and that’s what matters,” Pelosi said on CNN in September, referring to Biden in what was widely interpreted as a noncommittal answer. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) also offered less than enthusiastic support for Harris last year during television interviews. All three have now endorsed Harris’s bid to be the nominee.Still, there were notable holdouts. Former president Barack Obama released a statement Sunday praising Biden without explicitly endorsing Harris, asserting that Democrats would ultimately find “an outstanding nominee.”Sen. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.) initially expressed interest in challenging Harris for the nomination, before taking himself out of the running on Monday. Manchin, who left the Democratic Party in May to become an independent, said he wanted the party to embrace an open process to allow more-moderate candidates to compete. Before Biden left the race on Sunday, Manchin suggested in an interview with The Washington Post that Harris was too liberal.“I think we can rebuild the Democratic brand and right now you’re going to have to pick somebody that physically and mentally basically believes with every fiber of their body that we’ve gone too far to the left,” he said. “Now if they don’t, they’re going to keep dwindling away.”Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who sought the Democratic nomination in 2020, warned the party against rapidly lining up behind any candidate before taking “the pulse of voters.”“The decision is too important to rush, because the election is too important to lose,” he wrote Monday on X.In a new ad released hours after Biden dropped out, the Trump campaign targeted Harris over the surge of migration at the southern border, falsely branding her the nation’s “border czar.” The ad featured a repeated clip of Harris laughing, part of an attempt by Trump to undermine her bid to be commander in chief. At a rally Saturday, Trump referred to Harris as “laughin’ Kamala” and “crazy,” repeating his practice of mispronouncing her name.Harris has already begun leaning into her background as a prosecutor and state attorney general as she began to cast the race against Trump in a new light.“In those roles I took on perpetrators of all kinds,” she said. “Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type.”By dropping out and endorsing Harris, Biden has upended an already unwieldy presidential contest, making the race akin to a sprint rather than a traditional marathon, said Russell Riley, a presidential historian at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center.“Everything is abbreviated — so what we need to look for is the equivalent of sprinter’s skills,” he said. “Durability is much less an issue than quick reactions, ability to focus, a fast start and getting into stride quickly.”Amy B Wang, Abbie Cheeseman, Marianne LeVine, Kelsey Baker, Sabrina Rodriguez, Hannah Knowles, Michael Scherer and Matt Viser contributed to this report."
WaPo_66,"When your hearing isn’t great even at home, there are things you can do",https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/07/22/hearing-loss-tv-background-noise/,2024-07-23 01:59:02.736091,,"Consumer Reports has no financial relationship with any advertisers on this site.Having difficulty hearing the TV or dinner table conversation? A few simple steps may make a big difference — with or without a hearing aid.Here are some tips from Clarice Myers, a faculty audiologist in the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and James Willcox, Consumer Reports’ senior electronics editor, who has written extensively on how to fine-tune televisions, including for people with hearing loss and vision impairments. (Myers is also the audiological consultant for CR’s testing of over-the-counter hearing aids.)Turn down the noiseAre you in a group conversation and can’t hear what everyone is saying? Try reducing ambient noise by muting the TV or radio, or temporarily turning off a loud air conditioner or dishwasher. If you have an older appliance that makes a lot of noise, consider replacing it with a quieter model. You can also take a small conversation to another room and close the door to reduce extraneous noise.Make minor home changesHeavy curtains not only block out street noise but can also dampen reverberation inside a room, which can help you hear more clearly. Carpets and rugs do the same.Improve lightingYou might not think lighting is related to hearing, but during conversations, we get a lot of information from people’s facial expressions and body language. Optimizing your lighting can be useful. Try adding table lamps and other fixtures that better light up faces. Increasing overhead lighting may not be helpful because it can cast faces in shadow.Converse strategicallyWhen you’re speaking to another person, do so face to face to get the full benefit of nonverbal cues. If you still can’t hear what they said, ask them to rephrase. That might be an awkward ask, but slightly different words, intonation, or articulation may make more of a difference than simply raising the volume.Experiment with TV settingsYour TV may have special audio settings that can enhance dialogue. You can also use “night mode,” which lifts softer sounds and lowers loud ones. Or try turning down the bass a bit (it can mask dialogue) or boosting the higher-frequency sounds you may have trouble with. Some TVs can even stream audio directly to hearing aids via Bluetooth.Consider hearing aidsOver-the-counter hearing aids are now available for people with mild-to-moderate hearing loss. (If you’re not sure about the severity of your loss, see an audiologist for a hearing test.) Self-fitting OTC models, which allow you to tailor the aid’s settings to your hearing loss, can cost as little as $499 a pair. For prescription aids, big-box stores such as Costco may offer good value.Consumer Reports is an independent nonprofit organization that works side-by-side with consumers to create a fairer, safer and healthier world.

WaPo_67,Hurricane activity has paused. Here’s when it may come back to life.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/22/atlantic-hurricane-season-pause-update/,2024-07-23 01:54:02.736091,,"Hurricane season roared to life in late June and early July as Beryl became the earliest Category 5 on record. Since then, however, the Atlantic has been bereft of tropical activity, and the National Hurricane Center doesn’t anticipate storm development for at least a week.Considering all of the forecasts for a very active season — Colorado State University upped its forecast to 25 total named storms just two weeks ago — an understandable question would be: Where are the hurricanes?The short answer is that they’re still coming and that the current break in activity isn’t unexpected or unusual. It could well be the calm before the storm.Hurricane season doesn’t peak until Sept. 15 on average, with activity often lasting well into November. Moreover, the weather patterns expected to help fuel an active season are just starting to take shape.A burgeoning La Niña weather pattern will favor more upward-moving air across the Atlantic, enhancing the number of storms that can form. It will also help promote weaker-than-normal upper-level winds that favor increased storm organization. Meanwhile, record-warm water temperatures will provide ample fuel to make storms stronger.Storm activity so far this season is actually running ahead of average, despite the recent hiatus. A season’s first named storm forms on average around June 20; this year, Alberto formed on June 19. By Aug. 3, two storms have typically developed. Three have already formed this year, though Chris was a marginal storm that lasted only about 12 hours.Also of note: A season’s first hurricane doesn’t usually materialize until Aug. 11, and a Category 3 or stronger hurricane until Sept. 1. Yet Beryl became a hurricane on June 29 and an “extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane” on June 30. It’s usually around the second or third week of August when the oceans really begin to crank out storms. That’s when they are most numerous in the Main Development Region, the zone between the west coast of Africa and the eastern Caribbean where most long-track hurricanes form.The hot, dry air associated with an outbreak of dust from the Sahara desert is currently suppressing the growth of tropical systems. By some estimates, the ongoing outbreak of Saharan dust has been the most prominent since June 2022. The dust should become less of an impeding factor as we enter August.It’s probable the outbreak in dust is tied to the sinking motion of several large overturning atmospheric waves traversing the equatorial regions. Meteorologists call these Convectively-Coupled Kelvin Waves. Each one tends to affect the atmosphere for a week or so.Meanwhile, there’s an even larger-scale overturning wave in the atmosphere called the Madden-Julian Oscillation, or MJO. It’s essentially a large area of thunderstorms that drifts eastward across the global tropics. When the rising phase passes over the Atlantic, hurricanes can more easily form.In recent weeks, the MJO’s sinking phase has been centered over the Atlantic. That helps explain the lack of storms. By around the second week of August, more rising air conducive to thunderstorm development is expected to move over the Atlantic.By then, the oceans will have heated up even more, and the emerging La Niña will have established firmer footing. It’s possible that storm activity may increase substantially by the back half of August.During this lull in storm activity, it’s a good time to review your hurricane-readiness plans if you live in a vulnerable zone.Jason Samenow contributed to this report."
WaPo_68,A theater performance that says: Don’t leave your troubles at the door,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater/2024/07/22/haha-woolly-mammoth-review/,2024-07-23 01:44:02.736091,,"If you’ve ever felt skeptical about the credentials of anyone who goes by the title “life coach,” well, me, too.In the case of “Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha” — that’s seven ha’s, don’t settle for a chuckle less — we know the rough bona fides of the person who tells her clients she can sand down life’s rougher edges: She’s a clown. Formally trained, definitely. Board-certified, possibly.This much is certain: Her name is Julia Masli, and the show she’s brought to Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company after it became a buzzy, sold-out hit at last summer’s Edinburgh Festival Fringe consists largely of her briefly interviewing audience members and trying to come up with an on-the-spot solution for whatever is troubling them. “Problehhhhhhhm?” she queries, stretching out the word’s second vowel sound in a high-pitched voice that makes everything she says sound like a sigh.“My kids make me crazy,” groused one patron at the press night performance, elaborating that “they’re very dirty and demanding.”“I’m in love with a co-worker,” confessed another.A guy up in the balcony said he feels burdened by a general sense of dread. (Solidarity, brother.)Hardly quick-fix vexations. But therein lies the show’s absurdist value proposition. “I fix it,” Masli promised the woe-beset man. “I fix the world!”Masli spent the first dozen years of her life in Estonia before her parents shipped her off to boarding school in England. Later, she went to France to study clowning under Philippe Gaulier, a (then-)septuagenarian master whose famous pupils include Sacha Baron Cohen.That Masli trained with the instructor who begot Borat is one reason to believe that the slightly scrambled syntax of her spoken English is a comedic affectation — not that there’s much chitchat in her performance, served in a Fringe-sized portion of 70 minutes, give or take. In fact, it takes several moments after Masli enters the house, which is as suffused with blue smoke as a scene in an ’80s Tony Scott movie, for her to utter a decipherable word. Before that, she moans and coos as she prowls the stage, like an infant deciphering the mysteries of speech.Piercing the artificial haze is the beam of a flashlight mounted several inches above Masli’s head, part of a bizarre helmet that’s covered in wires and has what looks like a part of a brass instrument stuck to the back of it. It reminded me of the costumes from Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s surreal sci-fi movie “The City of Lost Children.” The mannequin leg she wears on her left arm reminded me of nothing; it’s just sui generis weird. Masli earned her first round of applause by managing to pick up a microphone using the artificial appendage’s inanimate foot.Soon enough, she’s sticking that foot, and that mic, in the faces of those who, presumably, look most in need of her assistance. Her invitation — “Problehhhhhm?” — occasionally summoned volunteers who seemed a little too eager to pitch in. The guy who said he was in love with a co-worker, for instance, was brought onstage with another person who was assigned to play the object of his crush; he was then instructed to practice unburdening himself of his feelings. “I’m feeling groovy,” he said to the stranger Masli had seated across from him. “Do you, likewise, feel groovy?” Later, he interrupted the show to offer some unsolicited, if heartfelt, advice to a pair of Masli’s other patients, suggesting they begin each day with a healthy breakfast and some exercise. Pfft. You could get that kind of crackpot advice from a medical professional.In the noble tradition of Mr. Miyagi teaching his unwitting young charge the basics of martial arts via the wax-on, wax-off method, Masli’s remedies often take the form of craft projects: One “volunteer” was tasked with making a garland of flowers for another. The dread-experiencing man was given a hammer and a workbench and encouraged, for some reason, to repair a broken chair. (There was a similar chair suspended high above the stage, suggesting some metaphorical significance on the part of the furniture.) It took him several minutes to get comfortable banging away while Masli continued the show, but the loud, distracting hammering was funny, and the way Masli pretended not to hear it was, too.That’s not to say she put everyone to work. When a mother complained of exhaustion, Masli simply guided the woman to a bed she wheeled out of the wings, gently removed the woman’s shoes, covered her eyes with a handkerchief and invited her to rest. Another guy was encouraged to cleanse the world of wickedness — by taking a shower onstage, which he did. I hope the water was warm.As with the credentials of a life coach, it’s fair to apply some incredulity to the fact that Masli has such varied tools/props at the ready. But you know what they say: When all you’ve got is a hammer (and a workbench, and a bed, and a bunch of flowers, and a fully functioning shower), every problem looks like a nail (or a busted chair, or sleep deprivation, or barren soil, or a lack of hygiene).I’m agnostic on the likelihood of Masli untangling the Gordian knot that is your life, but bullish that you’ll have a grand, and very silly, old time watching her try.Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha, through Aug. 4 at Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company in Washington. Approximately 70 minutes without intermission. woollymammoth.net."
WaPo_69,Russia sentences Russian American journalist to 6.5 years,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/22/alsu-kurmasheva-journalist-convicted-russia/,2024-07-23 01:23:02.736091,,"A court in Russia convicted Russian American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva of reporting false information about the country’s military and sentenced her to 6½ years in prison on Friday — the same day Wall Street Journal correspondent Evan Gershkovich was sentenced to 16 years on espionage charges, marking a new level of persecution of foreign press by the Kremlin.Kurmasheva, 47, an editor with U.S. government-financed Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, was convicted in a closed trial on Friday in Kazan, nearly 500 miles east of Moscow, the same day as Gershkovich’s conviction in Yekaterinburg, a city in the Urals. News of Kurmasheva’s conviction, however, emerged only Monday.Kurmasheva was convicted under Russia’s wartime fake-news law, which bans the broadcasting or posting of any information about the war in Ukraine other than official propaganda. The law, adopted after Russia’s February 2022 invasion, effectively bars reporting on Russian atrocities in Ukraine, military setbacks, heavy military casualties, or criticism of the war.Gershkovich, a U.S. citizen who was accredited as a journalist by Russia’s Foreign Ministry, was convicted Friday of spying in a closed trial described by American officials and his employers as a sham. He, the Wall Street Journal and the State Department strenuously denied the charges.Russian officials have said that talks are underway with Washington about a potential prisoner exchange involving Gershkovich, but Moscow has stated repeatedly that a trade would be possible only after the conclusion of the trial. The unusually swift verdict in his case suggested potential developments in a trade. It was unclear whether Kurmasheva, too, has been the subject of such discussions.Stories to keep you informed

Two dead in listeria outbreak linked to deli meat. Here’s what to know.Kurmasheva, who holds American and Russian passports, is a Prague-based editor with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. She was detained in June 2023 after a trip home to Russia to visit her ailing mother. Both of her passports were confiscated.Kurmasheva and her employer have denied any wrongdoing. After her detention in Kazan, she was charged with failing to register as a foreign agent, a charge often leveled at independent journalists, activists, writers, politicians and others as part of President Vladimir Putin’s sweeping crackdown on dissent, which accelerated after his invasion of Ukraine.In October, Russian prosecutors added charges of disseminating fake news about the Ukraine war. Because Kurmasheva’s trial was closed, no information was available about the actions for which she was prosecuted or the nature of the evidence, if any, against her.Unlike Gershkovich, Kurmasheva has not been declared by the State Department to be wrongfully detained, for reasons that remain unclear. As with Gershkovich, the State Department has declared former marine and corporate security executive Paul Whelan to be wrongfully detained after he was convicted in 2020 of spying and sentenced to 16 years.Putin hinted in February that he would be willing to swap Gershkovich for Vadim Krasikov, a Russian convicted of murder in Germany for assassinating former Chechen rebel commander Zelimkhan Khangoshvili in Berlin’s main park.After Gershkovich’s conviction, President Biden released a statement that he was doing all he could to secure the safe release of Gershkovich, Whelan and “all Americans wrongfully detained and held hostage abroad.”The State Department prioritizes Americans it has declared to have been wrongfully detained, which could reduce Kurmasheva’s chances of being included in exchange talks.Until her arrest, Kurmasheva lived in Prague with her husband and two daughters.In February, Russia designated RFE/RL an “undesirable organization,” which means that any Russian who cooperates with the media outlet could be jailed for up to five years.Stephen Capus, president of RFE/RL, said in a statement on Monday that Kurmasheva’s conviction was “a mockery of justice” and called for her immediate release, according to the Associated Press."
WaPo_70,Elori Saxl’s music sounds so new. Why does it feel so familiar?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/2024/07/22/elori-saxl-electronic-composer-drifts-surfaces/,2024-07-23 01:04:02.736091,,"Flash back to the last time you got caught staring into your smartphone under a misty rain. Try to remember the glowing micro-prisms that began collecting on the surface of your screen, how they formed a thickening patina of bioluminescent jewel dust. Now transfer that image from your mind’s eye to your auditory cortex and you might get a feel for the music of Elori Saxl, an experimental electronic composer who pulverizes recordings of classical instruments into digital particulates, then rearranges everything to evoke ocean spray, frost, pollen and smoke.She’s not making perfume. On her newest recording, “Drifts and Surfaces,” Saxl pushes out of the ambient toward the extreme, making tiny fragments of live percussion clot and tremble until they generate an awesome blur — a sound that Saxl says was inspired by her life on Wisconsin’s Madeline Island in Lake Superior. “I was trying to capture the sense of disappearing horizon, lostness, awe and dark power that feels really innate to Lake Superior,” she explains in the notes posted on her Bandcamp page. “It is also constantly changing — drifts change directions, water becomes ice, ice breaks apart and becomes waves. There is constant movement from drifts to surfaces, surfaces to drifts.”“The Blue of Distance,” Saxl’s outstanding 2021 album, conveyed similar ideas, using synthesizers and woodwinds to pantomime weather and water, all while playing little tricks on your eardrums, making them wonder whether they were experiencing the intimacy of human breath or an airless digital facsimile. There’s a similar game afoot in the swells of “Drifts and Surfaces,” with Saxl claiming that these tremulous, high-def pulses could resemble droplets in a lake as easily as they could represent data in a cloud.Is this music about the collision of nature and technology? For sure. But perhaps in the same way that turning pieces of wood into a violin counts as a collision of nature and technology. Those two entangled worlds aren’t always so oppositional. But be careful. Go too far in that direction and we start flirting with utopian technocratic woo-woo. Saxl’s music doesn’t seem to be arguing in either direction. Instead, it simply seems to be capturing what is — a cascade of raindrops and data points gathering in the shape of the truth."

Two dead in listeria outbreak linked to deli meat. Here’s what to know.The administration also recommends that companies set more protective privacy settings for young users by default and limit features that encourage social comparisons, such as social media “likes.”The scope of the report extends beyond social media, with the administration also urging action to curb “addictive” design features across mobile video games.Alvaro Bedoya, a Democrat on the Federal Trade Commission who sat on the task force, said the report largely sidesteps debates about speech online and instead focuses on how “social media is designed to encourage young people to stay online longer than they want to be.”While the recommendations are voluntary in nature, Bedoya said the report “carries a particular weight” because it represents various federal actors “speaking with one voice.”The task force, led by the Commerce and Health and Human Services departments, included representatives from the FTC, the Justice Department and the White House, among others.Many of the recommendations mirror protections that lawmakers at the federal and state level have sought to establish through legislation. Courts have halted many of those state level efforts after legal challenges from tech industry groups.Congressional efforts to expand safety and privacy protections online, meanwhile, have languished on Capitol Hill despite drawing broad bipartisan support.“These guidelines ensure that no matter what happens in the courts, there's a clear blueprint for how to prevent some of the worst harms that are coming from social media,” Bedoya said.In addition to the recommendations for tech companies, the report offers advice for how parents and caregivers can best protect kids while using digital platforms and outlines what additional research is needed to understand the link between harms to children and their online activity. The report also urges Congress to pass legislation to tackle the issue, as Biden has previously called for.Miriam Delphin-Rittmon, the HHS assistant secretary for mental health and substance use, said the report would help families develop plans around their children’s social media use and set up “screen-free activities.”“We did focus groups all over the country and families and caregivers talked about just the interest and the need for more support and resources to be able to help navigate and work with their young folks around social media,” she said."
WaPo_72,Are Democrats really going to do this?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/22/democrats-rush-nominate-kamala-harris/,2024-07-23 01:00:02.736091,,"The proposition that Kamala D. Harris is the Democratic candidate best suited to defeat Donald Trump is about as believable as the proposition that Joe Biden was mentally and physically equipped to serve as president until 2029.That is to say: Both are obvious fictions. Democrats coalesced around the fiction of Biden’s acuity during the primary season. Now that Biden has dropped out, they are adopting the fiction that “no one is better” (as California Gov. Gavin Newsom put it on Sunday) to take on Trump in Biden’s stead. Any prospect of a competitive nomination process is evaporating as Democratic politicians — even those previously mooted as possible Biden replacements should he step aside — stampede to Harris.Does anyone really believe Harris is the Democratic candidate most likely to block another Trump term? Unable to conceal Biden’s infirmity any longer, panicked Democratic leaders forced the president out of the 2024 race. They have a chance to put forward a strong candidate in a high-stakes election that is likely to be close. If they swiftly coronate Harris, Democrats would be elevating one of the weakest candidates available.Harris has never shown special political talent. In 2010, she came within one point of losing to Republican Steve Cooley in California’s attorney general race, even as Democrat Jerry Brown defeated Republican Meg Whitman by 13 points for the governorship and Newsom defeated the incumbent GOP lieutenant governor by 11.As for her run in national politics, Harris’s support quickly cratered in the 2020 Democratic primaries, where she ran to Biden’s left and dropped out early. Her tenure as vice president, substantially defined by a failed foray into immigration policy, was widely considered mediocre even by friendly media — at least until Sunday.Harris’s service in the Biden administration and avid vouching for the president’s abilities tie her irrevocably to the age deception that just upended the race. Of course, Biden’s mulish insistence on running for a second term almost certainly reflected, in part, the president’s honest assessment of his No. 2.Republican attack-ad makers will feast on Harris’s sundry policy pronouncements, especially from her 2020 campaign. “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking” will play on loop in western Pennsylvania. Images of Harris raising her hand on the debate stage when asked if she supported eliminating private health insurance (she later said, amid criticism, that she misunderstood the question) and decriminalizing border crossing are also potent GOP fodder.On policy, Harris’s offer to voters is essentially: How about the Biden administration, but more left-wing? This, as the public recoils from the effects of Biden policies on immigration and inflation — and as Trump is making a point of moving the Republican Party to the center on abortion and gay rights.The fact that Harris is a weak candidate doesn’t mean she can’t win, of course. In a closely divided party system, either candidate has a shot, and Trump is widely disliked, as is Harris. She has some assets: Abortion, the issue she has championed most successfully, is a Republican weakness. She might prove able to provoke outrageous statements around race and gender from idiotic GOP politicians or influencers.But having just gone through the excruciating process of decapitating their presidential ticket and throwing the race wide open (at least in theory), shouldn’t Democrats want to install not just a candidate who can win but a candidate who is likely to win? The list of more-talented politicians in the party — the familiar-by-now names include swing-state election winners Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona — is long (all three have already endorsed her, which more-or-less rules out a challenge).The argument for embracing Harris by acclamation anyway is apparently that the Democrats can’t afford internal discord when the focus should be on defeating Trump. That argument served Democrats badly when they allowed Biden to glide through the primaries without a debate.Democrats unceremoniously cashiered their erstwhile standard-bearer out of cold political calculation. Now they’re labeling him a world-historical statesman. Well and good, if that’s what needs to be done. But in their rush to back Harris, Democrats are seemingly abandoning that cold political calculation out of a mix of sudden relief and guilt.Remember that the Democrats’ 2016 coronation of Hillary Clinton (complicated only by a nettlesome Bernie Sanders) ended in tears. The competitive 2020 primary yielded a winning candidate in Biden. The 2024 primary, lacking serious competition, was so disastrous its result was just overturned by the party.Now the collective decision is apparently being made to once again nip internal Democratic competition in the bud — to keep marching in lockstep, to eliminate even temporary uncertainty within the party and keep politics stage-managed and controlled at every phase. Perhaps there is an organic brilliance at work here that I, as a non-Democrat, can’t recognize. Because it looks to an outsider like another manifestation of the same irrational political neuroticism that created this mess in the first place."

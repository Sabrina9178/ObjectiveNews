NBC_1,"U.S. economy grew at a 2.8% pace in the second quarter, much faster than expected",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/us-economy-gdp-q2-2024-faster-than-expected-rcna163606,2024-07-25 21:07:02.702650,,"Economic activity in the U.S. was considerably stronger than expected during the second quarter, according to an initial estimate Thursday from the Commerce Department.
Real gross domestic product, a measure of all the goods and services produced during the April-through-June period, increased at a 2.8% annualized pace adjusted for seasonality and inflation. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for growth of 2.1% following a 1.4% increase in the first quarter.
Consumer spending helped propel the growth number higher, as did contributions from private inventory investment and nonresidential fixed investment.
Personal consumption expenditures, the main proxy in the Bureau of Economic Analysis report for consumer activity, increased 2.3% for the quarter, up from the 1.5% acceleration in Q1. Both services and goods spending saw solid increases for the quarter.
On the downside, imports, which subtract from GDP, jumped 6.9%, the biggest quarterly rise since Q1 of 2022.
Stock market futures drifted higher following the report while Treasury yields moved lower.
There was some good news on the inflation front: the personal consumption expenditures price index, a key measure for the Federal Reserve, increased 2.6% for the quarter, down from the 3.4% move in Q1. Excluding food and energy, core PCE prices, which the Fed focuses on even more as a longer-term inflation indicator, was up 2.9%, down from 3.7% in the prior period.
The so-called chain-weighted price index, which takes into account changes in consumer behavior, increased 2.3% for the quarter, below the 2.6% estimate.
One other key variable, final sales to private domestic purchasers, which the Fed considers a good indicator of underlying demand, accelerated at a 2.6% pace, the same as in the prior quarter.
However, the report also indicated that the personal savings rate continues to decelerate, at 3.5% for the quarter, compared to 3.8% in Q1.
There have been signs of cracks lately in the consumer picture.
A report Wednesday from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed credit card balances at an all-time high for data going back to 2012. Revolving debt balances also reached a new high even as banks reported tightening credit standards and declining new card originations.
However, retail sales numbers have continued to climb indicating that consumers are weathering the headwinds of high interest rates and persistent inflation.
There also is pressure in the housing market: Sales are declining while home prices continue to climb, putting pressure on first-time homebuyers.
Federal Reserve officials are expected to hold interest rates steady when they meet next week, though market pricing is pointing to the first cut in four years in September. Policymakers have been circumspect about when they might start reducing rates, though recent comments indicate more of a willingness to start easing policy and most central bankers have said they see further increases as unlikely.Jeff Cox is a finance editor with CNBC.com where he covers all aspects of the markets and monitors coverage of the financial markets and Wall Street.

NBC_2,More than 100 flights canceled in Germany as environmental activists target airports,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/flights-cancelled-germany-activists-target-airportsclimate-rcna163589,2024-07-25 21:00:02.702650,,"FRANKFURT, Germany — Germany’s busiest airport canceled more than 100 flights Thursday as environmental activists launched a coordinated effort to disrupt air travel across Europe at the height of the summer holiday season to highlight the threat posed by climate change.
Frankfurt Airport said flights were halted for safety reasons after climate activists breached security fences, triggering a response from police, firefighters and airport security officers. All runways were back in operation by 7:50 a.m. local time, it said. About 140 flights have been cancelled so far, but further disruptions are expected throughout the day, the airport said.
Environmental groups said they planned to target airports around Europe this summer to remind people about the link between fossil fuels, such as those used by airliners, and climate change. The groups are calling for governments around the world to end the extraction and burning of fossil fuels by 2030.
“We sharply condemn these unauthorized demonstrations, and we reserve the right to take legal action against the participants,” Frankfurt Airport said. “Their activities pose severe danger to flight operations — possibly putting human life at risk.”
Climate data showed that Monday was the hottest day ever recorded as human-caused climate change continues to drive unprecedented heat and growing weather extremes. Global investments in planet-warming oil and gas are expected to increase by 7% this year, according to the International Energy Agency, despite global promises to slash fossil fuel use.
Flying is considered one of the most carbon-intensive activities, but the aviation industry is expected to grow steadily over the coming decades despite efforts to contain the climate crisis.
The Last Generation group, which organized the Frankfurt demonstration, said six protesters cut holes in the perimeter fence and headed toward the runways on foot, bicycles and skateboards.
It was the second time in as many days that a protest by Last Generation caused disruption at a German airport.
On Wednesday, five protesters glued themselves to a taxiway at Cologne-Bonn Airport, forcing a roughly three-hour halt to flights. That protest resulted in 31 flights being canceled. There were other protests or attempted protests in other European countries.
Climate activists staged similar actions in Finland, Norway, Switzerland and Spain on Wednesday.
At Helsinki Airport, a handful of protesters blocked the main check-in area for about 30 minutes, but police said the demonstration caused no delays to flights or other disruption.
At Oslo’s main Gardermoen airport, three activists managed to enter the runway area early Wednesday, waving banners and disrupting air traffic for about half an hour. Police said there were no major flight delays.
Police in London said Wednesday that they prevented a planned protest at Heathrow Airport that could have had a significant impact on Europe’s largest airport. Seven members of the group known as Just Stop Oil were arrested at Heathrow and three others were taken into custody at other locations as part of an “intelligence-led” operation, the Metropolitan Police Service said in a statement.
One of those arrested in London was Sean Callaghan, 29, who described himself as an environmental educator.
“I’m taking action at airports this summer because it is impossible for me to see a way in which we can inspire and enthuse students about the future of our planet,″ Callaghan said in a video posted on social media.
Last week, the German Cabinet approved legislation that would impose tougher penalties on people who break through airport perimeters.
The bill, which still requires approval by lawmakers, foresees punishment ranging up to a two-year prison sentence for people who intentionally intrude on airside areas of airports such as taxiways or runways, endanger civil aviation, or enable someone else to. Currently such intrusions only draw a fine.The Associated Press"
NBC_3,Biden appeals to Americans and what happens inside the Olympic village: Morning Rundown,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/biden-says-time-younger-voices-olympic-villages-morning-rundow-rcna163579,2024-07-25 19:00:02.702650,,"Biden appeals to Americans to “preserve our democracy” after he drops out of the 2024 race. FBI Director Christopher Wray reveals new details about the Trump assassination attempt. And NBC News hears what really goes on inside Olympic villages. 
Here’s what to know today.
President Joe Biden addressed his decision to end his re-election campaign from the Oval Office, framing it as a “defense of democracy” and passing “the torch to a new generation.” 
“I revere this office, but I love my country more. The defense of democracy is more important than any title,” Biden said. “I draw strength and find joy in working for the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our union is not about me. It’s about you. Your families. Your futures. It’s about ‘We the People.’” America’s going to have to choose between moving forward or backward,” Biden said. He added, “Our republic is now in your hands.”
“I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,” Biden said in a low tone. “That is the best way to unite our nation.”
He offered praise for his vice president, Kamala Harris, who has rapidly consolidated support within their party after he endorsed her for the Democratic presidential nomination. “She’s experienced, she’s tough, she’s capable,” Biden said. “She’s been an incredible partner to me and leader for our country.”
In his remarks, which lasted about 11 minutes, Biden touted his presidency’s achievements, while looking forward to goals he hopes to accomplish in the last six months of his term. 
The speech marked the beginning of Biden’s effort to close this chapter — ending his presidency, finishing 50 years in public service— and preserving his legacy.

Watch Biden’s full Oval Office address here. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a defiant, nearly hourlong speech to Congress in his first address to U.S. lawmakers in nearly a decade.
Netanyahu directly addressed the protests against his handling of the war in Gaza, on college campuses across America’s cities — including the hundreds who marched outside the Capitol during his speech. “Incredibly, many anti-Israel protesters, many choose to stand with evil. They stand with Hamas. They stand with rapists and murderers,” he said. Objection to the war in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians, led to roughly 40 Democrats in the House and Senate boycotting the address, outraged at his policies and the U.S.’ military support for it. Democratic Rep. Rashia Tlaib, the first Palestinian American woman to serve in Congress, held up a small sign at Netanyahu that read “war criminal” and “guilty of genocide.” 
He later accused the protesters at the Capitol of being funded by Iran, referencing a recent statement from the U.S. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines that Iran is “seeking to encourage protests and providing financial support to protesters.” Netanyahu said he had a message for the protesters: “You have officially become Iran’s useful idiots.” 
Netanyahu’s speech came at a critical period: The U.S. is in the middle of a chaotic election year, and the Biden administration continues to push negotiators toward a cease-fire agreement that could end the war in Gaza. Netanyahu asked for more support and noted the conflict could end immediately if Hamas released hostages, but vowed to continue fighting.
The 20-year-old gunman, Thomas Crooks, who tried to assassinate Trump researched President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, FBI Director Christopher Wray revealed in a testimony. Crooks searched “how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,” referring to the 1963 assassination.
He also had a firearm with a collapsible stock, making it easier for him to conceal the weapon, Wray testified. It would explain why witnesses didn’t see him walking around with a weapon beforehand and why the firearm wasn’t spotted until Crooks was already on the roof. 
The FBI still does not know Crooks’ motive. Wray said it has been frustrating that the investigation has not “yielded significant clues.”
Wray’s testimony has offered the clearest timeline of Crooks’ activities on the day of the shooting and in the week leading up to it, highlighting his level of preparation. 
The stock market, including the nation’s top tech companies, saw their worst performance in years this week. The drop comes as Wall Street traders decide to pull back their investments in firms heavily betting on artificial intelligence. Tesla shares fell 12.3% and Google’s parent company, Alphabet, fell more than 5%, its biggest drop since January. With these losses, interest-rate cuts from the Federal Reserve could come as soon as September, some traders say. 
“Although it might already be too late to fend off a recession by cutting rates, dawdling now unnecessarily increases the risk,” former Federal Reserve Bank of New York President Bill Dudley wrote in a Bloomberg News column.
While the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq still experienced healthy gains, rising unemployment rates and increased consumer borrowing indicate a broader economic pullback in the the months to come.
An area of Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming where a hydrothermal explosion launched steam and debris into the air will be closed for the rest of the season because more blasts may occur, officials said. No one was hurt in the blast in Biscuit Basin, 2 miles northwest of Old Faithful. 
The geyser was hundreds of feet high, and rocks the size of grapefruit were found hundreds of feet away, officials said. A boardwalk was also destroyed. The hydrothermal explosion was caused by “water suddenly transitioning to steam in the shallow hydrothermal system beneath Black Diamond Pool,” the U.S. Geological Survey said.
There’s a crucial part of the Olympic experience that remains largely unknown to spectators and off-limits to fans: the athletes’ village. 
In recent weeks, NBC News spoke with Olympians about life inside the residential complexes where thousands of athletes sleep, eat, train and socialize. This year, the villages in Paris are across three towns, in Saint-Denis, Saint Ouen and L’Île-Saint-Denis. It’s expected they will house 14,250 athletes during the Olympic Games and some 8,000 athletes during the Paralympic Games.
They likened the villages to summer camps, college dorms, crowded hotels and — in the words of gold medalist swimmer Mark Spitz — a “gigantic cruise ship.”
Border wall fraud: Steve Bannon is expected to stand trial starting Dec. 9 over charges that he defrauded donors with an online fundraiser to build additional miles of wall along the southern border.

Harris will visit Atlanta, Georgia next week, a source familiar with her travel plans told NBC News.
The Harris campaign views the battleground state as in better play with her at the top of the ticket as they hope to mobilize Southern Black voters.
Days before Biden announced his withdrawal from the race, one Democratic strategist last week said Harris’ “path is different” compared to Biden’s election strategy, NBC News reported.
The strategist said some believe Harris’ path could be more focused on mobilizing Black voters in Southern states such as Georgia and North Carolina compared to Biden’s strategy, which largely worked to lock down support in key Midwest swing states such as Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan.

During an interview on “Fox & Friends” this morning, Trump, without evidence, suggested there was a Democrat-led “coup” that ultimately forced Biden to withdraw from the race.
“Well, I think it was a coup. They didn’t want him running,” Trump said. “He was way down in the polls, and they thought he was going to lose. They went to him and they said, ‘You can’t win the race,’ which I think is true.”
Trump claimed that he has “very good information” from people “on the other side” that Democrats were “trying to do a coup.”
“You know, I have it from very good information. I know a lot of people on the other side, too, that they went and they forced him out, between Pelosi and Obama and some others that you see on television,” he said. “It’s interesting. I watched them on television, and they act so nice. ‘Oh yes, we love Joe. We love Joe.’ Behind the scenes, I know for a fact they were brutal.”
Biden had faced mounting calls from Democrats to step aside after his dismal debate performance last month. NBC News reported that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had quietly pushed efforts to nudge Biden out of the race after his poor debate performance. But Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who had joined calls for Biden to step aside, on Sunday denied that there was coordinated effort by Democrats to pressure Biden to leave the race.
Later in the interview, Trump again accused Democrats of election interference amid the legal battles he faces, saying “every single court case that I have is pushed on by them.”
“Just so you know, they push all these cases on me. They’re the ones that start it. And then they say, ‘I’m a prosecutor, he’s a criminal,’” he said. “They’re the ones. Every case is started by them, and I’m winning the cases.”
Trump was charged in a criminal case related to his efforts to halt the peaceful transfer of power in the days leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack amid his baseless claims of a stolen 2020 election. But the case has been delayed as a result of the Supreme Court’s decision this month that said Trump has  immunity for some of his conduct as president in his federal election case.

The House voted without opposition Wednesday for a resolution to establish a bipartisan task force to investigate the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump.
The task force will investigate federal, state and local law enforcement and agency actions in the lead-up to the attempt on Trump’s life on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania. Four hundred-sixteen members voted in favor of the resolution, and 16 members did not vote.
Seven Republicans and six Democrats will serve on the committee, House party leaders said in a statement.
The resolution text said the task force must issue a final report to the House by Dec. 13, noting that it should include “any recommendations for legislative reforms necessary to prevent future security lapses.”
In a statement after the vote, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said that “protecting the safety and security of our nation’s leaders is a responsibility that transcends party lines.”
Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., announced their intention Tuesday to create the task force, which will have subpoena authority.

Former President Barack Obama and Vice President Kamala Harris have been in close touch since she announced her presidential candidacy Sunday, having multiple conversations this week as she kicks off her campaign, according to four people familiar with their discussions.
Obama privately has fully supported Harris’ candidacy and plans to endorse her soon, these people said.
“He has been in regular contact with her and thinks she’s been off to a great start,” one of them said.
Obama is one of the only high-profile Democrats in the country who is yet to endorse Harris. While other party leaders have stepped forward to publicly back her, he has so far kept his support private.
The people familiar with the discussions didn’t know the precise timing of his endorsement. One of them said Obama didn’t want it to overshadow Biden’s moment, particularly his Oval Office address to the nation last night.
Another person familiar with the discussions said Obama and Harris, who is seeking to maintain the momentum her campaign has enjoyed among Democrats since she entered the race, wanted his endorsement to stand as its own moment.

The Harris campaign released its first official video, titled “We Choose Freedom,” which focuses on Americans’ rights and freedoms as the core issue at stake in the November election.
In the ad, which features Beyonce’s song “Freedom,” Harris paints Trump and his allies as people who “think we should be a country of chaos, of fear, of hate” and urges Americans to join her in choosing “something different.”
“The freedom not just to get by, but get ahead. The freedom to be safe from gun violence. The freedom to make decisions about your own body,” Harris says in the ad. “We choose a future where no child lives in poverty. Where we all can afford health care, where no one is above the law.”
“We believe in the promise of America and we are ready to fight for it,” she adds. “Because when we fight, we win. So join us.”

Trump, speaking at his first campaign rally since Biden ended his re-election bid, redirected a torrent of attacks yesterday at Harris, the de facto Democratic nominee.
“As you know, three days ago, we officially defeated the worst president in the history of our country, Joe Biden,” Trump told his crowd in Charlotte, North Carolina. “So now we have a new victim to defeat: lyin’ Kamala Harris … the most incompetent and far-left vice president in American history.”

Harris has looked at the vetting process from both sides now. But she doesn’t have much time to spare.
It was only Sunday that Biden abandoned his campaign and effectively handed it to her, leaving two weeks for Democrats to nominate her and a running mate if they hope to beat an Aug. 7 deadline to ensure their ticket appears on ballots in every state. Modern candidates usually have months to decide, as Biden did when he dragged his feet in picking her in 2020 and as Trump did holding a virtual public pageant this year before he put Sen. JD Vance of Ohio on his ticket.

NBC_5,"In 2021, Biden asked Harris to tackle the 'root causes' of migration. Here's what followed.",https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/kamala-harris-border-policy-rcna163317,2024-07-25 19:00:02.702650,,"President Joe Biden tapped Kamala Harris to tackle the daunting issue of immigration in March 2021, but the vice president’s public-facing work on addressing the root causes of migration largely evaporated within months, according to an NBC News analysis of public documents, U.S. aid disbursements and Harris’ travel schedule.
Harris traveled to Mexico in June 2021 to sign an agreement that has led to a commitment of $4 billion in direct assistance and over $5.2 billion in private-public investment from the U.S. But she has not visited the southern border, or the countries to its south, since January 2022. And despite requests from Mexico for more investment, her “Root Causes Strategy” made no new financial commitments.
When Harris became Biden’s “border czar,” as critics called her, the administration was under pressure from both sides to address the rising number of migrants — particularly unaccompanied children — crossing the border and landing in poor conditions in U.S. custody. On March 24, 2021, Biden took the stage at the White House and seemed to hand the keys on the issue over to his vice president.
“The vice president has agreed — among the multiple other things that I have her leading, and I appreciate it — agreed to lead our diplomatic effort to work with those nations to accept returnees and enhance migration enforcement at their borders,” Biden said.
In accepting the task, Harris made her role more specific, describing largely diplomatic responsibilities. “I look forward to engaging in diplomacy with government, with the private sector, with civil society and the leaders of each in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to strengthen democracy and the rule of law and ensure shared prosperity in the region. We will collaborate with Mexico and other countries throughout the Western Hemisphere.”
Biden administration officials have pointed to those remarks in rejecting criticism that Harris did not solve the crisis at the border, where there have been record crossings under Biden. They say her job was not to focus on working with countries in the region to address root causes, and they reject the mocking title “border czar.” 
The Border Patrol union says Harris did not deliver on any of her immigration-related assignments. 
When Harris’ name is mentioned at the border, “it’s a lot of eye rolls,” said Jon Anfinsen, national executive vice president of the National Border Patrol Council, the Border Patrol union. 
“I would ask what has she done in terms of solving the root causes. This has been a goal of hers for this many years. What’s changed? I would argue it’s not improved; it has only gotten worse,” Anfinsen said. “Shortly around that period of time, it kind of just went away, and you didn’t hear it.”
But Daniel Suvor, who was chief of policy for Harris from 2014 to 2017 while she was California's attorney general, said he was unsurprised she was tapped to address root causes of migration in Central America.
“She’s been interested in Central America for some time, and she has built up a wide range of relationships down there,” Suvor said.
Suvor said Harris' connections in Latin America stemmed from her work as attorney general to combat drug trafficking by transnational criminal organizations and her trips to Mexico City to meet with foreign officials.
“She understood all the way back then that we needed to work with the Mexican government, El Salvador, Honduran, Guatemalan government, to take on the cartels.”
An NBC News review found that her travel to address root issues in the region was largely limited to June 2021, with one trip to the border in El Paso, Texas, and another to Mexico and Guatemala. She made one additional trip to Honduras in January 2022. 
Her work in Guatemala may have been most memorable. It was where she faced criticism from immigration groups for telling migrants “don’t come” to the U.S. 
But her work in Mexico was arguably the most significant. It was there that Mexico and the U.S. signed a memorandum of understanding to “strengthen development cooperation in northern Central America ... to exchange knowledge, experiences, assets, and resources to address the root causes of irregular migration in northern Central America,” according to a description of the agreement by the State Department.
The agreement sent funds from the U.S. Agency for International Development, coupled with those from the Mexican Agency for International Development Cooperation, to help people in Central America. Since then, the U.S. has stayed on track to meet its commitment of $4 billion to address root causes, but Harris has also been able to solicit significant help from private companies, which have invested $5.2 billion in the region since 2021.
Those investments have funded entrepreneurs, ensured labor rights, strengthened food security and launched “19 projects in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras across sectors, including financial inclusion, healthcare, climate finance, and affordable housing,” according to the White House.
Since 2021, however, the Root Causes Strategy has made no new commitments, despite Mexican pleas for more direct investment from the U.S., not just from U.S. companies.
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said in May 2022 that the private investment strategy is too slow.
“We are convincing the government of the United States to invest with readiness,” he said at a news conference. “They have a very special system — they think that it’s enough to promote private investments. That if plants, factories are installed in Central America, then employment will be generated. … That is good, but that takes time.”
Harris made one more trip to Central America after 2021, to attend the inauguration of Honduran President Xiomara Castro in January 2022. According to the White House, Harris talked to her about “combating corruption and gender-based violence as a way to address the root causes of migration.”
Since then, she has held two meetings in Washington, one with López Obrador in July 2022 and the other most recently with Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo in March.
A White House official defended Harris’ record and said her work is ongoing. “Vice President Harris continues to lead the effort to address the root causes of migration from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador, including by generating more than $5.2 billion in investments into the region to give people economic opportunity at home. These investments are creating jobs and have connected more than 4.5 million people to the internet and brought more than 2.5 million people into the formal financial system.”
“Under the Vice President’s leadership, the Biden-Harris Administration continues to implement the Root Causes Strategy. As a part of this strategy, the Administration is on track to meet its commitment to provide $4 billion to the region over four years and continues to work to combat corruption, reduce violence, and empower women,” the White House official wrote.
Think tanks that study immigration and international non-governmental organizations have also questioned the impact of Harris’ work in addressing immigration.
“She had a very narrow mandate, which was to be the diplomatic representative in Central America at the time when most unauthorized immigration was coming from Central America,” said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington.
Since 2021, immigration from the Central American countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, once the leaders in illegal immigration across the southwest border, has fallen from 86,089 in March 2021 to 25,015 in June 2024, according to Customs and Border Protection data. 
But immigration experts point out that the decline is most likely driven by other factors, including U.S. policies restricting asylum at the border and an increase in Mexican interdictions of U.S.-bound migrants. And during that time, migration from countries like Venezuela and China — where Harris has no involvement in immigration discussions — has mounted.
Selee said USAID took over the money the U.S. sent to Central America for development while Harris stayed focused on the private-sector investment.
“Vice President Harris was very involved diplomatically early on with Central American governments, clearing the way to get these two initiatives underway and talking about how to stem unauthorized migration,” Selee said. “But, as near as I can tell, she just hasn’t stayed as engaged diplomatically on this. And, you know, over time, the State Department and the National Security Council really took over the diplomatic side.”
Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge, noted Harris’ role launching an anti-corruption task force with the Justice Department focused on Northern Triangle countries.
“I do think she [Harris] has played a leadership role in addressing the root causes,” Vignarajah said.
“Do we believe this solves the problem? No. Of course not. And this is where Congress needs to be a real player,” she said.Didi Martinez is an associate producer with the NBC News Investigative Unit.

NBC_6,Paris is abuzz ahead of the Olympics opening ceremony as a festive atmosphere takes hold,https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/olympics/paris-abuzz-ahead-olympics-opening-rcna163585,2024-07-25 18:00:02.702650,,"PARIS — Just a day before the 2024 Paris Olympic Games opening ceremony, the French capital was abuzz Thursday as it prepared to host the world’s biggest sporting party.
Though the Olympics soft-launched Wednesday with soccer and rugby sevens, the real action will begin Friday night when the city will stage perhaps the most ambitious inauguration in the Games’ history.
Almost 100 boats will take 10,500 athletes down the Seine — in many ways the star of the show over the next two weeks — in what will be the first time the ceremony has been held outside a single stadium.
The river is already lined with bleachers, and dotted with venues ready to host sports as varied as fencing and taekwondo to basketball and break dancing. And although these areas remain eerily quiet for now, protected by a network of high-security metal barriers, there was a festive atmosphere just up the street at the Arc de Triomphe, where people from all over the world had gathered.
Stream every moment and every medal of the 2024 Paris Olympics on Peacock, starting with the opening ceremony Friday at 12 p.m. ET.
“You can feel the vibes in the air,” said Vinicius Rodrigues, 32, from Sao Paulo. Under the arch of the iconic monument, he was dressed in the bright yellow of his home country alongside his wife, Aliene, 34, and two daughters, Maya, 3, and Chloe, 1.
This is the first Olympics they’ve traveled to. And despite their country failing to qualify for men’s soccer, and therefore unable to defend its gold medal, the family spent Wednesday at the game between Spain and Uzbekistan at the city’s Parc des Princes stadium. Though Spain won 2-1, it was the Uzbek fans’ singing, chanting and impressive unison “thunder clapping” that charmed neutrals.
“It was amazing,” beamed Rodrigues, who works as an electrical engineer. “It was one of my dreams to come here.”
Adding to the preshow excitement are the celebrities who have begun to roll into town this week. Singers Celine Dion and Lady Gaga have both been spotted in the French capital, leading to speculation they might be about to play in the secretively planned opening ceremony.
Social media has been replete with rumors about who else might attend or perform. 
Meanwhile, the actor Selma Hayek was among the stars chosen to carry the Olympic Torch through Paris on Wednesday. 
Hayek, who was dressed in a white tracksuit, called the torch “a symbol of light, hope, peace, and unity,” in an Instagram post Wednesday “If you believe in these values, know that you were with me every step of the way,” she said, adding that she was “proud to represent the enduring spirit of the Olympics, bringing light, hope, and unity to all.”
Hip-hop icon Snoop Dogg will carry the Olympic flame Friday through the streets of Saint-Denis, the town’s mayor, Mathieu Hanotin, announced Tuesday morning.
The Olympic organizers and French officials say they hope this spirit can change the narrative of a world beset by tension and division, and engulfed in war in the Gaza Strip, Ukraine and Sudan.
Many Parisians are skeptical.  A survey by leading French pollster IFOP between July 15 and 16 found that 36% of French people were indifferent about the Olympics, 26% were concerned and 5% were angry.
With Paris crisscrossed with QR code-demanding security checkpoints, trade in the city is down 70% in the past week, the Confederation of French Commerce said Monday. That was evident when NBC News walked around the security perimeter flanking the Seine late Wednesday. Cafes usually packed with tourists had the unusual spectacle of free tables outside, and two taxi drivers, who were not authorized by their employers to give their names, said the city was far quieter than usual.
With the event proper yet to kick off, this may just be a pregame lull. Several streets back from the Seine, the Champs Elysees was still the picture of bustling Paris. Bikes rattled over cobblestones, cigarette smoke wafted from cafe terraces, and stylishly dressed people went about their business.
Indeed, there are plenty here who are enthusiastic about the event that’s taken over their city.
For Pamela Karam, 33, a graphic designer who lives in the suburbs, it’s another step in the green revolution that’s consumed Paris under Mayor Anne Hidalgo. Over the past few years, downtown roads have been closed to cars in favor of bike lanes. And the Olympics promises to take this a step further, making the Seine swimmable for the first time in 100 years, thanks to a $1.5 billion overhaul of the sewage system.
“The skate park they’ve built around the Place de la Concorde is going to look so nice when it opens,” she said. “But being able to swim in the Seine — that will be fantastic.”Alexander Smith is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital based in London."
NBC_7,Video of police officer kicking and stamping on a man’s head sparks protest,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/video-violent-arrest-british-airport-sparks-protest-rcna163584,2024-07-25 18:00:02.702650,,"A video showing a British police officer kick and stamp on a man’s head during an arrest at Manchester Airport in northern England sparked a protest outside a police station late on Wednesday.
Police suspended one of the officers involved and referred the actions to an independent police complaints watchdog after the video, filmed by an onlooker, was posted on social media platforms and attracted criticism.
It showed a chaotic scene in an airport car park, in which several officers armed with tasers restrained two suspects. The events preceding this scene were not included in the video. One man was kicked and stamped upon by an officer as he lay face down on the floor. The second man also appeared to be struck in the head by an officer.
A Greater Manchester Police (GMP) statement said the video showed “an event that is truly shocking, and that people are rightly extremely concerned about. The use of such force in an arrest is an unusual occurrence and one that we understand creates alarm.”
It said police had responded to reports of an assault, and three officers were assaulted during their response. The officers, including one female officer whose nose was broken, required hospital treatment.
An officer was suspended on Thursday, having initially only been removed from operational duties.
The two men were arrested on suspicion of assault, assault of an emergency worker, affray, and obstructing police.
The incident sparked a protest outside a police station in a nearby town. One video posted online showed a crowd of at least 100 people chanting “Shame on you GMP”.
Police, who have not provided any details about the identity of those arrested at the airport, said the protest concluded safely and without incident.
“We have spent the evening listening to community feedback and will continue to engage with communities and elected members to maintain strong partnership links and understand local views,” they said in a subsequent statement.Reuters"
NBC_8,Harris has to recapture the young Latino voters Biden was losing,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/kamala-harris-biden-latino-young-voters-rcna163366,2024-07-25 18:00:02.702650,,"SAN ANTONIO — Rebecca Contreras was planning to vote again for President Joe Biden, but the 30-year-old Texan was uncertain he could win. Now with Vice President Kamala Harris as the de facto nominee, she said her confidence has crept back.
“Maybe there’s some hope again, and our votes can matter,” the  San Antonio social media marketing specialist, who considers herself progressive, said Monday. 
Long seen as reliable Democratic voters, the support of younger Latinos like Contreras was less of a sure bet for Democrats this year than in previous election cycles. 
Democrats saw then-President Donald Trump and the Republican Party carve out a larger share of the Hispanic vote in 2020. This year, polls showed a continued decline for Biden, with the two presidential candidates essentially tied among Latinos; the party has also feared losing more Latino supporters to third-party candidates or to voters staying home altogether. 
Latinos are younger than Americans overall, and hundreds of thousands of Latino citizens turn 18 and are eligible to vote each year. A May survey of over 2,000 voters under 40, including Latinos, found only one-third would vote for Biden. Among Latinos, 32% said they would support Trump, 28% chose Biden and another 28% said they would support ""someone else,"" the University of Chicago GenForward survey found.
Young Latino college students in Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania told NBC News in April that while most supported progressive policies that aligned with the Democratic agenda, few expressed support for Biden or Trump. 
One of every 5 Hispanics will be voting in their first presidential election this year, according to UnidosUS, a national Latino advocacy group. Of those new Latino voters, more than a third (36%) identify as independent or nonpartisan.
They are not so easily won over. 
Dennison Pinto, 19, of Allentown, Pennsylvania, had been exploring voting for a third-party candidate. On Monday, Pinto said he prefers a Democratic president, but he’s not yet sold on Harris or any other specific candidate. 
Fellow Allentown resident Jeremy Bautista, 20, cast his first vote in a local Pennsylvania election last year. He’s still mulling whether to vote this year. While Bautista said Harris is starting to look like ""one of the better options,"" he’s unsure whether she lines up with his views on economic policy and the Israel-Hamas conflict. 
Young voters had ""a general sense of both parties are the same, nothing’s going to change,"" Stella Rouse, an Arizona State University political scientist, told NBC News in April. This week, she said Harris can invigorate young Latinos if she conveys ""a message of opportunity"" and paints a picture of a future America that is multicultural and where young Latinos can take a lead. 
Poder NC Action, a progressive group focused on mobilizing North Carolina Latinos, said in a statement that younger voters weren't  confident that they would be represented by any presidential candidate or political party.  After Biden stepped down, ""we are more optimistic than ever,"" said founder Irene Godinez, 41. ""While we don’t align 100% with VP Harris, we support the choice of a new candidate who will bring a renewed spirit to the fight of our lives."" 
Carlos Odio, co-founder of Equis Research, a Democratic firm that polls Latinos, said in a post on X on Monday that an early read of data from a July 11-15 poll of Nevada Latinos shows Harris winning back some Latinos who had slipped away from Biden “and notably pulls a chunk who said they would sit out a Biden/Trump rematch.” 
His firm’s past polling has shown Harris with favorable and unfavorable ratings similar to Biden's but doing significantly better with Latinas, including those younger than 40, a key swing group. 
In-house Biden campaign polling conducted by Democratic pollster Matt Barreto shows that Harris is more popular than Biden among Latino voters.
Harris had a net 46-point advantage over Biden among Latinos who said they disapprove of Biden and his GOP rival, Trump, according to the polling detailed in a July 14 memo Barreto and fellow Biden pollster Angie Gutierrez posted online.
Harris' popularity with Latinos ages 18-29 is 16 points better than Biden’s, he said. The Hill first reported the memo. Barreto said the polling was done before Biden stepped down to determine if Harris could bolster Biden’s campaign with Latinos. 
Barreto said Harris won the Latino vote in California when she ran for attorney general in 2010 and 2014 and beat Rep. Loretta Sanchez for the Senate seat in 2016.
“She has an opportunity to reverse the media narrative that Democrats are losing Latino support because she seems to be quite popular with Latinos, and as Latinos learn more about her, I expect her favorability ratings will go up,” Barreto told NBC News on Tuesday.
Harris faces voter frustrations — as well as Republican attacks — over the high cost of living, which Latinos repeatedly name as their top concern in polling, as well as immigration. Republicans have erroneously called her the border czar, though her work focused on working with Central American countries on the root causes of immigration, not on border enforcement.
Harris also has to make her case to voters who feel they don't know her.
Evelyn Jimenez, 20, of San Antonio was excited to cast her first vote in a presidential election for Biden and ""heartbroken"" when he stepped down, saying she was skeptical of Harris. 
“I really didn’t see her do much in these four years. I didn’t see that she was involved,” Jimenez said. 
Harris has been campaigning this year to shore up Latino support, touting the administration’s policies and telling NBC News in March the challenge was “to let people know who brought it to them.”
Maca Casado, Harris campaign media director, said in a statement that Harris has worked to earn Latino voter support throughout her career and focused on issues of health care, child care and fighting gun violence. 
""Trump and MAGA are proudly running on an anti-Latino platform demonizing immigrants that only serves the wealthy and powerful — and are doing nothing to reach Latino voters,"" Casado said. The campaign said it is ""working aggressively to make the case because we won't take their votes for granted.""
Trump campaign senior adviser Danielle Alvarez said in a statement to NBC News, “Latino-Americans know Kamala Harris as the original Border Czar, the deciding vote that let to sky-rocketing inflation, and dangerously liberal. President Trump’s message to our community is simple and built on his winning record: If you want the return of the strongest economy in over 60 years, rising wages, quality jobs, strong borders, and safe neighborhoods, then vote for him.” 
More Latinas live in states with abortion bans and restrictions than last year; Florida recently enacted a six-week abortion ban. In Texas, where there is a near-total abortion ban, the teen birth rate rose for the first time in 15 years and the average fertility rate rose 5.1% among Latinas, disproportionately affecting them. 
Harris' outspokenness on abortion could be helped by campaigns in Arizona and Nevada to get abortion rights measures on November ballots. Support for abortion rights among Hispanics has been increasing over the decades, and a majority (62%) believe it should be legal in all or most cases. Harris has hit Trump and Republicans hard on abortion in visits to Arizona and other states. 
Abortion has been a thorny issue for Republicans, with some GOP candidates downplaying their anti-abortion views or avoiding discussing them. Trump softened the party’s platform to exclude a federal abortion ban. 
Gabriela Torres, 29, a high school culinary arts teacher, said she was with her mom and sister outside the U.S. Supreme Court when it overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion nationwide. Her mother was in tears and “you could feel the world shift,” she said. 
“My mom helped make this happen and now it’s taken away from us. Now I look at my daughter and it’s not just abortion, it’s reproductive rights. It’s the right to get birth control, to have access to safe abortions,” said Torres, who caucused for Hillary Clinton in 2016. “My hope is that maybe with a female in power” those rights can be returned, she said.
Markus Ceniceros, 20, a school board member in Arizona who lives in Phoenix and identifies as half white, half Latino, said he attended rallies where Harris spoke.
“She knows how to rally a crowd,” he said, “and she’s kind of been the spokesman for young voters since last year for the campaign and I think it’s working.”
Young voters, including Latinos, voted in higher numbers in 2020 and in the 2022 midterms, but have lower turnout compared to other groups.
With four months to go and with tight races in battleground states, the Democratic-leaning political arms of three national Latino groups — Voto Latino, UnidosUS and Mi Familia Vota — said they are combining forces to double down on mobilization and registration of Latino voters to support Harris.

The balloons are part of an ongoing propaganda campaign by Pyongyang against North Korean defectors and activists in the South, who regularly send balloons carrying items such as anti-Pyongyang leaflets medicine, money and USB sticks loaded with K-pop videos and dramas.
A suspected balloon suspended take-offs and landings at Seoul’s Gimpo Airport on Wednesday evening for two hours, an official at the Korea Airports Corporation said.
Balloons have affected traffic at South Korea’s main international airport, Incheon, several times in recent weeks.
In Gyeonggi, a province near Seoul, a balloon caught fire on top of a residential building. Fire fighters extinguished the blaze, an official at the Gyeonggi Northern Fire and Disaster Headquarters said.
South Korea’s military said some trash balloons were equipped with timed poppers that could cause fires.
“A timer is attached to the trash balloons, which has the effect of popping the balloons and spreading the trash after a certain period of time has passed,” Lee Sung-jun, a spokesperson for South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a briefing.
Lee said 480 balloons had landed mostly carrying paper and plastic trash in South Korea as of Thursday.
On Wednesday, North Korean balloons had landed in the vicinity of the heavily guarded presidential office in Seoul.Reuters"

Swimmer Caeleb Dressel, who has seven Olympic gold medals and is favored to win more this year, said on Thursday that he doesn't have confidence that all his competitors are clean. 
""I don’t really think they’ve given us enough evidence to support them with how this case was handled.”
Nearly two dozen Chinese swimmers had tested positive for trimetazidine, a heart medication banned by doping regulators, months before the 2021 Tokyo Olympics but still allowed to compete. Eleven of these swimmers were named to the Paris squad. 
Dressel's comments were echoed by Katie Ledecky a day earlier.
“I hope everyone here is going to be competing clean this week. But what really matters also is, were they training clean?” Ledecky told reporters on Wednesday.
“So really, hopefully, that’s been the case. Hopefully, there’s been even testing around the world.”

Team USA's Olympic swimmers are getting in their final training sessions before their events get underway Saturday. But before they walk out to the poolside at the Paris La Defense Arena, they'll have to brave the ready room.
The ready room is where swimmers sit together and patiently await their races. Given that world-class athletes have spent four years training for the Paris Games, the mood is tense and Olympians are nervous with anticipation. 
""Swimmers hate the ready room,"" explains Regan Smith, who won two silvers and a bronze at the Tokyo Games. ""I think there are some oddballs out there who crave the ready room and love it. I’m not a huge fan of it ... [but] I’ve gotten much more confident as I've gotten older so it doesn't shake me quite like how it used to.""
For others, it's a window into the minds of their rivals. Four-time gold-winner Ryan Murphy likes to listen to music and shut out any noise. ""There’s definitely nervous energy in there and I think everyone has some different tendencies when they’re nervous,"" Murphy says. ""You’re always gonna have the chatty person when they’re nervous [but] it isn’t me. You’re getting direct access to their brain.""

Today marks the start of the women's soccer competition, with all 12 competing teams in action across the day. That includes the U.S. Women's National Team which faces Zambia in their opening group stage match in Nice at 3 p.m. ET. 
The Olympics marks the start of a new era for the USWNT after an underwhelming performance at last year's World Cup in which the team suffered a Round of 16 exit to Sweden after penalties— its earliest ever elimination from the tournament.  
The early exit in the World Cup saw former head coach Vlatko Andonovski resign and he has now been replaced by Emma Hayes, who turned Chelsea into a major force in women's soccer. Hayes has won 14 major trophies in her 12 years in charge in west London. 
Gone too are USWNT stalwarts Megan Rapinoe and Julie Ertz — both retired after the World Cup. Alex Morgan, meanwhile, is now 35 years old and was not selected for the Games by Hayes. 
Hayes' squad for the Games is much younger and less experienced than the U.S. has had previously — only 10 of the 18-player roster were in the squad for the World Cup last year. But the group will still be considered among the medal contenders. 
Hayes insists the team will not be burdened by the memory of its early exit from the World Cup. ""I think this team is firmly focused on ... creating a new history together,"" Hayes said in a press conference. ""Our motivation isn’t always about righting the wrongs. Far from it. We’re excited. We’re prepared.""  
Unlike the men's tournament, the women's soccer competition at the Olympics is not age-restricted, meaning the teams competing at the Games are at full strength. 
Defending gold medalists Canada have been mired in controversy this week after being accused of using a drone to spy on the training session of their first opponents New Zealand. Spain is also expected to be in the mix for gold, having won the World Cup last year.  
Experienced captain Lindsey Horan will be crucial to the USWNT's chances, while defender Naomi Girma had a breakthrough year in 2023 being named USWNT player of the year. Sophia Smith is another to look out for: the Portland Thorns forward was nominated last week for CONCACAF player of the year.

Each competitor in the ranking round competes in 12 rounds of six-arrow ends, with scores totaled (60 maximum) after each of those dozen ends. When those 72 arrows have been shot, scores are tallied and competitors are ranked 1 through 64 for one-on-one knockout play.
Archery is being held at Esplanade des Invalides, a few arrows' shot from Napoleon's tomb.

French sprinter Sounkamba Sylla has been banned from the opening ceremony tomorrow because of a French secularism law that prohibits public sector workers from wearing a hijab.
""You are selected for the Olympics, organized in your country, but you can’t participate in the opening ceremony because you wear a headscarf,"" the 26-year-old member of the French 400-meter women's and mixed relay teams wrote on Instagram. 
During the European Championships earlier this year, Sylla wore a blue cap that was incorporated into the team's kit.  For the Paris Games, officials are trying to come up with a similar solution with the LVMH group, whose luxury brand Berluti is designing the uniform for the French delegation.
""We want to follow the same logic. That’s why we’re progressing in discussions with LVMH and Berluti,"" French Sports Minister Amélie Oudéa-Castéra said. ""I am confident.""

British tennis legend Andy Murray has withdrawn from the men’s Olympic singles, he said in a statement. The double Olympic gold medalist said that that he will still take part in the Olympic men’s doubles with fellow Team GB member Dan Evans. 
“I’ve take the decision to withdraw from the singles to concentrate on the doubles with Dan. Our practice has been great and we’re playing well together,” Murray said in a statement today. “Really looking forward to getting started and representing GB one more time.”
The 37-year-old confirmed earlier this week that he will retire from professional tennis after the Paris Games following years of injury-related problems. The tennis player has particularly struggled for fitness in recent weeks in the wake of surgery to remove a spinal cyst. 
Murray pulled out of the men’s singles tournament at Wimbledon earlier this month, but still played doubles alongside his brother Jamie Murray.

The Olympic Games are beamed to billions of people around the world, giving viewers a real-time, close-up look at every pole vault, layup, breaststroke and backflip.
But there is a crucial part of the Olympic experience that remains largely unknown to spectators, sealed off from the camera crews and off-limits to cheering fans — the Olympic Village.
In recent weeks, NBC News spoke with decorated Olympians about life inside the sprawling residential complexes where thousands of athletes sleep, eat, train and socialize. They likened the villages to summer camps, college dorms, crowded hotels and — in the words of gold medalist swimmer Mark Spitz — a “gigantic cruise ship.”

Swimmer Caeleb Dressel, who has seven Olympic gold medals and is favored to win more this year, said on Thursday that he doesn't have confidence that all his competitors are clean. 
""I don’t really think they’ve given us enough evidence to support them with how this case was handled.”
Nearly two dozen Chinese swimmers had tested positive for trimetazidine, a heart medication banned by doping regulators, months before the 2021 Tokyo Olympics but still allowed to compete. Eleven of these swimmers were named to the Paris squad. 
Dressel's comments were echoed by Katie Ledecky a day earlier.
“I hope everyone here is going to be competing clean this week. But what really matters also is, were they training clean?” Ledecky told reporters on Wednesday.
“So really, hopefully, that’s been the case. Hopefully, there’s been even testing around the world.”David K. Li

World-famous pop icon Céline Dion, who is rumored to be performing at the Olympic opening ceremony, has met with the French first lady Brigitte Macron. A picture posted on Instagram by Macron's chief of staff staff showed the two women standing side by side. 
Videos of Céline Dion in Paris began circulating on social media Tuesday, prompting rumors that the ""It's All Coming Back to Me Now"" songstress will perform tomorrow when the Games officially open. Yesterday, French Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera added even more fuel to the rumors, conceding that Celine’s presence in Paris was ""not a coincidence."" 
Yesterday, the French-Canadian singer posted pictures of herself at the Louvre Museum, confirming that she is in Paris. In both English and French, she wrote that ""every time I return to Paris, I remember there’s so much beauty and joy still to experience in the world. I love Paris, and I’m so happy to be back!""

Olympic gymnastics kicks off in under 48 hours and the GOAT is looking razor sharp.
In today's podium training, which is akin to a ""dress rehearsal"" for the actual competition, Simone Biles stuck her eponymous Yurchenko double pike vault cold. 
The powerful skill is the most difficult vault ever performed in women's gymnastics and is notoriously hard to land cleanly. 
If she does the ""Biles II"" like that during the competition, it is likely to be the highest score of the entire Olympics. Men's gymnastics kicks off with the qualification round Saturday, with the women following Sunday.David K. Li

France’s counterterrorism prosecutor’s office has confirmed to NBC News that a man from the Gironde region was arrested today on terrorism charges.
The 18-year-old from southwest France was arrested at an undisclosed location while on vacation. Another 18-year-old was arrested in the southwestern Gironde region earlier this week.
Both men are suspected of planning a violent act, the prosecutor's office told NBC News. Investigators are yet to determine the seriousness of the threat and whether  their plans went beyond messages that they had exchanged online.

Team USA's Olympic swimmers are getting in their final training sessions before their events get underway Saturday. But before they walk out to the poolside at the Paris La Defense Arena, they'll have to brave the ready room.
The ready room is where swimmers sit together and patiently await their races. Given that world-class athletes have spent four years training for the Paris Games, the mood is tense and Olympians are nervous with anticipation. 
""Swimmers hate the ready room,"" explains Regan Smith, who won two silvers and a bronze at the Tokyo Games. ""I think there are some oddballs out there who crave the ready room and love it. I’m not a huge fan of it ... [but] I’ve gotten much more confident as I've gotten older so it doesn't shake me quite like how it used to.""
For others, it's a window into the minds of their rivals. Four-time gold-winner Ryan Murphy likes to listen to music and shut out any noise. ""There’s definitely nervous energy in there and I think everyone has some different tendencies when they’re nervous,"" Murphy says. ""You’re always gonna have the chatty person when they’re nervous [but] it isn’t me. You’re getting direct access to their brain.""Sean Nevin
Today marks the start of the women's soccer competition, with all 12 competing teams in action across the day. That includes the U.S. Women's National Team which faces Zambia in their opening group stage match in Nice at 3 p.m. ET. 
The Olympics marks the start of a new era for the USWNT after an underwhelming performance at last year's World Cup in which the team suffered a Round of 16 exit to Sweden after penalties— its earliest ever elimination from the tournament.  
The early exit in the World Cup saw former head coach Vlatko Andonovski resign and he has now been replaced by Emma Hayes, who turned Chelsea into a major force in women's soccer. Hayes has won 14 major trophies in her 12 years in charge in west London. 
Gone too are USWNT stalwarts Megan Rapinoe and Julie Ertz — both retired after the World Cup. Alex Morgan, meanwhile, is now 35 years old and was not selected for the Games by Hayes. 
Hayes' squad for the Games is much younger and less experienced than the U.S. has had previously — only 10 of the 18-player roster were in the squad for the World Cup last year. But the group will still be considered among the medal contenders. 
Hayes insists the team will not be burdened by the memory of its early exit from the World Cup. ""I think this team is firmly focused on ... creating a new history together,"" Hayes said in a press conference. ""Our motivation isn’t always about righting the wrongs. Far from it. We’re excited. We’re prepared.""  
Unlike the men's tournament, the women's soccer competition at the Olympics is not age-restricted, meaning the teams competing at the Games are at full strength. 
Defending gold medalists Canada have been mired in controversy this week after being accused of using a drone to spy on the training session of their first opponents New Zealand. Spain is also expected to be in the mix for gold, having won the World Cup last year.  
Experienced captain Lindsey Horan will be crucial to the USWNT's chances, while defender Naomi Girma had a breakthrough year in 2023 being named USWNT player of the year. Sophia Smith is another to look out for: the Portland Thorns forward was nominated last week for CONCACAF player of the year.Aishwarya Thapa Chhetri

""To shoot something close to my average, I'm really happy,"" Kaufhold told reporters after the competition.

NBC_11,Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai to testify in his own defense at trial,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hong-kong-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-testify-defense-rcna163582,2024-07-25 15:00:02.702650,,"A defense lawyer said Thursday that prominent publisher Jimmy Lai will testify in his defense in the landmark national security trial brought under a Beijing-imposed law that has all but wiped out public dissent.
Lai, the 76-year-old founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper, was arrested in 2020 during a crackdown on the mass pro-democracy protests that rocked Hong Kong in 2019. He was charged with colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security and conspiring with others to put out seditious publications. If convicted, he faces up to life in prison.
On Wednesday, Lai’s lawyer Robert Pang argued his client had no case to answer because the prosecutors’ evidence was insufficient. Pang said the prosecution had failed to prove Lai’s intent after the introduction of the 2020 law and stressed the importance of freedom of speech.
But judges Esther Toh, Susana D’Almada Remedios and Alex Lee, who were approved by the government to oversee the case, ruled against him on Thursday.
""Having considered all the submission, we ruled that the first defendant has a case to answer on all charges,"" Toh said, without elaborating.
Lai appeared to be at ease after the ruling.
Pang said in court that Lai would testify in his defense. The case has been adjourned to Nov. 20.
Observers said Lai’s high-profile case, which has already stretched over 90 days, is a trial of press freedom and a test for judicial independence in the Asian financial hub.
When Britain handed back Hong Kong to China in 1997, the city was promised to have its Western-style civil liberties kept intact for 50 years. However, the freedoms that once set Hong Kong apart from mainland China, including freedoms of press and assembly, have drastically shrunk since the enactment of the 2020 security law.
Beijing and Hong Kong governments insist that the law brought back stability to the city following the social unrest.
The prosecutors have alleged that Lai had engaged in requesting foreign countries, especially the United States, to take actions against Beijing ""under the guise of fighting for freedom and democracy.""
They pointed to Lai’s meetings with former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other senior senators in the United States in July 2019 to discuss a now-withdrawn extradition bill that sparked the massive anti-government protests that year. They alleged Lai had sought support from the U.S. on sanctioning Beijing and Hong Kong’s leaders who allegedly cracked down the movement.
In 2022, six former Apple Daily executives entered guilty pleas and admitted to the court they conspired with Lai to call for sanctions or other hostile activities against Hong Kong or China. They were convicted and await sentencing behind bars.
During the trial, some of the former executives, alongside two others who also pleaded guilty to collusion charges, have testified as the prosecution’s witnesses.

NBC_12,Obama plans to endorse Harris for president soon,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/obama-plans-endorse-harris-president-soon-rcna163279,2024-07-25 12:00:02.702650,,"WASHINGTON — Former President Barack Obama and Vice President Kamala Harris have been in close touch since she announced her presidential candidacy Sunday, having multiple conversations this week as she kicks off her campaign, according to four people familiar with their discussions.
Obama privately has fully supported Harris’ candidacy and plans to endorse her soon, these people said. 
""He has been in regular contact with her and thinks she's been off to a great start,"" one of them said.
Obama is one of the only high-profile Democrats in the country who has yet to endorse Harris. While other party leaders have stepped forward to publicly back her, he has so far kept his support private.
The people familiar with the discussions didn’t know the precise timing of his endorsement. One of them said Obama didn’t want it to overshadow President Joe Biden’s moment, particularly his Oval Office address to the nation Wednesday night. 
Another person familiar with the discussions said Obama and Harris, who is seeking to maintain the momentum her campaign has enjoyed among Democrats since she entered the race, wanted his endorsement to stand as its own moment.
Aides to Obama and Harris also have discussed arranging for the two of them to appear together on the campaign trail, though no date has been set, three of the people familiar with the discussions said. 
Michelle Obama also supports Harris’ candidacy, two people familiar with the matter said.
""President Obama looks forward to helping Democrats up and down the ballot make the case to voters this fall,"" said Eric Schultz, a senior adviser to Obama. ""Our strategy will be based on driving impact, especially where and when his voice can move the needle.""
During their conversations in recent days, Obama has offered Harris his counsel on setting up a campaign and on other aspects of mounting a successful bid for the White House, which he has done twice, the people familiar with their discussions said.
From Obama’s perspective, Harris has taken on a lot in a very short time, and he sees himself as a resource and a sounding board for her as she navigates a high-stakes campaign with about just 100 days until Election Day, according to two of the people familiar with their discussions. 
Obama views his utility in the campaign as helping unify his party and moving Democrats forward, and he's expected to be a fixture on the campaign trail this fall.
The only publicly known phone call between Obama and Harris took place Sunday, when Biden announced he was ending his re-election campaign and swiftly endorsed Harris.
Obama issued a statement Sunday praising Biden and supporting a process to select a new Democratic nominee, but he didn't endorse Harris.
""We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead,"" Obama said in the statement. ""But I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges.""
Harris then quickly received endorsements from across the country, and no one has stepped up to challenge her for the nomination.
Since Biden’s June 27 debate performance, Obama had privately expressed concerns about his former vice president’s ability to defeat former President Donald Trump in November, NBC News has reported. He didn't publicly or privately urge Biden to remain in the race, though he defended his debate performance by writing on X that he understood what it was like to have a poor presidential debate.
Obama and Harris have known each other for years. She was an early supporter of his 2008 campaign and was given a speaking role at his 2012 nominating convention. Obama campaigned for Harris when she was running for attorney general in California and supported her when she ran for the Senate in 2016.Carol E. Lee is the Washington managing editor.

The task force will investigate federal, state and local law enforcement and agency actions in the lead-up to the attempt on Trump's life on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania. Four hundred-sixteen members voted in favor of the resolution, and 16 members did not vote. 
Seven Republicans and six Democrats will serve on the committee, House party leaders said in a statement.
The resolution text said the task force must issue a final report to the House by Dec. 13, noting that it should include ""any recommendations for legislative reforms necessary to prevent future security lapses.""
In a statement after the vote, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said that “protecting the safety and security of our nation’s leaders is a responsibility that transcends party lines.”
Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., announced their intention Tuesday to create the task force, which will have subpoena authority. 
Johnson and Jeffries said the task force would seek to understand what went wrong, ensure accountability and prevent a similar failure. 
""The security failures that allowed an assassination attempt on Donald Trump’s life are shocking,"" the pair said in a statement Tuesday.
Outside of the task force plans, the Department of Homeland Security has opened reviews into three aspects of Secret Service planning and preparedness related to the shooting.
Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned Tuesday, just a day after her testimony before the House Oversight Committee was panned by members of both parties who said she appeared unprepared for their questions.
A gunman opened fire just minutes into Trump's rally in Butler, killing a rallygoer and injuring two others. Trump was shot in the ear.
The shooter has been identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20. The Secret Service killed him as the attack unfolded.
NBC News has reported that Crooks was identified as a suspicious person one hour before the shooting, according to sources. NBC News also reported that Crooks flew a drone over the venue in the hours before the attack.Megan Lebowitz is a politics reporter for NBC News.

State police said they were investigating the “untimely death” of Linda Kosuda-Bigazzi after being called to her Burlington home for a welfare check shortly after 10:30 a.m. The cause of her death was under investigation, and police and her lawyer did not disclose any further details.
Kosuda-Bigazzi had been scheduled under a plea deal to be sentenced at 2 p.m. Wednesday in Hartford Superior Court to 13 years in prison for the 2017 death of her husband, Dr. Pierluigi Bigazzi, 84.
Her lawyer, Patrick Tomasiewicz, said her death was unexpected.
“We were honored to be her legal counsel and did our very best to defend her in a complex case for the past six years,” he said in a statement. “She was a very independent woman who was always in control of her own destiny.”
Police said Kosuda-Bigazzi wrote that she and her husband got into a fight after she told him repairs were needed to their home’s backyard deck. She wrote that he came at her with a hammer and she managed to wrestle it away from him during a lengthy struggle, authorities said.
“I hit him just swinging the hammer in any direction + then he was quiet — for a few seconds + then he stopped breathing,” she wrote, according to investigators. “I just wanted to slow him down. I sat on the floor by the kitchen cabinets across from the stove — next to him for a long time.”
State troopers found her husband’s body in their basement in February 2018 during a wellness check requested by UConn Health staff. It was wrapped in plastic and showed an advanced stage of decomposition, authorities said. The medical examiner said he had died from blunt trauma to his head.
Investigators have said they believe Pierluigi Bigazzi died sometime in July 2017 and that his UConn Health paychecks continued to be deposited into the couple’s joint checking account until his body was found.
An internal investigation by UConn resulted in the disciplining of a school medical official who was supposed to monitor Pierluigi Bigazzi’s work but had no contact with him in the months before his body was found.The Associated Press"
NBC_15,Elon Musk's X boosts conspiracy theories that Biden is dead or dying,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/joe-biden-dead-dying-covid-vegas-theory-musk-x-elon-rcna163248,2024-07-25 09:00:02.702650,,"Elon Musk’s X app boosted wild conspiracy theories this week that President Joe Biden had an undisclosed medical emergency and might be dying, despite a lack of evidence to support the claims. And it continued doing so even after Biden walked before news cameras Tuesday and appeared healthy. 
Biden addressed the nation in a broadcast from the Oval Office on Wednesday evening. He also was heard speaking by phone at an event Monday before reporters saw him in person Tuesday.
But earlier in the week, X created two special “trending” pages dedicated to what it said were “Biden’s Vegas Health Scare” and “Biden’s Vegas Emergency: Mystery Unfolds.” Biden was in Las Vegas on July 17 when he tested positive for Covid-19, but the trending pages are filled with speculation unrelated to Covid-19, including false assertions by users that he had been murdered or would be murdered soon by unseen forces. 
Baseless speculation that Biden had died started gathering popularity in conservative media shortly after he announced Sunday on X and other social media platforms that he was withdrawing from the presidential race and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris. 
Dana Perino, a Fox News co-host, said on the air Sunday, “Proof of life, please,” and right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones got more than 7 million views on a 7-minute video he posted Monday titled “Is Joe Biden Dead?” 
PeakMetrics, a research company, said the number of posts on X discussing Biden’s dying or experiencing a serious medical emergency spiked from about 29,000 Sunday to about 120,000 Monday and 176,000 Tuesday. Similar spikes occurred after Biden’s poor debate performance in June and after a widely criticized TV interview June 5, according to PeakMetrics. 
Searches by NBC News for similar content on other social media apps, including Instagram and TikTok, returned mostly debunkings of the rumors. 
X went beyond just hosting the conspiracy theories. An NBC News employee received notifications within X recommending posts to her with similarly dark messages. One recommended post by Laura Loomer, a far-right activist who was once banned from X, said without other evidence that based on a “medical source,” Biden was “in the terminal stage of his illness.” Her post got more than 13 million views. A second recommended post came from Ryan Fournier, chair of Students for Trump, who said Monday he was “hearing” that Biden “is in hospice care and unlikely to survive the night.” He did not cite his sources. His post got more than 7 million views. It is unknown whether other X users received the same recommendations. 
Musk, X’s owner, endorsed former President Donald Trump for president on July 13. 
Representatives for X did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday and Wednesday. Neither did the White House on Wednesday. 
X has created some form of curated trending pages since 2015, when it was known as Twitter, to help users navigate the flood of posts that can accompany popular narratives. In the past, Twitter employed people to ensure that trending pages had context from reliable news sources, but that changed when Musk bought it in 2022 and laid off the workers who were responsible for curating trending content. Now, the trending page includes summaries from X’s artificial intelligence software, Grok, and it includes the warning: “Grok can make mistakes, verify its outputs.” It is not clear whether or how often human X employees are involved.
The company separately faces accusations that it improperly prevented users from following one of Harris’ official presidential campaign accounts. Some users complained Sunday that they got an error message when they tried to follow the “Kamala HQ” account, Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said in a letter sent Monday to House Republicans seeking an investigation. The company has not responded to those accusations. 
Alice Marwick, an associate professor of communication at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said she saw X’s promotion of the posts with conspiracy theories as evidence that it had changed to fit Musk’s views. 
“X is hardly a neutral platform,” she said. “Elon Musk clearly has a deep, vested interest in a Trump victory in the 2024 election, and he’s using what’s at his disposal to do so, which is the social media platform that he controls.” 
Fournier, Jones and Loomer did not respond to requests for comment. Fox News also did not respond. 
Jones in particular has faced consequences for past conspiracy theories. He is liquidating assets to pay a $1.5 billion defamation judgment to the families of the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, which he called a hoax. 
Biden largely kept out of public view for six days while he was recovering from Covid-19. After the diagnosis, he cut short a campaign stop in Las Vegas to fly to his house in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. Without appearing in public, he made the historic announcement Sunday on social media that he was withdrawing from the presidential race and endorsing Harris to succeed him. 
Biden’s physician, Kevin O’Connor, said Tuesday that Biden’s Covid-19 symptoms had resolved and that over the course of the infection, he never had a fever or showed abnormal vital signs. Biden returned to the White House on Tuesday, arriving by motorcade and walking into the residence. 
But on X, conspiracy theorists twisted his bout with Covid-19 into dark theories. 
Radio host Charlie Kirk, the founder of the conservative group Turning Point USA, helped fuel the speculation with a post on X on Monday morning saying he had received “a weird lead on a story that people should look into.” He said that a source close to Las Vegas police was suspicious because, while Biden was in town, police at one point received instructions to help transport him to a local hospital but that then the plans changed and Biden went to the airport, instead, to fly out. Kirk cited the “rumor mill in the police department” to speculate that Biden’s health was worse than reported. 
But the change of plans last week did not seem suspicious to the Las Vegas hospital where Biden was almost taken, University Medical Center of Southern Nevada. 
Scott Kerbs, the medical center’s public relations director, said in an email that last Wednesday afternoon, staff members were told to prepare “for a potential medical visit from the president.” The center is Nevada’s only Level I trauma center, meaning it is generally tasked with caring for the president during official visits, he said.
“Our team was not shocked by this situation. We saw it as a precautionary measure,” he said. “Our team always works closely with the White House and U.S. Secret Service prior to and during these visits to ensure we remain prepared to care for the president. We always stand ready until Air Force One departs Las Vegas.” 
The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department confirmed in a statement to NBC News that it initially shut down roads leading to the hospital and then got word from the Secret Service that Biden was going directly to the airport. 
Kirk did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. 
Billionaire financier Bill Ackman, who has endorsed Trump, also spread doubt about Biden’s health, writing on X that “the president may be severely ill.” Ackman also shared a Substack post saying Biden “suffered an undisclosed medical emergency”; the Substack post alleged that Biden’s departure from Las Vegas was too chaotic to have been caused by a Covid-19 positive test, but it offered no other evidence of illness. Ackman’s hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, declined to comment. 
After Biden called in by telephone to an event with Harris on Monday, some accounts on X spread the idea that his voice had been faked by artificial intelligence. One video post with the claim, which had more than 7 million views, used AI software from the company ElevenLabs, but even after ElevenLabs denounced the video as a “fake” that was “fabricated to cause confusion,” the original post remained online and continued to gain views. David Ingram is a tech reporter for NBC News."
NBC_16,Yellowstone closes Biscuit Basin for the season after hydrothermal explosion,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/yellowstone-closes-biscuit-basin-season-hydrothermal-explosion-rcna163564,2024-07-25 08:00:02.702650,,"An area of Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming where a hydrothermal explosion launched steam and debris into the air Tuesday will be closed for the rest of the season because more blasts may occur, officials said.
No one was hurt in the blast at around 10 a.m. Tuesday in Biscuit Basin, 2 miles northwest of Old Faithful. Video showed some visitors running after the explosion.
The hydrothermal explosion was caused by “water suddenly transitioning to steam in the shallow hydrothermal system beneath Black Diamond Pool,” the U.S. Geological Survey said.
“Given the recent changes to the hydrothermal plumbing system, small explosions of boiling water from this area in Biscuit Basin continue to be possible over the coming days to months,” the USGS said in a statement.
Biscuit Basin will be closed for the rest of the 2024 season as a result, the park said. The Grand Loop Road remains open to vehicles and other thermal basins in the area are also open.
The geyser was hundreds of feet high, and rocks the size of grapefruit were found as far as hundreds of feet away, officials said. A boardwalk was also destroyed. 
""Some blocks closest to the explosion site are about 3 feet (1 meter) wide and weigh hundreds of pounds,"" the USGS statement said.
Hydrothermal explosions are relatively common on Yellowstone National Park, which is known for its hot springs and other thermal features, officials said.
Hydrothermal explosions happen in the park a few times a year, the USGS said, although often they happen in remote backcountry areas.Phil Helsel is a reporter for NBC News."
NBC_17,Trump turns his focus to Harris at his first rally after Biden's exit from the 2024 race,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-turns-focus-harris-first-rally-bidens-exit-2024-race-rcna163496,2024-07-25 09:00:02.702650,,"Donald Trump, speaking at his first campaign rally since President Joe Biden ended his re-election bid, redirected a torrent of attacks Wednesday at the de facto Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.
“As you know, three days ago, we officially defeated the worst president in the history of our country, Joe Biden,” Trump told his crowd in Charlotte, North Carolina. “So now we have a new victim to defeat: lyin’ Kamala Harris … the most incompetent and far-left vice president in American history.”
Trump acknowledged at the top of his 90-minute speech that he was leaving behind the sunnier persona and themes of unity that he and other Republicans had suggested they would stick to after he survived an assassination attempt July 13. He repeatedly mispronounced Harris’ first name and at one point, using the catchphrase from his old NBC reality show “The Apprentice,” declared: “Kamala, you’re fired!”
“You know, I was supposed to be nice,” he said. “They say something happened to me when I got shot; I became nice. And when you’re dealing with these people, they’re very dangerous people — when you’re dealing with them, you can’t be too nice. You really can’t be. So if you don’t mind, I’m not going to be nice.”
The audience did not mind, cheering loudly, and for the next hour-plus, Trump was unsparing in his criticism of Harris’ long career in public service. 
Trump mocked Harris for failing the bar exam on her first try. He targeted her work as San Francisco’s district attorney, arguing that she made the city worse, even though the good old days he recalled there came during Harris’ tenure, from 2004 to 2011.
“San Francisco, 20 years ago, was the greatest city in our country,” Trump said. “Today, it’s not a livable city.”
In a statement, Harris campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said: “Unity is over for Donald Trump — he is back with an unhinged, weird, and rambling speech complete with praise for the ‘late great’ Hannibal Lecter.”
Trump ran down a list of the progressive policy proposals, such as expanded health care coverage, that Harris advocated for as a senator from California and in her last presidential campaign, which ended before the 2020 primaries began. He placed her to the political left of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the democratic socialist who also ran for president that year.
“So if you want socialist health care, nation-wrecking inflation, the death of American energy and a lying radical left liberal San Francisco extremist as your commander in chief, then Kamala Harris is your candidate,” Trump said. “She’s the one for you.”
Trump also advanced a central GOP accusation against Harris — that she failed as a “border czar” after Biden tasked her with leading the administration’s efforts to address causes of migration from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Because of the assignment, Republicans have tied Harris to illegal border crossings. 
“No person who deliberately lets these kinds of savage criminals into America should ever be trusted with power again, should ever be trusted to be the president of our country,” Trump said. 
At one point, Trump invited Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, a labor union representing U.S. Border Patrol agents, to speak. Judd criticized Harris, saying she “refused to implement” policies that he recommended.
“This is the man for the presidency,” Judd said of Trump. 
Trump, forced to tailor his campaign strategy to a new opponent, rarely mentioned Biden. He argued that Democrats had staged an affront to democracy by dumping Biden after the primaries were over because they were worried about his poll numbers. Trump, who faces criminal charges in two jurisdictions over allegations he illegally tried to overturn the 2020 election results, also accused Harris of knowing more about Biden’s health than she let on publicly.
“Now, if we start beating her in the polls by 10 or 15 points, are they going to bring in a third candidate?” Trump wondered. “It’s like, you know, ‘Trump is killing this guy, all right, out! Let’s bring in a new one.’” 
Trump also wrestled with what has become Harris’ central pitch: that the campaign is now between a prosecutor and someone who was found guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.
“Their campaign says, ‘I’m the prosecutor and he is the convicted felon.’ That’s their campaign,” Trump said. “I don’t think people are going to buy it.”Henry J. Gomez is a senior national political reporter for NBC News"
NBC_18,"Two more troopers tied to Karen Read case are under internal investigation, authorities say",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/karen-read-murder-trial-troopers-investigation-rcna163562,2024-07-25 08:00:02.702650,,"Two more Massachusetts state troopers linked to the Karen Read case are under an internal affairs investigation after her trial, which included allegations of a law enforcement effort to frame Read in the killing of her police officer boyfriend, ended with a hung jury this month, authorities said Wednesday. 
The troopers, Detective Lt. Brian Tully and Sgt. Yuri Bukhenik, will remain on active duty during the investigation, a spokesperson for the Massachusetts State Police said. 
A third trooper who is also under investigation, Michael Proctor, was suspended without pay this month after a three-member panel made the recommendation following a duty status hearing.
The agency spokesperson would not provide additional details about the investigations into Tully and Bukhenik. 
The interim state police superintendent, Col. John Mawn, has said the agency was reviewing allegations of “serious misconduct” raised at Read’s trial about Proctor, the lead investigator in the case.
Tully supervised the detective unit at the Norfolk County District Attorney’s Office, where Proctor worked. 
At trial, Proctor admitted sending offensive text messages about Read to a group that included Bukhenik. In the messages, Proctor testified, he used a pejorative term for intellectually disabled people to describe Read.
Proctor also admitted to saying on the thread that he was searching Read’s phone and had found “no nudes so far.”
Proctor, who described the messages as “poor jokes” that were “regrettable” and “unprofessional,” said he was not reprimanded for the texts.
Proctor has not responded to repeated requests for comment. He was relieved of duty in the prosecutor’s office after a judge declared a mistrial in Read’s case.
Bukhenik did not respond to a message seeking comment left at a phone number listed under his name. Efforts to reach Tully were unsuccessful.
The mistrial in Read's murder trial was declared after nine weeks of testimony, dozens of witnesses and five days of deliberations. Prosecutors charged her with second-degree murder and other crimes in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O’Keefe, on Jan. 29, 2022.
Authorities alleged that during a tumultuous relationship, Read backed her Lexus SUV into O’Keefe, 46, and left him for dead outside the home of another Boston police officer, Brian Albert.
Lawyers for Read alleged that there had most likely been a fight during a party at Albert’s home that left O’Keefe dead. The defense pointed to Albert and another law enforcement officer whom they said Read “ghosted” after she traded flirty texts with him as the possible assailants. 
Albert testified that O’Keefe never stepped foot inside his house during the party. He would have been “welcomed with open arms” if he had, Albert testified.
After the judge declared a mistrial, prosecutors vowed to retry the case. On Monday, a judge scheduled a new trial for Jan. 27. Tim Stelloh is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital."
NBC_19,"The NBA on NBC theme song, 'Roundball Rock,' set to return in 2025",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/nba-nbc-theme-song-roundball-rock-set-return-2025-rcna163545,2024-07-25 08:00:02.702650,,"The red light on John Tesh’s answering machine was blinking. With the press of a button, a cassette tape began to roll and a message that would go on to change his life started to play.
It was from himself.   
“Hi, this is a message for me about the NBA theme,” Tesh said on his answering machine while calling his house in 1989. “Here’s an idea. It goes like this: “Bada-da-da-da-da—da—da…”
That melody went from his answering machine to television screens across the world, before permanently settling in the hearts and minds of many basketball fans as the anthem of the sport.
It was the origin of the song “Roundball Rock,” which Tesh estimates was played 12,000 times during game coverage as the NBA on NBC theme from 1990 to 2002.
The song is now set to make a comeback in 2025, with NBC announcing an 11-year media rights deal with the NBA on Wednesday.
NBA fans rejoiced on social media when the news was confirmed, celebrating the return of a song Tesh first came up with while he was asleep in another country.
The host of “Entertainment Tonight” at the time, Tesh had taken a month off from the show to cover the Tour de France. 
There, he learned NBC was looking for a theme for its NBA coverage, having recently acquired the broadcast rights from CBS. A lifelong musician who already had composed themes for the NFL, Tour de France and other sports, he immediately began stringing notes together.
“I was trying to put ideas into my subconscious brain,” Tesh, 71, told NBC during a recent phone interview. “What would a basketball theme sound like?”
He first heard that sound at 2 a.m., the future song waking him like the music of an alarm clock. He refused to hit the snooze.
“I knew if I went back to sleep, the theme would be gone, the idea would be gone,” he said. “There was no keyboard, no tape recorder, no cell phones. So, I called my answering machine and left a message for myself.”
Tesh entered an airport sports bar in Atlanta and took a seat shortly before opening tip. The Los Angeles Lakers were playing the host San Antonio Spurs in NBC’s first NBA broadcast of the season on Nov. 3, 1990.
More than a year prior, Tesh had returned home, retrieved his message and reported to the studio.
“I don’t know how many were sending theme ideas, but I wanted to be the first one in,” he said.  
Tesh assembled a full orchestra to complement the song’s piano, bass, drums, and guitar. He increased the pace of the song to around 120 beats a minute to match the average dribble rate of a basketball fast break. He added a musical bed that played beneath dramatic pregame montage narrations by Marv Albert and Bob Costas.
He conducted the soundtrack to the careers of Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Shaquille O’Neal, and other NBA stars of the era.       
“I knew you needed a fanfare, then you needed a second movement and then you needed a bed without any melody in it where Marv Albert could talk about this and that,” Tesh said.
He sent the theme to NBC executives, not as a demo, but as a finished product. It arrived not on cassette, but on a VHS tape, with the song played over highlights of the 1988 NBA Finals.
“I took any problem with imagination out of the mix so they could actually see it fully formed,” Tesh said. “When I got the call, it was like, ‘Hey, this works!’ I don’t even think I was competing with anybody. This was the first thing they saw.”
Now it was time for basketball fans to see it.
Tesh watched from the crowded bar as the intro to the game began. Narrated by Albert, the pregame montage mixed highlights and interviews with Lakers star Magic Johnson and Spurs center David Robinson.
“The Lakers have brought their Magic to Mr. Robinson’s neighborhood,” Albert said before the video faded to black.
Colorful lasers then etched the outline of NBC’s Peacock logo as Tesh’s theme began, its trumpeted opening and timpani roll giving way to the now very familiar orchestral melody of “Bada-da-da-da-da—da—da…”
“I motioned for the bartender to come over and I said, ‘Hey, you hear that? And he goes, ‘What?’ I said, ‘That song.’ He goes, ‘Yeah.’ I said, ‘That’s my song. I wrote that.’ And he says, ‘Great. Can I get you another beer?’ I was the only one in the place who was actually excited about what was going on.”
Tesh said the theme’s popularity surged after the NBA on NBC era, like a former chart topper that’s most appreciated years later when it evokes nostalgia.  
“Not until it left NBC and people started learning how to play it on YouTube did it become sort of the theme for the halcyon days of basketball,” he said. “It became what it is after it was on the air.”
Tesh was at a restaurant in Los Angeles in 2013 when his cellphone began to light up with text messages and phone calls.  
“I went to the bathroom and looked at my phone, my friend is saying, ‘Are you OK with this? Oh, my God. I’m so sorry.’ Stuff like that,” he said.
John Tesh and “Roundball Rock” had just been parodied on “Saturday Night Live.”
Jason Sudeikis played Tesh, dressed in his concert attire, and Tim Robinson played Tesh’s fictional brother, Dave. The duo pitched the theme to NBC executives played by Vince Vaughn, Kenan Thompson and Kate McKinnon — unofficially adding lyrics to the song.
“Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-basketball, gimme gimme gimme the ball, ‘cause I’m gonna DUNK IT!” Robinson sang while Sudeikis emphatically played the keyboard.
“I watched it with my wife, and I was going, ‘This is the coolest thing that could ever possibly happen to me!’” Tesh said. “People believe I have a brother named Dave, which I don’t. I don’t have a brother at all. But now the song has words: ‘Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-basketball…”
The sketch — along with “Roundball Rock” having its own Wikipedia page — was evidence of the staying power, mainstream crossover and endless relevance of a theme that had not been on the air regularly in more than a decade.
The theme did return to basketball broadcasts in 2019 when FOX acquired the rights from Tesh for its college basketball games. 
“(But) I got all these complaints from people who were like, ‘This is not right! This shouldn’t be on college basketball. Take it off! This is for the NBA!’” Tesh said. “I got into one of those Reddit threads and I said, ‘Hey, pardon me, but I’ve got some grandkids I’d like to buy birthday presents for.’”
The phone rang again recently, but this time, it wasn’t Tesh calling himself. It was NBC.
He was asked if the network could use the theme for basketball coverage during the 2024 Paris Olympics, as the network had done for previous Games. The call came amid the NBA broadcast rights negotiations, which sparked speculation about a potential return to NBC.   
“The guy who called me said, ‘Hey, we don’t know what’s going to happen with the rights, but are you free and clear if we want to use the theme?’” Tesh said. “So, we stand at the ready. We’d love to be a part of coming back home to NBC.”
Tesh, who continues to do concert tours and host his internationally syndicated radio show, recently went to Nashville to re-record the theme.
“We’re going to do the original version just with a larger orchestra,” he said, “cause if we change one note, people will kill me.”
The latest recording will come roughly 35 years after the first version was taped on an answering machine. It marked Tesh’s debut performance of a theme that would become the musical accompaniment to championship three-peats by both Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, and many of the NBA’s most memorable moments in between.  
“Ever since that one answering machine message struck gold, I’ve been singing melodies into recording devices, which now include my smartphone. But it’s just not the same,” Tesh said. “There was something magical about that goofy little cassette tape in the answering machine.”"

“Melania” will be released by Skyhorse Publishing, which has published such Donald Trump supporters as former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and attorney Alan Dershowitz. Skyhorse also has worked with third-party candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and former Trump insider Michael Cohen, who later became one of his harshest critics. Some Skyhorse books include forewords by Trump ally Steve Bannon.
Melania Trump’s memoir was announced Thursday by her office, which neither provided a specific release date nor mentioned whether it would come out before Election Day in November. Trump has been the subject of other books, including one by former adviser Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, but she has never told her own story at length before.
The former first lady “invites readers into her world, offering an intimate portrait of a woman who has lived an extraordinary life,” the announcement reads in part. “‘Melania’ includes personal stories and family photos she has never before shared with the public.”
A spokesperson said no information was available beyond what was included in the release, which made no reference to financial terms, promotional plans or if she worked with a co-author.
Melania Trump, Donald Trump’s third wife, has been an enigmatic figure since her husband announced he was running in the 2016 election. She has sought to maintain her privacy even as she served as first lady, focusing on raising their son, Barron, and promoting her “Be Best” initiative to support the “social, emotional, and physical health of children.” While she appeared at her husband’s campaign launch event for 2024 and attended the closing night of last week’s Republican National Convention, she has otherwise stayed off the campaign trail. Her decision not to deliver a speech at this year’s convention marked a departure from tradition for candidates’ wives, and from the 2016 and 2020 Republican gatherings.
According to her office, the memoir will come in two versions: a $150 “Collector’s Edition,” 256 pages, “in full color throughout, with each copy signed by the author,” and a “Memoir Edition,” 304 pages, including 48 pages of never-before-seen photographs. The book is listed at $40, with signed editions going for $75.
Both editions are available for pre-order exclusively through the first lady’s web site, MelaniaTrump.com. A spokesperson did not have any immediate comment on when or whether it could be ordered elsewhere.
Unlike other former presidents and first ladies, Donald and Melania Trump have not released any post-White House books through mainstream New York publishers. Donald Trump published numerous books before his presidency, working with Random House and Simon & Schuster among others, but many shunned him after the siege of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
He has released two books since leaving Washington, a picture book commemorating his time at the White House and a compilation of letters from world leaders and celebrities. Both came out through Winning Team Publishing, co-founded in 2021 by Donald Trump Jr. and former Trump campaign staffer Sergio Gor.The Associated Press"

Team USA came into this final match of pool play at Stade de France with a loss to Fiji and draw against France on its resume, forcing the Eagles to win to guarantee advancement.
The American took an opening possession 7-0 edge before Uruguay responded with consecutive tries as Los Teros held a 12-7 lead and seemingly all the momentum late in the first half.
Follow along with live coverage of the Olympics 
But in the dying moments before intermission, a key defensive stand   and a Baker try just before the whistle gave Team USA a 14-12 lead it  would never relinquish. Team USA outscored Uruguay, 19-5, in the second half.
“Yeah, we talk about it all the time, the two minutes before half and two minutes after half (are) the most important minutes of the game,” forward Aaron Cummings said.
“If you can get a score or pull down a score during those two minutes, then you’ll probably be in a good spot to win the game.” 
Baker insisted his team still hasn’t shown its full potential yet.
""Even the first game against France, we didn't really get to show who we were either,"" he said. ""It was all about the fight and defense.  We just know we got to get the ball, score and protect it and just keep it."" 
Lucas Lacamp also scored a try for the Americans while Stephen Tomasin connected on all four of his conversion attempts.
Baltazar Amaya's two tries and Bautista Basso's one try paced Uruguay's attack. 
Both the United States and France, which lost to Fiji after the American victory over Uruguay, advanced out of group play. 
While the Eagles and Les Bleus finished with the same 1-1-1 record, France was deemed to be the second-place team based on point differential.
The top two teams of each of the three groups advance to the quarterfinals along with two third-place sides.

NBC_22,Georgia to allow state funding for AP Black studies course following outrage,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/georgia-allow-state-funding-ap-black-studies-course-outrage-rcna163601,2024-07-25 22:24:02.733472,,"Georgia's Superintendent of Schools seemingly reversed course Wednesday following backlash over the state's refusal to provide funding for a new Advanced Placement class in African American Studies.
In a statement, Richard Woods said that the state will provide funding to districts that use a course code that has been in the catalog of state-funded courses since 2020. 
""Districts using this course code will receive state funding,"" he said. ""Should districts choose to do so, they may teach some or all of the standards in the AP African American Studies course using this code (and students may take the associated AP exam)."" 
The course previously did not qualify for Advanced Placement (AP) credit.
Woods' remarks followed complaints from advocates who said that the state's refusal to fund an AP course would suppress teaching about Black history. Florida and Arkansas have adopted similar restrictions on courses in AP African American Studies. 
State Rep. Jasmine Clark, a Democrat from Lilburn, who had called out Woods, said Thursday that his ""reversal, on principle, is great, and honors the fact that this course should have never been on the chopping block in the first place.""
She said allowing districts to use an already-existing course code is a ""workaround solution."" 
""I am meeting with the [Department of Education] this morning to confirm that with this workaround, students taking this course will receive the same GPA quality points as their peers in other AP courses. Since this course is a college-level course, there must be parity between this course and all other AP offerings,"" she said.
The State Board of Education, appointed by the governor, has to approve a class before it can be eligible for state funding, which helps pay for class materials and a teacher’s salary. Woods had decided he wouldn’t recommend approval of the class to the board but did not say why. 
In his statement Wednesday, Woods said when he reviewed the course he ""had concerns about the state endorsing the totality"" of it. 
""It’s my position that districts should use the existing course code — which offers them the flexibility to develop their own curriculum based on local priorities, or to use standards from the AP course if they choose and in consultation with their communities,"" he said. 
During the 2023-2024 academic year, 33 Georgia schools piloted an African American Studies course, said Sara Sympson, a spokesperson for the College Board, a nonprofit testing entity.
Advanced Placement courses are offered by the College Board across the academic spectrum, including in math, science, social studies, foreign languages and fine arts. The courses are optional and taught at a college level, allowing students who score well on a final exam to earn college credit while still in high school.Minyvonne Burke is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News.

NBC_23,Russian and Chinese nuclear-capable bombers patrol near United States,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/russia-china-nuclear-capable-bombers-patrol-united-states-rcna163611,2024-07-25 22:03:02.733472,,"Russian and Chinese nuclear-capable strategic bombers patrolled near the U.S. state of Alaska in the North Pacific and Arctic on Thursday, the two countries said, a move that prompted the United States and Canada to scramble fighter jets.
Russian Tu-95MS “Bear” strategic bombers and Chinese Xi’an H-6 strategic bombers took part in patrols over the Chukchi and Bering seas and the North Pacific, Russia’s defense ministry said.
“During the flight, Russian and Chinese crews cooperated in the new area of joint operations during all stages of the air patrol,” the Russian ministry said in a statement.
“At some stages of the route, the air group was accompanied by fighters from foreign countries,” it said.
On the five-hour flight, the Russian and Chinese bombers were escorted by Russian Sukhoi Su-30SM and Su-35S fighters. No foreign airspace was violated, Russia said.
The U.S. military’s North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) said that U.S. and Canadian fighter jets had intercepted the Russian and People’s Republic of China (PRC) aircraft in the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ).
“The Russian and PRC aircraft remained in international airspace and did not enter American or Canadian sovereign airspace,” NORAD said.
“This Russian and PRC activity in the Alaska ADIZ is not seen as a threat, and NORAD will continue to monitor competitor activity near North America and meet presence with presence.”

NBC_24,Biden and Harris to meet separately with Netanyahu at the White House,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-harris-meet-separately-netanyahu-white-house-rcna163590,2024-07-25 22:42:02.733472,,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are scheduled to meet separately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Thursday amid the 2024 election race shakeup and as the administration still pushes for a cease-fire agreement. 
Biden will host Netanyahu in the Oval Office at around 1 p.m. ET, and the two leaders are scheduled to meet with families of American hostages held hostage in Gaza around 2:30 p.m. in the White House Cabinet Room. 
This will be the first time the two will meet in person since Biden visited Israel shortly after Hamas' terrorist attack on Oct. 7. 
Harris will speak with Netanyahu around 4:30 p.m. in the vice president's ceremonial office, a meeting that is considered even more high-stakes now that she's running for president following Biden's decision to withdraw from the race. Harris missed Netanyahu's speech before a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday because of a previously scheduled event in Indianapolis. Typically, the vice president presides over joint addresses. 
A senior administration official told reporters Wednesday that Biden will discuss his ""ironclad commitment to Israel's security, the very serious threats from Iran and from Iranian proxy and terrorist groups, including Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis.""
The official said the two leaders are expected to speak ""in depth"" about developments in Gaza, including efforts to reach a cease-fire agreement and the humanitarian crisis. The administration believes that a deal ""is in the closing stages and it’s reaching a point that we believe a deal is closable, and it’s time to move to close that agreement,"" the official said. 
For her part, Harris has been engaged on the Israel-Gaza conflict for the last 10 months, the official said, including participating in every call with Netanyahu as well as critical meetings like those with hostage families. 
An aide to Harris said the vice president will continue her intensive engagement on Gaza during the meeting, underscore Israel’s need to defend itself, and condemn the Oct. 7 attack. 
Harris will convey her view that it’s time for the war to end in a way that will keep Israel secure, release all hostages, end the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, and allow the Palestinian people to enjoy their right to dignity, freedom, and self-determination, the aide said. They will also discuss efforts to reach agreement on the cease-fire deal. 
In his speech before Congress, Israel's prime minister thanked Biden ""for his tireless efforts on behalf of the hostages and for his efforts to the hostage families as well.""
""There will obviously be no daylight between the president and the vice president,"" the official said, adding they expect for a productive day because the Israelis will be at the White House for a while on Thursday. 
Netanyahu also thanked Biden for his leadership in his speech. 
""I thank President Biden for his heartfelt support for Israel after the savage attack on Oct. 7th,"" Netanyahu said. ""He rightly called Hamas 'sheer evil.' He dispatched two aircraft carriers to the Middle East to deter a wider war. And he came to Israel to stand with us during our darkest hour — a visit that will never be forgotten.""
""President Biden and I have known each other for over 40 years,"" he continued. ""I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel and for being, as he says, a proud Zionist. Actually, he says, a proud Irish American Zionist.""
Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with former President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Friday.Rebecca Shabad is a politics reporter for NBC News based in Washington.

NBC_25,Jennifer Aniston slams JD Vance over 'childless cat ladies' comment from resurfaced interview,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jennifer-aniston-slams-jd-vance-childless-cat-ladies-comment-resurface-rcna163633,2024-07-26 00:00:02.777714,,"Actor Jennifer Aniston, who has been open about her fertility struggles, slammed Sen. JD Vance over a resurfaced 2021 interview in which he said the United States was being run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies.”
“I truly can’t believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States,” Aniston wrote Wednesday in an Instagram story, including a clip of Vance’s comments.
The interview gained fresh traction this week after it was posted on X, days after former President Donald Trump announced that the Republican senator from Ohio would be his vice presidential running mate.
During a 2021 appearance on Tucker Carlson’s former Fox News show, Vance said that the country was being led “by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made.”
“So they want to make the rest of the country miserable too,” Vance continued. “And it’s just a basic fact. If you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?”
Harris, who has two stepchildren, is now running for president after President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race. Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, has adopted twins.
Vance went on to say in the clip that he believes people “who go home at night and see the face of a smiling kid, whatever their profession, I think they’re happier, I think they’re healthier, and they’re going to be better prepared to actually lead this country.” 
Aniston also called out Vance over his far-right stance on reproductive rights.
“All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,” Aniston wrote. “I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.”
The actor told Allure in 2022 that she tried to get pregnant for many years but “it was a challenging road” for her.
“I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it,” she said. “I was throwing everything at it. I would’ve given anything if someone had said to me, ‘Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.’ You just don’t think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.”
Aniston, 55, said the constant media scrutiny and false claims that she didn’t want children because she was “selfish” were hurtful.
Harris’ stepdaughter, Ella Emhoff, on Thursday also pushed back at Vance's comments from the 2021 interview.
“How can you be ‘childless’ when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I,” Emhoff wrote in a post on Instagram this morning, referring to her brother and Harris’ other stepchild, Cole Emhoff.
Emhoff also praised a statement by her biological mother, second gentleman Doug Emhoff’s ex-wife, Kerstin Emhoff, who defended Harris against “baseless attacks” and praised her for being a “loving, nurturing, fiercely protective” stepmother to her children for more than 10 years.
While Aniston did not officially back Harris, the Instagram post comes as many in Hollywood have begun publicly broadcasting their enthusiasm for the vice president’s campaign.
Josh Gad, Sheryl Lee Ralph, Barbra Streisand and Kerry Washington were among the flood of actors to voice their support. A handful of artists, including Lil Nas X and John Legend, also shared posts on social media backing Harris.
And Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, who was among the first Democratic donors to publicly urge Biden to step aside, donated $7 million to a super PAC supporting Harris’ run, The Information reported.Minyvonne Burke is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News."
NBC_26,Here's what the NBA's new media deal means for hoops fans,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/nba-streaming-broadcast-deal-nbc-peacock-amazon-prime-how-to-watch-rcna151502,2024-07-25 23:00:02.777714,,"The NBA announced a new media deal late Wednesday that would end its long-standing relationship with TNT, while adding and restarting partnerships with Amazon and NBC — expanding the reach of professional hoops but potentially posing new access issues to fans. 
Starting in the 2025-2026 season, existing partner ABC and its sister network ESPN will now share broadcast rights with Amazon Prime Video, NBC and the NBCUniversal-owned Peacock. The league is seeking to wind down its 35-year tie-up with TNT, although it is now facing a lawsuit from TNT's parent, Warner Bros. Discovery, as it does so.    
Barring a dramatic last-minute change, all of this means the upcoming 2024-2025 season will be the last to feature the popular ""NBA on TNT"" broadcast. Co-anchor and NBA Hall of Famer Charles Barkley said last month he would retire from TV following this season.  
“Our new global media agreements with Disney, NBCUniversal and Amazon will maximize the reach and accessibility of NBA games for fans in the United States and around the world,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. “These partners will distribute our content across a wide range of platforms and help transform the fan experience over the next decade.”
Comcast’s NBCUniversal is the parent company of NBC News.
The new arrangement means that a year from now, NBA fans looking for a complete national viewing schedule will have to subscribe to two streaming platforms: Peacock and Amazon Prime Video. And if they want to avoid traditional TV entirely, they’ll need a third: ESPN’s upcoming streaming service. 
Still, many games will be available through traditional broadcast channels on ABC and NBC, and through cable via ESPN. The NBA will continue to sell a separate League Pass subscription that starts at $14.99 a month.
Here's what a sample basketball week looks like according to the new agreement:
Early-round playoff games will also be split up among the networks; ABC will remain the exclusive home of the NBA Finals.
The deal also includes expanded WNBA coverage among those networks, with 125 games slated to be televised. 
The deal marks a return of the basketball league to NBC after a run from 1990 to 2002 that coincided with the game's rise to international popularity led by stars such as Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. Mike Tirico will anchor the network's coverage, NBC Sports President Rick Cordella told Richard Deitsch of The Athletic on Wednesday.
For the past 22 years, games have been split among ABC, ESPN (both owned by Disney) and TNT. The most recent agreements with those networks generated $24 billion, according to CNBC.
With the new deal, the NBA has nearly tripled that figure to approximately $76 billion, according to The Associated Press. 
Live sporting events are highly coveted by broadcast groups because of the viewership they can command. This year's regular season averaged 1.09 million viewers across ABC, ESPN, TNT and the league-owned NBA TV. While that was up just 1% from last year, it was the highest all-network average in four years, according to Sports Media Watch. 
Last year’s NBA playoffs was the most watched in 11 years, according to Nielsen.
In fact, annual ratings churn is not necessarily the most important part of the negotiations for sports broadcast rights. Rather, the slate of games themselves — known as ""inventory"" in the industry — is valuable in itself as it ensures a consistent audience. 
""Inventory is what matters,"" said Jon Lewis, who runs SportsMediaWatch.com. ""If you're trying to build up a streaming service like Peacock, or Amazon sports, that inventory is a big deal. They're clearly willing to pay a lot for it.""Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com."
NBC_27,"Netanyahu's speech was cheered in Congress, decried by hostage families back home",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/netanyahu-speech-congress-israel-hostage-families-gaza-hamas-rcna163581,2024-07-25 23:00:02.777714,,"Cheers and standing ovations greeted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress in Washington, the heart of American political power. But the barnstorming address left the father of 19-year-old soldier and Hamas hostage Liri Albag feeling heartsick.  
“When he talked for 55 minutes and didn’t talk about the deal for one second, I was very upset, embarrassed and angry,” Eli Albag told NBC News in a phone interview Thursday about what he viewed as Netanyahu's unwillingness to strike a deal with Hamas for the release of relatives being held in the Gaza Strip. 
He added that he wanted to believe that the return of Israeli hostages like Liri was a priority for the Israeli leader, but he said he hasn’t seen “the results.”
Albag, 55, is one of several family members of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza who demanded to meet with cease-fire negotiators after Israeli media and Reuters reported that an Israeli delegation had not set off for talks in Qatar on Thursday as planned. Instead it was reported that they were held back until next week.  
Netanyahu railed against Hamas and Iran in his Wednesday address, and he said Israel would not settle for anything less than “total victory” in its offensive in Gaza, which he said “could end tomorrow if Hamas surrenders, disarms and returns all the hostages.” If they didn’t, he said, “Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas’ military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home.”
Large protests greeted the speech, which came three months after Congress passed a military aid package that included $14 billion for Israel, with many demonstrators decrying the nearly 40,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza since the start of the war, according to health authorities in the enclave.
While some lawmakers, mostly Democrats, refused to attend the address amid mounting global outrage over the tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians killed and wounded, Noa Argamani, who traveled with Netanyahu to Washington, watched the address in the chamber.
Argamani became a symbol of Hamas’ Oct. 7 terror attack, which killed 1,200 and saw around 250 taken hostage, after her kidnapping was captured in a viral video. She has faced criticism from some Israeli commentators and hostage families for joining Netanyahu, some of whom have accused her of being a pawn in a political game.  Netanyahu has also been criticized for allegedly using hostages as “props” during public appearances but not advocating hard enough for their release.
“While (Netanyahu) boasts about caring about the hostages, he’s not sending the negotiation team to Qatar to seal the deal,” Udi Goren, whose cousin Tal Haimi’s body remains in Hamas’ captivity, said in a statement.  
“Why doesn’t he want more Argamanis to be back home?” he added. 
Netanyahu’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the hostage families' criticism of the prime minister's address and the government policy toward negotiations with Hamas.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the relatives of those held captive in Gaza, said the delay in sending negotiators to Qatar unfolded after hostage families had received repeated assurances from them that the delegation would be sent this week. 
“This foot-dragging is a deliberate sabotage of the chance to bring our loved ones back. It effectively undermines the negotiations and indicates a serious moral failure,” the group said in a statement Thursday morning. 
There are now 115 hostages who remain held in Gaza, including at least 41 who are believed to be dead, according to Israeli officials. Those numbers include four hostages who have been held in Gaza since 2014, with two of them among those believed to be dead. 
According to several of the American hostage families in Washington for the Netanyahu speech and meetings, they are upset that he is in the United States instead of in Israel trying to get their loved ones home. They also told NBC News on Wednesday that they are looking toward Thursday's joint meeting at the White House with President Joe Biden and Netanyahu as a chance for Biden to pressure the Israeli leader to agree to a cease-fire deal as soon as next week with no new obstacles.
Calling Netanyahu’s speech a “disgrace,” Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid also wrote on X that there had been “an hour of talking without saying a single sentence: ‘There will be a hostage deal.’”
The families spoke out after the Israeli military said Thursday that troops had retrieved the bodies of five hostages in Gaza's southern city of Khan Younis. 
Among them was kindergarten teacher Maya Goren, who died in Hamas’ captivity at age 56, according to Israeli officials. The bodies of four soldiers — Sgt. Maj. Ravid Aryeh Katz, Master Sgt. Oren Goldin, Staff Sgt. Tomer Ahimas and Sgt. Kiril Brodski — were also retrieved, the officials said.
The rescue operation took place as Israeli forces carried out an offensive in Khan Younis that saw tens of thousands of Palestinians forced to evacuate the area.Chantal Da Silva reports on world news for NBC News Digital and is based in London."

Kathy Hochul, law enforcement sources close to the case confirmed.
Federal officers were seen around the Manhasset property linked to the former staffer, Linda Sun, who left the governor’s office nearly two years ago.
The nature of the investigation is unclear, and no criminal charges have been filed.
Hochul’s office declined to comment on the FBI search. A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office in Brooklyn, which covers Long Island, also declined to comment.
When reached by phone Tuesday, Sun’s husband declined to comment.
According to her government bio, Sun was appointed deputy chief of staff to Hochul, a Democrat, in September 2021. At the time, she was the highest-appointed Asian American in the administration.
After leaving Hochul’s office, she served briefly as a deputy secretary in the state Labor Department. A person familiar with the circumstances of her departure said she was fired after evidence of misconduct was discovered. The matter was forwarded to law enforcement at the time, according to the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss personnel matters. The person declined to detail the nature of the alleged misconduct.
In 2023, according to her LinkedIn account, she managed the campaign of Austin Cheng, a Democrat who sought unsuccessfully to succeed George Santos, R-N.Y., after Santos was expelled from the U.S. House. Cheng did not immediately return an email seeking comment.
Before working for Hochul, Sun worked in state government for almost 15 years. From 2009 to 2012, Sun was chief of staff to Grace Meng, then a state assembly member from Queens and now a Democratic member of the U.S. House.

On a hot Georgia afternoon this spring, Nancy Breland was in her yard clearing branches and debris, trying to ward off any potential damage to her home from a large storm heading toward her coastal town.
At 72, Breland has been doing much of the upkeep around her home after her husband fell ill several years ago. She’d like to hire some help but worries about the impact on her budget. 
Breland feels she should be able to retire comfortably after her husband spent his career working as a union pipe fitter and she worked for decades as a hospital medical technologist. Instead, she said, she feels under increasing financial pressure and has been looking to cut her monthly expenses in the face of rising prices for groceries, utilities, insurance and home maintenance. 
“All the money I will ever have come in is what I have now,” she said. “I am worried that as we get older, I will have to employ outside landscapers and house cleaning services when we can no longer do it ourselves. This will be an added cost on top of decreasing funds due to inflation. I know many of my friends are already struggling with this. Fixed income is very hard when inflation is so high.”
Primary source of income: Combined, Breland and her husband have around $7,600 in monthly income from their retirement accounts and pension and Social Security payments. 
That is enough money to cover their monthly bills, though Breland has been cutting costs over the past year as other expenses have gone up, including a nearly 50% increase in her electric bill, to more than $300 a month. She recently canceled her cable service, which was costing her $257 a month, and now pays for just one streaming service. She stopped paying $600 a month for her and her husband’s long-term care insurance — deciding instead that if one of them has to go into a long-term care facility, they will sell their home to pay for it. 
Living situation: Breland says she and her husband, who have been married for more than three decades, lived a comfortable life during their prime working years and saved regularly for retirement. 
They have lived for 24 years in their current home in Brunswick, Georgia, a historic port town in the southeast corner of the state popular with vacationers. To keep busy after she retired, Breland took a part-time job at a hospital blood bank and was volunteering at a local sea turtle center and with her church. 
Breland said she has considered moving into an apartment that would have less maintenance, but a typical one-bedroom in her community goes for a minimum of $1,200 a month, and that would leave her with little space for her three dogs. She has little extra money to cover major one-time expenses, like a home repair, a vet bill or dental work, because her savings are largely tied up in retirement investment accounts. 
Selling off any of those investments would leave her with less in monthly returns to live off. She would like to go back to working part time for some extra income but is worried about leaving her husband alone because of his health needs.
Economic outlook: Inflation has taken a particularly painful bite out of the budgets of retirees who aren’t able to reap the benefits of rising wages. While Social Security checks have increased relative to inflation, other sources of income for retirees, like pension payments and retirement savings accounts, haven’t necessarily kept up for many. 
Breland said her life took a turn financially and emotionally about three years ago when her husband and her brother became ill around the same time. As a full-time caretaker to both of them, Breland had to quit her part-time job as, she said, her days became consumed with doctor’s appointments and hospital stays. 
“I spend all my time at three people’s doctor’s appointments, mine and theirs. It just wears you down. I’m just really tired of taking care of everybody,” she said. “My life, I thought before this, was perfect. That is what is really distressing to me emotionally. I was loving my job. I was loving volunteering.”
Budget pain points: Her monthly housing costs are around $1,600 a month for her mortgage, taxes and insurance, and they have been on the rise. Her homeowners insurance has gone from just under $2,000 in 2022 to $2,820 this year, and her flood insurance has gone from $525 in 2020 to $840, even though her home isn’t at high risk for flooding. Insurance for some of her neighbors has increased to as much as $5,000 a year. 
Because her savings are largely tied up in retirement investment accounts, Breland had to take out a home equality loan recently to cover the cost of removing some dead trees and repairing the steps to her house. She still owes $10,000 on the loan. 
What’s going well? After cutting some of her costs recently, paying off her car and receiving an increase in the minimum amount she is required to withdraw from her retirement investment account, she said, Breland has a bit more breathing room in her monthly budget. 
Despite all of her husband’s medical issues over the past several years, she said, her health care costs have been mostly covered by a supplemental Medicare plan the couple pays around $350 a month for. 
“We really are doing much better than we were. If we hadn’t had that medical insurance, it would not be a good thing here,” she said. “At least I’ve got a nice view from my back porch. I can sit here with my dog and my cold beer at night. But it’s not the only thing I wanted to be doing.”
What’s on her mind: Beyond her finances, Breland said that being the sole caretaker for her husband has taken its toll emotionally and left her feeling she is missing out on what were supposed to be some of her best years. 
“I’m really frustrated, because there are a lot of things I thought I’d do at this stage of my life. I thought I would be traveling a lot. I wanted to see the Grand Canyon, I wanted to see Montana, I wanted to go out West,” she said. “I feel like I’m stuck here. I had this vision that I was going to do all these things, and it’s not going to happen. It’s terrible to say this, but I’m really envious when I look on Facebook and I see people I went to high school with and they’re off doing all these great things with their husbands everywhere.”
How she sees things: More widely, Breland said, she doesn’t think the economy is going in the right direction. 
As a volunteer with her church, she said, she has seen an “overwhelming” number of people struggling with the rising cost of housing, transportation and groceries. 
“I’m looking at people trying to find a place to live in this town. I do not know how they afford rent when a one-bedroom apartment is over $1,200 a month, then suppose they have kids. I don’t know how they afford anything.”Shannon Pettypiece is senior policy reporter for NBC News."
NBC_30,Missouri Supreme Court blocks man's release after 1990 murder conviction is overturned,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/missouri-supreme-court-blocks-release-man-jailed-30-years-murder-convi-rcna163587,2024-07-25 23:00:02.777714,,"For more than 30 years, Christopher Dunn has been incarcerated in Missouri, accused of a murder he insisted he did not commit. Freedom seemed within his grasp when a circuit judge overturned his conviction and ordered for his release Wednesday — only to be overruled when the state Supreme Court granted the attorney general’s request for a stay.
The legal showdown over Dunn’s release marks the second time in a matter of weeks that Missouri’s Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey has fought a court order to release an inmate who was found to be wrongly convicted.
Last month, Sandra Hemme, 64, the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., had her conviction overturned, only to have Bailey appeal her release, keeping her behind bars. Ultimately, she was released July 19 after a judge threatened to hold the attorney general’s office in contempt of court.
Dunn, now 52, was 18 when he was accused of fatally shooting Ricco Rogers, 15, on the night of May 18, 1990.Though there was no physical evidence in the case linking Dunn to the shooting, he was convicted of first-degree murder in a case that heavily relied on two young witnesses who claimed to see the shooting. Those witnesses, who were 12 and 14, later recanted their testimony as adults and said they were coerced by prosecutors and police.
St. Louis Circuit Judge Jason Sengheiser overturned Dunn’s conviction on Monday following a motion filed by St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore in February seeking to vacate the guilty verdict.
“The State of Missouri shall immediately discharge Christopher Dunn from its custody,” Sengheiser’s ruling said, according to The Associated Press.
Sengheiser ordered that Dunn be freed by 6 p.m. Wednesday — a move blocked by Bailey’s motion for an emergency stay and sustained by the state’s highest court.
Under the state Supreme Court order, Sengheiser has until 5 p.m. Friday to file suggestions in opposition to Bailey’s motion for the stay and Bailey has until 5 p.m Monday to file suggestions in reply.
Dunn’s attorney, Justin Bonus, said his team was working to respond to the attorney general’s motion.
“Christopher Dunn has been found innocent by two separate judges after both judges hearing the evidence before them,” Bonus said in a statement to NBC News. “He remains in prison, an innocent man, with his conviction overturned. This is a travesty of justice.”
“The AG should not be fighting Judge Sengheiser’s decision. Their job is not to fight to uphold convictions, but to seek justice. That is not what is happening here,” Bonus added.
The Midwest Innocence Project, which worked to free Dunn and Hemme, said in a statement on X: “Chris’ legal team hoped and expected him to be released this evening. But at the Attorney General’s request, and less than an hour before Chris’ scheduled release, the Missouri Supreme Court stayed the order to release Chris, and requested additional briefing.”
“Tragically, Chris will remain in custody at the South Central Correctional Facility as his legal team continues to work to secure his release.”
NBC News has reached out to the attorney general’s office and Dunn’s legal team for comment.
For Dunn’s family, the decision was frustrating.
“We are devastated and so confused as to why the Missouri Supreme entertained the Attorney General’s improper intrusion into a matter already settled by a judge. Chris was literally a few steps away from freedom when the call came,” Dunn’s wife, Kira Dunn, said in a statement to NBC affiliate KSDK of St. Louis. “This is unimaginably cruel treatment of a proven innocent person. It is torture. It is pointless. It is a perversion of what justice should be in Missouri.”Breaking News Reporter"
NBC_31,What to expect from the most ambitious Opening Ceremony ever attempted,https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/olympics/olympics-2024-opening-ceremony-watch-start-time-rcna163453,2024-07-25 23:00:02.777714,,"Over 10,000 athletes will sail down the Seine on Friday in what is poised to be most ambitious Olympic opening ceremony ever attempted.
The 2024 Olympics, which kick off this week in Paris, are intended to ""revolutionize"" the Games yet remain accessible to a broad audience. 
To commemorate the official start of the Olympics, which were last held in Paris exactly a century ago, organizers have spent years orchestrating a dynamic, and distinctly French, affair.
Over a billion people around the world are expected to tune in. Here's everything to know about the ceremony, which, if all goes to plan, will go down in Olympic history.
Stream every moment and every medal of the 2024 Paris Olympics on Peacock, starting with the opening ceremony Friday at 12 p.m. ET.
The live NBC broadcast kicks off with a pre-show at noon ET Friday, and the ceremony itself begins at 7:30 p.m. Paris time, or 1:30 p.m. ET. 
The prime-time encore telecast, which features additional content, will air later in the day for U.S. viewers, at 7:30 p.m. ET. The ceremony is expected to be over four hours.
Follow here for live coverage of the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.
NBC will have 40 cameras capturing the action in Paris, and live coverage begins at noon ET. The ceremony will be broadcast on TV and streamed in digital format on NBC, Peacock and NBC Olympics. (NBC News shares a parent company with those entities, NBCUniversal).
A complete schedule of the events over the next two weeks can be found here.
At the start of the ceremony, the French flag will be raised and the French national anthem will be played.
Next comes what is arguably the highlight of the ceremony: the Parade of Nations. Athletes representing 206 countries will make their ceremonial entrance into the Games. Historically, that involves marching into a stadium on foot, but this year, athletes will proceed by boat along the ""main artery"" of Paris, the Seine River.
""An opening ceremony has never been held outside of a stadium. There is no model; it’s absolute creation,"" opening ceremony artistic director Thomas Jolly told The Associated Press.
Each national delegation will ride in a boat equipped with cameras that enable immersive access for viewers.
The ceremony will begin at the Austerlitz Bridge and travel just under 4 miles down the river, landing at the Trocadéro near the Eiffel Tower. Along the way, the athletes will pass the city's most prominent icons, including the Louvre and the Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral.
At the end of the route, the Olympic torch will be lit. French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to speak.
Several potential roadblocks, such as security and pollution concerns, have threatened to impede the extravagant opening ceremony. However, officials maintain that they are ""more than ready"" as they make their final preparations.
NBC's Mike Tirico will host the ceremony for the fourth time, alongside three-time Grammy-winning singer Kelly Clarkson and NFL Hall of Famer Peyton Manning.
Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, hosts of NBC’s “TODAY,” will have an aerial view of the ceremony from a bridge on the Seine. Maria Taylor, a commentator for NBC Sports, will also be part of the hosting effort.
The official musical performers remain unconfirmed, but Céline Dion and Lady Gaga have both arrived in Paris, further fueling speculation that they may be among the headliners.
The French newspaper Le Parisien reported that Dion, who is Québécois and often sings in French, is rumored to perform “L’Hymne à l’amour,” by one of France's most famous musicians, Édith Piaf. It would be Dion's first live performance since she was diagnosed with stiff-person syndrome in 2022.
Because the U.S. will host the next Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028, Team USA is set to be the penultimate team down the river. France gets the honor of being the last boat for its home Olympics.
NBA legend LeBron James and U.S. Open tennis champion Coco Gauff are scheduled to bear the U.S. flag throughout the ceremony. Gauff, 20, will be the youngest athlete to ever carry the Stars and Stripes at an Olympic opening ceremony.
James is a three-time Olympic medalist, while Gauff will make her Olympic debut in Paris.I’m the newsroom coordinator for NBC News Digital and cover all things gymnastics, culture and breaking news.

NBC_32,Uvalde school police officer pleads not guilty to charges from response to 2022 shooting,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/uvalde-school-police-officer-pleads-not-guilty-charges-stemming-action-rcna163642,2024-07-25 23:00:02.777714,,"UVALDE, Texas — A former Uvalde, Texas, school police officer who was part of the slow law enforcement response to the 2022 mass shooting at Robb Elementary School pleaded not guilty during a court appearance Thursday.
Adrian Gonzales was one of the nearly 400 law enforcement personnel who responded to the scene but then waited more than 70 minutes to confront the shooter inside the school. Teary-eyed family members were in the courtroom in the small Texas town to watch as Gonzales was arraigned on charges of abandoning and failing to protect children who were killed and wounded.
Some of the victims’ families have spent more than two years pressing for officers to face charges after 19 children and two teachers were killed inside the fourth grade classroom. Some have called for more officers to be charged.
“For only two to be indicted, there should have been more because there was a lot of ranking officers during that day that knew what to do but decided not to. But they only got these two,” Jerry Mata, whose 10-year-old daughter Tess was killed, said after the hearing.
“We’ll take what we get and we’re just gonna continue fighting for the kids and the two teachers and see it all the way through,” Mata said.
Gonzales and former Uvalde schools police Chief Pete Arredondo were indicted by a grand jury in June. Arredondo waived his arraignment and entered a not guilty plea on July 10. Both were released on bond following their indictments.
Prior to the hearing, Gonzales’ attorney had called the charges “unprecedented in the state of Texas.”
“Mr. Gonzales’ position is he did not violate school district policy or state law,” said Nico LaHood, the former district attorney for Bexar County.
Javier Montemayor, who is listed by the Uvalde District Clerk as Arredondo’s attorney, did not reply to Wednesday phone messages seeking comment.
The May 22, 2024, attack was one of the worst school shootings in U.S. history. The police response has been heavily criticized in state and federal investigations that described “cascading failures” in training, communication and leadership among officers who waited outside the building while some victims lay dying or begging for help.
Gonzales, 51, was among the first officers to arrive. He was indicted on 29 charges that accuse him of abandoning his training and not confronting the shooter, even after hearing gunshots as he stood in a hallway.
Arredondo, 53, was the on-site commander that day. He is charged with 10 state jail felony counts of abandoning or endangering a child. Arredondo failed to identify an active shooting, did not follow his training and made decisions that slowed the police response to stop a gunman who was “hunting” victims, according to the indictment.
Terrified students inside the classroom called 911 as parents begged officers to go in. A tactical team of officers eventually went into the classroom and killed the shooter.
Each charge against Gonzales and Arredondo carries up to two years in jail if convicted.
The case is the latest, yet still rare circumstance of a U.S. law enforcement officer being charged for allegedly failing to act during an on-campus shooting. The first such case to go to trial was a sheriff’s deputy in Florida who did not confront the perpetrator of the 2018 Parkland massacre. The deputy was acquitted of felony neglect last year. A lawsuit by the victims’ families and survivors is pending.
Several families of victims have filed federal and state lawsuits against law enforcement, social media and online gaming companies and the gun manufacturer that made the rifle the gunman used.The Associated Press"
NBC_33,Simone Biles nails her eponymous 'Biles II' vault in practice,https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/olympics/simone-biles-vault-practice-rcna163618,2024-07-25 23:00:02.777714,,"Olympic gymnastics kicks off this weekend in Paris and Simone Biles is looking better than ever.
In Thursday's podium training, which is akin to a “dress rehearsal” for Olympic competition, Simone Biles stuck her eponymous Yurchenko double pike vault cold. The skill, which bears her name because she was the first woman to perform it, is notoriously hard to land cleanly.
Because under-doing the vault can be so dangerous, Biles often over-rotates the skill, resulting in a fall or several backwards steps. The difficulty rating of the skill is so high (6.4) that she is capable of receiving a huge score – and even contending for a vault medal – with a fall.
Follow along for live coverage of the Olympics
When Biles sticks it, it's pure magic.
Biles' showing in podium training was a masterclass overall. During qualification, the U.S. women are slated to start on the balance beam. It's never an easy place to start, but they rehearsed the competition in order to simulate the real thing as closely as possible.
On the beam, Biles showed no sign of nerves. Reigning Olympic all-around champion Suni Lee had a tougher outing, falling on her risky layout, step-out mount. She did her routine again, opting for a safer straddle mount and had a clean showing on her second try.
Another eponymous ""Biles"" skill, the triple-twisting double back flip, came at the top of the next event, the floor exercise. She is the reigning world champion on this event, and it shows. She performed the hardest tumbling being done in the world with ease and indomitable power. A few out-of-bounds landings here and there, but nothing to worry about.
Tokyo team silver medalist Jordan Chiles showed an incredible amount of progress from the Olympic trials to now. She performed all four events with the consistency she became renowned for in the lead-up to the Tokyo Olympics, when she hit every domestic routine the entire year. 
Chiles will be the first to say she didn't have the Olympic performance she wanted, falling a handful of times in qualifications and again in team finals. This time, she appears capable of challenging Lee for the second U.S. spot in the all-around final and could very well make the floor final as well.
She'd have to get through her teammate, reigning Olympic floor champion Jade Carey first. Carey's has yet to perform her full difficulty in Paris, opting for a simplified vault and floor routine.
After tripping on the vault runway in Tokyo event finals, Carey is on the hunt for some redemption, too.
“A lot of us will say we want redemption and we all had something that didn’t go our way,” Carey said at the trials in Minneapolis.
Another highlight of podium training was Lee's bar routine, which is  chalk full of high-flying release moves and daring acrobatic connections. She is known to adjust her routine on the fly, depending on how she is feeling. In training, she connected a Nabieva, Bhardwaj and Maloney half, which would certainly put her on track to secure spot in the bars final.
Stream every moment and every medal of the 2024 Paris Olympics on Peacock, starting with the opening ceremony Friday at 12 p.m. ET.
That event final is slated to be one of the most competitive of these Olympics, with reigning Olympic gold medalist Nina Derwael returning from a shoulder injury, rising Algerian bars star Kaylia Nemour and the Chinese team, who are as exquisite on bars as ever.
Newcomer Hezly Rivera, who at 16 is the youngest member of the Team USA delegation, looked calm and composed in training. Despite her relative inexperience, Rivera has a team full of seasoned Olympians to lean on throughout these Paris Games.
According to the lineups they rehearsed, Rivera appears to be performing on bars and beam in qualifications. Team final lineups, assuming the U.S. women sail through as expected, will likely be determined by Sunday's performances.

The seven-member panel dismissed a lawsuit challenging the law, with presiding Justice Paul Baffoe-Bonnie saying reasons for the decision will be given later.
The Ghanaian Criminal Code of 1960 prohibits same-sex sexual acts, calling them “unnatural carnal knowledge.” Offenders face up to three years in jail.
The sentence will be lengthened if the Human Sexual Rights and Family Values Bill passed in February takes effect, and the government would intensify a crackdown on those accused of promoting lesbian, gay or other minority sexual or gender identities.
The court earlier this month postponed ruling on whether the bill should be transmitted to President Nana Akufo-Addo for approval, saying it should first be determined if the bill is constitutional.
Law lecturer, Prince Obiri-Korang, had asked the apex court in 2021 to annul aspects of the 1960 code criminalizing same sex sexual acts, saying it breached the constitutional right to privacy."

Team USA came into this final match of pool play at Stade de France with a loss to Fiji and draw against France on its resume, forcing the Eagles to win to guarantee advancement.
The American took an opening possession 7-0 edge before Uruguay responded with consecutive tries as Los Teros held a 12-7 lead and seemingly all the momentum late in the first half.

But in the dying moments before intermission, a key defensive stand   and a Baker try just before the whistle gave Team USA a 14-12 lead it  would never relinquish. Team USA outscored Uruguay, 19-5, in the second half.
“Yeah, we talk about it all the time, the two minutes before half and two minutes after half (are) the most important minutes of the game,” forward Aaron Cummings said.
“If you can get a score or pull down a score during those two minutes, then you’ll probably be in a good spot to win the game.” 
Baker insisted his team still hasn’t shown its full potential yet.
""Even the first game against France, we didn't really get to show who we were either,"" he said. ""It was all about the fight and defense.  We just know we got to get the ball, score and protect it and just keep it."" 
Lucas Lacamp also scored a try for the Americans while Stephen Tomasin connected on all four of his conversion attempts.
Baltazar Amaya's two tries and Bautista Basso's one try paced Uruguay's attack. 
Both the United States and France, which lost to Fiji after the American victory over Uruguay, advanced out of group play. 
While the Eagles and Les Bleus finished with the same 1-1-1 record, France was deemed to be the second-place team based on point differential.

JD Vance after comments he once made referring to Vice President Kamala Harris as childless re-emerged.
During a 2021 interview with Tucker Carlson on Fox News, Vance — now former President Donald Trump’s running mate — said Harris was one of the “childless cat ladies” who “want to make the rest of the country miserable too.” Vance added, “If you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children.”
Harris is stepmother to Emhoff’s two children, Ella and Cole, who refer to the vice president as “Momala.”
In a statement to NBC News, Kerstin Emhoff called Vance’s attacks “baseless,” adding: “For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I. She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it.”
Ella Emhoff, 25, posted a screenshot on her Instagram story in support of her mother’s statement, adding, “How can you be ‘childless’ when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I?”
She also tagged her mother’s Instagram handle, writing, “Say it louder for the people in the back.”
At the bottom of the image, Ella Emhoff wrote, “I love my three parents.”
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who now has two children, also criticized Vance’s comments, saying in an interview with CNN earlier this week, “The really sad thing is, he said that after Chasten and I had been through a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey. He couldn’t have known that, but maybe that’s why you shouldn’t be talking about other people’s children.”
“It’s about ... people’s families whose well-being will depend on whether we go into a future led by somebody like Kamala Harris who is focused on expanding the prosperity and the freedom, the well-being of our families,” Buttigieg added.

NBC_37,Allies push their in-state stars for VP — especially in Pennsylvania,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/kamala-harris-running-mate-shapiro-cooper-kelly-allies-rcna163373,2024-07-26 02:01:02.862759,,"PITTSBURGH — In the days after President Joe Biden ended his 2024 campaign and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him, Democrats across the country rushed to rally behind her, too. In Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia Democratic Party went a step further — endorsing not just Harris, but a ticket with Harris backed up by Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.
As Harris kicks off an unusually rapid search for a vice presidential nominee, Shapiro’s in-state allies are standing out with an especially public and vocal push to elevate their governor. Shapiro, who was elected in 2022 and twice elected state attorney general before that, has mostly deflected when asked about running mate speculation in recent days. So have North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and others.
But their friends are making enough noise on their own.
Former Rep. Bob Brady, the chair of the Philadelphia Democratic Party, told NBC News that with Shapiro on the ticket, Harris will win Pennsylvania.
“I don’t guarantee anything, but I will guarantee that,” said Brady, whose committee announced endorsing Shapiro for VP “without any opposition.” He continued, “No question about it. We’re so enthused, so riled up.” 
“We are pushing for our favorite son,” Brady said gushing about Shapiro’s electability, calling the endorsement of Shapiro a “no-brainer” and saying, “He checks every box.” 
Pennsylvania state House Speaker Joanna McClinton also endorsed a Harris-Shapiro ticket, telling NBC News that “when I think about winning Pennsylvania, I think about our governor first, because Gov. Shapiro has won across Pennsylvania three times.” 
Former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell said Shapiro is “the type of man that every mother in Pennsylvania would hope her son grows up to be.” 
Rendell says the enthusiasm level in Pennsylvania is already “sky high” for Harris, but believes with Shapiro on the ticket, it would “go off the charts.”
This push is a stark contrast to what Shapiro has been saying while fielding a glut of media questions about Harris’ campaign. Shapiro released a statement Sunday quickly endorsing Harris and noting their relationship, adding that he spoke to Biden and Harris after their announcements and has known Harris “for nearly two decades.” 
Since then, Shapiro has repeatedly told reporters that Harris has a “deeply personal decision to make,” adding that “it should be made free from any political pressure.”
Shapiro has kept up his local public schedule amid a new crush of national attention, speaking Wednesday in New Castle, Pennsylvania, about a new law reforming pharmacy benefit manager regulations. Like anything that passes through Pennsylvania’s divided state legislature, it required bipartisan cooperation. “We are proving that we can bring Republicans and Democrats together to get meaningful things done,” Shapiro said.
When asked about the support from the likes of Brady and McClinton, Shapiro told NBC News, “While I am, of course, grateful for the kindness that Speaker McClinton and Congressman Brady shared, this is a process that the vice president needs to go through and make her decision based upon factors that she lays forward.” 
Brady does not view his and others’ push for Shapiro as putting political pressure on Harris, emphasizing it is “110%” her decision. 
“If it’s not Josh Shapiro, whoever it may be, we will rally around them,” Brady said. 
While pro-Shapiro voices have been particularly outspoken backing him in his state, there are similar efforts heating up elsewhere. In North Carolina, where Cooper is under consideration, state Democratic Party Chair Anderson Clayton and Rep. Deborah Ross both posted pictures with their governor on X, writing, “I know who I would pick for VP 👀”
In Arizona, members of the state Democratic Party executive board endorsed Kelly for Harris’ running mate on Thursday, touting his ability to “help working families, boost our economy, and ensure our communities are safe and secure.”
“We are confident that with Senator Kelly on the ballot, Vice President Harris can build a winning coalition that defeats Donald Trump and J.D. Vance in November,” the state party announced, adding that “the road to the White House runs through Arizona in this election.”
It’s unclear whether such public displays have any effect on vice presidential decisions past or present. But they can be useful displays of loyalty. Just hours before the Arizona party put out its statement supporting Kelly, Arizona Democratic Party Chair Yolanda Bejarano initially stopped short of endorsing Kelly at a news conference in Phoenix, telling NBC News, “This is something that we’re going to trust the vice president’s judgment.”
And of course, not everyone is lined up behind their home-state VP hopeful.
Erin McClelland, the Democratic candidate for Pennsylvania state treasurer who beat the state party’s endorsed candidate in a primary earlier this year, posted on X against Shapiro, making reference to a sexual harassment case against a former Shapiro aide.
“I want a VP pick that’s secure enough to be second under a woman, is content to be VP & won’t undermine the President to maneuver his own election & doesn’t sweep sexual harassment under the rug.  I want someone that can speak to rural voters. That is @RoyCooperNC,” McClelland posted.
Brady called McClelland “nuts” in response and said he thinks she is making a “major mistake.” “I think she just sunk herself and I’m not too happy with her at all,” he added.
Pennsylvania state Sen. Sharif Street, the state Democratic Party chair, stopped short of fully endorsing Shapiro in an interview, citing deference to Harris. “As a state party, I don’t presume to tell the vice president, our nominee for president, who she should pick. I’m not doing that,” he said.
But Street added: “What I am telling you is I think Josh would do a great job.” 
Like others, Street noted that Shapiro has been the top vote-getter in Pennsylvania in past elections, including years when he shared the ticket with presidential hopefuls Biden and Hillary Clinton. And Street noted “he’s been effective” while working with a GOP state Senate and a Democratic state House in Harrisburg.
“My job is to make sure we win the state,” Street said. “I think Kamala Harris is gonna win Pennsylvania no matter which vice presidential pick she picks. But gee, I mean, if I could go around and have our governor be the pick, I mean, I’d be being disingenuous to say that wouldn’t make it easier.”Emma Barnett is a 2024 NBC News campaign embed.

NBC_38,The best graphics cards in 2024,https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-graphics-cards-rcna163535,2024-07-26 02:00:02.862759,,"Graphics cards or graphics processing units (GPU) are crucial if you are building a PC or looking to make a graphical upgrade to your current computer.
Many computers get by with an integrated graphics processing unit (GPU), which means the GPU is built into the central processing unit (CPU), with both processors sharing the same memory bank. But you’ll want a dedicated GPU for graphics-intensive activities such as gaming and video editing, and to benefit from parallel processing to speed up tasks.
While there are many budget graphics cards out there, you’ll need to spend a bit of money to ensure impressive visuals, high frame rates and next-gen lighting effects. There are only a small number of key GPU manufacturers out there — Nvidia, AMD and Intel — but anyone unsure where to start can check out the best graphic cards in the guide below.
SKIP AHEAD The best graphics cards | How to shop for the best graphics cards
When picking these suggestions, I drew on the advice of hardware and computing experts as well as my own experience as a gadget reporter and kept the below criteria in mind:
“The AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT is perfect for mid-range gamers,” says Damien Mason, the Senior Hardware Editor at technology outlet Club386. “It has best-in-class rasterized performance in its $500 price range” for capable 3D graphical rendering. Mason adds that its 16GB of video memory can handle “even the most demanding games at QHD (1440p) with the settings cranked up” as well as 4K games with more moderate expectations. While AMD’s ray tracing is still behind Nvidia, it’s certainly catching up and a slightly lower price point over the equivalent RTX 4070 makes this a sensible buy.
Manufacturer: AMD/Gigabyte | Memory: 16 GB GDDR6 | TGP: 263W | Ray Tracing: Yes | Outputs: HDMI 2.1 (1), DisplayPort 2.1 (3) | Fans: 3
If you need a splurge-worthy option look no further than the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090, which chipset manufacturer Nvidia describes as “the ultimate GeForce GPU”. Mason calls it “the best performing graphics card out there, at least until RTX 5090 inevitably dethrones it in the near future.” The Ada Lovelace architecture used in Nvidia’s processors is market-leading for professional graphical rendering, video and AI, and excels at producing 4K resolution, ray tracing and triple digit frame rates in most games, says Mason. This Founders Edition is pricier than some third-party models, but you’re getting a sleek design and out-of-the-box overclock for enhanced performance. For a GPU that can handle anything you throw at it, consider the RTX 4090 — just make sure that your CPU is capable enough so that it doesn’t cause a bottleneck for the 4090’s ambitions.
Manufacturer: Nvidia | Memory: 24GB GDDR6X | TGP: 450W | Ray Tracing: Yes | Outputs: HDMI 2.1 (1), DisplayPort 1.4 (3) | Fans: 2
This Asus spin on the RTX 4090 is well worth a look. It features an enhanced cooling system with a dedicated vapor chamber and triple-fan cooling to exhaust heat and reduce noise while you’re playing 4K or even 8K games. Plus it has the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace Streaming Multiprocessors, which offers up to 2x performance and power efficiency, according to the brand.
Manufacturer: Nvidia/Asus | Memory: 24GB GDDR6X | TGP: 450W | Ray Tracing: Yes | Outputs: HDMI 2.1 (1), DisplayPort 1.4 (3) | Fans: 3
If you’re looking for a sub-$300 GPU, consider the GeForce RTX 4060. “The true power of this graphics card comes from it being the cheapest model to support Nvidia DLSS 3 with Frame Generation, which gives you a monumental frame rate boost in compatible games,” Mason says. “Pair that with the latency-reducing Nvidia Reflex and you have a fantastic budget GPU that won’t break the bank.”
Manufacturer: Nvidia/MSI | Memory: 8GB GDDR6 | TGP: 135W | Ray Tracing: Yes | Outputs: HDMI 2.1 (1), DisplayPort 1.4 (3) | Fans: 2
The first thing to consider when shopping for a graphics card is your budget. Mason says graphics cards are, unfortunately, pricier than they’ve ever been. Top-of-the-line graphics cards easily dip into four figures, but you don’t need to drop your entire month’s wages to get good frame rates. Naturally, you get what you pay for. A more expensive model offers improved performance with more advanced graphical rendering, but it’s also more likely to last in the long term. Buying a budget graphics card may work if you have more limited graphical needs, but it’s worth considering what level of performance you want and whether you want a purchase that will still hold up in a few years.
When it comes to buying a graphics card, you need to pay attention to size, says Mason. “Some models are pretty large and won’t fit in anything but the biggest case, so it’s worth whipping out a tape measure before committing to a purchase. You also need to make sure your power supply has enough juice to run the GPU. Recommended wattages are usually featured on Nvidia, AMD and Intel product pages.”
Mason adds that “it’s not all about the GPU. Pairing a powerful model with a lackluster processor will only cause a bottleneck, meaning you won’t see all the frames you otherwise should. It’s important to keep your components as fast as one another so you can make the most of them.”
What complicates buying a GPU is the different iterations of each graphics card out there. GPU manufacturers typically release their own limited-run ‘Founders Edition’ version of a GPU to market first. These are ideal for shoppers who don’t want to get into the weeds, opting for a reliable baseline performance and clean design.
However, third-party manufacturers will also release their own takes on the manufacturer’s graphics processor, often with improved cooling solutions, unique designs and varying price points.
Mason tells us that “While most third-party models perform similarly to Founders Edition cards, the bespoke coolers can really make a difference to noise output and thermals.""
Many CPU processors will come with an integrated GPU to run the graphics requirements of your PC — though you’ll need a separate, dedicated GPU for more intensive graphical needs, whether that’s impressive AAA games or high-resolution video editing. 
Nvidia’s RTX graphics cards are considered to be more powerful than their GTX counterparts, with more advanced graphical features such as ray tracing (for realistic lighting in 3D graphics) and DLSS (AI-based upscaling from lower resolutions), which GTX models aren’t capable of. However, GTX graphics cards still have a place in the market, due to their simpler graphical demands and lower price points.
This varies greatly between different MacBook models. A MacBook Pro, for instance, has to be suitable for design professionals using ever-rendering editing software and therefore needs a powerful GPU to keep up. A MacBook Air, on the other hand, is designed for lower budgets and significantly reduced graphical needs.
These days, Apple prefers integrated GPUs, and as its website states, “Many 15-inch MacBook Pro laptops have two graphics processors (GPU) — a discrete GPU and an integrated GPU. The discrete GPU provides substantial graphics performance but uses more energy.” So the exact graphics card setup will vary between models.

NBC_39,Biden's legacy is still being written. How he helps Harris may be key.,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/bidens-legacy-still-written-helps-harris-may-key-rcna162962,2024-07-26 02:00:02.862759,,"WASHINGTON — Now a caretaker president, Joe Biden has no realistic hope of getting a divided Congress to pass unfinished parts of his agenda.
But what he can do in his remaining months in office may be even more important in preserving America's democratic traditions: stop Donald Trump's return to power, the president suggested Wednesday night in his Oval Office address.
“Nothing,” Biden said, “nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition. So, I’ve decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation.”
Biden has left it to his vice president, Kamala Harris, to defeat Trump. He bowed to political reality in dropping his re-election bid, conceding that the younger, more energetic Harris may stand a better chance in November.
But Biden’s legacy is tethered to the outcome of the election, even if he's no longer on the ballot, historians say. Proud as he is of hard-won legislation aimed at upgrading roads and bridges, Biden needs a Harris victory to secure his own place in history, they said.
“People don’t go to presidential libraries to see the pen used to sign the infrastructure act under glass,” Douglas Brinkley, a Rice University presidential historian, said in an interview.
“If Harris loses, it will show that Biden’s biggest accomplishment in history — defeating Trumpism in 2020 — only meant that he contained it for a short moment.”
Biden gave a few clues about the policies he’ll champion during his last six months in office. In his speech explaining his decision to drop out, he said he'll make the case for holding Supreme Court justices accountable by working to end their lifetime tenure and hold them to a code of ethics. 
He said he’ll speak out against gun violence and work to preserve both voting and abortion rights. 
But the election is bound to influence much of what he says and does as his term winds down. Harris' senior aides attend important staff meetings in the West Wing, assuring that the two camps work in sync.
White House aides said that Biden can help his chosen successor by using his powerful megaphone to showcase economic policies that voters like and Republicans oppose.
For example, aides said that White House officials will press the point that corporations should shoulder more of the tax burden and that the Trump-era tax cuts should be allowed to expire in 2025 for those earning more than $400,000 a year.
Campaigning directly for Harris is a riskier proposition. Only 36% held a positive view of Biden in the latest NBC News survey, down from 50% in his first months in office. 
Still, a sitting president is normally a fundraising draw and Biden can help the newly minted Democratic front-runner for the nomination woo donors even if he’s not especially useful stumping in battleground states.
“This will be Biden’s most important accomplishment: assuring that the torch is not only passed but that it will be used to burn down any chance the Trump campaign has of regaining the White House,"" said Mark Updegrove, president of the LBJ Foundation and author of five books on the presidency.
Lame-duck presidents go out differently, depending on their predilections and the political circumstances they face.
In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson, a Democrat, also abandoned a re-election bid, fearing defeat. Yet he passed important gun control legislation in the final three months of his term, seizing on the nation’s shock at the assassinations that year of Martin Luther King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy.
Approaching the end of his second term, Barack Obama demanded that his staff “run through the tape.” He didn’t want them letting up before turning the White House over to Trump in 2017.
In denial over his defeat in 2020, Trump devoted most of the post-election period to a failed attempt to reverse the outcome and remain in power. 
""You just can't ignore Jan. 6 and the incidents surrounding that to conclude this he [Trump] is a person who does not believe in democracy,"" Updegrove said. ""Democracy is the underpinning of the American system. You've heard from Trump very often during his campaign that if you don't have a border, you don't have a country. Well, if you don't have liberal democracy, you don't have a country. That's the essence of who we are.""
With Republicans controlling the House, Biden aides don’t anticipate any major legislative breakthroughs in the time that remains.
A president enjoys more latitude in the foreign policy sphere, and Biden has worked to leave his imprint on the world stage before he departs. 
He’d like to achieve a cease-fire in Gaza, a goal that has eluded him as Israeli officials push to eviscerate Hamas in the Gaza Strip, according to a person familiar with U.S. foreign policy planning.
Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, has already held at least two meetings with staff members reminding them that a considerable amount of unfinished business remains.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with Biden at the White House on Thursday. The president will attend a U.N. General Assembly meeting in September and he’d like to see a resolution of the war between Ukraine and Russia that preserves Ukrainian independence and territory.
Aides don’t expect a wave of White House departures in the coming months. Biden can be abrupt with staff, but he engenders a certain loyalty that tends to keep them in his orbit.
One White House official who is planning to stay until the end describes how Biden tried to console him when his brother died of cancer this year. 
As the official was about to join a meeting with the president, an aide told him to wait in the private dining room off the Oval Office. Biden entered the room and gave the official a hug. He spoke about the love between brothers and how his son Hunter felt when his brother, Beau, died of cancer in 2015.
Biden also asked about the official’s other brother, who is ill with the same type of brain cancer that killed Beau Biden. 
“I’m not exaggerating when I tell you the tears were falling from his face to the floor,” the official said. “That’s the guy he is. He feels deeply. I have a deep personal affection for him.”Peter Nicholas is a senior White House reporter for NBC News."
NBC_40,Republicans rip FBI director's testimony that Trump might not have been hit by a bullet,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/republicans-rip-fbi-directors-testimony-trump-might-not-hit-bullet-rcna163653,2024-07-26 02:00:02.862759,,"House Speaker Mike Johnson on Thursday pushed back against FBI Director Christopher Wray’s testimony before the House Judiciary Committee that former President Donald Trump may not have been hit directly with a bullet during the attempt on his life at a rally in Pennsylvania.
Wray, whom Trump nominated to head the FBI in 2017, testified Wednesday about his agency’s investigation into the assassination attempt, and said, “I think with respect to former President Trump there’s some question about whether or not it’s a bullet or shrapnel that, you know, hit his ear.” He said the investigation into the shooting, which is being led by the FBI, is “very much ongoing.”
Johnson said he didn’t find Wray’s testimony credible.
“We’ve all seen the video, we’ve seen the analysis, we’ve heard it from multiple sources in different angles that a bullet went through his ear. I’m not sure it matters that much,” Johnson said.
He also said Wray “was not forthcoming with some of the information that we would expect.”
“There’s a lot of frustration and concern about the leadership with these agencies,” Johnson said, apparently referring to the Secret Service as well.
Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung also blasted Wray, saying, “Anyone who believes this conspiracy bulls--- is either mentally deficient or willfully peddling falsehoods for political reasons.”
The former president has not released any medical records from his treatment at the hospital after the shooting, and the doctors who treated him were not made available to answer questions. The Trump campaign did release a letter from Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, a former White House physician.
Jackson ripped Wray in a statement on X. “What little credibility he may have left is gone after recklessly suggesting Trump might not have been hit from a bullet. It was a bullet — I’ve seen the wound. Pathetic!!!” he wrote in the post, with the last two sentences in all-capital letters.
Jackson said in the July 20 letter released by the campaign that he’d evaluated and treated Trump’s wound “daily” since the shooting.
“As reported and witnessed by the entire world, he sustained a gunshot wound to the right ear from a high-powered rifle used by the would be assassin,” Jackson said in the letter.
“The bullet track produced a 2 cm wide wound that extended down to the cartilaginous surface of the ear,” the letter said, adding that there “was initially significant bleeding,” but given “the broad and blunt nature of the wound itself, no sutures were required.”
Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., called Wray’s testimony “noteworthy,” and said Trump “owes it to the American people to be honest, and to say exactly what happened.”
“We have not seen any medical records. We have not had a an independent doctor other than a hyper-partisan, elected member of Congress comment on what happened,” Goldman said.
Trump expressed outrage Wednesday over another part of Wray’s testimony: his statement that he had not noticed any cognitive decline in his dealings with President Joe Biden.
“Anybody can see that Joe Biden is cognitively and physically challenged, and if you can’t see that, you sure as hell can’t be running the FBI,” Trump wrote in a post on social media, adding that “Wray has to resign, and NOW, for LYING TO CONGRESS!”Ryan Nobles is a correspondent covering Capitol Hill.

NBC_41,Kamala Harris to appear on 'RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars' season finale,https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-pop-culture/kamala-harris-rupauls-drag-race-stars-season-finale-rcna163676,2024-07-26 02:00:02.862759,,"Kamala Harris will appear on the season nine finale of “RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars” advocating for voting.
Set to air this Friday on Paramount+, the episode will begin with a special appearance from the vice president. 
“Each day we are seeing our rights and freedoms under attack, including the right of everyone to be who they are, love who they love, openly and with pride,” she said. “So as we fight back against these attacks, let’s all remember no one is alone. We are all in this together, and your vote is your power. So please make sure your voice is heard this November, and register to vote.”
Taped a few weeks before Harris announced her bid for the presidency, Harris joined judge Michelle Visage, Emmy-nominated choreographer Jamal Sims, Lance Bass, Leslie Jones, and Cheyenne Jackson and made her plea, encouraging Americans to register to vote.
She has long been an advocate for human and civil rights, and a champion for marriage equality. Last month, Harris hosted a Pride month reception in partnership with the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. “Drag Race” season 16 winner Nymhpia Wind, “All Stars” queens Vanessa Vanjie Mateo and Plastique Tiara, and Billy Porter were among the guests. On Wednesday night, the Human Rights Campaign backed Harris’ White House bid. They said, “In the Senate and as Vice President, Kamala Harris has been a champion for the Equality Act, which would ensure comprehensive non-discrimination protections for the LGBTQ+ community, and the Respect for Marriage Act, which secured federal marriage protections.”
This is not the first time a politician has appeared on the show. Back in 2020, Congresswoman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez appeared on the judges panel, and in 2022, Speaker Nancy Pelosi appeared on “All Stars” season 7 and encouraged Americans to vote.
“Drag Race” has also long advocated for voting rights. Each week queens and the show’s host RuPaul end the show by reminding audiences to register to vote.
Part two of the grand finale is expected to be a “Variety Extravaganza” as all eight queens return, with the winning queen earning $200,000 which will be donated to their chosen charity. Three Benefactress badges are also up for grabs, and a new voting twist could change everything.
Last week, RuPaul reminded the queens that the three queens with the most badges will be vying for the crown. But he swiftly added any of the queens could snatch the crown and be inducted into the Drag Race Hall of Fame. As of the grand finale part 1, Roxxxy Andrews had five Benefactress badges, Jorgeous and Plastique Tiara were tied with four with the former having a slight edge by having a lip-sync tie and maxi challenge win."
NBC_42,Breaking at the Olympics is a testament to hip-hop's influence around the world,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/breaking-olympic-hip-hop-influence-paris-2024-rcna161208,2024-07-26 02:00:02.862759,,"Logan Edra grew up learning about the four elements of hip-hop: rapping, graffiti, DJing and breakdancing. Now, she’s taking that knowledge and her love for the Bronx-born street dance style to the Paris Olympics.
“We’re part of this movement for the culture,” Edra, 21, who goes by Logistx, said in an interview. 
“It’s about peace, love, unity and having fun. There’s already cultural influence, cultural impact;  the only thing this adds is attention. We’re just getting more eyes on the culture.”
Breakdancing began in the 1970s within hip-hop culture, which highlighted Black American struggles and creative expression. Fifty years later, hip-hop’s influence in music, culture, art, fashion and sport has spread throughout the world, leading to international competitions and now the debut of breaking at the Olympic Games. The sport has come a long way from the energetic B-boys and B-girls practicing gravity-defying moves on slabs of cardboard in underserved cities. 
When breakdancers Edra, Jeffrey “B-boy Jeffro” Louis, Victor “B-boy Victor” Montalvo and Sunny “B-girl Sunny” Choi take their talents to the Olympics for the first time as Team USA this summer, it will highlight the influence of hip-hop and its impact on communities far and wide. 
“Hip-hop drives culture in general. The music has been the thing you see the most, but the Olympics really shows how important this dance form is. It’s incredible to see the global reach of hip-hop, especially through dance,” said Lavall “B-boy Brisk” Chichester, a Brooklyn-born breaker who is chief marketing officer of B-Boy & B-Girl Dojo, an online breakdancing school and resource site.
“I went to Italy and I saw a random kid practicing on the street,” Chichester said. “I didn’t speak Italian, he didn’t speak English, but we were just fast friends. We danced together. There’s a global community of people who just want to dance.”
Sixteen B-boys and 16 B-girls from around the world will compete in solo dance battles Aug. 9 and 10 at La Concorde in Paris, with athletes receiving the first-ever Olympic medals in breaking. Judges will use the same Trivium system used at the 2018 Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires, Argentina, which was the first breaking competition sanctioned by the International Olympic Committee. 
The digital scoring platform will allow judges to score the breakers in real time on their technique, performance, musicality, creativity and more. It’s an objective system in a sport that has historically been subjective. But breakers like Montalvo are confident they can bring the heart of the hip-hop-descended sport to the Olympics. 
Black youths in poor New York City neighborhoods cultivated breaking by mixing Black-created dance styles with martial arts and adding athleticism of their own. Puerto Rican youths in the city began to add their own flair to the street dance, Imani K. Johnson details in her book “Dark Matter in Breaking Cyphers: The Life of Africanist Aesthetics in Global Hip Hop.” Through the ’80s, movies and television began to feature forms of breaking as hip-hop music began to gain popularity. 
As the decades went on, breaking developed its own culture within hip-hop. Terms like “B-boy” and “B-girl” emerged along with defining elements of breaking like toprock, downrock, freezes, power moves and drops. Dancers began facing off in international competitions beginning in the 1990s, but dancers say they want to preserve breaking’s distinct culture even as the sport reaches the Olympics. 
“When I started breaking, it wasn’t about competition; it was about culture, it was about Black dance,” Carmarry Hall, a competitive breaker who goes by Pep-C, told The Associated Press.  “The Olympic platform is not going to appreciate the understanding. It’s structured in a certain way, and in that structure, you lose a little bit of the heart.”
Ana “Rokafella” Garcia, a pioneering Puerto Rican B-girl who rose to prominence in the ’90s and broke barriers as a female breaker, doesn’t see it that way. She told the Los Angeles Times that breaking may go through new stages and draw in more dancers and audiences but that “at the core it will never change.”
“Hip-hop is an Afro diasporic voice that calls for respect, and at this point after 2020, nothing can erase the rooted aspect of hip-hop in Blackness,” Garcia said. In 2020, the IOC’s executive board finalized its decision to add breaking to the Paris 2024 program. “The Olympics will be another iteration of this dance form and stand alongside the other cultural branches on this tree.”
Edra began breaking when she was around 7 years old. She said that although she is excited to compete at the Olympics, she can’t help but feel for the breaking veterans who won’t get to showcase their talents on the main stage.
“A lot of them are proud of me. I feel loved,” she said. “But I’m over here heartbroken because of the OGs that didn’t get this time of being seen. They built all of this.”
Sergio “B-boy Zeku” Garcia is one of the many dancers rooting for Edra. Garcia runs BreakinMIA, the Miami breakdancing school where Edra often trains. He said he’s just excited to see breaking on such a large platform and “couldn’t care less about a gold medal.” 
“It would be great, but we do think the exposure to all these young kids, that’s the real prize,” Garcia, 25, said in an interview. “Basketball’s expensive, football’s expensive, all these sports are expensive. But for breaking, you just need yourself and some music. I think this is going to help a lot of kids worldwide looking for an outlet.”

NBC_43,Pro-Palestinian protests inflame tensions in Washington over the Israel-Hamas war,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/-palestinian-protests-inflame-tensions-washington-israel-hamas-war-rcna163661,2024-07-26 02:00:02.862759,,"The pro-Palestinian protests that erupted in Washington during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to a joint session of Congress drew condemnation Thursday from political leaders. 
It was the latest inflection point as the protests have persisted around the United States since Israel responded to Hamas' terrorist attack in October. The war has engulfed the Gaza Strip, with hostages still being held there by Hamas. 
The protesters have called for a cease-fire and criticized America's ongoing support for Israel, mostly in the form of weapons. Opponents of the protests say they ignore the ongoing hostage situation and echo the talking points of a terrorist organization.  
A smaller group of protesters returned Thursday to demonstrate outside the White House, where Netanyahu was scheduled to meet with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. 
Joining several Republicans who condemned the protests on Wednesday, Harris, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both New York Democrats, forcefully criticized the protesters on Thursday, with Schumer telling NBC News, “What happened at Union Station was vile, offensive, wrong.”
Harris, in her statement, called out “despicable acts by unpatriotic protestors” and called their rhetoric “dangerous and hate-fueled.”
She also condemned “any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organization Hamas” and “the burning of the American flag.”
Jeffries told reporters at the Capitol that “it is unacceptable to deface public property, desecrate the American flag, threaten Jews with violence, or promote terrorist organizations like Hamas.”
The protest on Wednesday was originally led by the ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism) Coalition and grew to thousands ahead of Netanyahu's speech.
Waving flags and chanting, the protesters clashed with Capitol Police at barricades set up near the Capitol and then grew more heated when they reached Union Station, a few blocks away.
Protesters vandalized statues in front of Union Station (a major  Amtrak stop), removed and burned the American flags from the flagpoles and replaced them with Palestinian flags. Several flash bangs were heard, believed to be set off by protesters in the middle of Massachusetts Avenue, one of the main streets that feeds a circle in front of the train station.  
In several instances, police deployed pepper spray against the protesters and several were arrested.
During his speech Wednesday, Netanyahu condemned the protesters, accusing them of standing for evil and ""for Hamas.""
""From all we know, Iran is funding the anti-Israel protests that are going on right now outside this building,"" the prime minister said, adding: ""Well, I have a message for these protesters. When the tyrants of Tehran, who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering their hair, are praising and promoting and funding you, you have officially become Iran’s useful idiots.""
The statements from Democrats come as support for Israel's war against Hamas has become a political problem for the party.
Nearly half of congressional Democrats skipped Netanyahu's speech on Wednesday, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, of California, and former House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, of South Carolina. 
In recent weeks, more Democrats have called on Netanyahu to accept the terms of a cease-fire deal announced by President Joe Biden in May that would help bring home the remaining Israeli and American hostages held by Hamas.Alexandra Marquez is a politics reporter for NBC News.

NBC_44,House leaves town until September with little to show voters,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-leaves-town-september-little-show-voters-rcna163638,2024-07-26 03:40:02.815182,,"WASHINGTON — House Republican leaders have canceled next week’s work session and sent lawmakers home for a six-week summer recess with little they can brag about to constituents and voters heading into the final months before the election.
Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and his leadership team had hoped to pass all 12 bills that fund the government before the long August recess, setting up negotiations with the Democratic-led Senate on how to keep the government open ahead of a shutdown deadline on Sept. 30.
But that goal now looks out of reach with the House not returning until Sept. 9, leaving just three weeks to avert a shutdown. The House has already passed five funding bills and had planned to take up four more this week. But leaders managed to push through only one of them — focused on the Department of Interior — and yanked three others over intraparty disputes and the GOP’s minuscule three-seat majority.
“They can’t pass their own bills. They haven’t been able to pass their own bills all Congress. This is nothing new,” said Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla.
Both the House and Senate need to pass all 12 bills to fund the government for the 2025 fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1. A stopgap funding bill, known as a continuing resolution or CR, to temporarily keep the lights on is now likely with the election fast approaching.
The House’s final vote before departing town on Thursday was a non-binding GOP messaging bill, strongly condemning “border czar” Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party’s likely presidential nominee, for failing to secure the border. A half dozen vulnerable Democrats joined all Republicans in voting yes.
“Extreme MAGA Republicans have been in the majority for over 18 months. Can anyone name a single thing that extreme MAGA Republicans in the House have done in order to make life better for the American people? … You can’t,” Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told reporters, nodding to a fiery floor speech from GOP Rep. Chip Roy last fall where he lamented that there was not “one thing” Republicans could campaign on.
“They are incapable of governing,” Jeffries added.
Perhaps the most significant piece of legislation passed by Congress this year was the $95.3 billion emergency supplemental that sent a fresh infusion of military aid to a trio of allies: Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Johnson shepherded that package through the House in April, and attached legislation that would force the Chinese owner of TikTok to sell the popular video-sharing app after the election or risk a ban in the United States. Biden signed it into law.
That same month, Johnson also secured the renewal of a powerful U.S. surveillance program — known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or FISA — despite objections from his right flank. And the House overwhelmingly passed a $78 billion tax package — negotiated by Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., and Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore. — that includes an expansion of the child tax credit, though it’s held up in the Senate.
Asked about the stalled government funding process, Athina Lawson, a spokesperson for the speaker, pointed out the House has made more progress on its appropriations, or funding, bills than the Senate.
“The House has made significant progress in advancing FY25 appropriations bills. The House Appropriations Committee has diligently moved all 12 bills out of committee and the House has passed 75% of government funding for the upcoming fiscal year while the Senate has yet to even consider a single appropriations bill,” Lawson said. “The House will continue its successful effort to responsibly fund the government for FY25 when it returns from its district work period.”
Republicans had hoped to pass all 12 bills early to avoid another stopgap bill or, worse, getting jammed up with a massive omnibus funding bill by the Senate right at the deadline.
Roy, a Texas Republican and Freedom Caucus member, said the House “should have gotten all of them passed … before we left town.” But this time, he said Democrats were also to blame: “Talk to the Senate, talk to the White House.”
GOP Policy Chairman Gary Palmer, R-Ala., a member of Johnson's leadership team, also lamented that more progress wasn't made on the spending bills. 
""Well, I'm disappointed we didn't have all of them done by June 30,"" Palmer said as he left the Capitol on Thursday. When then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted last fall, Palmer said, Republicans ""needed to change the rules and put some real enforcement measures in place"" to get the bills done sooner.
""We ignore the schedule because there's no enforcement,"" he added. ""You've got to have consequences for not getting things done.""
Separately, the Senate next week is poised to pass a pair of popular bipartisan bills aimed at protecting children online, including from social media companies. But with the House now gone, the lower chamber won’t take them up until September at the earliest and possibly not until the lame-duck session after the Nov. 5 election.
Johnson has expressed general support for the children's privacy bills.
""Obviously, I believe in the purpose of the legislation,"" he said. ""I think it’s really important but there’s a couple of questions we have about the details, but I think we can work it out and I’d like to get it done. 
As they left for recess, Jeffries’ message of GOP chaos and dysfunction was echoed by rank-and-file Democrats, including some members who are facing tough re-election bids this fall.
“This is the exact type of chaos and do-nothing Congress that I fully believe the American people are going to reject in 2024,” said freshman Rep. Hillary Scholten, D-Mich. “We have to pass these appropriations bills. We have to do the farm bill, we have to get something done on immigration. The American people know it, they feel it. And this type of chaos is just not gonna stand.”
Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., argued that much of what House Republicans have done this Congress is use their majority and oversight powers to beat up on President Joe Biden, and now direct their attacks at his likely replacement at the top of the ticket.
“The Republicans spent the majority of this Congress on a completely bogus impeachment investigation of President Biden where they found no evidence of wrongdoing, much less any high crime or misdemeanor,” Goldman told reporters. “And as soon as he drops out, and Vice President Harris becomes the presumptive nominee, now all of a sudden all of their attention and their floor time is focused on sullying her up with false accusations.”
“It’s just continuing to use the official authority and official resources of Congress for partisan political electoral purposes, which is improper,” Goldman continued, “but it has been what the Republicans have done all term long, and it is the only thing that they can actually get passed.”Scott Wong is a senior congressional reporter for NBC News.

NBC_45,Texas man vanished from same Bahamas yoga retreat 10 years prior to Chicago woman,https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/texas-man-vanished-bahamas-yoga-retreat-missing-trans-woman-rcna163476,2024-07-26 03:00:02.815182,,"A Texas man went missing more than 10 years ago from the same Bahamas yoga retreat where a Chicago woman vanished last month, a spokesperson for the retreat confirmed.
Wesley Bell was last seen alive while attending a yoga retreat on Paradise Island in Nassau on Jan. 25, 2013, according to a missing persons flyer released by police at the time. He was attending a retreat at the Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat Bahamas, the same site from where Taylor Casey, 42, went missing last month, according to the retreat’s spokesperson, Jonathan Goldbloom.
“After an extensive search, the Bahamian police determined that he had drowned,” Goldbloom said Wednesday. He then referred NBC News to the Royal Bahamas Police Force.
The Royal Bahamas Police Force has not responded to multiple requests for comment from NBC News Digital over a span of nearly two weeks. The U.S. Embassy in the Bahamas did not return a request for comment on Bell’s missing person case. 
It appears there is no evidence of foul play in Bell’s case, though police have not commented on the matter.
In a brief phone call, his father, Don Bell, said he believes his son “drowned in the water” and added that authorities “couldn’t find him.” Bell’s mother, Marie Bell, said she had not heard about Taylor Casey going missing from the same retreat. The Bells declined to comment further and also referred NBC News to the Royal Bahamas Police Force and the U.S. Embassy.
The Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat Bahamas has been featured in The New York Times, Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop and HuffPost as a top travel destination. From 2012 to 2019, the retreat received a TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence annually. (Goop appears to have taken down its review of the retreat since the initial reports of Casey’s disappearance.)
Danniel Ward-Packard, who lives in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, said she was at the Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat Bahamas when Bell went missing in 2013. She remembers Bell as “always happy” and having “great energy,” adding that they were acquaintances rather than friends. 
Bell walked off by himself to go snorkeling one day and never returned, she said, adding that his shoes, shirt and hat were found on the beach the next day. 
“People were pretty traumatized,” Ward-Packard said. “It’s a beautiful place, everybody is having an amazing yoga experience in this gorgeous location and then somebody’s gone.”
Ward-Packard, 58, said she believes Bell drowned and cautioned against connecting Bell to Casey’s missing persons case. 
“People are turning a coincidence into a conspiracy,” she said, referring to posts on social media. “I can’t even imagine how they would be related.” 
Ward-Packard added that she’s always felt safe at the retreat and has been back at least twice since Bell’s disappearance.
The Bahamas has one of the highest levels of unintentional drowning in the Americas, according to the Pan American Health Organization, a United Nations health agency. For every 100,000 people, there were 6.4 unintentional drownings in the country, compared with 1.8 in the region throughout 2019, the agency found. 
New interest in Bell’s disappearance comes weeks after Casey disappeared from the retreat. 
Casey, who is Black and transgender, disappeared June 19, about halfway through a monthlong yoga instructor program at the retreat site. Her disappearance generated national headlines for several weeks.
Police have not indicated there is any evidence of foul play in Casey’s disappearance. While they discovered her phone about 50 feet out into the ocean, they have not been able to get inside the device. 
Several days after she was reported missing to police, Casey’s friends and family went to the site of the yoga retreat to meet with investigators and assist in the search. They cleared out the tent Casey was staying in, which they said still contained most of her personal belongings. However, they did not find her passport. 
Casey’s friends and family have repeatedly questioned, in media interviews and public remarks, the competence of police and actions of retreat staff during the investigation into Casey’s disappearance. On Wednesday, Collette Seymore, Casey’s mother, said that retreat staff told them that no one had gone missing from the site before her daughter.
“They told us one thing, but we found out another,” Seymore said.
She added that she has not heard from Bell’s family and declined to speculate about his missing person case. 
When asked about the apparent discrepancy, Goldbloom said in an email that “Bell’s disappearance was public knowledge and well-publicized at the time.” He added that retreat staff “cooperated fully with the investigation.”
Bahamian officials responded to what Casey’s family and friends have said to the press in a statement issued earlier this month, saying “the facts as they are now established do not bear the interpretations which are being described in the U.S. media and being advanced by various spokespersons.”
“We urge those making comments, therefore, not to prejudge this investigation by making comments that are manifestly prejudicial and untrue,” the Consul General of the Bahamas in Washington, D.C. wrote in the July 14 statement.
The Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat Bahamas has also consistently defended its actions in the days and weeks following Casey’s disappearance, and a spokesman for the retreat said that “police have advised that they believe that Taylor left the ashram voluntarily.”

NBC_46,Nikki Haley voters confront a new choice with the same skepticism,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/nikki-haley-voters-confront-new-choice-skepticism-rcna163218,2024-07-26 04:01:02.840804,,"Over little more than a week, former President Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt, President Joe Biden decided not to seek another term and Vice President Kamala Harris became the de facto Democratic nominee in his stead. And amid the churn, a new focus group of a key set of potential swing voters — supporters of Nikki Haley in the 2024 primaries — shows just how hardened  views of the 2024 election are.
Those who applauded Trump for adopting a conciliatory tone in the aftermath of the July 13 shooting now feel that he reverted to being the candidate they voted against in the Republican presidential nominating contest. Those who said they would vote for the Democratic presidential nominee in the fall were all already on board before Biden’s announcement. 
And those who were on the fence regarding the 2024 presidential race still feel like they are stuck there.
The conversations — as part of the NBC News Deciders Focus Group series, produced in collaboration with Engagious, Syracuse University and Sago — show that this group of people, who cast votes protesting against Trump’s Republican coronation earlier this year, are by and large unhappy with their choices in the fall.
Three participants plan to vote for Democrats again, just like they did in 2020. One currently plans not to vote. The remaining 10 focus group participants evenly split their votes between Trump and third-party candidates, either reluctantly choosing Trump because of their broader support for GOP policies or choosing a protest vote to signal their frustration with the direction of the party. 
“It may depend on where the tears fall on the ballot to determine who I cast my vote for,” said Audra B., a 53-year-old from Arizona, speaking about the choice between Trump and Harris. “I don’t like either one of them, but I’m also not going to not have my chance to vote. There are a lot of women who came before me to make sure I get this opportunity, and I don’t want to squander that.”
After eyeing both major party candidates and the third-party and independent options, Audra said, she’s currently planning to vote for Libertarian Chase Oliver after voting for Trump in 2020. 
Two others said that they supported Oliver, but unlike Audra, they both supported third-party candidates in 2020, too. 
“I think the Libertarian mostly falls in line with my views more than the other three [third-party candidates]. So it’s kind of, showing support for those ideas, and then hopefully people can see that there is a constituent out there and try to attract them more for the next election,” said Jason L., a 34-year-old from Arizona. 
“This would be the third presidential election in a row that I voted Libertarian and it has been a protest vote previously, as well as this election,” said John D., a 49-year-old from Wisconsin.
“And while I struggle with the fact that my candidate that I’m voting for doesn’t have the opportunity to win, kind of similar to what Jason said, my hope would be that the Libertarian candidate would gain enough votes to capture the attention of the other two parties and perhaps move their platform in that direction,” he continued.
Perhaps unsurprisingly for a group that didn’t back Trump in the GOP primary, the voters' impressions of Trump were broadly negative. When asked to say the first word that came to mind upon hearing his name, virtually all said something negative, including “egotistical,” “bombastic,” “polarizing” and “bully.”
“I like the way he ran the country, but I do not like the way he downgrades people. He calls people’s names, things like that. That’s uncalled for, he needs to improve that,” said Ronnie B., a 71-year-old from North Carolina who is backing Trump. 
The responses when Harris’ name was mentioned were more mixed. Most of the positive sentiment was from those already planning to vote Democratic in November. But Barbara Z., a 62-year-old Michigander who plans to support Trump in the fall, just like she did in 2020, said Harris was “interesting.” 
“I just like that she's a woman. It’s time to have a woman in the forefront,” Barbara said when asked what she liked about Harris. (She also said that she appreciated Trump’s handling of the economy but that he “thinks only for himself and not for the country.”) 
That said, most of these voters were lukewarm on Harris, at best broadly unfamiliar with specific policies or stances she’s taken. Many were critical of her, describing Harris as “sometimes catty,” “giggly” or “condescending,” or saying that sometimes she sounds like “word salad” when she speaks. 
“I think she’s out of her league, and there’s a lot more people, men or women — I mean, I’m saying women — that would be better qualified for that role,” said Dale J., a 67-year-old Minnesotan who is backing Trump. 
“Harris would have real challenges winning over most of these former Haley voters. They overwhelmingly questioned her readiness for the job despite her three and a half years as vice president,” said Margaret Talev, director of Syracuse University’s Institute for Democracy, Journalism & Citizenship in Washington.
“Several said they still don’t know much about her or associate her with Biden administration failures to control illegal immigration, and some raised gendered concerns about traits such as the way she laughs.” 
Haley finished second to Trump in the GOP primary, in some ways serving as an outlet for Republican-aligned voters to call for their party to move in a different direction instead of anointing Trump. Her criticism of Trump got more heated in the final weeks of her campaign before she dropped out (she referred to Trump as “unhinged” and “more diminished” in a February interview with NBC News, and said in January that “the first party to retire its 80-year-old candidate is going to be the one who wins this election.” 
Even after she dropped out, significant shares of Republican primary voters were still casting their ballots for her (including a handful of focus group participants). 
But even though Haley later came around, speaking at the Republican convention and endorsing Trump, these voters weren't swayed by her words, which they saw as more about her trying to stay politically viable.   
The massive shakeup at the top of the likely Democratic ticket didn’t change the minds of any participants as to which party they’d support in the fall. And they broadly agreed with the decision Biden made, even as they were, at times, critical of the president.  
“I do praise him because at the end of the day, he’s doing it for something higher than himself, he’s doing it for his party. So good on him. It’s not my party necessarily, but he’s doing something selfless,” said Zach R., a 30-year-old Wisconsinite supporting Trump. 
Jennifer S., a 49-year-old from Pennsylvania who said she’s leaning toward backing Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after voting for Trump in 2020, disagreed. 
“I don’t think he did it because it was the right thing to do. He did it because he had to,” she said. 
One main reason contributing to the lack of movement among these voters despite Biden’s big decision is that 10 of the 14 said that Harris represents a continuation of the Biden administration’s policies, of which they were broadly critical. 
“Many Haley primary voters watched the Democrats switch from Biden to Harris, and concluded the party has traded one set of candidate shortcomings for another,” said Rich Thau, president of Engagious, who moderated the sessions. 
But these voters largely dismissed Republican attacks on Biden arguing that he should resign from office if he can’t run for another term, as well as the argument that the move to promote Harris despite her not participating in the Democratic presidential nominating process this cycle is somehow anti-democratic. 
“The way I view it is the votes that were cast for Biden, were cast for the Biden-Harris ticket. So if Biden isn’t on the ticket, I believe it’s still a vote for Harris regardless because he had already identified her as his running mate,” said John D., the Wisconsinite voting for the Libertarian nominee. 
Not only did Harris’ elevation to the status of Democratic presidential front-runner change no one’s mind, there’s apparently little she can do with her vice presidential pick to bring these voters on board — outside of bringing Haley onto a unity ticket.  
That said, Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly appeared to be more familiar to this group of voters than other potential vice presidential contenders.  
""Mark Kelly is the only name that comes to mind,"" Cristel T. a  59-year-old from Georgia who voted for Biden in 2020 and plans to vote for Harris now. 
""He was an astronaut.""
Eight of these voters said that their views on Trump changed after he faced an assassination attempt. But that was short-lived for most, largely because they believe Trump backtracked on his call for unity.  
“I listened to the entire Republican convention, every night, and I heard the speeches, and then Trump said he tore up his original speech, which was his normal kind of right-at-you type. And came back with a unity speech, and he wasn’t going to use Joe Biden’s name, he wasn’t going to call him names anymore. And then my respect for him went way up,” said Ronnie B., the North Carolina voter voting for Trump. 
“What he said lasted about three days and now he’s back to his old self. … It appears he’s going back to the way he was,” Ronnie continued.
Dale J., the Minnesotan voting for Trump, agreed. 
“He was a little more vulnerable and he had a more human side to him,” he said, before adding, “I think he’s probably changed, but he’s changing back.”
“While the assassination attempt against Trump, and his own suggestions he was a changed man, made him more empathetic to some of these voters, he mostly erased their goodwill or hopes with his own 93-minute convention speech,” Talev added.Ben Kamisar is a national political reporter for NBC News"
NBC_47,OpenAI announces a search engine called SearchGPT; Alphabet shares dip,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/openai-announces-search-engine-called-searchgpt-alphabet-shares-dip-rcna163716,2024-07-26 04:00:02.840804,,"OpenAI on Thursday announced a prototype of its own search engine, called SearchGPT, which aims to give users “fast and timely answers with clear and relevant sources.”
The company said it eventually plans to integrate the tool, which is currently being alpha-tested with a small group of users, into its viral chatbot, ChatGPT.
Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, Alphabet investors have been concerned that OpenAI could take market share from Google in search by giving consumers new ways to seek information online. With this prototype, OpenAI is testing the waters for doing just that, promising users the chance to “search in a more natural, intuitive way” and ask follow-up questions “just like you would in a conversation.”
“We think there is room to make search much better than it is today,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote Thursday in a post on X.
Alphabet shares were trading about 2.5% lower on Thursday, while the Nasdaq was up slightly.
In May, Google launched AI Overview, which CEO Sundar Pichai called the biggest change in search in 25 years, to a limited audience, allowing users to see a summary of answers to queries at the very top of Google Search.
Though Google had been working on AI Overview for more than a year, public criticism mounted after users quickly noticed that queries returned nonsensical or inaccurate results within the AI feature — without any way to opt out.
The SearchGPT announcement follows OpenAI’s launch last Thursday of a new AI model, “GPT-4o mini.” The new model is an offshoot of GPT-4o, the startup’s fastest and most powerful model to date, which it launched in May during a livestreamed event with executives. 
OpenAI, backed by Microsoft, has been valued at more than $80 billion by investors. The company, founded in 2015, is under pressure to stay on top of the generative AI market while finding ways to make money as it spends massive sums on processors and infrastructure to build and train its models.
Last Month, OpenAI announced the hiring of two top executives as well as a partnership with Apple that includes a ChatGPT-Siri integration. Sarah Friar, previously CEO of Nextdoor and finance chief at Square, joined as chief financial officer, and Kevin Weil, an ex-president at Planet Labs and former senior vice president at Twitter and a vice president at Facebook and Instagram, joined as chief product officer.
OpenAI is bolstering its C-suite as its large language models gain importance across the tech sector and as competition rapidly emerges in the burgeoning generative artificial intelligence market. 
Both OpenAI’s new mini AI model and the prototype of SearchGPT are also part of the company’s push to be at the forefront of “multimodality,” or the ability to offer a wide range of types of AI-generated media, like text, images, audio, video and search, inside one tool: ChatGPT.
For SearchGPT, OpenAI’s blog post said the tool’s visual results will lead to “richer understanding” for users.
Last year, OpenAI Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap told CNBC: “The world is multimodal. If you think about the way we as humans process the world and engage with the world, we see things, we hear things, we say things — the world is much bigger than text. So to us, it always felt incomplete for text and code to be the single modalities, the single interfaces that we could have to how powerful these models are and what they can do.”Hayden Field is a CNBC reporter"
NBC_48,Here are some money moves to make before the Fed starts cutting interest rates,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/are-money-moves-make-fed-starts-cutting-interest-rates-rcna163710,2024-07-26 04:00:02.840804,,"With interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve on the horizon, it could be a good time to shift cash, experts say.  
Traders expect a rate cut in September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, which could lower the target range for the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point or more.
Meanwhile, many investors are sitting on hefty cash allocations, including trillions in money market funds, which are generally still paying above 5%.
After a series of rate hikes, investors piled into money market funds, which typically invest in shorter-term, lower-credit-risk debt, such as Treasury bills.
Total U.S. money market funds hovered near a record of $6.15 trillion as of July 17, with $2.48 trillion in funds for retail investors, according to Investment Company Institute data.
However, money market fund yields will likely fall if the Fed starts cutting rates in September, explained Ken Tumin, founder and editor of DepositAccounts.
“Most [money market funds] seem to closely follow the federal funds rate,” he said.
Next week’s Fed meeting could signal whether a September rate cut will happen. But banks typically start slashing rates for high-yield savings accounts and certificates of deposits ahead of Fed rate cuts, Tumin said.
“CD rates will likely fall pretty quickly once it becomes clear that the Fed is on the verge of cutting,” he said.
As of July 25, the top 1% average rate for high-yield savings accounts was hovering below 5%, while the top 1% for one-year CDs was around 5.5%, according to DepositAccounts.
CD rates will likely fall pretty quickly once it becomes clear that the Fed is on the verge of cutting.
It is a great time to “lock in rates” for a 9-month or one-year CD, said certified financial planner Ted Jenkin, CEO and founder of oXYGen Financial in Atlanta. Jenkin is a member of CNBC’s Financial Advisor Council.
When building a bond portfolio, advisors consider duration, which measures a bond’s sensitivity to interest rate changes. Expressed in years, the duration formula includes the coupon, time to maturity and yield paid through the term.
Some experts suggest shifts from money market funds to longer-duration bonds for longer-term investments, which could pay off once interest rates fall.
Bond prices typically rise as interest rates fall, whereas money market fund investors can expect lower yields without price appreciation.
While it is difficult to predict Fed policy, bonds could see “a healthy lift” if the Fed cuts interest rates by a full percentage point over the next year, Jenkin said.

NBC_49,"Boeing's crewed Starliner flight won't return until at least August, NASA says",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/boeings-crewed-starliner-flight-wont-return-least-august-nasa-says-rcna163709,2024-07-26 04:00:02.840804,,"Boeing’s crew spacecraft Starliner will stay docked with the International Space Station into August, NASA confirmed on Thursday, as the mission remains on hold while the company and agency study problems that arose early in the flight.
Starliner capsule “Calypso,” which carried NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the ISS, has now been in space 50 days and counting. The Boeing crew flight test has been extended several times while NASA conducted testing back on the ground prior to clearing the spacecraft to carry the pair of astronauts back to Earth.
NASA’s Commercial Crew manager Steve Stich said during a press conference Thursday that the agency was not prepared to set a return date.
“We’re making great progress, but we’re just not quite ready to do that,” Stich said.
NASA needs to conduct a review that won’t happen until the first week of August, Stich said, and only after that review will the agency schedule Starliner’s return.
The indefinite extension of Starliner’s flight test is difficult to put into context of other human spaceflights due to the unique circumstances and developmental nature of the mission. Any crewed spaceflight comes with heightened risk and scrutiny. Originally, Calypso was expected to spend a minimum of nine days in space before returning.
“I think we all knew that it was going to go longer than that. We didn’t spend a lot of time talking about how much longer, but I think it’s my regret that we we didn’t just say we’re going to stay up there until we get everything done that we want to go to do,” Stich said on Thursday.
Both NASA and Boeing leadership have repeatedly stressed that Wilmore and Williams “are not stranded in space.” Officials previously said that Starliner is safe to return in the event of an emergency and that the pair of astronauts are enjoying the extra time on the ISS and assisting the rest of the station’s crew with tasks in the meantime.
Boeing and NASA earlier this month began testing the spacecraft’s malfunctioning propulsion system back on the ground in White Sands, New Mexico.
Stich and Boeing’s Mark Nappi, vice president of the Starliner program, outlined the next steps that must be completed before making the call on when to bring back Starliner.
Boeing on Thursday is finishing dissection of the thruster that was tested in New Mexico. On Thursday afternoon, NASA and Boeing will hold a mission management meeting to plan the docked test firings that are expected to happen on Saturday or Sunday. Then, on Monday or Tuesday, the teams will do “an integrated assessment of all the data” from the docked tests, Stich said, before “some significant education of [NASA] leadership” ahead the final big review, also known as “Agency Flight Test Readiness Review.”
Stich also acknowledged again that NASA has contingency plans in case the agency determines that Starliner should return without Wilmore and Williams — alternatives that include using SpaceX’s Dragon capsule to bring back NASA’s astronauts.
“NASA always has contingency options. We know a little bit of what those are, and we haven’t worked on them a whole bunch, but we kind of know what those are,” Stich said. “Right now we’re really focused on bringing Butch and Suni home on Starliner.”"
NBC_50,How to avoid hair damage when swimming,https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-hair-care-for-swimmers-rcna163645,2024-07-26 04:00:02.840804,,"It’s the ultimate conundrum: you want to take a dip in the pool to cool off, but don’t want to wreck your hair in the process. Chlorine and ocean water can affect hair’s moisture levels and color, but adopting a good hair care routine can help curb these adverse reactions.
According to Yvey Valcin, a Seattle-based hairstylist and the founder of Yvey Salon, it’s important to understand any already-existing hair damage and what’s needed to bring your hair back to a healthy state. “What the hair needs always comes first, what you want to see your hair doing should come second and how you want your hair to be seen should come third,” he says.
We spoke with a hair stylist, an Olympian and a scalp expert about the best hair care products for swimmers and what to look for when shopping. We also put together a list of what to shop based on their recommendations and guidance.
SKIP AHEAD How we picked the best hair care products for swimmers | The best hair care products for swimmers in 2024 | How to shop for the best hair care products for swimmers
The right hair care products for swimmers can help restore moisture, detangle and protect your hair color, according to our experts. When shopping they recommend keeping the following factors in mind: 
Kerry Yates, trichologist and the founder of Colour Collective, recommends this color-safe clarifying shampoo from Oribe. It comes in an aerosol can and has a foaming, mousse-like consistency that lathers nicely, making it easy to distribute from scalp to ends, says Yates. The volcanic ash in the formula is responsible for exfoliating the scalp and getting rid of buildup (it’s also what gives the formula its dark gray tint), and the green tea extract in it protects against breakage, according to the brand.
“Exposure to salt water can cause dryness and brittleness, and when sun exposure is thrown into the mix, the adverse effects are exacerbated,” says Yates, who recommends this hair and scalp SPF for both sun and hair protection. The formula is water-resistant for up to 80 minutes and has a spray applicator that’s easy to spritz onto the scalp and your strands if you’re at the pool or oceanside.
Keana Hunter, first-time Olympian and artistic swimmer based in Los Angeles, is a fan of this shampoo and conditioner duo, saying that it “moisturizes [her] heavily dry and damaged hair.” The set, which is safe for color-treated hair, also helps maintain her blonde color. The formula’s all-star ingredient is manuka honey, a humectant that helps draw water, according to the brand. It also includes a blend of nourishing ingredients like mafura oil, fig extract, vitamin C and baobab oil.
“I use this hair oil after practice to help with dry ends and add the shine back to my blonde hair,” says Hunter. “This really helps my hair be less frizzy.” The formula protects color-treated hair from fading and discoloration thanks to African galanga root extract, while the medley of oils addresses signs of dryness, frizz and damage, according to Ouai. It also gives a shiny finish to the hair, which is great if you’re dealing with dullness or brittleness.
“I often recommend this balancing shampoo to clients who love to be in the water,” says Valcin. “It’s best used right after swimming to remove chlorine or salt from your hair.” The formula consists of two essential ingredients, amino acid and vitamin B6, which work together to remove excess oil from the scalp and repair hair that’s been dried out from chlorine or salt water.
This leave-in conditioner is lightweight, color-safe and provides frizz management and hydration for up to 72 hours, according to the brand. I particularly love this formula because it has different benefits for wet and dry hair. To use on damp hair, I apply a small amount from the mid-lengths of my hair to my ends and comb through — this protects against heat damage and prevents breakage. On dry hair, I apply it just to my tips four to five days after a blowout to make my ends appear less frayed and frizzy. It also has a subtle jasmine scent that’s not overpowering.
For Hunter, this leave-in treatment helps alleviate tangled, unruly hair. “When I apply this to my hair it immediately smooths it out and moisturizes my split ends,” she says. Because it’s a great detangler, it works for those with curly hair, those who wear their hair up often or those prone to knots and tangles after wearing a swim cap. To use, apply a small amount onto damp hair and brush through with a wide tooth comb.
As an added protective layer, Yates says to apply this leave-in conditioning spray before going swimming. The leave-conditioner works to detangle, smooth and reintroduce hydration into the hair via a mix of honey, aloe vera and tamanu oil. It also comes out as a lightweight mist, making it easy to control and apply to your desired area.
If you’re struggling with severely damaged hair, whether it be from chlorine, coloring, heat or all of the above, this restorative hair mask from Dove Beauty is a great fix. More potent than a typical conditioner, the hair mask uses peptides to reduce frizz, prevent breakage and detangle.
I currently use this mask as part of my normal hair care routine and enjoy that the thick consistency feels substantial on my 2B curls. Since I started using it, I’ve found that my hair is softer and shinier after a blowout, my frizz is greatly diminished and my dry ends appear hydrated and healthy.
When looking for hair care products, consider what the formula’s main intention is. For instance, some products are meant to boost moisture while others help prevent color fade. Similarly, hair oils and serums can both help damaged hair, but they function in different ways. Hair serums provide nourishment, while hair oils form a protective layer to shield against heat damage or chlorine. “Both oils and serums are crucial to protecting your hair before and after getting in a chlorinated pool,” says Valcin.
Pool chlorine can have damaging effects on all hair types and textures. “Being a swimmer, my hair experiences a lot of damage, especially since we don’t wear a cap when we compete,” says Hunter. Some frustrations she experiences from chlorine include breakage, dryness and knots.
While chlorine comes with negative side effects for your hair, there are ways to prevent and treat damage. 
“Using a clarifying shampoo is a great option to remove any chemicals from the water off your hair,” says Valcin. These formulas provide a deeper cleanse compared to traditional shampoos, effectively getting rid of chlorine, product buildup and hard water minerals in the hair. While all hair types can benefit from a clarifying shampoo, you shouldn’t use it as often as a traditional shampoo (aim for two times a month) because it could strip the hair and scalp of its natural oils. To use, apply a small amount to your scalp and gently massage for a few minutes. Rinse it with warm water and follow up with something moisturizing to seal the cuticles — Valcin recommends a leave-in conditioner, hair serum or moisturizing hair mask.

FOX_1,5 key takeaways of Biden's address to the nation from the Oval Office,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/5-key-takeaways-bidens-address-nation-oval-office,2024-07-25 21:26:02.702650,politics,"Former President Donald Trump spoke with the 'Fox & Friends' co-hosts about President Biden's Oval Office address, his plan to take on VP Kamala Harris, the latest on the assassination attempt and accusations of his involvement in Project 2025.
President Biden delivered an approximately 11-minute address to the nation from the Oval Office on Wednesday. 
While sitting behind the Resolute Desk, surrounded by portraits of American presidents, Biden spoke of his decision to discontinue his re-election campaign and laid out his plan for the remainder of his term. 
The 81-year-old president, after recovering from a reported COVID-19 case last week, also spoke repeatedly about ""defending democracy."" 
Here are five key takeaways from the address that comes at a pivotal moment of the election cycle as Vice President Harris, with Biden's endorsement, vies to become the Democratic nominee for president. 
BIDEN ADDRESSES DECISION TO DROP OUT OF 2024 RACE, INTENDS TO COMPLETE TERM IN WHITE HOUSE

1. Biden offers an explanation about deciding to step aside from the race 
The president said that when he was elected to office, he promised to ""always level with you, to tell you the truth."" 
That truth, Biden said, is that the ""sacred cause of this country is larger than any one of us,"" and those dedicated to the ""cause of American democracy must unite to protect it."" 
""In recent weeks, it's become clear to me that I need to unite my party in this critical endeavor. I believed my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future all merited a second term. But nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,"" Biden said. ""That includes personal ambition. So I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It's the best way to unite our nation. You know, there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. There's also a time and place for new voices. Fresh voices. Yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now."" 
2. Biden vows to reform the Supreme Court 
The president laid out his plan for the remaining six months of his first term. 
""I'm going to call for Supreme Court reform because this is critical to our democracy, Supreme Court reform,"" Biden said, without elaborating. 
He also vowed to ""continue to lower costs for hard-working families,"" grow the economy, defend personal freedoms and civil rights ""from the right to vote to the right to choose."" The president said he would continue work on the ""cancer moonshot,"" which was part of his 2020 campaign promise to end cancer as we know it and mobilize the federal government to speed progress in cancer research.

TRUMP SLAMS BIDEN'S 'TERRIBLE' OVAL OFFICE ADDRESS ON ABRUPT EXIT FROM 2024 RACE: 'IT WAS A COUP'
3. Biden condemns political violence, without directly addressing the assassination attempt on former President Trump. 
""I'll keep calling out hate and extremism. Make it clear [that] there is no place, no place in America for political violence or any violence that ever. Period,"" Biden said, while listing priorities for the rest of his term. 
Trump survived an assassination attempt on July 13 at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, sending a unifying shock wave throughout the Republican Party, which formally named him their nominee the following week. 
4. Biden references ""kings and dictators"" when reiterating his support for Harris as the Democratic presidential nominee 
""I'd like to thank our great Vice President, Kamala Harris. She's experienced. She's tough. She's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country. Now the choice is up to you, the American people. When you make that choice, remember the words of Benjamin Franklin's hanging on my wall here in the Oval Office, alongside the busts of Doctor King and Rosa Parks and Cesar Chavez,"" Biden said. 
The president recalled how, when Franklin emerged from the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, he was asked whether the country would be a monarchy or a republic. 
Franklin famously was quoted as responding, ""a republic, if you can keep it."" 
Biden also touted his more than 50 years of service to the nation. 
""The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do,"" he said. Biden has previously accused Trump of wanting to be a dictator.
Biden noted the country emerged from the ""worst pandemic in a century, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, [and] the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.""

5. Biden boasts that he is the first U.S. president of this century without Americans at war anywhere in the world""I will keep working to ensure America remains strong, secure in the leader of the free world. I'm the first president of this century to report to the American people that the United States is not a war anywhere in the world,"" Biden said. The claim comes as the Biden administration received heavy criticism over its botched withdrawal from Afghanistan. 
During his debate against Trump last month, Biden made the stunning omission of the 13 U.S. service members killed at Abbey Gate when claiming no U.S. troops were killed while he was in office.

Biden in his Oval Office address also vowed to ""keep rallying a coalition of proud nations"" to prevent Russian President Vladimir Putin from taking over Ukraine, promised to make NATO ""more powerful and more united than any time in all of our history"" and said he would support allies in the Pacific, claiming that it is no longer ""conventional wisdom"" that China would surpass the United States. 
Regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict, Biden vowed to ""end the war in Gaza, bring home all the hostages to bring peace and security to the Middle East.""

The Fair Election Fund, a recently formed national election integrity watchdog group, is announcing this week it is awarding an initial $50,000 in ""bounties"" to whistleblowers who have reported first-hand knowledge of voter fraud or irregularities across four states, including North Carolina and Michigan.
The Fair Election fund was set up earlier this year pledging millions of dollars to promote election integrity by paying and protecting whistleblowers on the front lines who are able to identify issues at polling places and election offices.
The group says it has heard from numerous whistleblowers across the country reporting issues receiving multiple ballots, delayed ballots, mailing address errors, independent parties blocked from overseeing counting, receiving ballots without requesting one and other issues.

""The Fair Election Fund today is sharing the stories of the first brave whistleblowers who stepped up and exposed the wrongdoing they saw in the election process and we are grateful for their contribution. We must shine a light on these abuses and root out election fraud before Americans head to the polls this November.""

Former President Donald Trump slammed President Biden's Oval Office address on his exit from the 2024 presidential race, calling it a ""terrible"" speech while accusing Democrats of staging a coup against the president.
Trump reacted to Biden's remarks during ""Fox & Friends"" Thursday, arguing he left more questions than answers Wednesday night on the abrupt end of his presidential campaign.

""I think it was a coup. They didn't want him running. He was way down in the polls, and they thought he was going to lose,"" Trump said. ""They went to him and they said, you can't win the race, which I think is true, unless I did something very foolish, which I wasn't going to do, and I think he was so far down and they said, 'You're not going to win, and you're not in great shape, and you did poorly in the debate.' I think the debate started everything.""
""I know a lot of people on the other side, too, that they went, and they forced him out between Pelosi and Obama and some others that you see on television. It was interesting,"" he continued. ""I'd watch them on television and they act so nice. ‘Oh, yes, we loved you. We loved you behind the scenes.’ I know for a fact they were brutal.""
Biden addressed the nation for the first time on Wednesday since bowing out of the 2024 election on Sunday, saying he is passing the torch to ""a new generation"" while again throwing his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris in her campaign to secure the Democratic Party's nomination. 
""I decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It's the best way to unite our nation. You know, there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. There's also a time and place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now,"" Biden said.

The speech lasted roughly 11 minutes, with the president sitting at the Resolute desk in the Oval Office while touting his years in political office and decision to bow out. Members of the president's family were in attendance for the speech, including first lady Jill Biden, daughter Ashley Biden, son Hunter Biden and others. 
""It was like a terrible speech and terrible delivery,"" Trump said. ""He looked like he was having problems, and yet you watch the other networks and you would think he was Ronald Reagan in his prime, Winston Churchill in his prime, and he wasn't. It was not good… It was not a good speech.""
""It's so phony what's going on,"" he continued. ""The press is so – it's so fake. Anybody can see it was a problem.""
Biden announced his exit from the presidential race in an X post while self-isolating in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, after a COVID-19 diagnosis last Wednesday. After suffering ""mild symptoms"" and ""general malaise"" after his diagnosis, he received a negative diagnosis on Tuesday this week and returned to the White House.
His trip to the nation's capital on Tuesday marked the first time Biden was seen in public since suspending his re-election bid and the first time since being diagnosed with COVID-19 on July 17. 
""I knew there was a palace coup going on, and I assumed that she'd be probably getting it,"" Trump said of Harris. ""She had the advantage.""

Detroit-based Pastor Lorenzo Sewell said on Wednesday that ""we need to stop"" playing identity politics, reacting to Vice President Kamala Harris becoming the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.
""It would be amazing to have the first Black woman president, I think that would be cool,"" Sewell, the pastor of 180 Church on Detroit's west side, told ABC 7.
""But we need to stop playing identify politics as well,"" he added. 
The pastor, who spoke at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin last week, went on to say, ""You don't have anything more powerful in America than a Black woman, so I understand there are allegiances there, but sometimes that can be misguided. I've had people call me this afternoon and say 'vote for Kamala Harris because she’s Black.' That doesn't resonate with me right?""

ABC 7 reported further that Sewell said that he has not publicly endorsed any candidate for the 2024 presidential election and that he never intended being ""front and center with the Trump campaign."" 
Sewell hosted former President Trump at his church in June in addition to speaking at the RNC last week.
""If President Trump would've moved just a millimeter, we would not be hearing tonight how he is going to make America great again,"" Sewell said at the GOP convention. 
Sewell added that the Black community has been ""hurting"" under the Democratic leadership.
""When we look at our community, we see clearly that our community is hurting and it's been under Democratic leadership,"" Sewell said. 
""I'm not saying for the last 60 years Democrats are doing the wrong thing. What I'm saying is that when you look at our community, specifically Detroit, Pontiac, Flint, and Saginaw, we're hurting. And the Republican Party is saying 'I want to have a conversation.'""

Furthermore, Sewell said that a growing number of Black men are shifting support toward the Republican Party. 
The ABC local affiliate also interviewed Black voters about their thoughts on Trump.
Tayson Stewart, 27, said that ""Trump looks like he's trying to help us."" 
""… he looks like he knows what he’s talking about,"" Detroit-based Stewart said.
""The Black voters are asleep. They are going to vote for Kamala because they following Biden, and don't do it. Trump really trying to help us, that’s what I think.""
""I'm terrified if that man is in there,"" Detroit-based Leon Crosby, 57, said about Trump. 
""I'd be terrified as an African American,"" Crosby added.

Trump, who was formally nominated last week at the Republican National Convention as the GOP's 2024 presidential nominee, stands at 46% support among registered voters in an NPR/PBS News/Marist Poll released on Tuesday.
Harris, who on Monday night announced that she'd locked up her party's nomination by landing commitments of backing from a majority of the nearly 4,000 delegates to next month's Democratic National Convention, stood at 45% support.
The poll was conducted on Monday, the day after President Biden's announcement that he was ending his 2024 re-election rematch with Trump. 
Sewell's comments came amid Harris facing scrutiny over her qualifications to be commander in chief.
Tennessee Republican Rep. Tim Burchett on Monday called Harris a ""DEI hire"" in an interview with CNN, suggesting that Harris was selected as vice president solely because she was a Black woman.
""One hundred percent she is a DEI hire,"" Burchett told CNN’s Manu Raju. He continued, ""Her record is abysmal at best.""

Biden, who is 81 and has faced criticism from both Republicans and Democrats over his physical appearances and mental acuity after the first presidential debate, did not mention any personal reasons for why he is stepping away.
""In recent weeks, it has become clear to me that I need to unite my party in this critical endeavor.

Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., holds up a sign with the words 'war criminal' on it during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to the United States Congress, July 24 2024.
Several commentators on social media condemned Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., for protesting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday with a sign calling him a ""war criminal.""
Netanyahu tore into Gaza cease-fire demonstrations across the U.S. and accused Iran of funding those protests during an impassioned address. While many have praised him for his leadership and for his speech to Americans, not all politicians were happy to see him, with several Democrats skipping the event.
Among those in the chamber was Tlaib, a Palestinian American who is one of Israel's harshest critics in the House of Representatives. Tlaib has called for Netanyahu to be arrested by the International Criminal Court (ICC). She staged a silent protest for much of his speech, holding a double-sided sign that read ""guilty of genocide"" on one side and ""war criminal"" on the other.
Fox News Digital observed a member of the House sergeant-at-arms' staff speaking to Tlaib multiple times, after which she put the sign down, but that didn’t stop social media from erupting over her display.

While we knew that she was a lawbreaker, we had no idea she'd been in a war and broke the law. Not surprised,"" The Blaze contributor Allen Mashburn wrote, joking that the sign applied to Tlaib.
Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton condemned the congresswoman, ""Breaking: Terrorist supporter sits in Congress.""

Tlaib also defended her display on X, sharing a photo and writing, ""I will never back down in speaking truth to power. The apartheid government of Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians. Palestinians will not be erased. Solidarity with all those outside of these walls in the streets protesting and exercising their right to dissent.""

Melania Trump may be returning to the White House as her husband, former President Trump, aims to make a historic comeback in November, this time against Vice President Kamala Harris, the new presumptive Democratic nominee who emerged swiftly after President Biden announced his exit from the race. 
The former first lady has largely kept a low profile since leaving the White House but recently appeared at last week's Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where her husband officially became the Republican nominee.

Just days prior, she released a statement calling for national unity following the assassination attempt against the former president. 
""When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realized my life, and Barron’s life, were on the brink of devastating change… A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald’s passion - his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration. The core facets of my husband’s life - his human side - were buried below the political machine,"" the statement read. ""Donald, the generous and caring man who I have been with through the best of times and the worst of times,"" the former first lady wrote. ""Let us not forget that differing opinions, policy, and political games are inferior to love. Our personal, structural, and life commitment - until death - is at serious risk. Political concepts are simple when compared to us, human beings. We are all humans, and fundamentally, instinctively, we want to help one another.

Dawn is here again. Let us reunite. Now. This morning, ascend above the hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence. We all want a world where respect is paramount, family is first, and love transcends. We can realize this world again. Each of us must demand to get it back.

President Biden's tenure in the White House expires in January, and political insiders from both sides of the aisle believe the remaining six months of his lame-duck presidency will consist largely of the same routine and ""absolutely nothing.""
Biden suspended his 2024 re-election campaign on Sunday, noting in a statement that he believed it ""is in the best interests of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term.""
Biden's announcement, which included his ""full support and endorsement"" for Vice President Harris to take over as the party's presidential nominee, led many Americans and political pundits to question what that fulfillment of duties will look like and whether the president will see through any meaningful policies or changes during his remaining months in office.
Former Democrat presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard, who represented Hawaii's 2nd Congressional District in the House from 2013 to 2021, said she sees little change coming Americans' way in the next six months, insisting Biden ""hasn't been the one making decisions"" on key issues all along.

""Clearly, President Biden hasn’t been the one making decisions on our country’s domestic and foreign policy for the last three and a half years,"" she said. ""The same unelected people running the country with Biden as their figurehead will continue to do so for as long as he is in office and with Kamala Harris, if she’s elected.""
""The people who’ve been actually running the country are the unelected power elite from the administrative state, national security state and military industrial complex working hand-in-glove with the propaganda media acting as their agents,"" she added. ""Their goal is to remain in power at any and all costs, and [they] have already shown they are willing to do whatever it takes to defeat and destroy [former President] Donald Trump, as he is the greatest threat to their power.""
Biden's unprecedented announcement came as an increasing number of Democrat lawmakers publicly called for him to step aside, with the party's leadership reportedly engaged in efforts to convince the 81-year-old president he could not win the November general election against Trump, the 2024 GOP nominee who he defeated four years ago to win the White House.

FOX NEWS MEDIA PROPOSES TRUMP-HARRIS DEBATE MODERATED BY MARTHA MACCALLUM, BRET BAIER
""There is almost nothing that Biden can achieve in the next six months, other than treading water and maintaining the status quo,"" he said. ""If the White House were smart, it would double down on its support for Israel and make clear that the Democrats understand moral clarity on fighting what is in effect the Ku Klux Klan on the banks of the Mediterranean.""
American Majority CEO and founder Ned Ryun echoed Epstein's assessment, saying he believes there's ""absolutely nothing"" Biden will be able to accomplish in the shadows of Harris' presidential campaign.
""First, there’s no way anyone on either side of the aisle would want to push the envelope as they have their own re-elections to worry about,"" Ryan said. ""[Senate Majority Leader] Chuck Schumer would never let anything overtly problematic come to the floor in the Senate because it’s a terrible map already; he doesn’t need to make it even harder for them to try and hold majority.""
""So Biden will achieve precisely nothing, except via executive orders, as he’s beyond a lame-duck president and shouldn’t even still be in office,"" he added.

House Republicans are questioning whether Vice President Kamala Harris was aware of any signs of cognitive decline in President Biden before his performance in last month’s presidential debate prompted similar concerns among the wider public.
""I don’t see how anybody in the president's inner circle could not have known about his cognitive decline,"" House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, told Fox News Digital when asked about Harris. 
McCaul, who’s met with Biden twice since he took office in January 2021, said, during the second meeting earlier this year, the president ""didn’t seem to quite comprehend things very well.""
""It was very noticeable to the members of the meeting. There was something — maybe he was just having a bad day,"" McCaul said.

Other GOP lawmakers were more pointed in their criticism of Harris, pointing to reports she and Biden had been together in small group settings, including one-on-one lunches.
""If you look at video from six months ago, three months ago, when she continued to appear before large groups of people and say, ‘The president’s fine, he's doing great,’ you know, they were all in on this,"" Rep. Scott Fitzgerald, R-Wis., said. ""As a result of that, you know, we find ourselves in the really strange position of not knowing whether or not he can fulfill his duties.""
Harris announced Sunday she would be running for president after the 81-year-old Biden dropped out of the race.

The administration’s GOP critics have accused Democrats of staging a ""coup"" against Biden because all polls indicated he was positioned to lose to former President Trump, though left-wing lawmakers have rejected those claims and insisted anyone was free to challenge Harris.
The Republican attacks have included questions over whether Harris saw Biden operate privately the way he did on the debate stage against Trump in June, speaking with a hoarse, meandering tone and, at times, appearing confused.
""It's clear that she has watched his decline and done nothing to bring it to light or to take action,"" said Rep. Ben Cline, R-Va. ""Instead, what we see is her involvement in one of the greatest cover-ups in our nation's history.""

Fox News host Sean Hannity unpacks Vice President Kamala Harris’ voting record as she runs for the presidency on ""Hannity."" 
SEAN HANNITY: Joe Biden can barely talk, but Democrats, the state-run media mob, they now want you to believe that Joe Biden is too far gone for a political campaign but he can somehow still carry out his duties as president for another six months. He looked, as usual, weak, frail and a cognitive mess.  
ADAM SCHIFF CLAIMS HE WASN'T PART OF 'COORDINATED EFFORT' TO FORCE BIDEN OUT 
We told you this before the 2020 election. Now, these are the same people, only a few weeks ago, that told you Biden was sharp as a tack and the videos we showed you, that were unedited of his decline, were cheap fake videos. The same people who now want you to believe that Kamala Harris is the second coming of Jesus. We're now less than a week into Kamala's ascension as her party's presidential nominee.

The honeymoon phase, you know the sugar high, is fully underway and breaking tonight, Democrats just finalized a plan to nominate Harris before the convention to prevent any debate or competition. 
Meanwhile, the state-run media mob … are gushing over Harris, scrubbing her radical record. They now claim that the real border czar was never really the border czar.

President Biden addressed the nation Wednesday from the Oval Office for the first time since announcing over the weekend that he was withdrawing from the 2024 race and passing the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris. 
Fox News chief political analyst Brit Hume reacted to the roughly 11-minute address, saying he doesn’t quite buy Biden’s reasoning for dropping out of the presidential race. 
DEMOCRATS THROWN INTO CHAOS AS THEY FACE TIGHT DEADLINE TO REPLACE BIDEN
""To hear the president tell it, he was fine with running for re-election, thought he could win the race and serve for four more years until sometime between Saturday night and Sunday morning, when it dawned on him, apparently, that it was time for a new generation of leaders,"" Hume said.

Politico reported that Biden told his senior aides early Saturday his campaign was moving ""full steam ahead"" despite growing calls from members of his party to step aside after a disastrous performance at the CNN Presidential Debate in Atlanta. 
However, later that evening, the president appeared to change his mind about the direction of his re-election bid after speaking with two of his closest aides.

In his fourth address to the nation, the 46th president said the only way to move forward is to ""pass the torch to a new generation."" 
Biden reflected on his administration’s successes throughout the past three years but argued he wouldn’t be seeking re-election because the ""defense of democracy"" is ""more important than any title.""
""There was enough mention of democracy and the sacredness of it to suggest that it was more than a little political motivation in his speech, since democracy and the salvation of it has been such a theme of his and Kamala Harris's election program,"" Hume told Fox News anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum. ""But it was quite a conversion overnight, it seems, if you believe it. I'm not sure I do.""
""I think when we all look back on this in the fullness of time and perhaps with a better explanation of exactly the decision-making process the president went through, it will be seen as inevitable once that debate happened that he would have to step aside and that someone else would have to come forward,"" he continued.

""It was like something he could have given in January of 2025. It rang hollow for me,"" she noted.

FOX_12,Doctors react after Biden’s live address to the nation: A concerning ‘lack of emotion’,https://www.foxnews.com/health/doctors-react-bidens-live-address-nation-lack-emotion,2024-07-25 11:00:02.702650,politics,"President Biden addresses the nation from the Oval Office for the first time since dropping out of the 2024 race.
After President Biden’s address to the nation Wednesday night, multiple doctors shared their opinions with Fox News Digital about his perceived health status based on his live speech.
Seated in the Oval Office, the president spoke relatively briefly about his withdrawal from the 2024 race and his commitment to continuing to serve the country for the next few months. 
He did not mention his recent COVID-19 infection, ongoing concerns about his cognitive health, or the recent assassination attempt on the life of former President Donald Trump.
AFTER BIDEN DROPS OUT OF RACE, DOCTORS REVEAL WHY THE DECISION MAY HAVE BEEN BEST FOR HIS HEALTH
Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and a Fox News medical contributor — who has never treated the president — noted that Biden seemed to be reading from a teleprompter on Wednesday night, as he often does, making it difficult for those watching to gauge his medical fitness.
Although Biden stumbled over his words a few times, Siegel was more concerned about the president’s apparent ""lack of emotion.""

""It is a very emotional time for him and he isn't showing it,"" the doctor told Fox News Digital after the speech. ""He seems to lack conviction.""
JOE BIDEN WITH COVID AT AGE 81: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE RISK THE VIRUS POSES TO OLDER ADULTS
Siegel expressed concern that Biden ""could be depressed and shocked by the current reality.""
""I feel compassion for him,"" Siegel went on. ""How can he quote from the Declaration [of Independence] without much conviction? I feel bad for him and for us.""
""It is a very emotional time for him and he isn't showing it.""
Dr. Robert Lufkin, a California-based physician and medical school professor at UCLA and USC, also weighed in on Biden.
Lufkin noted that he has never examined Biden, but offered his observations based on Wednesday’s speech and recent media events.
BIDEN HEALTH CONCERNS PERSIST AS HE MAKES FIRST APPEARANCE AFTER ENDING CAMPAIGN
In previous appearances, Biden has shown signs of ""cognitive deterioration,"" the doctor told Fox News Digital.
""The findings in his previous presentations could have a variety of causes, including sleep deprivation, sedation, metabolic abnormalities or even neurodegenerative diseases.""
Tonight’s short presentation appeared to be read from a teleprompter, Lufkin agreed — ""which is less demanding than the more spontaneous Q&A debate format of some of his previous events.""
Biden addressed the nation from the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, July 24, 2024. ""That format is much less challenging and less likely to uncover pathology than a more rigorous Q&A exchange or debate format,"" a doctor told Fox News Digital. (Evan Vucci, Pool via AP)
In previous appearances, such as the June 27 debate, Biden has shown ""confused rambling, sudden loss of train of thought in the middle of a sentence, halting speech, and the repeated use of the word ‘anyway’ when lost in a sentence,"" Lufkin noted.

""Tonight, we did not see these in his presentation,"" he said. ""His delivery was fairly uniform without interruptions.""
The fact that these findings were less apparent tonight could be due to the speech format of the presentation and use of a teleprompter, according to Lufkin.
""That format is much less challenging and less likely to uncover pathology than a more rigorous Q&A exchange or debate format,"" he went on.

He said he hoped that ""continued interactions with Mr. Biden in various presentation formats will allow us to understand his situation in more detail.""
""I suspect the stress of trying to run for office and be president was leading to even worse daily cognitive performance,"" said a neurologist on Wednesday night after watching Biden's speech. Above, the president on Wednesday after returning to public view after nearly a week of seclusion due to COVID.  (Getty Images)
Dr. Earnest Lee Murray, a board-certified neurologist at Jackson-Madison County General Hospital in Jackson, Tennessee, said the speech from the Oval Office was ""clearly better"" for Biden than the debate, but also noted that the president struggled at times with reading from the teleprompter. 
Murray has not treated or examined Biden.
""Reading simple passages do become difficult in patients with dementia,"" he told Fox News Digital, expressing a professional opinion in general about such cases. 
The president struggled at times with reading from the teleprompter. 
""Patients with a dementing process have significant difficulties with multitasking,"" said Murray, again speaking generally.
""President Biden seemed more rested and relaxed tonight,"" Murray said.

In response to earlier outreach from Fox News Digital, the White House press office said that ""health was not a factor"" in the president's decision to withdraw from the 2024 race.

FOX_13,House unanimously votes to create Trump assassination attempt commission,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-votes-create-commission-studying-trump-assassination-attempt,2024-07-25 10:00:02.702650,politics,"Fox News congressional correspondent Aishah Hasnie has highlights on FBI Director Christopher Wray's testimony on the Trump shooting on 'Special Report.'
The House of Representatives unanimously voted to establish a bipartisan commission to investigate the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump.
No lawmakers voted ""no"" nor ""present,"" and 416 voted ""yes."" Ten Democrats and six Republicans did not vote.
The task force will be comprised of seven Republicans and six Democrats, with the members likely being announced this week.
House GOP leaders raced the bill to the floor after the deadly shooting at Trump’s Butler, Pennsylvania, rally nearly two weeks ago. One attendee died, and two others were injured, with Trump himself getting shot in the ear and evacuated off the stage by the Secret Service.

The vote was bipartisan, as expected — the hours following the shooting prompted a flurry of bipartisan condemnations against political violence, as well as scrutiny of the security situation that allowed a 20-year-old gunman with a rifle onto a rooftop just outside the rally perimeter.
""The security failures that allowed an assassination attempt on Donald Trump’s life are shocking. In response to bipartisan demands for answers, we are announcing a House Task Force made up of seven Republicans and six Democrats to thoroughly investigate the matter,"" Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in a joint statement on Tuesday. ""The task force will be empowered with subpoena authority and will move quickly to find the facts, ensure accountability, and make certain such failures never happen again.""
FBI DIRECTOR WRAY REVEALS 5 KEY DETAILS ABOUT TRUMP SHOOTERS' STASH OF EXPLOSIVES, WEAPONS

The resolution was led by Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., whose district the shooting took place in and who was in attendance but unharmed.
Johnson told Fox News Digital in an interview last week that he wanted the panel to reach a conclusion as soon as possible — in part, at least, ""so that people don't make up their minds about some conspiracy theory or some sinister plot.""

""Some of those rumors have begun already, and we have to address that immediately,"" he said ""The idea of a task force is that we can have sort of a precision group or unit that goes to work on this immediately. It'll be bipartisan and will have subpoena authority. I think that's going to be very important to get the answers as quickly as possible.""
The bipartisan scrutiny of the security situation forced U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle to resign on Tuesday.

FOX_14,"Trump's defamation lawsuit against ABC, George Stephanopoulos can move forward, judge rules",https://www.foxnews.com/media/trumps-defamation-lawsuit-against-abc-george-stephanopoulos-can-move-forward-judge-rules,2024-07-25 10:00:02.702650,politics,"Rep. Nancy Mace accused ABC's George Stephanopoulos of trying to ""shame"" her for endorsing former President Trump in a heated interview Sunday.
A Florida judge rejected ABC's motion to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed against the Disney-owned network and its anchor George Stephanopolous by former President Trump, allowing it to move forward. 
The lawsuit stems from comments Stephanopoulos made in March when he falsely asserted that Trump was found ""liable for rape"" in a civil case against the Republican White House hopeful. 
""A jury may, upon viewing the segment, find there was sufficient context. But a reasonable jury could conclude Plaintiff was defamed and, as a result, dismissal is inappropriate,"" Judge Cecilia Altonaga of United States District Court in Miami ruled Wednesday. 
TRUMP SUES ABC NEWS, GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS FOR DEFAMATION
Trump touted the ruling on Truth Social, writing, ""A BIG WIN TODAY IN HIGH FLORIDA COURT AGAINST ABC FAKE NEWS, AND LIDDLE’ GEORGE SLOPADOPOLUS. A POWERFUL CASE! BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA WILL BE FORCED BY THE COURTS TO START TELLING THE TRUTH. THIS IS A GREAT DAY FOR OUR COUNTRY. MAGA2024!""
ABC News declined to comment.

Stephanopoulos' comments were made during a tense exchange with Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., on his Sunday program ""This Week"" in March.
After playing a clip of Mace discussing being a victim of rape, Stephanopoulos asked her, ""How do you square your endorsement of Donald Trump with the testimony we just saw?"" 
ABC HAS TO STAND BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS AS TRUMP SUES FOR DEFAMATION, LEGAL GURU SAYS
""You've endorsed Donald Trump for president. Judges and two separate juries have found him liable for rape and for defaming the victim of that rape,"" Stephanopoulos said, alluding to the legal victory by Trump accuser E. Jean Carroll. 
Stephanopoulos repeated that claim a whopping ten times during his ugly spat with Mace, despite the fact that a jury actually determined Trump was liable for ""sexual abuse,"" which has a distinct definition under New York law.

The ABC News anchor remained defiant about the lawsuit during an appearance on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" in May.
""Trump sued me because I used the word ‘rape,’ even though a judge said that’s in fact what did happen,"" Stephanopoulos said. ""We filed a motion to dismiss.""
After the federal jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse, but not rape, Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote in a later ruling that just because Carroll failed to prove rape ""within the meaning of the New York Penal Law does not mean that she failed to prove that Mr. Trump ‘raped’ her as many people commonly understand the word ‘rape.’""
ABC NEWS' GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS INACCURATELY SAID TRUMP WAS FOUND ‘LIABLE FOR RAPE’ 10 TIMES, LEGAL GURUS SAY
Days before Wednesday's ruling, Trump suggested he was scrapping ABC's scheduled presidential debate he agreed to participate in with President Biden, who dramatically exited the presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday, and floated that Fox News should host a debate instead. 
""My debate with Crooked Joe Biden, the Worst President in the history of the United States, was slated to be broadcast on Fake News ABC, the home of George Slopadopolus, sometime in September. Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC. Thank you!,"" Trump posted on Sunday.

FOX News Media sent formal letters to both the Trump and Harris campaigns proposing its own debate in September.
""Now that Vice President Kamala Harris is the presumptive Democratic nominee, FOX News Media is amending our proposal for a debate this cycle. Given the race has changed, we’d like to request the opportunity to host a Presidential Debate between VP Harris and former President Trump,"" the letters sent to each campaign, signed by FOX News Media President and Executive Editor Jay Wallace and FOX News Vice President of Politics Jessica Loker, stated Wednesday. 
""We propose to host the debate in the state of Pennsylvania on Tuesday, September 17, just as early voting is getting underway there and in other key battlegrounds. We are open to discussion on the exact date, format and location — with or without an audience,"" Wallace and Loker continued. ""Again, we believe Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, the faces of our political coverage, are the best choices to moderate.""

FOX_15,Three ways President Biden just helped Kamala Harris close in on Donald Trump,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/three-ways-president-biden-just-helped-kamala-harris-close-donald-trump,2024-07-25 10:00:02.702650,politics,"President Biden addresses the nation from the Oval Office for the first time since dropping out of the 2024 race.
President Joe Biden has just gone from being his own worst enemy to being Kamala Harris’ greatest asset. I say that because the bumbling, unsure Joe Biden of three and a half weeks ago and since the disastrous presidential debate was absent on Wednesday night. 
To be sure, there were a few moments, indeed more than a few moments, where he stumbled over his words and expressions in his Oval Office address to the nation. But far more important was the brief 10-minute or so summary Biden offered Americans of his accomplishments. On Wednesday night, in the absence of a partisan political campaign, they suddenly seemed far more compelling than they did in the course of the now ended Biden-for-President effort. 
I say that because every point that Biden’s approval goes up from here on out will undoubtedly translate into additional support for Vice President Kamala Harris in her race against Donald Trump. 
BIDEN ADDRESSES DECISION TO DROP OUT OF 2024 RACE, INTENDS TO COMPLETE TERM IN WHITE HOUSE
In his brief address, Biden convincingly made a case for his leadership -- both domestically and overseas -- without direct partisan attacks or shrill and harsh rhetoric.
Most tellingly, Biden struck a theme that neither he nor the Democrats could have articulated while he was a candidate: ""Passing the torch to a new generation.""  The president sought to inoculate Harris, perhaps not entirely convincingly, on her greatest liability -- the Southern border and unfettered illegal immigration.

Similarly, Biden made what I thought was a strong case for unity, stability and, most of all, democracy. 
Still, I don’t believe, nor would I mean to imply that this speech in any way changes or fundamentally alters the campaign to come. But it suggests that Joe Biden has been revitalized and can play three important roles for Vice President Harris.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
First, as chief advocate for the Biden domestic and foreign policy. Second, as chief advocate for a new, and frankly untested, face on the national stage – the sitting vice president. And third, not to be underestimated, after Wednesday’s speech, there will be a revitalized and resurgent ability to raise vast sums of money to combat Donald Trump and the Republicans.

Make no mistake, Joe Biden, with his brief 10-minute address, has gone from being a pariah among donors to a likely celebrity again. The president, who just one short week ago was shunned by the party’s richest and most influential donors, will undoubtedly be welcomed back into living rooms from the Upper East Side to West Los Angeles as he makes the case simultaneously for his administration and that of his hoped-for successor.
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
Finally, the president’s speech gives Democrats an asset they frankly lacked until Wednesday night: a sitting president who can make the case for the party. Biden no doubt will join with former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama to demonstrate newfound Democratic unity both at the convention and beyond. Harris now has an opportunity at that convention, both on her own and with her choice of vice president, to lay out her own vision of the America she hopes to lead.
I still regard Donald Trump as the frontrunner in the 2024 election, as the polls narrowly show. But with a newly compelling Joe Biden, a united Democratic Party and three presidents to advocate on her behalf, Kamala Harris has a far better chance of winning this election than anyone thought possible just a few days ago.

FOX_18,Why inflation is making us have fewer babies,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/why-inflation-making-us-have-fewer-babies,2024-07-25 20:00:02.702650,opinion,"'Fox & Friends' co-host Lawrence Jones has 'Breakfast with Friends' at the Machine Shed in Pewaukee, Wisconsin. 
Is inflation making American families have fewer children? Yes.
According to the Department of Agriculture data and inflation statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, raising a child in 2023 could cost an average of $331,933 from the time a child is born until the age of 18. And that’s without the cost of a college education. 
In 2015, the cost of raising a child was calculated at just $233,610 and since then costs for day care, food and housing have skyrocketed. This means that, compared to nine years ago, an American family will need to come up with an additional $100,000 just to get one child through high school.

What are young families thinking about having family? Well, they aren’t just delaying until later in life to have kids. Instead, they are opting to bypass having kids at all, with money at the epicenter of their decisions.
GEN Z VOTERS REVEAL ISSUES THAT WILL SWAY THEIR VOTE IN 2024
We are already at a record low birthrate, with the fewest babies born in 2023 since 1979. These challenges may not only affect the dynamics of modern-day family neighborhoods across our country, but they will also put us in a serious deficit position for the American labor force 20 years from now.
One issue that is resonating with young voters and affecting their financial desire to have children is home affordability. More than 9 in 10 (91%) of adult Gen Zers say housing affordability is going to be important when considering who they will vote for in the upcoming election. This issue was a higher priority than abortion rights, gun laws and even foreign wars.
In fact, it speaks to the financial issue on why more young people don’t want to have children and just how much the cost of living has affected their wallets and impaired their thinking of even being able to afford a family. Look at the home price to income ratio in America.
ANGRY GEN Z AMERICAN DETAILS 'STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE' IN VIRAL RANT: 'I CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE'
In 1980, the median home price in the United States was $50,000, while the median income was $25,000. Today, home prices have soared to a median average of $423,000 and the median income is about $65,000. That means the home price to income ratio in our country has tripled from a 2 to 1 ratio to 6 to 1 in 45 years.
Aside from the financial issues, Gen Z’s lack of interest in having children also stems from wanting to have more time for themselves, to travel and explore other lifestyles than having a family. The phenomenon that started in the 1980s called DINK (Dual Income No Kids) has become popularized on TikTok and is being readily adopted with this generation as a conscious choice versus having children.
Some Gen Zs even cite climate change and political instability as other nonfinancial reasons for not wanting to bring children into the world.

It’s ironic now having three kids of my own in their 20s and thinking about, ""How do I get them off of payroll?"" and watching my children consider, ""Do I want to bring someone on to payroll?"" 
According to a Bank of America 2024 State of Gen Z’s Financial Health report released recently, over 50% Gen Z adults believe the cost of living is their biggest challenge and greatest barrier to their own success, which in turn plants those seeds of doubt on how they can take care of another human being.
With credit card debt approaching $1.2 trillion, student debt still hovering at $1.7 trillion, and over $1 trillion of outstanding auto loan debt, getting our arms around the rising cost of inflation across the board will be one of the most important jobs for the next president of the United States.

It's not going to be just about being put gas in your tank, food on your table, or being able to make your rent payment, but about giving the confidence to the younger generations that not only is it a great idea to have a family, but also one that you can afford.  
Right now, the high cost of everything is making this generation think more about themselves than our future.

FOX_19,I won't stay silent about the scars from my transgender experience,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/i-wont-stay-silent-about-scars-from-my-transgender-experience,2024-07-25 17:00:02.702650,opinion,"Former NFL sideline reporter Michele Tafoya and Independent Women’s Forum ambassador Prisha Mosley discuss a recent study showing how most children grow out of gender confusion on ‘The Ingraham Angle.’
When I was a child and suffering from numerous mental health issues, I learned about transgenderism. Vulnerable and in distress, I was given false hope by the pseudoscientific idea that I could become a boy. 
Encouraged by doctors that this could solve my issues and alleviate my unhappiness, I began a medical journey to make a ""female-to-male transition"" that left enormous physical and emotional scars. It did not solve my problems, but rather created new ones. 
My breasts are gone and what’s left in their place feels numb or painful. I haven’t decided which is worse - I miss one when I experience the other. Unnecessary prescription hormones have damaged my voice, my skeletal structure, and my hormonal system.

This is my truth, my experience, my life. 
MUSK SAYS TRANS CHILD WAS FIGURATIVELY 'KILLED BY THE WOKE MIND VIRUS,' VOWS TO DESTROY IT: 'MY SON IS DEAD'
It was hard to come forward and talk about my experience. I am attacked viciously online by the same trans community that love bombed me when I attempted to transition. Yet I have chosen to share my story out of love and concern for vulnerable children and teens who might be going down the same path I did. 
I don’t want suffering, confused teens to cut off their breasts thinking it will bring happiness. I don’t want sexual assault survivors to think that they can magically morph their female bodies into males and never feel vulnerable again, as I once thought.
FEDERAL JUDGE RULES FLORIDA RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSGENDER MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR KIDS UNCONSTITUTIONAL
Today, I expect online bullies to attack me and call me names. But I do not expect reputable newspapers to do so for all their readers to see. However, in June, that’s exactly what happened. 
In the June 12 issue of the Santa Fe Reporter, ahead of the one-year anniversary on June 16 of New Mexico’s HB 7 taking effect, Independent Women’s Forum paid for an advertisement featuring my story. 
New Mexico’s HB 7 forbids public entities and associated individuals from ""restrict[ing] or interfer[ing] with a person’s ability to access… gender-affirming health care."" Essentially, this bill discourages anyone from telling young people like me about the risks associated with attempting to medically ""transition."" 
TAXPAYER-FUNDED PLANNED PARENTHOOD BOASTS ABOUT BEING LEADER IN TRANSGENDER MEDICAL PROCEDURES
They want children’s ""gender identity"" affirmed – regardless of how fleeting or how serious the underlying issues that are causing the wish to transition are. I know from experience how this can backfire on vulnerable youth and inflict irreversible, lifelong harm. 
The ad in the Santa Fe Reporter included a QR code linking to IWF’s Identity Crisis documentary series, which tells my story and the stories of numerous others who experienced transition and ultimately ""detransition."" I think it’s information that children and their parents deserve to have. 
Following IWF’s advertisement, the Santa Fe Reporter reportedly heard from activists and others who disliked it. That’s hardly a surprise. I hear from people all the time who prefer I stay silent and call me names rather than have an honest conversation about the dangers of cross-sex hormones and surgery for trans-identifying youth. I wouldn’t have been surprised if letters to the editor to that effect were published.

But that didn’t happen. Instead, publisher Julia Goldberg issued a large, full-color apology for running the advertisement, promised not to run further advertisements from IWF, and labeled our work ""an online anti-transgender misinformation campaign."" That claim is blatantly false. Nothing in this series is anti-transgender. Nothing is misinformation.
Unsatisfied, the Reporter then published what it entitled a ""Teachable Moment,"" in which it labeled our work at IWF ""anti-transgender,"" and part of an ""ongoing attack on transgender lives.""
Unbelievably, the story compares IWF’s advertisement (about whether teachers should face liability in the classroom) to White supremacy. It portrays IWF as in favor of the ""eradication of trans people."" It then states that the Southern Poverty Law Center ""includes IWF"" in an ""anti-LGBTQ pseudoscience network."" 
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
By labeling IWF’s basic educational resources – real stories from trans-identifying minors – as ""anti-transgender,"" the Santa Fe Reporter destroys any opportunity for common ground and understanding.
I won’t back down to bullies. I’ll keep speaking out and telling my story because I care about vulnerable young people. I don’t want them to suffer like I have.

Vice President Kamala Harris is beginning to vet her list of potential running mates for 2024, according to sources familiar with the campaign.

Harris's team has requested information on approximately a dozen individuals, according to anonymous sources speaking to the Associated Press.

Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, and Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina are among the most-discussed prospects for the Democratic vice-presidential nomination.
Her selection will set the tone for her last-minute presidential campaign launched with an endorsement of Biden following his sudden and unexpected withdrawal from the race.
Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for comment on the reports.

The campaign of former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee in the 2024 election, has dismissed Harris's eventual vice-presidential pick as inconsequential. 
""There is a short list of governors and senators. They are all interchangeable,"" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told reporters on Wednesday. ""It doesn’t matter.""
Many top Democrats have fallen in line behind Harris, receiving endorsements from the Clintons, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.

Harris and Trump are locked in an extremely close contest, according to a new national poll conducted entirely after Biden announced he was suspending his campaign and endorsing his vice president.
Trump, who last week was formally nominated as the Republican Party’s 2024 presidential candidate, stands at 46% support among registered voters in an NPR/PBS News/Marist Poll.
Harris, who on Monday night said she had locked up the Democratic nomination thanks to verbal commitments from delegates at next month’s Democratic National Convention, stood at 45% support. Trump’s one point edge is well within the survey’s sampling error. Nine percent of those questioned were undecided.

""Can I ask a question? Have we talked about it enough? I mean, the country knows that happened. They saw it play out in real time.

Biden addressed the nation on Wednesday night from the Oval Office and said he planned to serve out the rest of his term. 
""Will the press ever stop criticizing? And when are we going to start doing a little more on Donald Trump? I think it was a very poignant evening. He talked about what was ahead, what we needed to do, why he was doing it, and here we are,"" Dingell continued.

A super Jupiter has been spotted around a neighboring star by the Webb Space Telescope — and it has a super orbit.
The planet is roughly the same diameter as Jupiter, but with six times the mass. Its atmosphere is also rich in hydrogen like Jupiter’s.
One big difference: It takes this planet more than a century, possibly as long as 250 years, to go around its star. It’s 15 times farther from its star than Earth is to the sun.
WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE ’DEVIL COMET’ AFTER ITS CLOSEST PASSING OF EARTH IN 71 YEARS
Scientists had long suspected a big planet circled this star 12 light-years away, but not this massive or far from its star. A light-year is 5.8 trillion miles. These new observations show the planet orbits the star Epsilon Indi A, part of a three-star system.
An international team led by Max Planck Institute for Astronomy’s Elisabeth Matthews in Germany collected the images last year and published the findings Wednesday in the journal Nature.
Astronomers directly observed the incredibly old and cold gas giant — a rare and tricky feat — by masking the star through use of a special shading device on Webb. By blocking the starlight, the planet stood out as a pinpoint of infrared light.

The planet and star clock in at 3.5 billion years old, 1 billion years younger than our own solar system, but still considered old and brighter than expected, according to Matthews.
The star is so close and bright to our own solar system that it’s visible with the naked eye in the Southern Hemisphere.
Don’t bet on life, though.
""This is a gas giant with no hard surface or liquid water oceans,"" Matthews said in an email.
It’s unlikely this solar system sports more gas giants, she said, but small rocky worlds could be lurking there.
Worlds similar to Jupiter can help scientists understand ""how these planets evolve over giga-year timescales,"" she said.

The first planets outside our solar system — dubbed exoplanets — were confirmed in the early 1990s. NASA’s tally now stands at 5,690 as of mid-July. The vast majority were detected via the transit method, in which a fleeting dip in starlight, repeated at regular intervals, indicates an orbiting planet.
Telescopes in space and also on the ground are on the hunt for even more, especially planets that might be similar to Earth.

The House of Representatives voted along bipartisan lines to condemn Vice President Kamala Harris' handling of the U.S. southern border, the first piece of legislation targeting Harris since she became the Democrats' presumptive 2024 nominee.
Six Democrats joined all Republicans in voting for the measure, which passed 220-196.
The House Democrats who voted for the resolution are Reps. Jared Golden, D-Maine, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-Wash., Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, Don Davis, D-N.C., and Yadira Caraveo, D-Colo.
Republicans have for years accused Harris of failing her job as ""border czar"" after President Biden handed her the task of mitigating the ""root causes"" of illegal immigration in 2021.
It's quickly becoming the cornerstone of GOP-led attacks against Harris as she gears up for an expected head-to-head race with former President Trump. But the six moderate Democrats who voted to condemn Harris amount to a scathing rebuke of their party's likely presidential candidate – despite dozens of left-wing lawmakers rushing to endorse her.

During debate on the bill, House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who's leading the effort, accused Harris of overseeing ""failed and dangerous policies as Joe Biden's border czar that caused the most catastrophic border crisis in this nation's history.""
House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green, R-Tenn., similarly opened debate with, ""We've been told that Vice President Harris' job was to find the root causes of the crisis. Turns out to do so she could have just looked in the mirror.""
Democrats, however, accused Republicans of being openly political in their motivations.

""Testing new campaign messaging is not a good use of the House's time,"" said Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., the top Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee.
Thompson called the bill a ""second-rate attempt at election interference,"" adding, ""Perhaps it's also an ethics violation, since my Republican colleagues are blatantly using House resources for campaign purposes. And like so much other campaign literature, this political resolution is premised on falsehoods and supported by cherry-picked statistics.""
House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., told Fox News Digital, ""The mainstream media can try to rewrite history all they want, but the American people know the truth and our House Republican majority will remind them. Kamala Harris is Biden's border czar, and the unprecedented invasion at our borders is hers to own.""

FOX_26,CNN commentator presses David Axelrod on Biden's forced campaign exit: 'Lot of dishonesty',https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-commentator-presses-david-axelrod-bidens-forced-campaign-exit-lot-dishonesty,2024-07-25 23:00:02.777714,politics,"Former Obama advisor David Axelrod was pressed to explain President Biden's sudden choice to withdraw from the presidential race.
Former Obama campaign strategist David Axelrod was pressed to explain how he could account for President Biden's sudden decision to withdraw from the presidential race.
""I think what you’re asking Republicans to do is to overlook a lot of dishonesty that came right out of this White House, that came right out of the vice president, people who work for him, his family, other Democrats, Democrats in Congress,"" CNN contributor Scott Jennings told Axelrod during a panel discussion Wednesday night.
""You‘re asking the country to overlook a lot of dishonesty about Joe Biden‘s abilities, capabilities, his capacity to serve for another four years and so on,"" he added.
Biden addressed the nation on Wednesday evening from the Oval Office for the first time since he officially dropped out of the 2024 presidential race, saying that he still intends to complete his term.

Jennings said that Biden did not appear to decide to leave the race completely on his own volition, but instead arrived ""at this decision with a little push, not just from the goodness of his own heart, but you have to admit, with a little bit of a push from the party bosses.""
Axelrod argued that the ""party bosses"" were communicating the consensus of Democrats and American voters. 
""The party bosses were reflecting the consensus of the American people who made a judgment,"" Axelrod said. ""But, Scott, there‘s so many Republicans who I talked to, who are overlooking far more than this, and they‘ll tell you that, about Donald Trump."" 
""I mean, that is really the story of the Republican Party right now,"" Axelrod said, adding that the party ""is in the thrall of a guy who is morally and ethically challenged and who left the presidency."" 
""You‘re not on a strong footing here in making this argument,"" he said.

Jennings responded that Biden's decision to leave the race was a ""weird"" one.
""I fully and freely admit that both parties have warts,"" he said. ""But we're acting like there's no warts on this situation,"" Jennings said. ""This is weird. [Biden] won the primary without a serious challenge. He told us all he could serve, his party told us he could serve. He's clearly diminished."" 
""I think he ultimately arrived in the right spot,"" he said. ""He ultimately got here. But it was pretty torturous how they got here and I think a lot of people burned a lot of credibility on the road to getting here.""

Vice President Kamala Harris is beginning to vet her list of potential running mates for 2024, according to sources familiar with the campaign.
The presumptive Democratic Party nominee has been moving quickly to formalize a campaign ticket after President Biden stepped down Sunday afternoon.
Harris's team has requested information on approximately a dozen individuals, according to anonymous sources speaking to the Associated Press.

Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, and Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina are among the most-discussed prospects for the Democratic vice-presidential nomination.
Her selection will set the tone for her last-minute presidential campaign launched with an endorsement of Biden following his sudden and unexpected withdrawal from the race.
Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for comment on the reports.

The campaign of former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee in the 2024 election, has dismissed Harris's eventual vice-presidential pick as inconsequential. 
""There is a short list of governors and senators. They are all interchangeable,"" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told reporters on Wednesday. ""It doesn’t matter.""
Many top Democrats have fallen in line behind Harris, receiving endorsements from the Clintons, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.

Harris and Trump are locked in an extremely close contest, according to a new national poll conducted entirely after Biden announced he was suspending his campaign and endorsing his vice president.
Trump, who last week was formally nominated as the Republican Party’s 2024 presidential candidate, stands at 46% support among registered voters in an NPR/PBS News/Marist Poll.
Harris, who on Monday night said she had locked up the Democratic nomination thanks to verbal commitments from delegates at next month’s Democratic National Convention, stood at 45% support. Trump’s one point edge is well within the survey’s sampling error. Nine percent of those questioned were undecided.

A CNN panel got into a heated debate on Wednesday over whether President Biden was capable of doing the job, as commentator Ana Navarro insisted questions about Biden's health and decline were all ""speculation"" because she's spent time with him. 
After presidential historian Tim Naftali insisted President Biden did not have to drop out of the race and did so in order to unify his party, the Manhattan Institute's Reihan Salam pushed back and said it was ""so obviously false"" and that Biden was ""manifestly incapable"" of doing the job.
Biden addressed the nation on Wednesday in his first public appearance since he decided to bow out of the race.
""Tell me how you know he’s manifestly incapable?"" Naftali shot back.

Salam said Biden's decline has been widely discussed and added that the ""deeper question is who is actually in charge at any given time? You know, this notion that he’s only sharp for six hours a day? This is an incredibly volatile moment, in part because of his failures.""
Navarro jumped in to attack Salam's thinking and noted the time she'd spent with the president. 
""No. Everything you're saying, I'm sorry, is speculation. Let me tell you what is not speculation,"" Navarro, also a co-host on ""The View,"" said. ""It is speculation! It is speculation! Because actually, unlike you, I’ve actually seen the guy at 9:00 at night. I have seen him after he has had five different events in 24 hours."" 
Salam shot back at Navarro and wondered, ""Might that cloud your judgment?"" 
""Do you think that makes you more objective?"" he added.

Former NY Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey also jumped into the debate, arguing that Biden's debate performance showed he was ""clearly incompetent"" and unable to answer questions.

The panelists continued to argue and speak over one another before Ashley Allison, who worked for the Biden-Harris campaign in 2020, said, ""The story that Joe Biden is lying to the public is not – when was the last time you were with Joe Biden? When was the last time you were with Joe Biden?""
""There are a lot of Democrats in Congress who were with him in October 2021, who are frightened and afraid in October 2021, because he could not clearly communicate a case for passing major legislation, something that he specialized in during the Obama administration,"" Salam added before the conversation ended.

""He asked the question: does character still matter? Well, it does tonight,"" Jones said, appearing visibly moved by Biden's speech. 
""He’s an old guy, but the heart’s still there,"" Jones said of Biden. ""The words aren’t as clear, but the love is clear. The heart is still there, and I think people need to look at this because you had somebody sitting in that chair, and he wouldn’t give up power no matter what. Wouldn’t give up power, let there be an insurrection, wouldn’t get out of that chair.""
""Even when the people voted for him to get out of the chair, he wouldn’t get out of the chair,' he continued, referring to former President Trump. ""You’ve got somebody who’s sitting in that same chair showing that character does matter, showing that you can have grace, you can put the people first, you can pass the baton, and you’re a bigger person for it.""

""I love that man,"" he said. 
Biden's speech from the Oval Office came less than four weeks after his disastrous debate performance against Trump. While a Democratic and liberal media pressure campaign almost immediately began afterward to force him out of the nomination, Biden held fast until Sunday, repeatedly claiming he was not going anywhere.
He finally capitulated and has received an outpouring of praise from many of the same figures who were afraid he would allow Trump to win another term.

Vice President Kamala Harris is edging former President Donald Trump in a hypothetical general election match-up, according to a new poll conducted after President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race.
The New York Times/Siena College released a new survey that found that Trump leads Harris by only one percentage point among likely voters, 48% to 47%. Among registered voters, Trump led Harris by two percentage points. 
The new results reveal a tightening of the race since Democrats changed their nominee when compared to a New York Times poll in July that found Trump was leading Biden by 6 points.

In the second White House press briefing since President Biden announced he would not be seeking a second term in office, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre insisted again his decision was not based on his health and that he would be finishing his term.
""President Biden will go down in history as one of the nation's greatest presidents, accomplishing more in nearly four years than most presidents do in eight years,"" Jean-Pierre said.
She read from a statement issued by Biden, saying, ""I have given my heart and my soul to our nation like so many others have, and I have been blessed a million times in return, with the love and support of the American people.""
Jean-Pierre said Biden made it clear Wednesday night during his address that, over the next six months, he will be focused on doing his job as president and building on his historic results for the American people.

Politico's John Harris wrote in a column on Thursday that President Biden has ""essentially been only half a president,"" and argued his address to the nation on Wednesday showed why he had to drop out of the race.
""It is [Donald] Trump who used the presidential pulpit — and the mania and obsessive interest that followed him even after he lost it — in ways consistent with the grain of American history. He preoccupies the psyche of the nation, no less among those who loathe him as among the half or nearly half who are open to returning him to power,"" Harris wrote. ""It was Biden who is the tragic exception.""
Biden addressed the nation from the Oval Office on Wednesday and told Americans he was dropping out to unify the Democratic Party, adding that the election was about ""defending democracy."" Harris wrote that Biden's speech showed ""a paradox,"" in which ""Trump represents continuity and Biden is the anomaly.""
""On the performative dimension of the presidency — using words to inspire his supporters, box in his enemies, to reframe debates — he [Biden] has been arguably the weakest Oval Office occupant in more than a century, back to the days before television or even radio, when most Americans might read about a presidential speech but had never heard the president’s voice,"" he continued.

Harris argued that Biden did perform admirably when it came to passing legislation. He wrote Biden's voice has gotten fainter throughout his presidency and said the president's ""thoughts straddle a line between discursive and incoherent.""
""A president who was effective at waging a national argument and reframing debates to his advantage would not be facing a potent threat from the same politician he beat in the last election,"" Harris wrote in the column. 
He further criticized Biden's Oval Office address in the column, which was widely praised by members of the media, as another example of the president's ""weakened capacity to wage argument.""

""In recent weeks, it's become clear to me that I need to unite my party in this critical endeavor.

Presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris is reportedly working with a specific short list of candidates to choose her vice presidential pick in the next two weeks before the Democratic National Convention.
Harris’ list of potential running mates, according to NBC News, was whittled down to Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, governors Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Roy Cooper of North Carolina, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.
""You need someone who’s moderate, obviously, a white male, and I would say she needs someone from a border state,"" Ashley Etienne, a former Harris communications director, told NBC News.
""I think her choosing a white male counterbalances her race and her gender in a way that could open her up to peeling off many of those Nikki Haley voters, those disaffected Republicans, independents. And I think it rounds off the ticket in a way that I think feels fresh, feels also forward, but also feels fully aware of where we are as a nation.""

NBC reported the Harris campaign is hoping to find a candidate who will appeal to the demographics that Biden was strongest with, including older white voters and suburban women. Additionally, the campaign reportedly wants a candidate who appeals to white men who aren't fans of Trump but are skeptical about Harris.
If Harris ends up deciding against choosing a white male, NBC News reported Cedric Richmond, a former Biden adviser and Louisiana congressman, has also been floated as a possible running mate.
Many had speculated Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and California Gov. Gavin Newsom would also be considered, but both have withdrawn their names from consideration.

""I think it's Mark Kelly if I had to bet,"" Etienne said.
Arizona Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, who is running for Senate in Arizona, said Wednesday Kelly would give Harris a ""jolt"" if she chose him for vice president.
Kelly's Democratic colleagues in the Senate have spoken highly of him. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., the party's 2016 vice presidential nominee, told NBC News Kelly would be a ""superb"" choice for Harris.
Hailing from the key battleground state of Arizona, Kelly could assist Harris in locking up western states and provide credibility on the border, which he has said is in ""crisis."" He has a compelling life story and career, being a former Navy pilot and astronaut. His parents were both police officers, which could help Democrats dodge GOP attacks for being too soft on crime.
Kelly is married to former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., who was shot during a campaign event with constituents in 2011. He cared for her throughout her recovery and continues to do so. Both are leading advocates of gun control reforms.

While meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office Thursday, President Biden joked that he has known leaders from the Jewish state as far back as his childhood. 
""Mr. President,"" Netanyahu said at the start of the meeting, ""we've known each other for 40 years. And you've known every Israeli prime minister for 50 years from Golda Meir. So, from a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish-American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the State of Israel. And I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead on the great issues before us.""
Biden answered, ""I look forward to as well. By the way, that first meeting with Prime Minister Golda Meir, she had an assistant sitting next to me, a guy named Rabin. That's how far back it goes. I was only 12 then. Anyway, thank you all for being here."" 
Biden was referring to Yitzhak Rabin, who served as prime minister of Israel from 1974-1977 and again from 1992 until he was assassinated in 1995.

Biden actually met with Meir and Rabin in 1973, when he was a 30-year-old senator, a story he's told frequently. Three years ago, he incorrectly claimed he was a ""liaison"" between Israel and Egypt during the Six-Day War, which occurred in 1967, when he was still in law school. 
""I have known every, every prime minister well since Golda Meir, including Golda Meir,"" Biden said during a menorah lighting in 2021. ""And during the Six-Day War, I had an opportunity to, she invited me to come over because I was going to be the liaison between she and the Egyptians about the Suez.""
He actually met with Meir just prior to the October 1973 Yom Kippur War.
""And I sat in front of her desk,"" he added at the time. ""And she had a guy, her staff member, to my right. His name was Rabin. And she kept flipping those maps up and down. She had that bevy of maps, sort of kept it, and it was, it was so depressing what she was, about what happened. She gave me every detail.""
Biden's team confirmed to Fox News Digital Thursday he was joking about his age. 
Both leaders ignored reporters’ shouted questions about a potential cease-fire and the anti-Israel protests after the brief meeting. 
Netanyahu’s address to Congress Wednesday led to anti-Israel protests in the capital, with some marching through the streets shouting ""Free Palestine"" and others waving Hamas flags, burning the American flag and painting graffiti.
A Christopher Columbus statue outside Union Station was tagged with the warning ""Hamas is coming."" 
Netanyahu slammed the demonstrators during his address, calling them ""Iran's useful idiots.""

""I have a message for these protesters. When the tyrants of Tehran, who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering their hair, are praising, promoting and funding you, you have officially become Iran's useful idiots,"" Netanyahu said.
""Some of these protesters hold up signs proclaiming ‘Gays for Gaza.’ They might as well hold up signs saying ‘Chickens for KFC.’ These protesters chant ‘From the river to the sea.’ But many don't have a clue what river and what sea they're talking about.""

He addressed a nearly full House chamber, which included members of Congress and special guests like freed Israeli hostages who were taken by Hamas Oct. 7 and billionaire Elon Musk, among others.
Among those in the chamber was Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., Israel's harshest critic in the House of Representatives. Tlaib has called for Netanyahu to be arrested by the International Criminal Court. She staged a silent protest for much of his speech, holding a double-sided sign that said ""guilty of genocide"" on one side and ""war criminal"" on the other.

Less than a week since becoming the presumptive Democratic Party nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris is facing a tidal wave of GOP attack ads as she enters the spotlight in the presidential race and while she is benefiting from a massive surge in ""earned"" media.
The Associated Press reports that former President Trump and his allies are outspending Harris’ campaign 25-1 on TV and radio advertising. Republicans have spent more than $68 million, compared to $2.6 million by Democrats since Monday, according to the media tracking firm AdImpact. Top topics include the ongoing border crisis and inflation, as well as her record that critics have presented as extremely left-wing.
Meanwhile, Harris has earned a flood of media coverage since President Biden announced Sunday that he would not stand for re-election and endorsed Harris as his successor. The Trump campaign has dubbed it a ""Harris honeymoon"" and predicted a polling boost for the former California senator.

""We’re working to get up ads as quickly as we can (though it’s only been three days) and in the meantime she’s dominating earned media,"" a campaign official told Politico.
 ""I think it’s lighting your money on fire to do ads when you’re getting the best and most earned media of the cycle,"" Clinton veteran Nick Merrill told the outlet.
That outlet reported that filmmakers were at Harris’ rally in Wisconsin on Tuesday to catch footage for a digital-only ad.

Meanwhile, the AP reported that the Harris campaign has raised a massive $100 million between Sunday and Monday afternoon, and can launch a robust advertising campaign whenever it wants to.
Harris spokesperson Kevin Munoz told the AP that the vice president ""will make her case aggressively alongside a campaign infrastructure designed to win close elections.""
BIDEN SAYS 'THE CHOICE IS UP TO YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,' WHILE SAYING HE WON'T SEEK RE-ELECTION
""In just 24 hours, Kamala Harris put abortion rights front and center for voters, broke fundraising records, and spun Donald Trump out into a manic and public breakdown — because he knows she is best-equipped to prosecute the case against a convicted felon like himself,"" he said.
Democratic-backed ads are set to fire up soon too. While there’s only about $2.6 million in ads through the end of August, according to AdImpact, the pro-Biden super PAC Future Forward will roll out a $129 million ad campaign in September.

But the Trump campaign still has more coming. The pro-Trump Preserve America Super PAC has booked $45 million in ads through the end of August, while MAGA Inc. has booked another $23 million.
Meanwhile, Harris and Trump are locked in an extremely close contest, according to a new national poll conducted entirely after Biden announced that he was suspending his campaign and endorsing his vice president.
Trump stands at 46% support among registered voters in an NPR/PBS News/Marist Poll. Harris stood at 45% support. Trump’s one point edge is well within the survey’s sampling error. Nine percent of those questioned were undecided.

Here's what's happening…
- Harris finally responds to pro-Hamas protests in DC…
- Videos show what emergency responders found on Trump shooter's body 
- Harris campaign is reportedly vetting a dozen VP prospects…
The House of Representatives voted along bipartisan lines to condemn Vice President Kamala Harris' handling of the U.S.' southern border, the first piece of legislation targeting Harris since she became the Democrats' presumptive 2024 nominee.
Six Democrats joined all House Republicans in voting for the measure, which passed 220-196.
The House Democrats who voted for the resolution are Reps. Jared Golden, D-Maine; Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-Wash.; Mary Peltola, D-Alaska; Henry Cuellar, D-Texas; Don Davis, D-N.C.; and Yadira Caraveo, D-Colo.
For years, Republicans have accused Harris of failing her job as ""border czar"" after President Biden handed her the task of mitigating the ""root causes"" of illegal immigration in 2021.
It's quickly becoming the cornerstone of GOP-led attacks against Harris as she gears up for an expected head-to-head race with former President Trump. But the six moderate Democrats who voted to condemn Harris amount to a scathing rebuke of their party's likely presidential candidate — despite dozens of left-wing lawmakers rushing to endorse her…Read more

FOX_37,Biden jokes he was '12' when he first met Israeli PM Golda Meir during Netanyahu visit to White House,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-jokes-12-first-met-israeli-pm-golda-meir-netanyahu-visit-white-house,2024-07-26 06:00:02.830449,politics,"The president discussed his long history with Israeli prime ministers in a meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday.
While meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office Thursday, President Biden joked that he has known leaders from the Jewish state as far back as his childhood. 
""Mr. President,"" Netanyahu said at the start of the meeting, ""we've known each other for 40 years. And you've known every Israeli prime minister for 50 years from Golda Meir. So, from a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish-American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the State of Israel. And I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead on the great issues before us.""
Biden answered, ""I look forward to as well. By the way, that first meeting with Prime Minister Golda Meir, she had an assistant sitting next to me, a guy named Rabin. That's how far back it goes. I was only 12 then. Anyway, thank you all for being here."" 
Biden was referring to Yitzhak Rabin, who served as prime minister of Israel from 1974-1977 and again from 1992 until he was assassinated in 1995.

Biden actually met with Meir and Rabin in 1973, when he was a 30-year-old senator, a story he's told frequently. Three years ago, he incorrectly claimed he was a ""liaison"" between Israel and Egypt during the Six-Day War, which occurred in 1967, when he was still in law school. 
""I have known every, every prime minister well since Golda Meir, including Golda Meir,"" Biden said during a menorah lighting in 2021. ""And during the Six-Day War, I had an opportunity to, she invited me to come over because I was going to be the liaison between she and the Egyptians about the Suez.""
He actually met with Meir just prior to the October 1973 Yom Kippur War.
""And I sat in front of her desk,"" he added at the time. ""And she had a guy, her staff member, to my right. His name was Rabin. And she kept flipping those maps up and down. She had that bevy of maps, sort of kept it, and it was, it was so depressing what she was, about what happened. She gave me every detail.""
Biden's team confirmed to Fox News Digital Thursday he was joking about his age. 
Both leaders ignored reporters’ shouted questions about a potential cease-fire and the anti-Israel protests after the brief meeting. 
Netanyahu’s address to Congress Wednesday led to anti-Israel protests in the capital, with some marching through the streets shouting ""Free Palestine"" and others waving Hamas flags, burning the American flag and painting graffiti.

Netanyahu slammed the demonstrators during his address, calling them ""Iran's useful idiots.""

""I have a message for these protesters. When the tyrants of Tehran, who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering their hair, are praising, promoting and funding you, you have officially become Iran's useful idiots,"" Netanyahu said.
""Some of these protesters hold up signs proclaiming ‘Gays for Gaza.’ They might as well hold up signs saying ‘Chickens for KFC.’ These protesters chant ‘From the river to the sea.’ But many don't have a clue what river and what sea they're talking about.""

He addressed a nearly full House chamber, which included members of Congress and special guests like freed Israeli hostages who were taken by Hamas Oct. 7 and billionaire Elon Musk, among others.
Among those in the chamber was Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., Israel's harshest critic in the House of Representatives. Tlaib has called for Netanyahu to be arrested by the International Criminal Court. She staged a silent protest for much of his speech, holding a double-sided sign that said ""guilty of genocide"" on one side and ""war criminal"" on the other.

CNN_1,Harris navigates Biden and Netanyahu as she considers her stance on Israel,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/kamala-harris-israel-policy/index.html,2024-07-25 20:40:00,politics,"
            Four days into the most consequential week of Kamala Harris’ political life, she has to confront the most fraught foreign policy issue facing the country by looking directly into the eyes of an Israeli prime minister who decided not to even give her a passing name check in his address to Congress Wednesday afternoon.
    

            Up until now, Harris has been defined by working for President Joe Biden, arguably the most explicitly pro-Israel American president, even though his relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu has frayed.
    

            But now that she’s the presumptive Democratic nominee, Harris has to define what kind of president she wants to be — on this and every other issue, while Biden remains at the White House trying to nail down a Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal and with some around him thinking that restarting the normalization of relations with Saudi Arabia could be a top legacy project for the remainder of his term.
    

            Harris didn’t preside over Netanyahu’s speech to Congress on Wednesday, instead choosing to stick with a pre-scheduled trip to a sorority event in Indiana, as antisemitic protests erupted near the US Capitol where fences were put up like in the days following the January 6, 2021, riot. On Thursday, she’s set to welcome Netanyahu to her ceremonial office in the Old Executive Office Building. But articulating a clear position on Israel will take more than that, according to CNN’s conversations with two dozen former and current aides, members of Congress and other political players.
    

            “We don’t have enough evidence,” said Richard Haass, the former president of the Council on Foreign Relations and official in George W. Bush’s State Department, when asked to evaluate Harris’ position on Israel vis-à-vis Biden. “Anyone who says they can answer is not very helpful. You can’t judge a person when they’re vice president.”
    

            Even several people who have talked with Harris in depth about Israeli policy responded to CNN’s questions — on whether, for example, she would have done the same as Biden in sending some and halting other weapons to Israel — with a series of extended pauses and insistences that it’s impossible to judge hypotheticals.
    

            Aides say she will make her feelings clearer on Thursday after her meeting with Netanyahu.
    

            Harris is going to try to emphasize her independence from Biden without breaking with him, people who know her say, and is going to try to show the same clarity she’s displayed when going after Donald Trump instead of getting caught up in a garbled attempt to please everyone by not saying anything.
    

            The uncertainty about where she stands is high enough that second gentleman Doug Emhoff made a surprise appearance on a quickly organized Zoom call Wednesday afternoon hosted by the Jewish Democratic Council of America and Jewish Women for Kamala.
    

            “Let me just make this clear: The vice president has been and will be a strong supporter of Israel as a secure democratic and Jewish state, and she will always ensure that Israel can defend itself, period. Because that’s who Kamala Harris is,” Emhoff said.
    

            But change is coming, predicted Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee who has been critical of Israel in this period and observed Harris’ foreign policy thinking when they served on the Senate Intelligence Committee together.
    

            “President Biden brought to the White House a lifelong relationship with Bibi Netanyahu and a very mature history on the US-Israel relationship,” Murphy said. “This certainly seems to be a moment for a reconsideration of the relationship and for some fresh thinking on how to approach an Israeli political landscape that is lurching further to the right than we could have ever imagined.”
    

            Murphy added, “I think we would all benefit from getting a fresh set of eyes on this conflict and the way that the United States could try to create a viable Palestinian state.”
    

            But Harris has so many different pulls on her that an aide did not give a direct answer when asked if the vice president considers herself a Zionist — a term Biden again proudly embraced just weeks ago.
    

            That’s a reflection of how much Zionism, which for a century meant believing in the right of a Jewish homeland to exist, has been co-opted by anti-Israel forces, who argue it has come to symbolize colonialism and the killing of Palestinians.
    

            It’s also a reflection of the difference in thinking and rhetoric between the Democratic Party’s new standard bearer and a president who has made allegiance with Israel one of his defining positions for 50 years in national politics.
    

            “The vice president has been a strong and longstanding supporter of Israel as a secure, democratic homeland for the Jewish people. She will always ensure Israel can defend itself from threats, including from Iran and Iran-backed militias such as Hamas and Hezbollah,” said Harris’ deputy national security adviser Dean Lieberman when asked if she considers herself a Zionist. “One can criticize specific policies of the government of Israel while still strongly supporting the state of Israel and the people of Israel. And that support for Israel in no way conflicts with the vice president’s strong view that the Palestinian people deserve freedom, dignity, and self-determination.”
    

            Many close observers see a sign of where Harris’ inclinations are in her choice of Phil Gordon to be her national security adviser. A former Obama administration official, Gordon in 2016 co-authored a report for the Council on Foreign Relations, which, seven years before the October 7 attacks, begins: “The U.S. relationship with Israel is in trouble.” The root of the problem, the authors wrote, is that while America and Israel used to agree on the threats to Israeli security and what to do about them, now those threats have become broader and more complicated, and the opinions about how to tackle them have too.
    

            Gordon has traveled to the region since October 7, holding meetings separate from the ones that Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan and others have been having.
    

            One official who has been deeply involved with Biden administration policy on Israel said that Harris’ differences will actually be key to keeping the overall relationship from getting worse.
    

            “She’ll be able to communicate with another generation. She has the ability, because of who she is, to be enormously helpful to us who care deeply about Israel and how we’re going to get through this disaster,” said the official. “She is the future of the relationship between us and Israel.”
    

            Aides and allies who have talked with Harris – from her Senate days up through her being on the line for nearly every conversation Biden has had with Netanyahu – insist that substantively there is little daylight between her and the president.
    

            The difference is rhetorical, but that difference, they say, is very important. She has been concerned since right after October 7 both about expressing empathy for the Palestinians and about thinking of what the political reverberations could be back home from the way Biden hugged Netanyahu close, figuratively and then literally on his trip to Israel two weeks after the attacks.
    

            It’s the explanation, aides involved tell CNN, for the fury that erupted from the West Wing in March about the way Harris punctuated prepared text that both decried the “humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza and thoroughly condemned Hamas. She built up to her reading of “there must be an immediate ceasefire,” taking a long pause, then adding the rest of the approved sentence: “for at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table.”
    

            Many Democrats outside the White House are making optimistic guesses that she aligns with them.
    

            “Like most Americans, the vice president falls within the pro-Israel mainstream—somewhere between the ‘Greater Israel’ far right and the ‘Free Palestine’ far left,” said Rep. Ritchie Torres, a New York Democrat who has positioned himself as one of the most stalwart defenders of Israel. He added that he expects that position to translate into being for a two-state solution, keeping up security aid and Iron Dome funding for Israel and supporting the Trump administration-negotiated Abraham Accords.
    

            For all the Biden speeches that had to be paused as protesters were removed from the rooms, Harris’ first week effectively on the top of the ticket hasn’t seen such an interruption so far. That doesn’t mean the politics of this are settled.
    

            Abbas Alawieh – a delegate who won a spot at the Democratic convention because he represents some of the 730,000 people who voted “uncommitted” in Michigan’s Democratic primary – told CNN on Wednesday that he remains “very curious how she will differentiate a Gaza policy.”
    

            Alawieh said he’s hopeful. At the very least, he thinks that the party under Harris’ leadership will no longer make him and others aligned with him feel “neglected, ignored—and in some cases maligned,” as happened on a Tuesday night call of state delegates when another person told him to shut up when he tried to speak.
    

            The Michigan Democratic Party chair condemned that behavior in an email to delegates.
    

            Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition released an online ad on Wednesday repeatedly referring to Harris by a mispronounced version of her first name and falsely claimed that she “sided with the pro-Hamas demonstrators” and snubbed Israel by not attending Netanyahu’s speech to Congress.
    

            Trump also accused her of this, saying at a rally in North Carolina that “she’s running away from Israel” and “totally against the Jewish people” for not going. Neither the ad nor the candidate mentioned that Ohio Sen. JD Vance also skipped the speech, though he had no other public schedule, with campaign spokesman Jason Miller telling CNN he “has duties to fulfill as the Republican nominee for vice president.”
    

            Harris’ connection to these issues is more than policy. It touches Emhoff’s daughter, who has been noticeably active on pro-Palestinian causes since October 7. It has come up at Seder dinners at the Naval Observatory. And more than anything, it is rooted in the second gentleman.
    

            Emhoff has talked at length about feeling a sense of duty, not just when he became the first Jewish spouse of a vice president or president, and channeling that into helping develop the administration’s strategy to combat antisemitism. He’s also talked about how much pain he felt personally after October 7.
    

            Halie Soifer, the CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, recalled a trip to Jerusalem she took with Harris and Emhoff in 2017, when she was working in the California Democrat’s new Senate office. She still has photos of Harris taking out a traditional kippah head covering for Emhoff when they visited the Western Wall.
    

            Soifer said she is satisfied that Harris remains committed to Israel — even after being read the indirect answer about whether the vice president considers herself a Zionist.
    

            And Emhoff has stressed that even as this campaign picks up, he is going to keep talking about Judaism and Israel, as he has throughout this administration with his wife’s encouragement.
    

            On the Zoom call on Wednesday, he told the story of not being with his wife on Sunday when the news broke about Biden exiting the race, dropping a little Yiddish by blaming “this flight mishigas” that had him stuck in Los Angeles.
    

            Then he made a promise to the 1,700 people listening: “I’m going to keep living openly like a Jew and maybe there will be a mezuzah on the White House, like there is on the vice president’s residence.”

CNN_2,Doug Emhoff’s ex-wife defends Harris against sexist criticisms of her as childless,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/kerstin-emhoff-defends-kamala-harris-sexism/index.html,2024-07-25 19:31:00,politics,"
            The ex-wife of second gentleman Doug Emhoff on Wednesday defended Vice President Kamala Harris against sexist criticisms about her lack of biological children, calling them “baseless” and expressing her gratitude for the presumptive Democratic nominee.
    

            “These are baseless attacks. For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I,” Kerstin Emhoff said in a statement first provided to CNN. “She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it.”
    

            Emhoff’s statement follows resurfaced video of Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance criticizing several public figures, including Harris, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg as “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives.”
    

            “It’s just a basic fact — you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC — the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,” Vance told Tucker Carlson in a July 2021 interview.
    

            Kerstin Emhoff, a film producer, shares two children with Doug Emhoff. The vice president has said her stepchildren refer to her as “Momala.”
    

            Spokespeople for Vance did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his 2021 statement. Vance is a father of three.
    

            Harris has already faced rounds of attacks on her race and gender. Right wing media have been maligning Harris at an increased clip since President Joe Biden announced he was dropping from the race Sunday and endorsed Harris, slamming the vice president as a “DEI” candidate while criticizing everything from her romantic history to the way she laughs.
    

            Buttigieg, who was criticized along with Harris in Vance’s 2021 interview, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins that the remarks came at a time when he and his husband, Chasten, “had been through a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey.”
    

            “He couldn’t have known that,” Buttigieg said, “but maybe that’s why you shouldn’t be talking about other people’s children.” (The Buttigiegs welcomed twins in late 2021.)
    

            Harris and Doug Emhoff married in 2014.
    

            “The thing about blended families,” Harris told CNN in 2020, “if everyone approaches it in the way that there’s plenty of love to share, then it works.”
    

            In a 2019 essay in Elle, Harris discussed becoming close friends with Kerstin Emhoff and sharing a blended family. “Kerstin and I hit it off ourselves and are dear friends,” Harris said. “… We sometimes joke that our modern family is almost a little too functional.”

CNN_3,Biden and Netanyahu set to meet at fragile moment in their relationship,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/biden-bibi/index.html,2024-07-25 19:00:00,politics,"
            President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are set to speak on Thursday – a high-stakes meeting that comes at a crossroads for both Israel’s war in Gaza and Biden’s political future.
    

            The meeting, which follows Netanyahu’s address to Congress on Wednesday, is Biden’s first meeting with a world leader since announcing he would drop out of the 2024 race, and it comes at a fragile point in their decadeslong relationship. While the US president has remained firmly behind Israel, even as its campaign in Gaza has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, both leaders have traded not-so-subtle barbs in recent months over the future of the war and how Netanyahu has waged it.
    

            Biden has described Israel’s actions in Gaza as “over the top,” threatened to withhold some new arms transfers and repeatedly pressured Netanyahu to scale back and be more precise in his military operation in Gaza – criticism that reached a peak when an Israeli strike killed seven World Central Kitchen workers in early April. The Israeli leader has been steadfast in his position that the war will not end until Hamas is eliminated while accusing the US of withholding weapons from its closest ally – claims that American officials flatly rejected.
    

            The moment is also crucial as Israel’s operations in Gaza threaten to snowball into a broader regional war, as Israel and Lebanon continue to trade cross-border fire.
    

            Speaking in front of Congress this week, Netanyahu did not substantially address the status of ceasefire negotiations. He instead praised Biden for his “heartfelt support” for Israel after the October 7 Hamas attack while urging the US to fast-track military aid to “dramatically expedite an end to the war.”
    

            “As we defend ourselves on all fronts, I know that America has our back and I thank you for it – all sides of the aisle,” Netanyahu said.
    

            The US does not believe, for now, that Netanyahu is standing in the way of or delaying a ceasefire and hostage deal, and believes that progress is being made amid ongoing negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Both the Israelis and Hamas, the official said, have elements they need to agree on before a deal is reached, and not one side is holding up negotiations at this point.
    

            The in-person meeting at the White House will be the first time the two men have met in person since Biden’s trip to Israel last year following the October 7 attack, although the two men have spoken frequently on the phone. It will be followed by a meeting with American hostage families, and then Netanyahu will meet with Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Biden has endorsed to replace him on the top of the Democratic ticket.
    

            The prime minister in his remarks to Congress criticized anti-Israel protesters as “Iran’s useful idiots” and falsely downplayed the role of Israel in causing the ongoing civilian suffering in Gaza.
    

            Biden’s support for Israel’s war had been one his most politically toxic issues within his own party for much of the year, with many of his public campaign appearances being repeatedly interrupted by protesters demanding a ceasefire in Gaza. Biden’s stance toward those protests has been conciliatory – he has repeatedly responded to them by saying that the protesters have a point, and that too many innocent people are dying in Gaza.
    

            But the national conversation surrounding Biden’s handling of Israel’s war took a back seat to the waves of Democratic concern about his ability to beat former President Donald Trump after his faltering debate performance last month. Trump and Netanyahu will meet Friday at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump announced Tuesday.
    

            Last week, Biden spoke extensively about the war in the Middle East for the first time in months – telling a Complex Networks interviewer that he considers himself a Zionist but adding that he’s “done more for the Palestinian community than anybody” while still calling for more aid to reach the Gaza Strip.
    

            “I’m the guy that opened up all the assets. I’m the guy that made sure that – I got the Egyptians to open the border to let goods through, medicine and food,” Biden said. “I have been very supportive of the Palestinians, but Hamas, they’re a bunch of thugs.”
    

            Biden and Netanyahu last spoke during a 30-minute call on July 4, during which both leaders “focused” on details about a possible hostage exchange and ceasefire deal.
    

            A deal was never finalized or assured during that call.

CNN_4,Vance confronts upheaval and uncertainty in first 10 days as Trump’s running mate,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/jd-vance-10-days-running-mate/index.html,2024-07-25 18:48:00,politics,"
            Minutes into his first solo event as Donald Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance had already divided his hometown audience here – over donuts.
    

            While reconnecting with the locals in the crowd over shared memories and favored haunts, Vance posited taking his security detail to nearby Central Pastry Shop after his event.
    

            Amid laughter, stans of a rival donut shop shouted at the stage: “Milton’s!”
    

            The Ohio Republican, in damage control mode, offered to the dissenters, “I love Milton’s, too.” Crisis averted.
    

            Vance has already faced far greater upheaval than pastry debates since joining the Republican ticket – more than perhaps any modern vice presidential nominee. The political landscape Vance stepped into 10 days ago is no longer recognizable after President Joe Biden abruptly ended his campaign. The fallout has left him without a Democratic counterpart after Vice President Kamala Harris quickly emerged as her party’s presumptive nominee. It could be more than a week before Harris selects her running mate.
    

            “I was told I was going to get to debate Kamala Harris, and now President Trump’s going to get to debate her?” Vance joked Monday in the Middletown High School auditorium, surrounded by his wife and friendly faces from his childhood. “I’m kind of pissed off about that if I’m being honest with you.”
    

            Even before he took the role, Vance entered the job unlike any of his predecessors. While playing minigolf with his kids and awaiting word about Trump’s pick, Vance learned the former president was bloodied during a Pennsylvania rally by a would-be assassin’s bullet. His selection two days later – kept secret until the former president’s dramatic reveal to kick off the GOP convention – bitterly divided Trump’s wide circle of allies and advisers, some of whom had publicly lobbied for other Republicans during the prolonged public audition.
    

            Now Vance, chosen by Trump as an heir to his MAGA movement as much as a running mate, is navigating an assignment that seems to be changing on the fly. And he does so with the knowledge that his new boss pays close attention to how his allies and staff perform on television and in public appearances. Trump nearly picked Doug Burgum over Vance in some measure because he thought the North Dakota governor looked the part.
    

            Asked Tuesday if he would have chosen someone different had he known that Harris would become his likely Democratic opponent, Trump said, “I’d do the same pick.”
    

            “He’s doing really well,” Trump said of Vance. “He’s really caught on.”
    

            Trump tapped Vance in part to reinforce his party’s efforts to win over White working-class voters throughout the Rust Belt, a region Vance spent most of his life in and captured in the best-selling memoir “Hillbilly Elegy.” When he called Vance to offer him the vice presidential nod, Trump said he thought the first-term Ohio senator could help the GOP flip Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
    

            Vance leaned into his biography during his appearance Monday in Middletown, where someone held up a homemade “2028 Vance for President” sign. He shared stories of his maternal grandmother, “Mamaw,” and about growing up in a community turned upside down by unemployment and drug addiction.

            It’s a background that Vance has often traced back to Appalachia and his “hillbilly” decedents, and one that Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear – seen as a potential Harris running mate – sought to undermine Monday.
    

            “I want the American people to know what a Kentuckian is and what they look like,” Beshear told MSNBC in response to a question about running on a ticket with Harris. “Because let me just tell you that JD Vance ain’t from here.”
    

            Vance later responded with a jab at Beshear’s legacy as the son of a former governor.
    

            “Nobody gave me the governorship, and nobody gave me a job because of who my father was. I’m proud of that,” he said.
    

            Vance, a former venture capitalist who has already introduced Trump to his network of wealthy friends in the tech industry, is hitting the donor circuit as well, starting Wednesday with a fundraiser in Indiana. He has another half dozen planned in the coming week, according to two sources familiar with the schedule and first reported by The New York Times, and will appear at a joint fundraiser with Trump in Doral, Florida, on Thursday.
    

            Vance will also be relied on to match the campaign schedule of a Democratic ticket led by a more energetic candidate than the 81-year-old Biden. He’s slated to hold five events in two days next week spanning two key battlegrounds, Nevada and Arizona.
    

            But Vance remains a largely unknown quantity, and Democrats have moved quickly to attack the Republican over his past stances, especially his opposition to abortion in almost every instance.
    

            On Wednesday, the Democratic National Committee circulated a clip of Vance comparing abortion to slavery and asserted in a statement: “The Trump-Vance ticket is running on a cruel, dangerous, and wildly unpopular anti-choice agenda that the American people will reject this November.”
    

            Vance, who previously supported a nationwide abortion ban, shrugged off his views as inconsequential given Trump’s latest stance opposing new federal restrictions on the procedure.
    

            “I’m running as the vice presidential nominee, not the presidential nominee, and if I want my views on abortion to dominate the Republican Party, then I’d run for president. I didn’t, and I haven’t,” Vance said on a plane ride from Ohio to Virginia earlier this week. “Donald Trump ran for president, and I think that it’s important as a party we say the voters have decided here. Trump having won has decided what the platform is.”
    

            In Middletown, it was clear Vance was still finding his footing on the stump. A half hour late to his event, Vance and his wife, Usha, stepped onto the stage without entrance music and fumbled through some handshakes before he somewhat awkwardly approached the lectern and she left to find her seat.
    

            At their first joint appearance in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Saturday, there was little doubt who between Trump and Vance was the main act and who was the warmup. Vance delivered short remarks focused mostly on the former president and then reappeared 90 minutes later, priming the audience by introducing Trump, who still wasn’t ready to take the stage, much to the crowd’s disappointment.

            When Trump finally emerged to his signature entrance of “God Bless the USA,” Vance clapped alone for a time as the former president absorbed the cheers. They stood briefly together side by side and quickly embraced before Trump stepped up to the lectern. Vance left the stage and didn’t reappear again that evening.
    

            On television, though, Vance has quickly settled into his role as chief Trump surrogate.
    

            When Fox News asked Vance and Trump in a joint interview if the pressure campaign against Biden was a “coup,” Trump somewhat balked. “Sort of,” he said. Vance, though, pounced.
    

            “If Joe Biden can’t run for president, he can’t serve as president,” Vance said. “And if they want to take him down because he’s mentally incapable of serving, invoke the 25th Amendment. You don’t get to sort of do this in the most politically beneficial way for Democrats. If it’s an actual problem, they should take care of it the appropriate way.”
    

            The unlikely pairing of Trump with a freshman senator half his age will be closely watched in the coming months for signs of discord, especially given the former president’s past treatment of his onetime running mate Mike Pence. Vance’s previous outspoken objections to Trump have already generated fodder for Democrats looking to paint the Ohio Republican as an ambitious shape shifter willing to say what it takes to get closer to power.
    

            But Barbara Duerk, president of the Roanoke Valley Republican Women in Virginia, told CNN said she likes that he changed his mind.
    

            “What I liked about Vance is that he was a ‘Never Trumpster,’ and he learned and saw, and that’s what I encourage all people to do, whether they be Democrats or Republicans,” said Duerk, a self-described former Democrat.
    

            The age difference didn’t bother Mary May, another Roanoke voter, who connected with Vance’s stories about his mother’s addiction struggles.
    

            “We need some young blood,” May said. “He’s for the people.”

CNN_5,Judge rebukes Hunter Biden’s lawyers for ‘false statements’ in their bid to toss tax indictment,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/hunter-biden-lawyers-tax-indictment/index.html,2024-07-25 17:58:00,politics,"
            A judge on Wednesday chided Hunter Biden’s lawyers and threatened to sanction them for “making false statements” in their recent motion to throw out his federal tax indictment.
    

            District Judge Mark Scarsi issued the warning in a 3-page order where he called out Hunter Biden’s lawyers for “misrepresenting the history” of the case. He gave them one week to explain themselves, or potentially face sanctions, like professional disciplinary proceedings or monetary fines.
    

            The dispute revolves around previous assertions from Hunter Biden’s team where they claimed special counsel David Weiss “brought no charges” in the probe when he was serving as US attorney, before he was elevated to special counsel last year.
    

            “These statements, however, are not true, and Mr. Biden’s counsel knows they are not true,” Scarsi wrote.
    

            In fact, as Scarsi pointed out in his order, Weiss did charge Hunter Biden with tax offenses before becoming special counsel. Weiss charged Hunter Biden with two misdemeanors in June 2023 as part of a plea deal that eventually fell apart.
    

            After that proposed plea agreement imploded last summer, Weiss became a special counsel. He then filed the nine-count tax indictment in California, which includes two of the same misdemeanors that were supposed to be part of the plea deal.
    

            “The misstatements in the current motion are not trivial,” Scarsi wrote, adding that he “has little tolerance for lack of candor.”
    

            CNN has reached out to Hunter Biden’s team for comment.
    

            Lawyers for President Joe Biden’s son made those claims in a motion to toss the indictment on the grounds that special counsels like Weiss are unconstitutionally appointed and unlawfully funded. They cited a recent ruling from District Judge Aileen Cannon, who endorsed that long shot theory and dismissed former President Donald Trump’s classified documents case.
    

            Unlike Hunter Biden, who was first charged by a US attorney before being charged by a special counsel, Trump was only charged by a special counsel. Scarsi wrote Wednesday that this creates a “meaningful distinction” between the two cases.
    

            He also described Cannon’s ruling as a “nonbinding district court decision,” further signaling that he may disagree with her controversial ruling, which the prosecutors are appealing.
    

            Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty to tax evasion and other related offenses, and is scheduled to stand trial in September. He was convicted of three felonies last month at a separate trial, for buying and possessing a gun while addicted to illegal drugs.

CNN_6,Biden calls his decision to step aside from 2024 race a matter of defending democracy,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/biden-oval-office-address-2024/index.html,2024-07-25 17:37:00,politics,"
President Joe Biden, speaking to the nation from the Oval Office Wednesday evening, framed his decision to step aside from the 2024 presidential race as a matter of saving democracy and passing “the torch to a new generation.”
    

            In a poignant speech that marked the beginning of the closing chapter of his presidency and half-century in public service, Biden acknowledged that uniting the party required sacrificing personal ambition for what he sees as a greater good.
    

            “I revere this office. But I love my country more,” the president said
    

            “It’s been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in defense of democracy, which is at stake – and is more important than any title. I draw strength and I find joy in working for the American people,” he said.
    

            While Biden did not mention Donald Trump by name, he tried to draw a clear contrast with the former president, whose ambition led him to claim victory in an election he did not win four years ago.
    

            “The great thing about America is, here, kings and dictators do not rule,” Biden said. “The people do. History is in your hands, the idea of America lies in your hands.”

What happens in the Democratic nomination now that Biden has left the race


            Biden is no longer the presumptive Democratic nominee trying to convince the nation that he still has the stamina and faculties to take on Trump in an election in which he warned nothing less than democracy itself is in the balance. Instead, he’s now a lame-duck, having thrown his political weight behind his vice president, Kamala Harris, after being convinced by fellow Democrats that he is politically incapable of seeking a second term in office.
    

            “You know, in recent weeks it’s become clear to me that I need to unite my party in this critical endeavor. I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America’s future all merited a second term,” Biden said. “But nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition. So, I’ve decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It’s the best way to unite our nation.”
    

            His speech marked his first extensive remarks since his announcement Sunday that he was not running and was the first time many Americans have seen him since he tested positive for Covid-19 last week.
    

            During his remarks, which lasted about 11 minutes, Biden worked to shape the first draft of his own legacy, heralding his first-term accomplishments while looking ahead to goals he hopes to achieve in his remaining months in power, including Supreme Court reform, ending the war in Gaza, upholding American alliances and working toward his cancer-ending moonshot.
    

            He also championed his vice president, who’s now taking his place on the ticket.
    

            Harris, Biden said, is “experienced. She’s tough. She’s capable. She’s been an incredible partner to me, and a leader for our country.”
    

            “Now the choice is up to you, the American people,” he added.
    

            Oval Office addresses have historically been serious moments for presidents to speak to the American people at times of national crisis or to make major policy announcements. It will be only the fourth time Biden has addressed the nation from the setting as president. And it’s the second time in just 10 days, following Biden’s remarks to the country earlier this month following the assassination attempt against Trump. He’s also used the setting to speak about Hamas’ attack on Israel last year and to laud the passage of a bipartisan budget agreement.
    

            Biden, who returned to the White House on Tuesday after testing negative for Covid-19, began drafting his highly anticipated address while isolating with the virus in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, senior officials told CNN.
    

            The president and his longtime communications aide, Mike Donilon, began early work on the speech shortly after Biden went public with his decision to exit the race, after three weeks of mounting intraparty pressure. (Donilon, a former pollster, played an instrumental role in presenting the data that informed Biden’s decision to step aside.)
    

            He also received speechwriting assistance from historian Jon Meacham.
    

            Harris, who quickly secured the backing of enough delegates to win the Democratic nomination, hit the campaign trail Tuesday in the key battleground state of Wisconsin, where she sought to draw a contrast with Trump. She appeared at a sorority event in Indianapolis on Wednesday, then traveled to Houston, which is where she watched Biden’s remarks.

Doug Emhoff’s ex-wife defends Harris against sexist criticisms of her as childless


            The former president held his first campaign rally since Biden dropped out in North Carolina on Wednesday, attacking Harris as a “radical liberal” who voters will reject in November. After Biden delivered his Oval Office speech, Trump said on social media that is was “barely understandable, and sooo bad.”
    

             A CNN poll released Wednesday found no clear leader in the race between Harris and Trump, but it showed a closer contest than earlier CNN polling of the Biden-Trump matchup.
    

            The new CNN poll finds voters widely supportive of both Biden’s decision to step aside and his choice to remain in office through the end of his term. But Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters are closely split over whether the next nominee should continue Biden’s policies (53%) or take the country in a new direction (47%). Desire for a new direction is largely concentrated among younger voters and voters of color.
    

            Biden himself is expected to turn his attention in the coming days and weeks to the legacy of his one-term presidency. But, as one source told CNN, with the decision to drop out of the 2024 race only days old, such discussions have not begun in earnest.
    

            But on Wednesday, he took the opportunity to marvel at his own, uniquely American, life story.
    

            “It has been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years. Nowhere else could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as president of the United States.”
    

            “Here I am,” he added. “That’s what’s so special about America.”
    

            The president then walked out to the Rose Garden, where he addressed hundreds of White House staffers who walked over to the executive mansion to see Biden and share ice cream with him.

CNN_7,NORAD intercepts Russian and Chinese bombers operating together near Alaska in first such flight,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/norad-russian-chinese-bombers-alaska/index.html,2024-07-25 17:00:00,politics,"
            The North American Aerospace Defense Command intercepted two Russian and two Chinese bombers flying near Alaska Wednesday in what a US defense official said was the first time the two countries have been intercepted while operating together.
    

            The bombers remained in international airspace in Alaska’s Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) and were “not seen as a threat,” according to a statement from NORAD.
    

            The US and Canada, which together comprise NORAD, intercepted the Russian TU-95 Bear and Chinese H-6 bombers. The aircraft did not enter US or Canadian sovereign airspace, NORAD said.
    

            It also marks the first time H-6 bombers, which are a derivative of older Soviet bombers, have entered the Alaska ADIZ, the defense official said.
    

            The intercept was carried out by US F-16 and F-35 fighter jets, as well as Canadian CF-18 fighter jets, according to the defense official. Support aircraft were also part of the intercept, the official said.
    

            On Thursday, China’s Defense Ministry said the Chinese and Russian air forces had organized a “joint strategic aerial patrol in the relevant airspace of the Bering Sea” as part of an existing annual cooperation plan between the two militaries.
    

            Zhang Xiaogang, a spokesperson for the ministry, told a news conference it was the eighth such patrol organized by the two militaries since 2019, which were aimed at “further testing and enhancing the level of cooperation between the two air forces, as well as deepening strategic mutual trust and practical cooperation between the two countries.”
    

            “This action is not aimed at third parties, it is in line with relevant international laws and international practices and has nothing to do with the current international and regional situation,” Zhang said.
    

            Russian flights into Alaska’s ADIZ are not uncommon. In May, Russia flew four aircraft into Alaska’s ADIZ, which NORAD said at the time “occurs regularly.”
    

            But the presence of Chinese aircraft appears to be a new development. In March, the head of US Northern Command, Gen. Gregory Guillot, said China was pushing farther north into the Arctic and he expected to see aircraft there “as soon as this year potentially.”
    

            “What I have seen is a willingness and a desire by the Chinese to act up there,” Guillot told a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
    

            “We have seen them in the maritime. We have seen them under the cloud of a technical or scientific research, but we think it is certainly multi-mission, to include military. And then I expect to see air activity in the Alaska part of the Arctic as soon as this year, potentially.
    

            “It is a very big concern of mine.”
    

            China considers itself a “near-Arctic” state and has worked to expand its presence in the far north, including through its cooperation with Russia.

CNN_8,Jill Biden travels to Paris Olympics as her husband passes the torch,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/jill-biden-paris-olympics/index.html,2024-07-25 15:00:00,politics,"
            First lady Jill Biden watched on Wednesday night as President Joe Biden told the American people it was time to “pass the torch” on his political career. Then she got on a plane, flying nearly 4,000 miles to Paris, where another torch was being passed.
    

            Jill Biden is arriving in Paris at a monumental time for her husband’s presidency. Stepping aboard her plane moments after the president addressed the nation from the Oval Office, the first lady’s role has rapidly shifted from that of an active and prolific surrogate to a leader racing the clock to the inauguration of a new administration.
    

            Biden is now embarking on a tour of “lasts” in office, starting with her second and final trip to cheer on American athletes at the Olympic Games as first lady.
    

            The trip, which has been in the works long before the president suspended his reelection campaign, will signal how her role may be remembered at home and on the world stage.
    

            It’s a legacy she hinted at in 2021 when traveling with the president to the G7 summit. “I feel that I’m a partner on this journey of healing, bringing together, unity,” Biden told reporters.
    

            That unity will be on display at the Olympic Games, a rare moment in intensely polarized times.
    

            “The First Lady is excited to head to the Olympic Games, where we are all united as a country in support of one team: Team USA,” her spokesperson, Vanessa Valdivia, said in a statement.
    

            Biden, whom her office described as a devoted sports fan, is expected to greet Olympic athletes and their families during the trip, and will represent the US at the opening ceremony. She will also cheer on Team USA at “various Olympic events,” her office said.
    

            For the past three-and-a-half years, Biden has been the president’s fiercest protector and closest adviser, wielding influence from the White House to the campaign.
    

            “She is Joe Biden’s rock and she has been a rock in this administration — one that the president has depended upon, but senior leadership have looked to for guidance,” said Capricia Marshall, who served as US chief of protocol during the Obama administration and White House social secretary during the Clinton administration.
    

            That role and her support of the president took on some scrutiny in recent weeks after his faltering debate performance.
    

            “Down to the last hours of the decision only he could make, she was supportive of whatever road he chose,” Jill Biden’s communications director Elizabeth Alexander told CNN.
    

            Alexander added, “She’s his biggest believer, champion, and always on his side, in that trusted way only a spouse of almost 50 years can be.”
    

            A reluctant politician, the first lady has been a major surrogate on the campaign trail, criss-crossing the country on the president’s behalf as she worked to bolster his support with key coalitions.
    

            She is expected to continue to be on the road in support of Vice President Kamala Harris, a Harris campaign spokesperson said.
    

            Biden, Marshall said, has sought to elevate issues of importance to her, while also “constantly keeping in mind the president’s agenda and reinforcing that messaging constantly.” One of those issues is women’s health research, which she will highlight Saturday in Paris at an event focused on advancing women’s sports and health innovation with health, sports and business leaders, her office said.
    

            Biden has also focused on education issues, spoken out against gun violence, and highlighted support for US military veterans and families.
    

            “She has been nonstop, hardworking. She wanted to be first lady for everyone, not just those that voted for Joe … and really has embraced the role,” said Anita McBride, who served as a top aide to former first lady Laura Bush.
    

            Biden will also be remembered for “breaking ground,” McBride said, as the first first lady to hold a job outside the White House, teaching English at a Virginia community college.
    

            In one tangible signal of how plans for the Paris trip changed since the president’s decision to drop his reelection bid, Jill Biden had been scheduled to headline a fundraiser for Americans living abroad in Paris. But it’s been rescheduled to be led by second gentleman Doug Emhoff, who picked up the torch of the spouse of the presumptive Democratic nominee and will lead the US delegation to the closing ceremony on August 11.
    

            The first lady previously led the US delegation to the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, which were rescheduled to the summer of 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. At the time, Biden provided a dose of normalcy to an otherwise highly unusual Olympics rife with Covid restrictions, including mask mandates and virtually empty stadiums.
    

            Decked in Team USA apparel, Biden was seen cheering, clapping, and at times agonizing over the games, a cheerleader mom stand-in for the American athletes whose parents could not be there in person.
    

            Three years later, Valdivia said, “these Games are especially meaningful for her because when she went to the Tokyo Olympics in the summer of 2021, the athletes couldn’t bring their families with them due to Covid. This time she’ll be able to celebrate the families and cheer with them for their Olympians.”

CNN_9,House Democrats praise Biden’s speech passing the torch,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/house-democrats-praise-bidens-speech/index.html,2024-07-25 12:10:00,politics,"
            House Democrats Wednesday night praised President Joe Biden for his speech explaining his decision to step aside from the 2024 presidential race, putting an end to a bitter chapter of Democratic infighting over Biden’s future where many Democratic lawmakers publicly and privately pressured the president to not run for reelection.
    

            Biden’s disastrous debate performance on June 27 sent the Democratic Party into a tailspin, where concerns about the president’s mental acuity and the negative impact that could have on down ballot races culminated in 36 House and Senate Democrats publicly calling on Biden to end his presidential campaign.
    

            But in the wake of Biden’s heartfelt speech, the consensus among lawmakers was one of gratitude, ready to bury the hatchet.
    

            Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, who had called for Biden to step aside, praised the speech, saying “He did a great job of laying out why he did what he did.”
    

            Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who at one point told Biden that polling showed that the president cannot defeat Donald Trump and that Biden could destroy Democrats’ chances of winning the House in November if he continues seeking a second term, called Biden’s address on Wednesday, “great.”
    

            “I thought it showed his greatness and his goodness,” the California Democrat said.
    

            Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, who penned a deeply personal letter to Biden earlier this month, said that there is “no shame in taking a well-deserved bow.” He told CNN after watching the speech, “He’s a model to everybody about how to put Democratic community first, above your own ambitions and interests.”
    

            Over the course of the three-and-a-half week saga, Biden tried to quell concerns from lawmakers directly in a series of phone calls.
    

            On one of those calls with a group of moderate House Democrats, Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, shared concerns with Biden that he was losing ground in her state. At the time, the president pushed back, suggesting that he didn’t believe that, which prompted Houlahan to tell Biden that she had polling and it is what she is seeing. The interaction left many on the call frustrated and despondent because they were convinced that not only was the president dug in, but that he was not getting valid information from his tight group of advisers.
    

            But on Wednesday night, Houlahan had a different message, telling CNN, “I was very grateful to him for the very patriotic thing that he did for all of us.”
    

            Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz praised Biden’s address as “one of the best speeches I think he’s ever given” despite saying he “didn’t look as good or sound as good.”
    

            After Biden announced Sunday he would step aside and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, many in the party expressed their support for the new candidate, and a wave of endorsements from state delegations made Harris the presumptive Democratic nominee. Despite attacks from Republicans, including Trump, the party has lined up behind Harris. Wednesday night, many lawmakers reflected on Biden and his speech.
    

            A number of lawmakers reacted to the emotion they felt from Biden while watching the speech.
    

            “He made me cry,” Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett, a staunch Biden supporter amid concerns about his electability, told reporters Wednesday. “It was the president that I know and love…you could see what it’s like to have a real compassionate, well-intentioned, thoughtful president.”
    

            Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who had hoped Biden would stay in the race, told CNN of the speech, “I thought it was very effective. I imagine it was one of the hardest addresses he’s ever had to deliver.”
    

            “You could tell the weight of it was on him while he was speaking. Sometimes you can just tell when people are talking that what they’re saying is very hard for them to say,” Democratic Rep. Jeff Jackson of North Carolina told CNN.
    

            One of Biden’s top congressional allies, Rep. Jim Clyburn, praised the speech and, when asked if Biden had made the right decision to step aside, said, “I’m happy that he is happy.”
    

            As much as lawmakers applauded Biden, they said the president had made the right decision.
    

            Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna told CNN, “Yes,” Biden made the right decision “because ultimately a decision of running or not is a very personal decision, and he seemed very much at peace with it.”
    

            The rare moment lawmakers had just witnessed was not lost on them.
    

            “We owe him a debt of gratitude for putting the country over self. Around here, that’s like a flying unicorn,” Pocan said.

CNN_10,New York urges Supreme Court not to intervene in Trump’s hush money criminal case,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/new-york-missouri-supreme-court-trump-hush-money-case/index.html,2024-07-25 09:53:00,politics,"
            New York’s attorney general urged the Supreme Court on Wednesday to stay out of Donald Trump’s hush money criminal case, arguing the nation’s highest court should not grant a novel request by Missouri to pause his sentencing hearing and lift the gag order imposed on the former president in the case.
    

            Earlier this month, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican, asked the Supreme Court for permission to file a complaint against New York to pause Trump’s September sentencing hearing and lift the restrictions on his speech – arguing in part that New York was infringing on the right of Missouri voters to hear from presidential candidates.
    

            But New York Attorney General Letitia James told the high court in a new filing that Missouri had no legal basis to turn to the justices for that type of relief, which she said “seriously undermines the integrity of the courts and risks setting a dangerous precedent that encourages a flood of similar, unmeritorious litigation.”
    

            The type of relief sought by Missouri, James argued, can only be obtained through her state’s courts, not the Supreme Court.
    

            “Allowing Missouri to file this suit for such relief against New York would permit an extraordinary and dangerous end-run around former President Trump’s ongoing state court proceedings and the statutory limitations on this Court’s jurisdiction to review state court decisions,” she wrote.
    

            Chiefly, James argued that Missouri lacked the legal right – known as “standing” – needed to bring its complaint against her state because the harms Bailey said his residents would face without the high court’s intervention are “speculative.”
    

            “The potential sentence and speech restrictions may prove no obstacle to the interests of people who wish to hear from former President Trump,” James wrote, adding that the former president’s sentencing in the case has already been moved to September “and may not occur” if the judge who oversaw the trial grants Trump’s request to set aside the verdict in light of the Supreme Court’s ruling granting him partial immunity.
    

            Missouri’s request, James argued, was nothing more than the state “impermissibly seeking to further the individual interests of former President Trump.”
    

            A Manhattan jury convicted Trump in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records tied to hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels to keep her from speaking out about an alleged affair with Trump before the 2016 election. Trump has denied the affair.
    

            For now, a limited gag order barring Trump from publicly speaking about prosecutors, court staff and their families remains in place at least until Trump is sentenced.

CNN_11,House votes to set up bipartisan task force to investigate Trump assassination attempt,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/house-vote-bipartisan-task-force-assassination-attempt/index.html,2024-07-25 09:30:00,politics,"
            The House voted on Wednesday to create a bipartisan task force to investigate the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump.
    

            The move comes as lawmakers seek answers and accountability after the 2024 Republican presidential candidate was shot at during a rally in Pennsylvania this month. A resolution to establish the task force was approved in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 416 to 0.
    

            The House task force will be made up of seven Republicans and six Democrats and will have subpoena authority, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries announced this week.
    

            Johnson told CNN on Wednesday that the appointments to the task force will be announced on Thursday. Jeffries’ nominations to the task force will be handled “after consultation” with Johnson.
    

            The work of the task force will be done “quickly, efficiently, effectively, and that’s what the American people demanded,” Johnson said Wednesday.
    

            It will issue a final report on its findings no later than December 13, 2024, “including any recommendations for legislative reforms necessary to prevent future security lapses,” according to the text of the resolution the House passed.
    

            Congress has moved swiftly to investigate the security failures that led to the shooting on July 13. After mounting pressure and calls from lawmakers to step down, US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned this week.
    

            On Monday, Cheatle was grilled at length by the House Oversight Committee over security failures related to the assassination attempt. On Tuesday, a Pennsylvania state police commissioner offered striking testimony about the security failures that led to the near assassination of Trump. And on Wednesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified that Trump’s would-be assassin searched for details of the John F. Kennedy shooting from his laptop and flew a drone in the area near the rally just two hours before the former president took the stage.
    

            The task force “will move quickly to find the facts, ensure accountability, and make certain such failures never happen again,” Johnson and Jeffries said in a joint statement earlier this week.
    

            According to the resolution establishing the task force, it will “investigate and fully examine all actions by any agency, department, officer, or employee of the federal government, as well as state and local law enforcement or any other State or local government or private entities or individuals, related to the attempted assassination of Donald J. Trump on July 13, 2024 in Butler, Pennsylvania.”
    

            The task force will also be empowered to issue interim reports “it deems necessary.” In addition to having subpoena power, the task force can take depositions, according to the resolution.

CNN_12,Trump slams Harris as an ‘ultra-liberal’ as he returns to the campaign trail under a reshaped political landscape,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/donald-trump-rally-north-carolina/index.html,2024-07-25 09:11:00,politics,"
Donald Trump stepped onto the campaign trail Wednesday to an entirely new race and a political landscape once again irrevocably altered by an unprecedented election year.
    

            The former president’s rally here was﻿ his first since President Joe Biden abruptly ended his reelection bid Sunday, setting off a chain of events that appears destined to end with Trump facing Vice President Kamala Harris in November.
    

            Trump lost no time Wednesday turning his focus to his likely new opponent, dubbing her “Lyin’ Kamala Harris” and painting her as a “radical liberal” whom voters will reject in November.
    

            “Kamala Harris has been the ultra-liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe,” the former president told his supporters.
    

            Biden’s decision to end his campaign and Harris’ subsequent elevation has sent a surge of adrenaline through the Democratic Party and unleashed a wave of new donations to compete with Trump’s own strengthened financial position. Meanwhile, Trump and his campaign are working to reimagine a playbook and operation launched to take on an unpopular 81-year-old incumbent.
    

            Trump told the audience in Charlotte that he “was supposed to be nice,” alluding to his message of unity after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania the weekend before the Republican National Convention.
    

            “They say something happened to me when I got shot: I became nice,” Trump said. “If you don’t mind, I’m not going to be nice,” he added to roars from the crowd.
    

            “This November, the American people are going to tell her, ‘No thanks, Kamala. You’ve done a terrible job. You’ve been terrible at everything,’” said the former president, who slammed Harris over the border and inflation.
    

            Trump also mocked Harris’ attempts to portray the race against the former president as one between a former prosecutor – Harris is a former San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general – and a convicted felon.
    

            “Their campaign says, ‘I’m the prosecutor, and he is the convicted felon.’ That’s that campaign. I don’t think people are going to buy it. And we won our big case. You know, we won the case in Florida,” Trump said, referring to the recently dismissed classified documents case.
    

            “A vote for Kamala is a vote for four more years of dishonesty and incompetence, weakness and failure,” he added.
    

            In a campaign already marked by extraordinary events – a significant civil judgment against Trump, a felony conviction, an indictment dismissed and another delayed by a scandal in the Georgia prosecutor’s office, Biden’s confidence-shattering debate performance and the assassination attempt – the latest twist has plunged the presidential race deeper into uncharted territory.
    

            Trump spent Tuesday reacting to his changed political fortunes. In a barrage of social media posts, the former president ripped into his likely new opponent, lamented that Republicans were forced “to waste a great deal of time and money” prior to the Democratic shake-up, suggested that the “Biden/Harris administration” was to blame for the assassination attempt on his life, criticized Democratic tributes to Biden (“He was pushed out of power like a dog,” the former president wrote) and ripped Fox News for giving airtime to the Democratic governor of Minnesota, a state Trump is targeting.

            “They make me fight battles that I shouldn’t have to fight!” Trump said of the network.
    

            Later, Trump held a call with reporters – the first of its kind this cycle – during which he tested new attack lines against Harris.
    

            “As a result of her dangerously extreme immigration policies, the largest invasion in history is now taking place at our southern border, and it’s getting worse, not better,” said Trump, who has spent the past 19 months attacking Biden over the border while rarely mentioning Harris.
    

            The Democratic National Committee responded to the stepped-up attacks on Harris over immigration by highlighting Trump’s successful effort to kill a bipartisan immigration deal earlier this year.
    

            Trump’s team insists it was prepared for a change at the top of the Democratic ticket long before Biden officially dropped out, pointing to an internal memo from May laying out scenarios that would result in an open convention and another Democrat as the nominee.
    

            Senior Trump advisers continue to suggest that a campaign against Harris would largely center on the same issues once used to criticize Biden: crime, immigration and inflation. As Biden’s second in command, Harris played a key role in shaping the administration’s approaches to those topics, they will argue.
    

            However, some individuals close to Trump acknowledge the uncertainty brought on by Harris’ candidacy, specifically what new Democratic enthusiasm could mean for turnout in November. A new CNN/SSRS poll released Wednesday found no clear leader in a Trump-Harris matchup: The former president held 49% support among registered voters nationwide to Harris’ 46%, a finding within the poll’s margin of sampling error. Still, that was a closer contest than earlier CNN polling had found about a Biden-Trump matchup.
    

            Trump’s campaign had been bracing for the fresh excitement over Harris to generate a bump for her in the polls, as it laid out in an expectation-setting memo Tuesday from Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio. He predicted that Harris would start “gaining on or even leading President Trump” in the polls, though he also insisted that the “honeymoon” period would end.
    

            Trump’s team faces a race against the clock to define Harris before she can fully turn the Biden election machine into her own campaign. Though polls suggest Harris is a recognizable figure, the Trump campaign remains convinced that the public doesn’t know much about her – referring to the gap as “name education.” The campaign intends to spend the coming weeks trying to fill that knowledge void with as much negative information about Harris as it can.
    

            Fabrizio in his memo previewed what the Trump campaign is expected to attack: Harris’ record in California as a prosecutor and state attorney general; her tie-breaking vote as vice president on the Inflation Reduction Act, a law Biden championed to boost investments to reverse climate change; and her response to the rise in migrant border crossings.

            A source close to Trump also indicated that the campaign and its allies are planning to specifically highlight certain choices she made as San Francisco district attorney in an attempt to portray her as lenient on violent criminals.
    

            “So, while the public polls may change in the short run and she may consolidate a bit more of the Democrat base, Harris can’t change who she is or what she’ done,” Fabrizio wrote.
    

            The leading pro-Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., launched a new 30-second spot Sunday, first shared on social media, showcasing another plan of attack. The ad says Harris “covered up Joe Biden’s obvious mental decline” and features a clip of her praising Biden’s performance as president. “Our president is in good shape, in good health, tireless, vibrant, and I have no doubt about the strength of the work that we have done,” Harris says in the clip.
    

            The group, which has already spent $77 million on ads boosting Trump so far, announced plans to air the ad in the key battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania.
    

            Trump’s appearance in Charlotte provided his first opportunity to contrast himself with Harris before voters in a battleground state. Four years ago, North Carolina produced Trump’s narrowest margin of statewide victory, and it is expected to be a top battleground again in 2024.
    

            In a memo released Wednesday, the Harris campaign outlined its view of the candidate’s electoral path to victory, painting a much more optimistic picture beyond the so-called Blue Wall states to include the battleground states of the Sun Belt such as Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina. It’s a notable change from where things stood just weeks ago when a Biden campaign memo acknowledged that those Sun Belt states were no longer as competitive.

CNN_13,"What is DEI? Republicans are using the term to attack Kamala Harris, but experts say it’s widely misunderstood",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/dei-kamala-harris/index.html,2024-07-25 08:08:00,politics,"
            The ongoing controversy surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion has spilled over into the 2024 presidential race with Vice President Kamala Harris on the path to becoming the Democratic nominee.
    

            Earlier this week, Tennessee Republican Rep. Tim Burchett suggested in an interview with CNN’s Manu Raju that President Joe Biden chose Harris as a running mate because she was a Black woman.
    

            “100% she is a DEI hire,” Burchett said.
    

            Supporters have defended Harris, who, if elected, would become the nation’s first female president.
    

In an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, UN ambassador Susan Rice called the attacks from Republicans “extremely offensive and dehumanizing.”
    

            Rice said the attacks insinuate that people from marginalized groups who achieve success or rise to leadership roles didn’t earn it.
    

            “That is incredibly insulting,” Rice said.

A GOP congressman called Kamala Harris a ‘DEI hire.’ Some caution it’s a sign of what’s to come


            But Harris isn’t the first target in Republicans’ efforts to discredit people of color and the programs that help promote diversity.
    

            Since 2023, 85 anti-DEI bills that target programs at colleges have been introduced in 28 states and in Congress, according to a tally by The Chronicle of Higher Education. Fourteen have been signed into law, in states like Texas and Florida.
    

A 2023 survey by the Pew Research Center found that 52% of employed US adults said they have DEI trainings or meetings at work, and 33% said they have a designated staff member who promotes DEI.
    

            But recently, some companies have slashed teams dedicated to DEI. And wealthy corporate leaders such as Bill Ackman and Elon Musk have made posts on social media that decried diversity programs.
    

            Critics say DEI programs are discriminatory and attempt to solve racial discrimination by disadvantaging other groups, particularly White Americans. But supporters and industry experts insist the decades-old practice has been politicized and is widely misunderstood.
    

            CNN interviewed seven DEI experts and industry leaders and asked each to define diversity, equity and inclusion. Although their responses varied slightly, most had a shared vision for what constitutes DEI:
    

            – Diversity is embracing the differences everyone brings to the table, whether it’s someone’s race, age, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, physical ability or other aspects of social identity.
    

            – Equity is treating everyone fairly and providing equal opportunities.


            – Inclusion is respecting everyone’s voice and creating a culture where people from all backgrounds feel encouraged to express their ideas and perspectives.

DEI efforts are under siege. Here’s what experts say is at stake


            Daniel Oppong, founder of The Courage Collective, a consultancy that advises companies on DEI, said DEI was created because marginalized communities have not always had equal opportunities for jobs or felt a sense of belonging in majority-White corporate settings.
    

            “That is the genesis of why some of these programs exist,” he said. “It was an attempt to try to create workplaces where more or all people can thrive.”
    

            President Lyndon Baines Johnson signs the Civil Rights Act on July 2, 1964. The law made it illegal to discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and barred unequal application of voter registration requirements. It also banned segregation in public places, like public schools and libraries.
    

            The backlash against DEI may feel like a pendulum swing from 2020, when the nation faced a racial reckoning following George Floyd’s death. But the DEI practice has been around for decades.
    

            Dominique Hollins, founder of the DEI consulting firm WĒ360, said the origins of DEI programs date back to the civil rights movement, which played a pivotal role in accelerating efforts to create more diverse and inclusive workplaces.
    

            Title VII of the Civil Rights Act established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which works to eliminate employment discrimination.
    

            In the 1960s and ‘70s, employees began filing discrimination lawsuits with the EEOC, and many companies began incorporating diversity into their business strategies by providing diversity training, according to a 2008 report published in the Academy of Management Learning & Education.
    

            These diversity training efforts emerged around the time that affirmative action began by executive order from President John F. Kennedy. Although the two concepts may seem similar, affirmative action is different from DEI because it required federal contractors to treat all applicants and employees equally, regardless of race, color, religion and sex.
    

            Colleges and universities also used affirmative action to boost enrollment of students of color at majority-White schools. But last year, the Supreme Court gutted affirmative action, ruling that race-conscious college admissions were unconstitutional.

            After President Ronald Reagan backed corporate deregulation policies that said companies should be addressing discrimination internally in the 1980s, Hollins said some of the diversity efforts lost momentum.
    

            In the decades that followed, Hollins said, many companies kept pushing for DEI-focused jobs and training in a “piecemeal” fashion, instead of creating ongoing programs and dedicated teams.
    

            Hollins said many companies didn’t have the staffing or resources to sustain DEI efforts.
    

            But Floyd’s murder by Minneapolis police in May 2020 sparked a racial reckoning and a renewed push for creating DEI leadership roles and initiatives at major corporations.
    

            Between 2019 and 2022, chief diversity and inclusion officer roles grew by 168.9%, according to a LinkedIn analysis.
    

            Today, some of those efforts have been rolled back, and people have left DEI roles because they didn’t feel fully supported, Hollins said.
    

            Companies “were giving the appearance of commitment without actually doing the right work for that commitment to be sustainable,” Hollins said.
    

            Despite the backlash against DEI programs and initiatives, many companies are standing firm in their support for DEI. 


            A survey published in January by the polling firm Ipsos found 67% of people surveyed said their employers require or offer trainings, lectures, webinars, or resources on DEI. And 71% of people surveyed said they think DEI training is important to “creating a positive workplace culture.”
    

            Today, studies show that many companies are prioritizing some form of DEI. According to a 2023 study by the Pew Research Center, 61% of U.S. adults say their workplace has policies that focus on fairness in hiring, promotions or pay. And 56% of U.S. adults say “focusing on increasing diversity, equity and inclusion at work is mainly a good thing.”


            Kelly Baker, executive vice president and chief human resources officer at Thrivent, an organization that provides financial advice, said DEI in the workplace can be a mix of employee training, resource networks and recruiting practices.
    

            Her company, for example, has resource groups for women in leadership, young professionals, Black employees, Hispanic employees and military veterans, among others.
    

            Thrivent’s DEI training teaches employees how to understand and bridge cultural differences in the workplace, Baker said.
    

            Thrivent also seeks job candidates with diversity in their race, geography, gender and industry background, Baker said.
    

            Experts say many corporations tie DEI to their business strategies.
    

            Diversity “is related to our business growth strategy,” Baker said. “It’s pragmatic and essential and critical for us to ensure that our client base reflects the world that we are in and the world that we are going to be in.”
    

            College campuses have become ground zero for the DEI debate as state lawmakers across the country launch efforts to halt or limit DEI programs in public schools and universities.
    

            Earlier this year, the University of Florida eliminated the office of its chief diversity officer to comply with regulations from the Florida Board of Governors that prohibit spending state funds on DEI programs.
    

            Ella Washington, professor of practice at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, said she is concerned that efforts to ban DEI on college campuses will prevent students from being prepared for the real world.
    

            “I think a lot of it is short-sighted and politically motivated,” Washington said. “It’s hard for me to believe that all of these lawmakers want exclusion be taught and to erase all of history.”
    

            Washington said while DEI looks different on every college campus, many schools focus efforts on recruitment and admissions, curriculum and special programs for underrepresented students.
    

            Georgetown’s Office of Student Equity & Inclusion oversees several DEI-centered programs including the Disability Cultural Center, Women’s Center, LGBTQ Resource Center and the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access, according to its website.
    

            Washington said there is also a program for first-generation college students where they have a chance to build community.
    

            Prioritizing and embracing a diverse student body allows students to interact with peers from different walks of life and learn new perspectives even outside of the classroom, Washington said.
    

            “Colleges are certainly a microcosm of the world,” Washington said. “So, having an experience where equity is centered, equality is considered, inclusion is at the forefront of people’s minds, those are things we are teaching the next generation about how they should be running the world.”
    

            In recent years, DEI has become a social and political lightning rod for lawmakers, corporate leaders and conservative activists, who have sought to cast the initiatives as unfair and even racist.
    

            Some were emboldened by the Supreme Court’s decision to gut affirmative action last June.
    

            Christopher Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and an outspoken critic of DEI, wrote in a New York Times op-ed last year that “these are not neutral programs to increase demographic diversity; they are political programs that use taxpayer resources to advance a specific partisan orthodoxy.”
    

            The Claremont Institute, a conservative think tank, holds a similar position. Ryan P. Williams, president of the institute, previously told CNN he believes the ideology behind DEI is “fundamentally anti-American.”
    

            “The words that the acronym ‘DEI’ represent sound nice, but it is nothing more than affirmative action and racial preferences by a different name, a system that features racial headcounts and arbitrarily assigned roles of ‘oppressor’ and ‘oppressed’ groups in America,” Williams said in an emailed statement. “If we continue to do democracy this way, it will only end in acrimony, strife, resentment, and American collapse.”
    

            Earlier this year, billionaire investor Bill Ackman posted a 4,000-word opus on X that criticized DEI as “inherently a racist and illegal movement in its implementation even if it purports to work on behalf of the so-called oppressed.” Ackman’s lengthy thesis was later reposted by billionaire Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who now owns the social media platform.
    

            “DEI is just another word for racism. Shame on anyone who uses it,” Musk wrote in his post.
    

            In a follow-up post, Musk doubled down, adding: “DEI, because it discriminates on the basis of race, gender and many other factors, is not merely immoral, it is also illegal.”
    

            Tesla, which is owned by Musk, has since omitted all language regarding minority workers and outreach to minority communities in its 10-K filing with the SEC made January 29, CNN previously reported.
    

            But not every business leader agrees. Mark Cuban, billionaire businessman and minority owner of the Dallas Mavericks, pushed back on Musk’s posts in a thread defending DEI as good for businesses and their workers.
    

            “The loss of DEI-Phobic companies is my gain,” Cuban wrote. “Having a workforce that is diverse and representative of your stakeholders is good for business.”
    

            In April 2022, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed HB 7, known as the “Stop WOKE” bill into law. ﻿


            Texas, North Dakota, North Carolina, Tennessee and Utah also have at least one anti-DEI bill that has been signed into law, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education.


            In Nebraska, Republican State Sen. Dave Murman proposed a bill in January that would prohibit state colleges and universities from dedicating public money and staff time to DEI efforts.
    

            The bill is currently with the Nebraska legislature’s education committee, which will decide whether to move it to the full legislature.
    

             Murman’s office did not respond to a request for an interview.
    

            Nebraska Democratic state Sen. Danielle Conrad told CNN she opposes the bill, in part because the broader effort to ban DEI has become “divisive.” She said it also “distracts from the real issues” colleges are facing, such as families who can’t afford tuition.
    

            DEI, she said, is valuable to colleges and universities.
    

            “We absolutely know from common sense and research that when we have more diverse perspectives in discussion or as part of our education, it helps us to have more thoughtful results,” Conrad said. “It helps us to be more well-rounded, active and engaged citizens.”

CNN_14,Ex-Uvalde schools police officer will be arraigned today on charges of child endangerment and abandonment in 2022 massacre,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/us/uvalde-shooting-police-officer-arraignment/index.html,2024-07-25 21:43:00,us,"
            One of the 376 officers who responded to the massacre at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, is expected to be arraigned on over two dozen criminal charges Thursday – more than two years after law enforcement’s botched response to the mass shooting that left 19 children and two teachers dead.
    

            Former Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District police officer Adrian Gonzales faces 29 counts of abandoning and endangering a child in connection with the slaughter  on May 24, 2022. He is expected to plead not guilty.
    

            Gonzales and former Uvalde schools police chief Pete Arredondo are to this point the only law enforcement officers to face criminal charges in the deadliest school shooting in more than a decade.

            It took officers 77 minutes after the gunman walked into the school to take him down. As victims lay dead or dying inside classrooms, officers were seen on video waiting outside in hallways.
    

            The delayed response to the attack has been described as an “abject failure,” with officials and experts blaming multiple entities.
    

            According to Gonzales’ indictment, the former officer failed to “follow his active shooter training.”
    

            “After hearing gun shots and after being advised of the general location of the shooter and having time to respond to the shooter, the said Adrian Gonzales failed to engage, distract or delay the shooter, to attempt to engage, distract and delay the shooter, and failed to otherwise act in a way to impede the shooter until after the shooter entered rooms 111 and 112 of Robb Elementary School and shot at a child or children in Rooms 111 and 112,” the indictment states.
    

            Gonzales’ attorney, Nico LaHood, said his client’s “position is he did not violate school district policy or state law.”
    

            “The application of this statute, to law enforcement, under these circumstances is unprecedented in the state of Texas,” the defense attorney said last month. “It will take time to evaluate these allegations and the underlying facts.”
    

            Gonzales told investigators he was at the high school when he heard a report of a vehicle accident near Robb Elementary and went to check. He said he heard shots and entered the south hallway along with Arredondo. Gonzales said he tried to call for a SWAT team on his radio but could not transmit inside the school building – so he left.

            “Once I got out to get radio reception, I never went back in,” Gonzales told investigators.
    

            While the gunman roamed freely inside the school, Gonzales said he spent much of the time waiting with emergency medics outside the west door. He said he found a set of keys and a floor plan of the school that had been requested by a Texas Ranger on scene.
    

            Gonzales, who was hired by the Uvalde school district in July 2021, left the department in February 2023. No specific reason was given for his departure, according to the Uvalde News Leader.
    

            Arredondo, who was considered the de facto incident commander at the scene, faces 10 counts of child endangerment and known criminal negligence, according to his indictment.
    

            Arredondo was fired by the Uvalde school board three months after the shooting. He waived his right to an arraignment and entered a plea of not guilty last week, CNN affiliate KSAT reported.
    

            Uvalde County Jail records show both Arredondo and Gonzales were released on $10,000 bond.

CNN_15,California’s Park Fire grows 7 times larger in hours as Oregon battles country’s biggest active fire,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/us/durkee-fire-oregon/index.html,2024-07-25 20:14:00,us,"
The largest active wildfire in the United States has scorched almost 270,000 acres in eastern Oregon, as nearly 80 large active wildfires are burning in the US, including a California blaze that exploded in size overnight. Here’s the latest:


• The Oregon fire is 0% contained: The Durkee Fire – which has already burned an area larger than the city of Indianapolis – started on July 17 near the Oregon-Idaho state line. Amid high temperatures, extremely dry vegetation and strong winds, the fire has grown tens of thousands of acres since Sunday and is 0% contained as of Thursday morning.
    

• Durkee Fire threatens nearby communities: Three people were injured and two homes and 12 other structures were destroyed as the fire spread, according to the Oregon Department of Emergency Management. Officials have asked some residents to evacuate. Some communities do not have power, according to Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, who has deployed resources from the National Guard to assist.
    

• California battles its own blaze: The Park Fire in California has exploded to 45,549 acres – growing 7 times larger just over four hours overnight – and is 3% contained, according to CalFire. The blaze has forced mandatory evacuations in Butte County, where the state’s deadliest wildfire, the Camp Fire, killed more than 80 people in 2018.
    

• Two fires threaten national park in Canada: The flames closing in on the nation’s largest national park from two directions sent visitors and residents fleeing the town of Jasper in Alberta, where buildings are burned. Officials say the losses are significant.
    

            The lightning-sparked Durkee Fire is the largest of 31 large wildfires currently burning across Oregon, which has been the hardest hit by fires in recent days.
    

            Officials in Malheur County and Baker County issued evacuations for areas around the Durkee Fire. Meanwhile, dense smoke from the flames impeded traffic on Interstate 84, leading to periodic closure of the freeway.
    

            Kotek called it a “dynamic situation.”
    

            “The wildfires in Eastern Oregon have scaled up quickly,” Kotek said in a news release. “We are facing strong erratic winds over the region that could impact all fires. Rain is not getting through. Some communities do not have power.”
    

            More than 500 firefighters and resources from 22 states are working to fight the fire,  according to InciWeb.

            “We have been at this for a number of days, and those days just seem to keep getting harder and harder with the weather that we’re seeing in our area and the intense fire behavior,” Sarah Sherman of the Bureau of Land Management said in a video update.
    

            Over the weekend and earlier this week, the Durkee Fire exhibited extreme fire behavior, even creating it’s own weather in the form of pyrocumulus clouds.
    

            The clouds form over heat sources due to the intense, upward vertical motion of air cooling and condensing as it moves higher into the sky. They can reach heights of 50,000 feet and generate their own systems of thunderstorms.
    

            If fires burn hot enough, they can create clouds that produce lighting and rain, called pyrocumulonimbus.
    

            “Over the last week, firefighters have been challenged by hot temperatures and gusty winds that continue to push several wildfires across the state,” the Oregon State Fire Marshal said.
    

            Wildfire smoke, including from the Durkee Fire in Oregon, was spreading into Boise and beyond. Air quality alerts have been issued for parts of Colorado, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.
    

            Patrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, told the Associated Press that driving into town Wednesday morning was “like driving into a fog bank, because it’s so thick and low to the road.”
    

            “Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,” Nauman said of the smoke.
    

            A cold front has moved through the area Thursday morning, bringing high temperatures to the 80s on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. A red flag warning, which indicates increased risk of fire danger, has expired.

            President Joe Biden, speaking to the nation from the Oval Office on Wednesday, framed his decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential race as a matter of saving democracy. “I revere this office. But I love my country more,” he said. During his remarks, which lasted about 11 minutes, Biden outlined his administration’s accomplishments and sought to draw a clear contrast with former President Donald Trump. He also championed his vice president, who’s now taking his place on the ticket. “The best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It’s the best way to unite our nation,” Biden said. A new CNN poll shows Vice President Kamala Harris improves on Biden’s performance against Trump, though Trump still holds 49% support among registered voters nationwide to Harris’ 46%.
    

            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu struck a defiant tone in a speech to Congress on Wednesday as he sought to shore up support for the war in Gaza. He vowed to “fight until we achieve victory” and called for America and Israel to stand together. Netanyahu’s remarks — in which he also promised to free the hostages in Hamas captivity — came as the death toll in the enclave nears 40,000, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. As Netanyahu blasted his critics in the nearly hourlong address, pro-Palestinian protesters in Washington, DC, burned US flags and depictions of the Israeli leader. The White House called the protests disgraceful, with spokesperson Andrew Bates adding that “antisemitism and violence are never acceptable. Period. “
    

            The House voted on Wednesday to create a bipartisan task force to investigate the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. The move comes as lawmakers seek answers and accountability after the 2024 Republican presidential nominee was shot at during a rally in Pennsylvania this month. A resolution to establish the task force was approved in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 416 to 0. The House task force, made up of seven Republicans and six Democrats, will issue a final report on its findings in December, “including any recommendations for legislative reforms necessary to prevent future security lapses,” according to the text of the resolution the House passed.
    

            A lightning-sparked wildfire raging in eastern Oregon has scorched nearly 270,000 acres, making it the largest active wildfire in the US. The Durkee Fire, which has already burned an area larger than the entire city of Indianapolis, started over a week ago near the Oregon-Idaho state line and was still 0% contained as of early today. The extreme heat beating down on the West and other parts of the US this summer, along with high winds, could be a recipe for danger leading into the wildfire season, firefighters have warned. Meanwhile, wildfires have forced a town and a major national park in Canada’s Alberta province to be evacuated. Several buildings have been burned by one of two raging wildfires menacing the town of Jasper in the Canadian Rockies’ largest national park, authorities said today.

CNN_17,Renewed calls for passage of George Floyd Justice in Policing Act after fatal shooting of Black woman in her home,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/us/george-floyd-justice-in-policing-act/index.html,2024-07-25 18:30:00,us,"
            The law enforcement killing of Sonya Massey in her Illinois home earlier this month has thrust the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act back in the national spotlight, with renewed calls for passage of the failed legislation targeting racial bias and use of force.
    

            Body-camera footage released Monday showed the fatal police shooting of the 36-year-old Black woman who had called 911 for help. A White sheriff’s deputy, Sean Grayson, now faces murder charges.
    

            George Floyd, the act’s namesake, was another Black person killed by police. The 46-year-old died in police custody on May 25, 2020, after Derek Chauvin, a White police officer, was filmed kneeling on Floyd’s neck and back for nearly nine minutes as Floyd pleaded for help and said he couldn’t breathe.
    

            Chauvin was convicted of murder and manslaughter in a state trial in 2021 and sentenced to more than 22 years in prison. He later pleaded guilty in federal court of depriving Floyd of his civil rights.
    

            Floyd’s killing sparked a wave of protests around the world, along with a spate of legislative measures intended to address police brutality and racial bias.

A step-by-step look at how law enforcement’s visit to Sonya Massey’s home went so wrong


            But the Floyd bill, which was co-written by Vice President Kamala Harris when she was a senator, has languished for years amid wide partisan differences that are heightened today.
    

            “I think the biggest impediment is, it’s an election year and Republicans control the House,” said Maria Ponomarenko, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin and co-founder and counsel at NYU’s Policing Project. “I’ve very little hope that this year there is much that could change the conversation until the election has passed.”
    

            In response to Massey’s death, President Joe Biden and Harris this week called on Congress to pass the bill.
    

            “In this moment, in honor of Sonya’s memory and the memory of so many more whose names we may never know, we must come together to achieve meaningful reforms that advance the safety of all communities,” Harris said in a statement Tuesday.


            Here’s what you need to know about the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, what happened to it and its chances of passing.
    

            The legislation was originally introduced in 2020 and again in 2021. It would set up a national registry of police misconduct to prevent officers from evading consequences for their actions by moving to another jurisdiction.
    

            The measure seeks to ban racial and religious profiling by law enforcement at the federal, state and local level. It would mandate an overhaul of a legal doctrine known as qualified immunity that critics claim shields law enforcement from accountability.
    

            A 2021 fact sheet on the legislation said the measure would also allow “individuals to recover damages in civil court when law enforcement officers violate their constitutional rights by eliminating qualified immunity for law enforcement.”
    

            The fact sheet also stated the legislation would “save lives by banning chokeholds and no-knock warrants” and would mandate “deadly force be used only as a last resort.”
    

            The bill twice cleared the House under Democratic control – in 2020 and 2021 – largely along party lines.
    

            But it never went anywhere in the Senate, even after Democrats won control in 2021. Its failure to pass was attributed in part to disagreements about qualified immunity, CNN previously reported.


            With the legislation stuck, Biden signed a more limited executive order to overhaul policing on the second anniversary of Floyd’s death. It mandated actions that are applicable to federal officers, including efforts to ban chokeholds, expand the use of body-worn cameras and restrict no-knock warrants, among other things.

            But the president cannot mandate that local law enforcement adopt the measures. Instead, the executive order laid out actions the federal government can take, such as federal grants and technical assistance, to prompt local law enforcement to fall in line.
    

            In May, Texas Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee – who died last Friday – reintroduced the bill days before the fourth anniversary of Floyd’s killing.
    

            But policing reforms have not been a priority in a Congress where House Republicans are in the majority.
    

            Any policing overhaul that can find support in a divided Congress will likely be stripped of crucial provisions opposed by Republicans and law enforcement groups, according to Ponomarenko and other experts.
    

            “At this point, pretty much all of it would be a big sticking point,” Ponomarenko told CNN.
    

            “In addition to limiting qualified immunity, the bill would have imposed a variety of data collection requirements on state and local agencies that receive federal grants. It would have established a federal police misconduct database to make it easier to track officers as they move from one agency to another. All of these are likely to be sufficiently controversial to preclude passage.”

Illinois police release bodycam video of fatal shooting of Black woman in her home


            This week, Illinois State Police released a 36-minute video of Massey’s encounter with the two Sangamon County sheriff’s deputies who responded to her house after midnight on July 6. Massey had called 911 to report a possible “prowler” at her home in Springfield, according to a court document filed by prosecutors.
    

            In the video, which includes body-camera footage, Grayson and another deputy are seen initially speaking calmly with Massey when she goes to the stove to turn off a pot of boiling water. She then picks up the pot and the other deputy steps back – “away from your hot steaming water,” he says.
    

            “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,” she responds, repeating the phrase when the deputy asks, “Huh?”
    

            “You better f**king not or I swear to God I’ll f**king shoot you in the f**king face,” Grayson says. Grayson then draws his firearm and points it at Massey, who ducks and apologizes while lifting the pot, the video shows. Both deputies yell, “Drop the f**king pot!”

            Then, three shots are heard, and Massey is left in a pool of blood on her kitchen floor. After a few seconds of silence, one deputy says “shots fired” and calls for emergency medical services.
    

            University of Chicago Law Professor Craig Futterman, founder and director of the school’s Civil Rights and Police Accountability Clinic, told CNN Massey’s killing was “yet another tragic death that clearly didn’t need to happen.”
    

            It “dramatizes the importance of passing national reforms, the kinds of reforms that could prevent incidents like this from continuing to happen. It is just unfinished business,” Futterman said.
    

            “This video is just simply horrifying,” he continued. “If this isn’t the sort of thing that moves people to act, to seek to pass some common sense reforms, it’s difficult to know what will.”

CNN_18,"Texas woman’s lawsuit after being jailed on murder charge over abortion can proceed, judge rules",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/us/texas-abortion-lawsuit-proceed-lizelle-gonzalez/index.html,2024-07-25 16:33:00,us,"
            A Texas woman who was jailed and charged with murder after self-managing an abortion in 2022 can move forward with her lawsuit against the local sheriff and prosecutors over the case that drew national outrage before the charges were quickly dropped, a federal judge ruled Wednesday.
    

            U.S. District Judge Drew B. Tipton denied a motion by prosecutors and the sheriff to dismiss the lawsuit during a hearing in the border city of McAllen. Lizelle Gonzalez, who spent two nights in jail on the murder charges and is seeking $1 million in damages in the lawsuit, did not attend the hearing.
    

            Texas has one of the nation’s most restrictive abortion bans and outlaws the procedure with limited exceptions. Under Texas law, women seeking an abortion are exempt from criminal charges, however.

A Texas woman is suing the prosecutors who charged her with murder after her self-induced abortion


            Starr County District Attorney Gocha Ramirez and other defendants have argued their positions provide them immunity from civil lawsuits.
    

            Rick Navarro, an attorney for the defense, argued that it was “at worst a negligence case” during the hearing. Ramirez has previously told The Associated Press that he “made a mistake” in bringing charges.
    

            Tipton asked Gonzalez’s attorneys whether they could prove the prosecutors knew of the exception.
    

            “What we intend to show is that negligence doesn’t explain this oversight. It is the role and function of prosecutors to be aware of the elements of the statutes that they are charging,” said David Donatti, an attorney with the ACLU of Texas who is representing Gonzalez.
    

            Gonzalez was indicted in 2022 after she took the drug misoprostol while 19 weeks pregnant. She was treated at a Texas hospital, where doctors later performed a caesarian section to deliver a stillborn child after they detected no fetal heartbeat.
    

            Her lawsuit filed in March also named the county, which runs the small hospital where Gonzalez was treated, claiming that hospital staff violated patient privacy rights when they reported the abortion. An amended complaint alleged that the sheriff’s office interviewed Gonzalez and arrested her later under direction from the prosecutors.
    

            The charges were dropped just days after the woman’s arrest. In February, Ramirez agreed to pay a $1,250 fine under a settlement reached with the State Bar of Texas. Ramirez also agreed to have his license held in a probated suspension for 12 months.
    

            Wednesday’s decision will allow the case to move forward.

CNN_19,Belgian tourist suffers 3rd-degree burns to his feet while walking in Death Valley as temperatures exceed 120 degrees,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/us/death-valley-tourist-burned-feet/index.html,2024-07-25 14:36:00,us,"
            A 42-year-old Belgian tourist was hospitalized after suffering third-degree burns on his feet Saturday while walking in sand dunes in California’s portion of Death Valley National Park as temperatures soared above 120 degrees, according to the National Park Service.
    

            The man, whose name has not been released, lost his shoes as he was taking a short walk in the Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes, where the air temperature was 123 degrees Fahrenheit and the ground temperature “would have been much hotter,” according to a park service news release.
    

            “Due to communication challenges, park rangers were not able to determine if his flip flops broke or were lost in sand,” the service said.
    

            The man’s family called for help and other park visitors carried him to a parking lot.
    

            Because of his burns and pain level, park rangers determined he had to be taken to a hospital quickly, according to the release.
    

            Rescuers attempted to take the man to a hospital via helicopter, but the heat’s impact on flying conditions prevented them from doing so, the news release said. Instead, park rangers transported the man to a higher elevation in an ambulance, and then was flown to University Medical Center in Las Vegas, officials said.
    

            Third-degree burns destroys two layers of skin and may damage bones, muscles and tendons, according to Stanford Medicine. The burned area appears white or charred, and it has no sensation because nerve endings are destroyed.
    

            The incident came just two weeks after a motorcyclist died in Death Valley from heat exposure, the Death Valley National Park said in a news release. The high temperature that day was 128 degrees, according to preliminary data. Death Valley hit 129 degrees the next day, which hadn’t happened in July since 2021.
    

            Last July, a 71-year-old man collapsed and died outside a restroom in Death Valley National Park after park rangers believe he hiked a nearby trail. Another man was found dead in his disabled vehicle on the side of the road in the park, with park rangers suspecting he succumbed to heat illness while driving and then baked in temperatures as high as 126 degrees.
    

            So far this month, Death Valley has seen 20 days with temperatures over 120 degrees, including every day from July 15 through at least Tuesday. The average temperature for Death Valley in July is 117 degrees.
    

            The park also had nine consecutive days above 125 degrees this month, which is its second-longest streak above 125 on record.
    

            Despite extreme summer heat – or even because of it – Death Valley National Park is a popular tourist attraction. The park, regarded as one of the hottest places on Earth, drew about 1.1 million visitors in 2023, according to the National Park Service.
    

            “Many visitors come here in the summer specifically to experience the extreme heat,” the service said.
    

            The park responded to 88 emergency medical calls and 23 search-and-rescue requests last year. An alert from the National Park Service tells visitors to expect high temperatures of 100 to 130 degrees.

Fort Lauderdale, Florida (AP) — A judge says controversial social media personality Andrew Tate’s defamation lawsuit against a Florida woman who accused him of imprisoning her in Romania can move forward, but he threw out Tate’s allegations against her parents and some allegations against the woman.
    

            Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Joseph Curley ruled that the widely followed former professional kickboxer, 37, and his brother, Tristan, 36, can pursue their allegations that the woman in 2022 enlisted another woman in a plot to extort money from them.
    

            The British-American brothers say the woman falsely accused them of human trafficking and rape, costing them their freedom and millions of dollars in income from their lucrative social media, podcasting and business ventures. Romanian officials indicted the Tates last year, saying the brothers forced seven victims into pornography and subjected them to physical violence.
    

            Her attorneys say the lawsuit is in retribution for her reporting him to authorities. The Associated Press generally does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted.

            Curley said in last week’s ruling, posted to online court records Tuesday, that the Tates’ attorneys have shown enough possible evidence that the woman defamed their clients and was attempting to defraud and extort them to warrant that the sides exchange discovery. He pointed to April 2022 text messages the woman and her friend exchanged where they say they will ask the Tates for $200,000 and “act like we still love them and stuff.”
    

            Curley also pointed to other text messages that could indicate the woman knew she falsely accused the Tates of sex trafficking and false imprisonment. No trial date has been set and because of discovery and legal challenges it could be years before one occurs, if ever.
    

            Curley did throw out parts of the lawsuit accusing the woman of false imprisonment for the Tates being arrested, intentional infliction of emotional distress and interfering with their business relationships. He left the door open to their attorneys amending and refiling those accusations.
    

            Curley dismissed the Tates’ accusations that the woman’s parents defamed them when they told American diplomatic officials about their daughter’s allegations. He said they had no reason to believe their daughter’s accusations were false and had a right to report them. He had earlier dismissed allegations against the second woman because she is a Moldovan citizen living in Great Britain and outside Florida’s jurisdiction.
    

            Attorneys for the Tates and the woman each said Curley’s decision was a win for their side.
    

            Tate attorney Joseph McBride said they are “most pleased with Judge Curley’s ruling” as the defamation accusation directly addresses the “plot to destroy Andrew and Tristan Tate’s lives.” He said no decision has been made on whether to amend and refile the dismissed accusations.
    

            The National Center on Sexual Exploitation Law, which represents the woman and her parents, called Curley’s ruling a “huge victory.”
    

            “We are very pleased the Court has tossed out the majority of this frivolous lawsuit and wisely narrowed the issues and claims,” attorney Dani Pinter said in a statement. “If the case proceeds, we look forward to the opportunity to prove the truth of what occurred in Romania, and we are confident that ultimately we will succeed and this harassing lawsuit will fail.”
    

            Romanian investigators said in their indictment that the Tates and two Romanian women formed a criminal group in 2021 “in order to commit the crime of human trafficking” in that country, the United States and Britain. Prosecutors also confiscated the Tates’ assets, including 15 luxury cars, luxury watches and about $3 million in cryptocurrency.

            Investigators say the seven accusers were recruited with false declarations of love, but then forced to take part in pornography. The women were controlled by “intimidation, constant surveillance” and claims they were in debt, officials said.
    

            But the Tates, in their lawsuit, paint a different picture. They say the Florida woman and all women who lived at their estate were free to come and go as they pleased, and closed-circuit security video can prove it.
    

            Andrew Tate has been banned from TikTok, YouTube and Facebook after the platforms accused him of posting hate speech and misogynistic comments, including that women should bear responsibility for being sexually assaulted. But he remains popular on X, with almost 10 million followers, many of them young men and schoolchildren. He runs an online academy where he says he teaches young men how to get rich and attract women.
    

            Several women in Britain also are pursuing civil claims against Andrew Tate, alleging they were victims of sexual violence. British authorities have charged the Tates criminally with sexual aggression. Details have not been disclosed.
    

            In a 2023 interview with the BBC, Andrew Tate denied spreading a culture of misogyny and accusations that he manipulated women for financial gain.

            A 29-year-old man accused of breaking into Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass’ home this year pleaded no contest to felony vandalism Wednesday and will avoid prison time, according to the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office.
    

            Ephraim Hunter was charged with burglary and vandalism in connection with the April break-in. The mayor and her family were inside the home at the time.
    

            “Mr. Hunter is pleased with the resolution. He is looking forward to working hard in recovery, turning his life around, and becoming a success story,” Hunter’s attorney, Howard Stern, said.
    

            Hunter was accused of entering the home by smashing a rear glass door, causing somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000 worth of damage, the district attorney’s office said in a news release shortly after the incident. His hand was cut during the ordeal, leaving “blood stains throughout the house,” the release read.
    

            No one in Bass’ family was harmed, a spokesperson for the Democratic mayor said after the incident.

            As part of a plea agreement, Hunter entered a no contest plea and was given two years of probation. He was ordered to stay away from the mayor’s work and home addresses, as well as the mayor’s family members, for three years, according to the district attorney’s office.
    

            He was also ordered to pay more than $15,700 in restitution, attend a drug abuse and mental health treatment program for several months and eventually live in a halfway house, officials said.
    

            Hunter had told a local radio station he was on a drug binge at the time of the break-in and was not targeting Bass.
    

            The mayor’s official residence, the Getty House, is a nondescript Tudor-style home that sits on a corner in the Windsor Square neighborhood and fits seamlessly into its lineup of historic mansions.
    

            Bass, who is traveling to Paris with first lady Jill Biden for the opening ceremonies of the Olympics, did not have a comment on the plea entry, her communications office said in an email to CNN.

            Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney launched a cross-studio bundle of Disney+, Hulu, and Max on Thursday, bringing the services together at a discounted price as the entertainment giants look to scale their streaming businesses.
    

            The companies said the bundle of the three services, which was first announced in May, is available to new and returning subscribers for $16.99 a month with ads, or $29.99 a month without ads — an up to 38% savings over the standalone pricing of each platform.
    

            The lowest priced Max plan is currently offered at $9.99 a month with ads. Disney+ with Hulu is also available for $9.99 a month with ads.
    

            The new bundle offers subscribers access to a wider array of programming, including the premium service HBO, and content from ABC, CNN, Discovery, the Food Network, FX, HGTV, Hulu, Pixar, and the Star Wars franchise. The collaborative effort also brings together two major comic-book rivals, Warner Bros.’ DC and Disney’s Marvel, in a single package.
    

            The launch of the bundle comes as WBD, the parent company of CNN, and Disney, which owns both Disney+ and Hulu, look to woo and retain subscribers in a battle against larger streaming rivals Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.
    

            “We have found that when you bundle together with other content that more people in the family like — on a very basic level — the more often you watch product, the more people in the family that watch the product, the lower the churn,” WBD chief executive David Zaslav said this spring.


            Smaller streaming platforms have struggled in recent years to retain subscribers in an increasingly crowded sector that also includes NBC’s Peacock, Paramount+, and Apple TV+. Earlier this week, Peacock parent company Comcast announced the service had shed 500,000 subscribers in its most recent quarter.
    

            Others are also jumping into the already-crowded streaming fray. Earlier this month, Hallmark announced that it, too, will launch its own standalone streaming platform, Hallmark+, ahead of the holiday season.
    

            But the emergence of the combined services at a discounted price resemble traditional cable television bundles. Disney already offers its own bundle that includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+. In December, Verizon announced a new streaming subscription that paired Netflix and Max’s ad-supported tiers for $10 a month, a deal that, for an additional $10, includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN.

CNN_23,Southwest Airlines is getting rid of open seating,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/investing/southwest-airlines-assigned-seats/index.html,2024-07-25 21:25:00,us,"
            Southwest Airlines is shifting to assigned seats for the first time in its history, a change that will allow the low-fare carrier to charge a premium for some of the seats on its planes.
    

            The airline will also start offering overnight “red-eye” flights for the first time, which it said will improve the efficiency by increasing the use of its aircraft.
    

            Southwest said customers were clamoring for these changes – when people switch to a competitor from Southwest, the company said the No. 1 reason the unhappy passengers cite is open seating. But the change will also help the company charge some passengers more for their tickets.
    

            “The research is clear and indicates that 80% of Southwest customers, and 86% of potential customers, prefer an assigned seat,” said the airline in a statement. “By moving to an assigned seating model, Southwest expects to broaden its appeal and attract more flying from its current and future customers.”
    

            Southwest did not give details about when the changes will go into effect, but it said it would be discussed further in September.
    

            The airline had announced in April that it was looking at a change in its seating policy that has been in effect for its entire 50 year history. Southwest is under pressure from activist investors who have been pushing for changes in management and growth in profitability.

            Southwest has long been known as a low-cost, low-fare carrier, but it has been facing competition from the three other major carriers, American, United and Delta, which get much of their revenue from charging more for premium seating. It also faces growing rivalries on the other end of the spectrum: ultra-low cost carriers, such as Spirit and Frontier, which offer bargain-priced seats for which customers have to pay extra for just about anything including carry on bags.
    

            Southwest doesn’t charge for carry on bags and has long allowed passengers to check two bags for free. The airline also doesn’t charge customers to change flights.
    

            The company made no mention in its statement about whether it will change its baggage or change fee policy. The premium seats, which will offer more legroom, will not be available until 2025 as it will require reconfiguring its planes.
    

            Southwest used to be the most profitable US airline. But that is no longer the case.
    

            Thursday, it reported a 51% drop in profit to $370 million, despite reporting record revenue for the quarter that was boosted by strong passenger traffic.
    

            But this has been a tough environment for US airlines to make money. Significant increases in labor costs and higher fuel prices, two of the largest expenses in the industry, have eaten into profits. And relatively low average fares have exacerbated the damage.
    

            Rival American Airlines also reported its profit fell 44% in the second quarter, despite its own record revenue.
    

            Although Southwest still has the healthiest credit rating of any US airline, it has been struggling with a number of issues in recent years – some as a result of its own mismanagement, but some because of outside factors and changing industry dynamics.
    

            Shares of Southwest (LUV) were down more than 4% in premarket trading on its news.
    

            The airline went 47 consecutive years without reporting an annual loss – until 2020, when the pandemic nearly halted all demand for air travel.
    

            Southwest’s fleet is made up entirely of Boeing 737 jets. That had reduced its operating costs, because it allowed its pilots to fly any of its planes, giving it a flexibility and efficiency not available to its larger rivals. But it also made it most susceptible to Boeing’s substantial problems in recent years – both a 20-month grounding of the 737 Max in 2019 and 2020 following two fatal crashes, and a slowdown in production this year due to concerns about the quality and safety of its planes.
    

            But its low-cost efforts also hurt Southwest at times, most notably in December 2022, when its suffered a catastrophic service meltdown that caused it to cancel about 17,000 flights, or nearly half of its schedule, during the busy holiday travel period. While other airlines recovered quickly from a winter storm that month, Southwest’s computer technology, denounced as “antiquated” by its unions, made it difficult for it to schedule its pilots and flight attendants and resume normal operations.
    

            Southwest made changes in its software and operations in the wake of those service issues. And last week, as many of the world’s airlines were forced to cancel 5,000 flights in a single day due to a flawed software update from cyber security firm CrowdStrike, Southwest was one of the few carriers that avoided the issue and did not have to cancel flights. This time it was rival Delta Air Lines that suffered the service meltdown.
    

            But that December 2022 meltdown cost Southwest around $1 billion, including a $140 million fine from the Department of Transportation. And it resulted in a loss in the fourth quarter of 2022 as well as the first quarter of 2023 as passengers were reluctant to book on airline in the immediate aftermath of the service problems.
    

            The company reported losses in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of 2024 as well amid higher labor and fuel costs. Losing money in four of six quarters before the most recent period is a stunning and unwanted reversal of fortunes for Southwest. The airline had previously posted losses only during the pandemic, Great Recession and after the September 11 terrorist attacks – even while its rivals were flying in and out of bankruptcy. It also brought unwanted attention from activists investors at Elliott Investment Management, which announced in June it had taken a $1.9 billion stake in the airline and called for management changes.
    

            Southwest has also gotten unwanted attention from the Federal Aviation Administration, which announced earlier this month it is stepping up oversight of its operations due to a number of potentially dangerous incidents involving its planes in recent months.
    

            In March, a Southwest jet veered off course and had a close call with an air traffic control tower during an attempted landing at New York’s LaGuardia Airport. In April, a plane plunged to within 400 feet of the surface of the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Hawaii. In June another plane came within 525 feet of the ground over an Oklahoma town when it was still nine miles away from the Oklahoma City airport. And later that month a plane took off on a closed runway at the airport in Portland Maine which had a repair vehicle on it that had to race to get out of its way. Earlier this month, a plane got within 150 feet of the ground when it was still five miles away from the airport in Tampa, according to data from Flightradar24.
    

            “The FAA has increased oversight of Southwest Airlines to ensure it is complying with federal safety regulations,” the agency said in a statement.
    

            Southwest said it has formed an internal team to also look at the incidents.
    

            “Southwest is working closely with the Federal Aviation Administration in the review of recent events,” it said.

            The US economy is on the verge of an extremely rare achievement.
    

            Economic growth in the first half of the year was solid, with the economy expanding a robust 2.8% annualized rate in the second quarter, according to fresh Commerce Department figures released Thursday, which are adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings.
    

            Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic output, was much stronger in the second quarter than economists had predicted. The GDP report showed that businesses are continuing to invest and that consumers are still fueling growth with their spending, despite high prices.

A big change could come to the US economy in September


            As the economy continued to expand from April through June, inflation resumed a downward trend and seems to be on track to slowing further toward the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.
    

            America’s economy is about to stick what’s called a “soft landing,” which is when inflation returns to the Fed’s target without a recession — a feat that’s only happened once, during the 1990s, according to some economists.
    

            The latest GDP report showed that a key gauge of consumer demand picked up in the second quarter to an annual rate of 2.9%, matching the rate in the fourth quarter of 2023 for the strongest pace in two years. A measure of business investment also strengthened in the April-through-June period.
    

            The current health of the American economy suggests that the Fed has successfully handled inflation so far, with the finish line coming into clear view.

            People looking for love with an Olympic athlete could have a difficult time this year: Grindr, the LGBTQ+ dating app, has disabled some of its location-sharing features to protect athletes from harassment or prosecution.
    

            Some users noticed this week that they can’t use the “Explore” feature on the app at the Olympic Village in Paris, which lets people change their location and look at profiles.
    

            That’s by design, Grindr confirmed. The company explained in a blog post that for an athlete who isn’t out or comes from a country with strict LGBTQ+ laws, using the app “can put them at risk of being outed by curious individuals who may try to identify and expose them.” The app can still be used by people in the Village, even though some location services will be disabled.
    

            Roughly 155 LGBTQ+ athletes are attending the Olympics in Paris, according to OutSports, which is a small fraction of the more than 10,000 attending the games.
    

            The company is making other changes for the Olympic Village: For example, profiles default to revealing how far away someone is with the “show distance” feature. That feature can be enabled but will default to “off” for users in the Village, and other venues. Grindr said that change is to “help athletes connect without worrying about unintentionally revealing their whereabouts or being recognized.”
    

            During the two-week event, Grindr is also letting users in the Village send unlimited disappearing messages or unsend messages for free. Those are features typically the app charges for. Sending private videos and disabling screenshots have also been temporarily disabled if used in that radius.
    

            “Our goal is to help athletes connect without worrying about unintentionally revealing their whereabouts or being recognized,” Grindr said, adding that it made similar restrictions at previous games.
    

            Grindr started clamping down on its features during the Olympics after 2016, when a heterosexual Daily Beast writer reported on using Grindr to meet athletes in the Olympic Village in Rio de Janeiro. The story, which was deleted, drew angry accusations that the writer had outed gay athletes, whom he didn’t identify by name but had descriptions of them.
    

            Grindr (GRND) recently announced ambitious growth plans to shake off its hook-up reputation with new tools that it hopes users find long-term relationships and recommend in-person events. The stock is up more than 30% for the year.

CNN_26,"Meta must do more to address non-consensual, deepfake porn, Oversight Board says",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/tech/meta-non-consensual-deepfake-porn-oversight-board/index.html,2024-07-25 19:12:00,us,"
            Meta failed to remove an explicit, AI-generated image of an Indian public figure until it was questioned by its Oversight Board, the board said Thursday in a report that calls on the tech giant to do more to address non-consensual, nude deepfakes on its platforms.
    

            The report is the result of an investigation the Meta Oversight Board announced in April into Meta’s handling of deepfake pornography, including two specific instances where explicit images were posted of an American public figure and an Indian public figure.
    

            The threat of AI-generated pornography has gained attention in recent months, with celebrities like Taylor Swift, as well as US high school students and other women around the world, falling victim to the form of online abuse. Widely accessible generative AI tools have made it faster, easier and cheaper to create such images. Social media platforms including Meta’s — where such images can spread rapidly — have faced growing pressure to combat the issue.
    

            In the case of the image of the American public figure posted to Facebook — which was generated by artificial intelligence and depicted her as nude and being groped — the company immediately removed the picture, which had previously been added to a matching bank that automatically detects rule-breaking images. But in the case of the Indian public figure, although the image was twice reported to Meta, the company did not remove the image from Instagram until the Oversight Board took up the case.
    

            “Meta determined that its original decision to leave the content on Instagram was in error and the company removed the post for violating the Bullying and Harassment Community Standard,” the Oversight Board said in its report. “Later, after the Board began its deliberations, Meta disabled the account that posted the content.”
    

            The report suggests that Meta is not consistently enforcing its rules against non-consensual sexual imagery, even as advancements in artificial intelligence have made this form of harassment increasingly common. The report also points to continued issues at Meta moderating content in non-Western or non-English speaking countries, which the company has faced criticism over before.

            Meta said in a statement that it welcomed the board’s decision. It added that while the specific posts identified in the report have already been removed, the company will “take action” on images of the Indian public figure that are “identical and in the same context” as those highlighted by the Oversight Board “where technically and operationally possible to do so.”
    

            In its report, the Oversight Board — a quasi-independent entity made up of experts in areas such as freedom of expression and human rights — laid out additional recommendations for how Meta could improve its efforts to combat sexualized deepfakes. It urged the company to make its rules clearer by updating its prohibition against “derogatory sexualized photoshop” to specifically include the word “non-consensual” and to clearly cover other photo manipulation techniques such as AI.
    

            According to the report, Meta told the board that it had not originally added the image of the Indian public figure to its rule-violating photo matching bank because there had not been news reports about it, whereas the media had covered the images of the US public figure. “This is worrying because many victims of deepfake intimate images are not in the public eye and are forced to either accept the spread of their non-consensual depictions or search for and report every instance,” the Board said, adding that Meta could consider other factors, including whether an image was AI-generated when determining whether to add it to the bank.
    

            After the board began its inquiry in April, Meta added the image to its photo matching bank.
    

            The push to fight non-consensual deepfakes is just part of Meta’s larger efforts to prevent the sexual exploitation of its users. The company on Wednesday said it had removed around 63,000 accounts in Nigeria that were engaging in financial sextortion scams, where people (often teenagers) are tricked into sending nude images and then extorted.

CNN_27,Ethiopia landslide death toll reaches 257 as UN warns it could surpass 500,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/africa/ethiopia-landslide-deaths-reach-257-intl/index.html,2024-07-25 21:35:00,world,"
            The death toll from devastating landslides in southern Ethiopia has climbed to more than 250 and could rise as high as 500, the UN warned, citing local authorities.
    

            The landslides hit thousands of people in Gofa Zone on Sunday and Monday and are the deadliest ever reported in Ethiopia, Africa’s second most populous country.

            “These people are at high risk of further landslides and need to be evacuated to safe zones immediately. Amongst these are at least 1,320 children under 5 years of age and 5,293 pregnant and lactating women,” the UN’s humanitarian agency OCHA said.
    

            The UN agency also said that the government is finalizing an evacuation plan.
    

            Residents and volunteers have been digging through the mud searching for survivors.
    

            Photos from one site showed residents of Kencho Shacha Gozdi embracing after another day of excavations.
    

            Ethiopia is prone to landslides during the rainy season, according to geological surveys. In parts of the country, including the southern region, floods triggered by heavy rains have displaced thousands of people in recent months, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a report last month.
    

            At least 43 people died from floods and landslides last year, OCHA said in November.

CNN_28,"Floods inundate Philippine capital, oil tanker sinks as deadly typhoon prompts calls for climate action",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/asia/philippines-flooding-manila-climate-typhoon-gaemi-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-25 21:14:00,world,"
            Much of the Philippine capital remained underwater Thursday after deadly Typhoon Gaemi worsened torrential monsoon rains that lashed the country, trapping thousands of people in rising flood waters and causing widespread damage.
    

            Continuous heavy rains, massive flooding and landslides across the Philippines killed at least 13 people and displaced more than 600,000, and an oil tanker capsized off the country’s coast during strong winds and high waves, Philippine authorities said Thursday.
    

Unlike in Taiwan, the typhoon – known locally as Carina – didn’t make landfall in the Philippines, but its powerful outer bands dumped more than 300 mm (12 inches) of rain in the Manila region and parts of the main island Luzon, prompting officials to declare a “state of calamity” in the capital on Wednesday and evacuate tens of thousands of people.
    

            Video and images from Manila show people wading through chest-deep water and some clinging precariously to overhead power lines as major roads turned into rivers. Families with children wrapped in towels or plastic ponchos huddled together on dinghies as disaster response teams rescued them from flooded houses.
    

            Some parts of Metro Manila – home to 13 million people – have reported floods as high as one-story buildings, with some residents spotted waiting for rescue on roofs, according to the official Philippine News Agency.
    

            In Rizal province’s Cainta, east of the capital, floodwaters were still around waist-level on Thursday, according to local councilor Ben Ramirez Narag.
    

            “No one is prepared for this, even though we anticipated the typhoon, we could not have predicted the scale of rainfall,” he said.
    

            His team was delivering supplies to evacuation centers and assessing damage to infrastructure, he added.
    

            The southwest monsoon, supercharged by the typhoon, is still causing misery and destruction in the Philippines even after Gaemi moved north and made landfall in Taiwan early Thursday as the equivalent of a Category 3 major hurricane in the Atlantic.
    

            Heavy rainfall, gusty winds and a dangerous storm surge killed at least two people and injured nearly 300 others in Taiwan’s northeast, according to the Central Emergency Operations Center.
    

            Taiwan remained largely shut down for a second day Thursday with flights canceled and financial markets, schools and offices closed as heavy rainfall continued to pummel the island. Some mountainous regions have reported up to 1,219 mm (48 inches) of rain.
    

            A cargo ship carrying nine crew sank off Taiwan’s coast in rough seas on Thursday, according to the island’s fire agency. The Tanzanian registered vessel sank around 20 miles off the coast of the southern port city of Kaohsiung and was not equipped with a lifeboat.
    

            All the crew members “fell into the sea and were floating there” wearing life jackets, Hsiao Huan-chang, the head of the fire agency, said in a news conference.
    

            The island is expected to endure several more hours of torrential rain even as the typhoon’s center moved into the Taiwan Strait Thursday and headed toward China.
    

            The storm made landfall in China’s southeast coastal Fujian province Thursday evening, bringing more strong winds and downpours to a country already hit hard by weeks of extreme rain and deadly flooding.
    

            The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) on Thursday said it was responding to an incident involving a tanker carrying over one million liters of industrial fuel oil that capsized off the coast of Bataan, west of Manila. PCG spokesperson CG Rear Adm. Armando Balilo said 16 crew members of the MT Terra Nova had been rescued with the search ongoing for one missing sailor.
    

            Images show the coast guard launching a rescue operation and the ship almost fully submerged in rough seas. Coast Guard aerial assets have been deployed to monitor an oil spill with “an estimated coverage of two nautical miles (2.3 miles) carried by a strong current,” it said.
    

            On land, the flooding has caused widespread disruption that forced authorities to close schools, businesses and cancel more than 150 flights on Thursday.
    

            Carlito Pagaduan, a resident of northern Ilocos Sur province, told CNN that heavy rains descended early Thursday and although floodwaters had not entered his home he feared they may lose power in the hard-to-reach area.
    

            “We’re trying to save battery,” he told CNN. “Due to strong winds, we don’t know when we’ll lose electricity.” He said his family has prepared for evacuation but will stay in their home for now.
    

            Rescue services said Thursday they are continuing to pull trapped residents out of flooded buildings. Some homes could be seen completely inundated and vehicles submerged on flooded streets.
    

            Quezon City, north of Manila, was hit hard by the floods. The city government said in a post on X that more than 55,000 people, including nearly 16,000 families, had been evacuated and were sheltering in evacuation centers.
    

            The Philippine Red Cross has launched an emergency appeal for donations to help the thousands of Filipinos affected by the typhoon-enhanced monsoon.
    

            “Families and children are without water, electricity and basic services, whole others are stranded in knee- and chest- deep floods,” it said in a post on X.
    

            Dramatic footage posted by Philippine media Wednesday showed several barges colliding with a bridge in Pasig City as the Marikina River – a major artery flowing through the capital – overflowed.
    

            Pasig mayor Vico Sotto told local media Wednesday night that a man was rescued from one of the barges and brought to a nearby hospital for treatment.
    

            At a situation briefing on the typhoon response on Thursday, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. stressed the need to urgently assess the flooding situation and requested local government units to deploy medical staff to evacuation centers.
    

            The widespread and destructive flooding has put fresh scrutiny on the Philippines’ ability to respond to disasters.
    

            The archipelago experiences several typhoons a year, but the human-caused climate crisis has made storms more unpredictable and extreme – while leaving the nation’s poorest most vulnerable.
    

            As the climate crisis worsens, typhoons are becoming more intense and destructive. In 2021, Super Typhoon Rai – known locally as Odette – killed more than 200 people when it slammed as an equivalent Category 5 hurricane into Siargao Island, a popular tourist and surfing destination on the central east coast. Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest storms recorded in modern history, struck the Philippines in 2013 and killed more than 6,000.
    

Experts have said countries in the Global South are reaching their limit of being able to handle climate and extreme weather disasters on their own and those living in low-lying, coastal areas will soon lose their homes to rising sea levels.
    

            A study published last year found that parts of Asia’s largest cities could be under water by 2100 due to rising sea levels, and coastal flooding events in Manila within the next century will occur 18 times more often than before – solely because of climate change.
    

            Just days before the typhoon lashed the Philippines, President Marcos included flood prevention in his state of the nation address.
    

            “More than 5,500 flood control projects have been completed and many more are currently being done throughout the country,” Marcos said Monday.
    

            Campaigners have urged Marcos to do more to build resiliency to extreme weather, which has left people struggling to rebuild after enduring multiple climate disasters.
    

            “These torrential rains give yet another picture of extreme weather in a climate changed world. Filipinos are calling for climate justice. President Marcos must champion policies to help facilitate access to justice for communities,” Greenpeace Philippines campaigner Khevin Yu said in a statement.
    

            “This will likely not be the last, or the worst, storm we will face this year. Climate impacts will continue to escalate. It is small communities … with poor infrastructure, that are affected the worst. For their sake, the Marcos administration must prioritize climate action.”

CNN_29,Officer suspended after videos of police beating men at UK airport spark outcry,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/uk/british-police-beating-uk-airport-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-25 20:20:00,world,"
            A British policeman has been suspended after multiple videos emerged on social media showing officers beating at least three people inside Manchester Airport in an incident the city’s own force has labeled “truly shocking.”
    

            The viral videos, in which one officer could be seen kicking and stomping on the head of a man in prone position, are the latest to spark a public and political argument in Britain over police violence and drew protests accusing police of racism.
    

            Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said the footage on social media showed a confrontation that began after three officers were injured in a “violent assault,” including one female officer who suffered a broken nose.
    

            But the force added that the event seen in the videos was “truly shocking” and an “unusual occurrence,” adding it had voluntarily referred itself to Britain’s independent police watchdog for a full investigation. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) confirmed it had launched an investigation.
    

            “We appreciate the footage which was shared on social media has attracted widespread shock and concern. It is vitally important we investigate all of the circumstances surrounding the incident,” the office said in a statement.
    

            Police said that the officer seen in the video has been suspended after earlier announcing they were removed from operational duties.
    

            The videos began circulating Wednesday, quickly going viral on social media and sparking an outcry from both the public and some politicians.
    

            One video shows a man on the ground with at least two police officers pointing a taser at him. A male police officer moves closer to the man and starts kicking him in the face, while his taser is still drawn, before stomping on his head. A woman is heard shouting “stop it, he hasn’t done anything!”
    

            Small splatters of blood appear on the floor at the scene.
    

            Later in the same video, another man, whose hands were in the air while sitting nearby, is taken to the ground after a police officer points a taser at him. After the second man kneels on the ground, one officer starts kicking him before another wrestles him to the ground and appears to try to constrain his hands behind his back.
    

            In another video of the same incident, a female officer is seen clearly in distress, crying and walking away from the scene before being assisted by another officer.
    

            CNN cannot independently verify the events leading up to or directly after the violence captured on video.
    

            The condition of the men following the confrontation is unclear.
    

            Another video shows a man in a gray T-shirt being confronted, pepper-sprayed in the face, and brought to the ground by a police officer who wrapped his arm around the man’s neck as he wrestled him down.
    

            The events captured in the videos sparked protests outside the GMP divisional headquarters in the town of Rochdale on Wednesday evening. Videos from the scene showed large crowds gathering outside the police station, shouting “GMP shame on you.”
    

            On Thursday morning, GMP Assistant Chief Constable Wasim Chaudhry said the protest had concluded safely without any incidents.
    

            “We understand the immense feeling of concern and worry that people feel about our response and fully respect their right to demonstrate their views peacefully,” Chaudhry said.
    

            Some protesters blamed the violent incident on police racism as the officer seen in the video is white and the men being kicked and tasered appear to be Asian.
    

            The campaign group Stand Up To Racism has announced it will hold a demonstration in central Manchester for Thursday night, calling on people to come and “send a clear message that we won’t stay quiet against racist police violence.”
    

            The Muslim Council of Britain, an umbrella body for Muslim-led organizations, said it was “deeply shocked and alarmed” by the footage.
    

            The incident comes of the back of years of allegations of institutional racism in police forces across the country. Last year, an official report into the Metropolitan Police in London accused the organization of perpetuating a misogynistic, sexist, racist and homophobic internal culture.
    

            While the so-called Casey Report focused on the Met, it sparked accusations of institutional racism at other police forces across the United Kingdom, including the GMP.
    

            Manchester Police has previously disclosed several race-related incidents. Just last week, the GMP suspended five officers and put two officers on restricted duties following a report made of racial discrimination in Bury.
    

            A spokesperson for the force said GMP was “deeply concerned by the allegations and will not hesitate to take any action necessary.”
    

            It is still unclear what happened before the videos were filmed.
    

            In its statement released on X, the police outlined its version of the events that led up to the videos.
    

            The incident started when police were called to Terminal 2 of the airport on Tuesday evening following reports of an assault. When officers confronted the male suspect, three officers were injured in a “violent assault, where they were punched to the ground,” with one female officer ending up with a broken nose, the force said.
    

            Four men have been arrested for assaulting an emergency worker, the statement added.

            “We know that a film of an incident at Manchester Airport that is circulating widely shows an event that is truly shocking, and that people are rightly extremely concerned about,” Chaudhry said in the statement.
    

            “The use of such force in an arrest is an unusual occurrence and one that we understand creates alarm.”
    

            Multiple British politicians condemned the assaults shown in the videos. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, called the videos “disturbing” in a post on X.
    

            Prime Minister Keir Starmer said “understands the concern” over the videos.
    

            Paul Waugh, the local MP for Rochdale, said in a post on X he is “extremely concerned” by the “appalling” footage from Manchester Airport, noting he has expressed his concerns to police.
    

            The man who was arrested is a Rochdale resident, Waugh said, adding in a later post that he has spoken to the man’s family and will meet them Friday.
    

            UK Home Office Minister Diana Johnson said on X that she was “aware of the disturbing footage” and “understand(s) the public concern it has prompted.”
    

            But not all lawmakers condemned the police actions.
    

            Richard Tice, deputy leader of Reform UK and one of five recently elected MPs for the right-wing populist party, said in a television interview that seeing the video was “not distressing” but rather “reassuring” that police officers were responding to a “serious issue” if they were using such force.

CNN_30,Families of hostages held in Gaza slam Netanyahu for leaving ceasefire deal out of Congress speech,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-us-congress-speech-hostage-reaction-intl/index.html,2024-07-25 19:28:00,world,"
            Families of hostages held captive in Gaza condemned Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech to the United States Congress, as pressure grows on the Israeli prime minister to agree to a deal to secure their release.
    

            “The speech and applause won’t erase the one sad fact: The words ‘Deal Now!’ were absent from the prime minister’s address,” The Hostage and Missing Families Forum in Israel said in a statement.
    

            Although Netanyahu’s speech drew raucous applause inside Congress, dozens of Democrats refused to attend. Among those who snubbed the speech was former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who called it “by far the worst presentation of any foreign dignitary invited and honored with the privilege of addressing the Congress of the United States.”
    

            People gathered at the so-called Hostages Square in Tel Aviv to watch Netanyahu’s speech on Wednesday. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has become a potent political force in Israel since some 250 people were abducted by Hamas on October 7, and the square a regular site of protests demanding that the hostages be brought home.
    

            “They came to watch the broadcast of the speech and hear addresses from family members of the hostages, hoping to hear the Prime Minister utter the two crucial words: ‘There’s a deal,’” the statement from the Forum said.

Fact check: Netanyahu falsely claims there have been ‘practically’ no civilian fatalities in Rafah, besides one incident


            During his nearly 52-minute address, Netanyahu lashed out against critics of Israel’s war in Gaza but did not mention the status of the ceasefire negotiations, despite intense international pressure to find a deal and growing optimism that one could soon be struck.
    

            Rather than mentioning a deal, a bellicose Netanyahu told Congress: “The war in Gaza could end tomorrow if Hamas surrenders, disarms and returns all the hostages. But if they don’t, Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas’ military capabilities, end its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home.”
    

            But Netanyahu is facing growing calls to negotiate a deal to secure the hostages’ release. Noam Peri, daughter of Chaim Peri, who the Israeli government last month said died in Hamas captivity, said: “You can no longer save my father, but you must return to our shared values and restore the basic contract between us – before it’s too late.”
    

            “Sign the deal, save the hostages who are alive and fighting for their lives every moment,” she urged.
    

            Criticism from families of hostages was echoed by Yair Lapid of the opposition Labor party, who wrote on X: “Disgrace! An hour of talking without saying the one sentence: ‘There will be a kidnapping deal.’”
    

            But Netanyahu’s speech was lauded by members of his government. Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the “moving and important” speech demonstrates “the strength of alliance between the US and Israel.”
    

            Bezalel Smotrich, the hard-right finance minister and chairman of the Religious Zionist Party, said: “Our Jewish and Israeli hearts are moved and filled with pride on this important occasion.”
    

            After Netanyahu’s speech, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced it had retrieved the bodies of five hostages and brought them back to Israel. The bodies of Ravid Katz, Kiril Brodski, Tomer Ahimas, Oren Goldin and Maya Goren were found during an operation in the Khan Younis area on Wednesday, the IDF said, where it launched a fresh ground offensive this week.
    

            This means that 111 hostages remain in Gaza, including 39 believed to be dead, according to data from Netanyahu’s office. There are eight dual-American citizens believed still to be captive in Gaza, three of whom have been confirmed dead. The Biden administration has not shared information about the five who may still be alive.
    

            The recovery of the five bodies came after Israel renewed its offensive in Khan Younis. The United Nations estimates that about 150,000 people fled the area on Monday alone, after the IDF issued evacuation orders that have intensified pressure on the meager supplies of food and water, and the lack of places to seek shelter.
    

            Video published Thursday showed smoke billowing into the sky over Khan Younis, after a very large explosion which local journalists said was an Israeli airstrike. The journalists said the strike occurred in the town of Kizan Al Najar east of Khan Younis and had killed several people and injured at least 15 others. CNN has asked the IDF for comment.
    

            Despite the warm reception by lawmakers in Congress, about 80 House Democrats skipped Netanyahu’s speech, including US Vice President Kamala Harris, who instead attended a pre-scheduled trip to a sorority event in Indiana. President Joe Biden and Harris are scheduled to meet with Netanyahu at the White House Thursday.
    

            Also among the absentees was Nancy Pelosi, who later blasted Netanyahu’s speech.
    

            “Many of us who love Israel spent time today listening to Israeli citizens whose families have suffered in the wake of the October 7th Hamas terror attack and kidnappings. These families are asking for a ceasefire deal that will bring the hostages home – and we hope the Prime Minister would spend his time achieving that goal,” she said in a statement.
    

            Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the lone Palestinian-American congresswoman, held up a black-and-white sign during Netanyahu’s speech. One side said, “War criminal;” the other, “Guilty of genocide.”
    

            A number of House Democrats and Republicans criticized Tlaib’s demonstration. Democratic Rep. Steny Hoyer said the sign was “unfortunate” and not appropriate.
    

            While most of the chamber rose to applaud Netanyahu as he entered, Tlaib was among three Democrats who remained seated. Sen. Chuck Schumer stood to welcome Netanyahu, did not not applaud. Sen. Mark Kelly, a potential pick for Vice President in November, did applaud the Israeli leader.
    

            With so many Democrats skipping the speech, a number of Republicans sat on the Democratic side of the aisle.

CNN_31,China’s hosting Palestinian and Ukrainian delegations this week. But can it play peace broker in global conflicts?,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/china/china-global-conflicts-broker-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-25 13:02:00,world,"
    Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.


            China’s top diplomat Wang Yi has had a busy week in which two devastating conflicts have loomed large.
    

            Wang started by gathering 14 Palestinian factions for reconciliation talks in Beijing, including bitter rivals Hamas and Fatah, before meeting on Wednesday with Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba – the first time China has hosted a top Ukrainian official since Russia’s invasion nearly two and half years ago.
    

            The juxtaposed diplomacy – where talks were closely linked to the grinding wars in Gaza and Ukraine, respectively – came as Beijing vies to present itself as a geopolitical heavyweight in a world increasingly divided by both conflicts.
    

            In a meeting with Kuleba, Wang said Beijing “supported all efforts that contribute to peace” – marking China’s latest effort to position itself as a “neutral” peace broker in the conflict, even as it has ratcheted up ties with Russia.
    

            And at the conclusion of talks between the Palestinian factions a day earlier, the foreign minister hailed the signing of a declaration on “ending division.” The agreement, viewed with a measure of skepticism in the Middle East where such deals have quickly collapsed before, was a “historical moment in the Palestinian liberation cause,” Wang said.
    

            For the Chinese government, experts say, Wang’s week of diplomacy offered a chance to play up desired optics: framing the country as a productive player in intractable conflicts – and an alternative broker to the United States.
    

            China’s ambition is to be “recognized and accepted as a – if not the – global leader, and it seeks to do so by enlisting the support of the Global South, which is more numerous in both population and country terms than the democratic West,” said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of London.
    

            But it also signals some of the limits within which Beijing is operating, experts suggest, as it seeks to build a solution in Gaza without having deep influence in the region and calls for peace in Ukraine while keeping tight ties with Russia.
    

            Kuleba’s visit was the first time in the nearly 29 months of Russia’s war on Ukraine that a high-level Ukrainian official has visited China. In contrast, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited twice and Kremlin officials have made numerous trips during the same period.
    

            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other European leaders have previously expressed hope that China could use its close relationship with Russia to push for peace on terms acceptable to Kyiv, which unequivocally calls for the withdrawal of Russian troops and a return to its internationally recognized borders. But Chinese officials have given no public indication of doing so and have instead pushed for any peace efforts to consider “all countries’” security concerns.
    

            Kuleba’s visit comes as Beijing is under increasing pressure from the West over its ties to Russia and allegations it’s aiding Moscow’s war effort by providing dual-use goods. Beijing denies this and says the West is fueling the conflict by supplying arms for Ukraine’s defense.
    

            Western rhetoric is also hardening. NATO leaders earlier this month said Beijing was “decisively” enabling Russia’s war by support for its defense industrial base, and Zelensky last month accused China of prolonging – through its “support to Russia” – the war devastating his country.
    

            That may be a topic of conversation later this week when Wang is expected to speak with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in another engagement during a regional meeting in Laos.
    

            Kuleba arrived in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou on Tuesday saying that there would be “extensive, detailed, substantive” negotiations focused on “one issue - peace in Ukraine.”
    

            “We will talk, we will be looking for common ground. We need to avoid competition between peace plans,” he said in a social media video post, in an apparent reference to the vast distance between Beijing’s proposed “political settlement” for the war and Ukraine’s own peace formula.
    

            Official statements from Beijing and Kyiv after Wednesday’s Wang-Kuleba talks gave no indication that the Ukrainian diplomat had swayed Beijing toward Kyiv’s vision for peace.
    

            Instead, Wang re-emphasized Beijing’s past statements and its call for a “political settlement.” China last year released its view on such a settlement, which backs a ceasefire without stipulating the prior withdrawal of Russian troops, a position criticized as favorable to Moscow’s illegal territorial gains. Neither side mentioned the provision of material or economic support to Russia in official statements.
    

            Wang did appear to leave a door open for Ukraine to rely on China as a broker, saying, according to Beijing’s Foreign Ministry, that “although the conditions and timing are not yet ready,” China was “willing to continue to play a constructive role in ceasefire and resumption of peace talks.”
    

            Kuleba, for his part, reiterated the country’s position of being ready for peace talks “when Russia is ready to negotiate in good faith,” according to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, but highlighted that Kyiv sees no such readiness from Moscow.

            Observers say Beijing could, at some point, play a role in any potential future talks, but is unlikely to shift its relationship with Russia.
    

            Xi is widely seen to view China’s northern neighbor as a critical partner in pushing back against a world order he sees as unfairly dominated by the West – and does not want Russia to suffer a damaging defeat.
    

            Chinese leaders may have decided to meet Kuleba now to show they’re trying to “push for peace” amid Western criticism of Beijing’s Russia ties and because of the impending election in the United States, according to Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore.
    

            Kyiv is casting a wary eye on those elections that could see a plunge in American support for Ukraine’s defense if Republican candidate Donald Trump wins. Trump’s running mate JD Vance has openly advocated for ending military aid to Ukraine in favor of bolstering Taiwan’s defenses.
    

            “Perhaps Beijing is reading this and feels that they are in a better position to push Kyiv towards a compromise that Moscow might find more amenable,” Chong said.China’s state-linked news outlet Global Times also highlighted expert commentary suggesting Ukraine may realize that “efforts to completely isolate” Russia internationally have failed, as players like India and Brazil – both key Global South nations – have not supported a communique following a Ukraine-backed peace summit in June, which did not include Russia. Beijing has said such conferences should include both Kyiv and Moscow.
    

            Beijing’s efforts to be a platform for Palestinian reconciliation, meanwhile, come as it has presented itself as a leader for voices across the Global South in calling for Palestinian statehood and decrying Israel’s war and its staggering humanitarian cost, while criticizing US backing of Israel.
    

            Wang said that Tuesday’s reconciliation talks between Palestinian factions ended with an agreement “on post-Gaza war governance and the establishment of a provisional national reconciliation government.”

Can China play a role in avoiding an all-out war in the Middle East?


            The announcement comes as the future governance of Palestinian territories remains in question following Israel’s repeated vow to eradicate Hamas – and a growing push for Palestinian statehood. But it was met with some skepticism from observers in the region given the failure of past attempts at unity.
    

            A US State Department spokesperson questioned whether the deal would “in any way have an impact on the ongoing discussions to reach a ceasefire” in the war in Gaza, adding it ran counter to Washington’s position, which is that militant group Hamas should not have a role in the governance of “a unified Gaza and the West Bank” after the war.
    

            Within the region, there is also a sense that some of Beijing’s broader diplomacy around the conflict may be “missing out on the intricacies” of different viewpoints there, while seeking to win backing for its own international agenda, according to Jonathan Fulton, a nonresident senior fellow for the Atlantic Council’s Middle East programs.
    

            “Of course there’s frustration with the West and in particular with the US, but at the same time nobody’s looking at China and saying, ‘well, this is the country that’s going to come and solve it,’ because they see it as very self-interested actor with a pretty shallow level of regional knowledge and expertise,” he said.

CNN_32,"Hamas and Fatah sign agreement in Beijing ‘ending’ their division, China says",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/23/china/hamas-fatah-palestinian-factions-beijing-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-25 12:34:00,world,"
            Palestinian factions including rivals Hamas and Fatah have signed an agreement on “ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity” in Beijing, China said Tuesday.
    

            The announcement followed reconciliation talks hosted by China involving 14 Palestinian factions starting Sunday, according to China’s Foreign Ministry, which come as Israel wages war against militant group Hamas in Gaza and as Beijing has sought to present itself as a potential peace broker in the conflict.
    

            Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the agreement was “dedicated to the great reconciliation and unity of all 14 factions.”
    

            “The core outcome is that the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) is the sole legitimate representative of all Palestinian people,” Wang said, adding that “an agreement has been reached on post-Gaza war governance and the establishment of a provisional national reconciliation government.”
    

            It was unclear from Wang’s comments what role Hamas, which is not part of the PLO, would play in such an arrangement, or what the immediate impact of any deal would be. The talks were held as the future governance of Palestinian territories remains in question following Israel’s repeated vow to eradicate Hamas in response to the group’s October 7 terrorist attack on its territory.

In the West Bank, an independent Palestine remains a distant dream


            The PLO is a coalition of parties that signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1993, and formed a new government in the Palestinian Authority (PA).
    

            Fatah dominates both the PLO and the PA, the interim Palestinian government that was established in the Israeli-occupied West Bank after the 1993 agreement known as the Oslo Accords was signed. Hamas was not party to the accords and does not recognize Israel.
    

Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative, who was at the Beijing talks, said “all the parties” have agreed that they should join the PLO, and that the organization is the only legitimate representative of the Palestinians.
    

            There is a long history of bitter enmity between Hamas and Fatah. The two sides have tried – and failed – multiple times to reach an agreement to unite the two separate Palestinian territories under one governance structure, with a 2017 agreement quickly folding in violence.
    

            The PA held administrative control over Gaza until 2007, after Hamas won the 2006 legislative elections in the occupied territories and expelled it from the strip. Since then, Hamas has ruled Gaza and the PA governs parts of the West Bank.
    

            Hamas and Fatah signed a reconciliation agreement in Cairo in October 2017 under pressure from the Arab states, led by Egypt. Under the deal, a new unity government was supposed to take administrative control of Gaza two months later, ending a decade of rivalry.
    

            But the deal’s lofty aspirations quickly collapsed. When Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah visited Gaza in March 2018, he was the target of an assassination attempt when a bomb detonated near his convoy. Fatah immediately blamed Hamas for the attack.
    

            Barghouti said the latest attempt at reconciling the Palestinian factions “went much further” than previous efforts and included “specific steps” towards the formation of a consensus government.
    

            The war in Gaza, he told CNN, has prodded the factions to unite as a common front against Israel’s occupation.
    

            “There was a very clear feeling that what Israel is doing is really threatening everybody,” he said. “And so, in that sense, the feeling of unity (to) confront the Israeli side is very clear here.”
    

            A new government would ensure the unity of the occupied West Bank and Gaza, ruling both territories after the war and effectively “blocking Israeli efforts” to maintain its occupation of Gaza, he said.
    

            Most Palestinians would however be taking the news about reconciliation “with the usual caution and pessimism,” said Tahani Mustafa, senior Palestine analyst at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank.

            “The major issues that have proven to be obstacles to reconciliation in the past were not addressed,” she told CNN. “It’s very unlikely anything substantial will come out of this especially as the biggest obstacle so far has been (Palestinian Authority president and Fatah leader) Mahmoud Abbas (and) his absolute reluctance to relinquish in any way his monopoly on power.”
    

            Hamas is not opposed to the PLO but has instead demanded fair representation within the organization, she said. “Abbas has been reluctant to provide this, as it would mean Fatah losing its hegemony over the last Palestinian political institution it controls.”
    

            At a news conference Tuesday in Beijing, Hamas delegation representative Mousa Abu Marzook said they had reached an agreement to complete a “course of reconciliation,” while also using the platform in Beijing to defend the group’s October 7 attack on Israel.
    

            Israel launched its military operations in Gaza following the Hamas attack, that killed more than 1,100 people and saw roughly 250 others kidnapped. Around 39,000 Palestinians have died in the conflict, which that has triggered a mass humanitarian crisis and widespread destruction.
    

            “We’re at a historic junction. Our people are rising up in their efforts to struggle,” Abu Marzook said, according to a translation provided by China’s Foreign Ministry, adding that the October 7 operation had “changed a lot, both in international and regional landscape.”
    

            Hossam Badran, a member of Hamas’ Political Bureau, said that during the meeting a step toward forming a consensus government was agreed in principle, “with the approval of the Palestinian factions, to manage the affairs of the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, supervise reconstruction, and also prepare the atmosphere for elections at a later stage.”
    

            Badran said this initiative should not wait until after the war, but should proceed even as the conflict continues and that establishing such a government could facilitate a ceasefire.
    

            He added that in “this meeting, we talked about the mechanisms, but a one- or two-day meeting does not allow us to discuss all the details.”
    

            Beijing has not explicitly condemned Hamas for its October 7 attack on Israel.
    

            Tuesday’s agreement follows an earlier round of talks between Hamas and Fatah hosted by Beijing in April.
    

            Since the start of the war in Gaza, China – which has looked to bolster its influence and ties in the Middle East in recent years – has presented itself as a leading voice for countries across the Global South decrying Israel’s war in the enclave and calling for Palestinian statehood.

China’s Xi Jinping calls for peace conference and ‘justice’ over war in Gaza as Arab leaders visit Beijing


            Chinese leader Xi Jinping in May called for an international peace conference during meetings with leaders from Arab nations and has also dispatched a special envoy to the Middle East to meet with diplomats and officials.
    

            China also surprised many last March when it played a role brokering a rapprochement between longtime rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran, but observers have questioned the extent of Beijing’s geopolitical clout in a region where the US has long been a dominant power.
    

            Those efforts have been broadly seen as part of Beijing’s push to position itself as a geopolitical heavyweight with a different vision for the world from the United States.
    

            China is promoting an idea that it is “doing the impossible – bringing these oppositional sides together,” said Jonathan Fulton, a nonresident senior fellow for the Atlantic Council’s Middle East programs.
    

            “It fits (their) narrative that the US is the wedge issue, that Western involvement in the Middle East created these divisions and China can come in and ease them … but I don’t know that China really is seen (in the region) as a credible actor who can do much,” he said, pointing to Beijing’s relatively limited regional expertise and influence to ensure the success of the agreements or solutions it supports.
    

            The US State Department said that while it had not reviewed the text of the Beijing agreement, it did not support Hamas having a role in the postwar governance of Gaza.
    

            “When it comes to governance of Gaza at the end of the conflict, there can’t be a role for a terrorist organization,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told a press briefing, referring to Hamas specifically.
    

            Miller said he did not believe the deal would “in any way have an impact on the ongoing discussions to reach a ceasefire” and that the US wants to see the Palestinian Authority governing “a unified Gaza and the West Bank” after the war.
    

            “But no, we do not support a role for Hamas,” said Miller, adding that Hamas has “the blood of innocent civilians, both Israeli and Palestinian, on their hands.”
    

            Miller would not say whether US Secretary of State Antony Blinken would speak about the deal specifically in his upcoming meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
    

            Tuesday’s agreement was inked as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in the US for a highly anticipated visit in which he will meet top US officials and address Congress.

            One person was killed and three others were injured at Cambodia’s famed centuries-old Angkor temple complex when a large tree was blown down onto their vehicle during a fierce rainstorm, the government said Wednesday.
    

            The accident occurred late Tuesday afternoon at the southern gate to Angkor Thom, which is near the more famous Angkor Wat temple and part of the same archaeological complex in the northwestern province of Siem Reap, about 200 miles northwest of the capital, Phnom Penh.
    

            The site is Cambodia’s most popular tourist attraction and in the first half of this year attracted more than half a million international tourists, according to Cambodia’s Tourism Ministry.
    

            The tree fell on a tuk-tuk — a kind of motorized three-wheeled vehicle popular in South and Southeast Asia — killing the driver instantly and injuring its three passengers, one critically, according to a statement issued by the Siem Reap Provincial Administration.
    

            Several statues on the balustrade of what is called Tonle Oum Gate were also damaged by the falling tree, the statement said.
    

            The Apsara National Authority, the government agency that oversees the archaeological park, posted photos late Tuesday on its official Facebook page showing the fallen tree in front of the temple entrance. The agency later announced that the tree had been removed and the entrance was again accessible to visitors.
    

            The Angkor site sprawls across some 155 square miles, containing the ruins of capitals of various Cambodian empires from the 9th to the 15th centuries. Scholars consider it to be one of the most important archaeological sites in Southeast Asia.

CNN_34,"Powerful Typhoon Gaemi hits Taiwan, expected to drench an already soaked China",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/asia/typhoon-gaemi-taiwan-china-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-25 09:01:00,world,"
            A powerful typhoon made landfall in northeastern Taiwan early on Thursday, killing at least two people and injuring hundreds of others as authorities closed financial markets, schools and offices.
    

            Conditions in Taiwan worsened as Typhoon Gaemi brought heavy rainfall, gusty winds and a dangerous storm surge. It reached land in Yilan County with sustained winds up to 205 kph (125 mph), equal to a Category 3 major hurricane in the Atlantic.
    

            The typhoon is expected to move over the Taiwan Strait Thursday before making landfall in mainland China’s Fujian province, bringing more strong winds and downpours to a country already hit hard by weeks of extreme rain and deadly flooding.
    

            A woman riding a motorcycle in Taiwan’s southern Kaohsiung City was crushed to death by a fallen tree, and a woman in eastern Hualien was hit by a parapet that fell from the roof of a house, Taiwan’s Central Emergency Operations Center reported. More than 200 others were wounded.
    

            The rapidly intensifying storm had been expected to strengthen into a super typhoon before making landfall on Taiwan’s northeast coast Wednesday afternoon.
    

            However, it was deflected off its forecast track by Taiwan’s mountainous terrain and spent more than six hours offshore making a loop near the Hualien coastline before making landfall at around midnight.
    

            Hualien, eastern Taiwan’s most populated city, was hit with an additional eight hours of the typhoon’s worst conditions, including winds over 100 mph (160 kph), storm surge, and torrential rainfall. Rainfall totals topped 300 mm (1 foot) in many locations, with mountainous areas receiving over 500 meters (1.5 feet).
    

            The deflection was caused by mountains disrupting the storm’s wind field. The phenomenon has been documented numerous times over the past 60 years in typhoons approaching northeast Taiwan, with several making full loops before eventually moving over land.
    

            Taiwan is often struck by typhoons and has a generally strong track record in preparing for the damaging winds and downpours they can bring, especially in its cities. The more at-risk populations tend to be in remote and mountainous areas, especially on the east side of the island, where landslides can pose a major danger.
    

            Taiwan’s Central Meteorological Agency (CMA) issued a sea and land typhoon warning for the entire main island, while Taiwan President Lai Ching-te urged residents not to make trips unless they can ensure their safety.

What rapid intensification means for hurricanes


            Prior to landfall in Taiwan, Typhoon Gaemi strengthened in Pacific waters that have been at their warmest temperatures on record. The first typhoon of the season to affect Taiwan, it strengthened by 96 kph (60 mph) over a 24-hour period, well exceeding the definition of rapid intensification of 56 kph (35 mph) in 24 hours. Scientists have found that hotter oceans caused by the human-caused climate crisis are leading storms to intensify more rapidly.
    

            Most Taiwanese cities closed schools and offices on Wednesday while Taiwan Railways suspended some rapid train services. More than 50,000 households in Kaohsiung were without power.
    

            Dozens of flights and all regular train services have also been canceled for Wednesday and Thursday, with three of Taiwan’s largest carriers – EVA Air, China Airlines and Starlux Airlines – announcing disruptions due to the typhoon.
    

            Taiwan’s defense authorities said they had to modify ongoing annual five-day Han Kuang War Games due to the typhoon. The live-fire drills are the biggest annual military exercises of their kind in Taiwan, where the armed forces are increasingly vigilant against the threat of invasion from China.
    

            “We will adjust some of the air and naval elements given the typhoon situation,” defense ministry spokesperson Sun Li-fiang told reporters in Hualien.
    

            Gaemi has also forced the closure of schools and government offices in the Philippines as heavy rains hit the Manila capital region and the main island of Luzon. Some flights have been canceled and the Philippine Stock Exchange said it would cease all trading Wednesday.
    

            Images show roads and streets in Manila flooded by rains brought by the storm, as people wade through knee-deep water.
    

            Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. earlier said more than 770,000 people have been affected by the typhoon and southwest monsoon in the country’s southern regions, and 4,500 personnel were on standby to assist with search and rescue operations.
    

            Though weakened, Gaemi is expected to make landfall in China on Thursday as the equivalent to a strong Category 1 or low-end Category 2 hurricane with sustained winds of 145 to 160 kph (90 to 100 mph.)
    

            The worst of the winds are expected to occur in coastal areas of Fujian province, where boats have moored to take shelter and trains will be suspended Thursday, but heavy rain will spread across Fujian, southern Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces for the rest of the week.
    

            By the weekend, the remnants of Gaemi will likely spread heavy rainfall farther north into areas of China like Henan, Shanxi and Hebei provinces which have been hit hard by flooding in recent days.
    

            For many in China, the prospect of another major storm bringing more water is a big concern.
    

            In the past two weeks, tens of thousands of people have been evacuated across multiple provinces in China following deadly floods and landslides, which have blocked highways, destroyed homes and caused devastating financial losses as they wiped out crops and livestock.

Summer of devastating floods shows steep challenge for China as it grapples with extreme weather


            Torrential rainfall hit southern, central and eastern parts of the country and led to major emergency response efforts in a flood season that has started some two months ahead of its typical schedule.
    

            In Henan province, the flooding came after a period of scorching temperatures that complicated efforts to grow and irrigate vital crops in parts of central China’s agricultural heartland. Then, extreme rain inundated tens of thousands of acres of cropland and forced more than 100,000 people to evacuate their homes, according to state media.
    

            The flooding in Henan and surrounding provinces – and the double hit of arid heat and floods in a matter of weeks – has prolonged what has already been a devastating period of extreme weather across China that’s forecast to continue.

CNN_35,"He wants a less hectic, car-free life. Here’s why this Mediterranean town is the perfect retirement spot",https://edition.cnn.com/travel/sitges-spain-retirement/index.html,2024-07-25 21:21:00,world,"
            Sometimes making a fresh start isn’t all about big plans for the future. It can mean small changes such as walking instead of depending on a car.
    

            That was one of the key factors for Michael Steven Grant when he started considering a retirement move.
    

            Grant, a 63-year-old former sales professional, was looking for a smaller-scale place with access to a larger city, and the coastal town of Sitges in Catalonia is ideally located less than an hour southwest of Barcelona in northeastern Spain. Grant began moving toward retirement in 2022 when he started splitting his time between New York City and the cozy Spanish seaside town surrounded by sandy golden beaches, Mediterranean views and fresh air.
    

            He and his partner purchased their apartment in Sitges for €235,000 (about $255,000).
    

            “There are several reasons we bought our future retirement home in Sitges. One reason is in a small coastal town, the ability to walk to food markets and restaurants – not needing a car as you get older – is great. Sitges is easily accessible from Barcelona, 30 minutes by train, for anything you need, medical, arts and entertainment, airports and great high-speed train rail connections to all European cities,” Grant said.
    

            The two-bedroom apartment, featuring a small balcony, is only a five-minute stroll to the beach, and “the cost of living as one gets older is a big consideration. Sitges is overall much less expensive than it is in New York City,” Grant said.
    

            Grant plans to apply, probably next year, for a special “non-lucrative” Spanish visa that requires applicants to support themselves with a minimum of €2,400 per month  (about $2,600) without working.
    

            Right now, Grant spends part of his time in Sitges, where he goes as a tourist with up to two stays per year of 90 days. He plans to sell his NYC apartment and settle some family business before he moves to Spain full-time.
    

            After many busy years – and too much driving – in the health insurance and fundraising fields, the slower-paced lifestyle and warm Mediterranean climate have acted as a reinvigorating balm.

            Grant, who grew up in Ontario but has lived and worked in far-flung places including Honolulu and Sydney, was looking for a detox from his former high-stress life.
    

            “Sitges has a very laid-back atmosphere. We love going for a three-four mile walk along the promenade that runs along the coastline, stopping for a coffee or snack, doing a little reading or grocery shopping, swimming for two hours. Then, the mandatory siesta midafternoon.”
    

            The pros: great quality of life and affordability, Grant says. And the only con — which ends up being a pro — is that you slow down and enjoy life.
    

            Grant has fully acclimated to the Spanish rhythm, quickly picking up the Spaniards’ penchant for late dinners that run past midnight. He has learned not to be impatient in waiting for the check after a three-hour meal, and the prices are pleasing when the bill arrives.
    

            Compared with the United States, a good meal out with wine is about €50 (about $55) as opposed to more than $150 in the NYC area. High-speed trains from Barcelona to Madrid are €18 (about $20), compared with an Amtrak Acela from NYC to DC, which is closer to $150.
    

            But it wasn’t all a piece of cake settling down in Sitges to live the expat dream. Opening a bank account, dealing with taxes and getting a mortgage to buy the apartment required patience and help from local professionals, who are expats’ best bets when navigating bureaucracy.
    

            “As are all big moves in life, you must be open-minded, accept things as they are, where you are. I met a friend in Barcelona who put me in touch with a good, local bilingual lawyer who was key. He helped me go through all steps of opening a bank account … getting a mortgage with a Spanish-based bank and buying a home.”
    

            Grant says it was crucial to have a professional on the ground to coordinate with daily to ensure things ran smoothly, such as paying all necessary local, city and federal taxes annually.
    

            “Unlike the US, where writing checks is still common, in Spain all is done digitally, with wire transfers. Make sure you always have your US passports with you for conducting business,” he advises.

            Grant soon realized the “Spanish way” meant learning how to act as a native and pick up social customs that are typical of many Mediterranean countries where networking and fostering contacts is crucial.
    

            “Make sure you always thank, with a small gift and cards, everyone who has helped you along the way: banker, attorneys, they are invaluable resources and can help you with referrals to other professional services you may need.”
    

            “Small gifts such as a bottle of wine, dinner gift certificates from top restaurants as treats and thank you’s, and doing the same on holidays, always remembering your attorney, banker, plumber, electrician.”
    

            Grant’s top piece of advice for other expats wanting to follow in his footsteps: really soak up the vibe and live as locals before taking the leap and buying property.
    

            Based on his experience, he suggests visiting several times throughout the year and not just in summer when it’s high season. Walk around at night, get a sense of the local community and really put the neighborhood to the test to make sure it’s easily accessible to everything you’d need before purchasing a home.
    

            Getting to know neighbors and having local friends and contacts helped Grant with good recommendations and referrals, like finding handymen.
    

            Once Grant found his new community, he turned his Sitges life into a business opportunity by helping other expats relocating to Spain.
    

            He’s currently a sales consultant at a relocation company in Barcelona supporting American and international buyers in navigating the local real estate market, handling paperwork and legal issues and being a liaison on redesigns and renovations.
    

            In the future, he’ll fully retire in Spain. “NYC has gotten very expensive.”

CNN_36,Frankfurt airport suspends flights after climate protesters block runways,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/travel/germany-frankfurt-airport-climate-protest-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-25 14:55:00,world,"
Germany’s busiest airport temporarily suspended flights on Thursday after climate activists glued themselves to the tarmac in a protest against the use of fossil fuels.
    

            The airport, used by nearly 60 million travelers last year, advised passengers not to travel to the facility and its website showed multiple flights diverted or canceled as demonstrations took place on at least one taxiway.
    

            In an update, the airport said flights were “gradually resuming” after the temporary suspension of air traffic “due to a police operation.”
    

            Six protesters glued themselves to a taxiway, according to activist group Oil Kills.
    

            “The sun hasn’t risen yet, but air traffic in Germany has already been brought to a standstill,” it said on X.
    

            Climate activist group Letzte Generation, or “Last Generation,” posted videos and photos on X that appeared to show its members on the tarmac.
    

            “Airports are places where it becomes apparent that what was seen as normal in the past is something we cannot afford anymore today. Gas and coal are threatening our existence,” Letzte Generation said on X.
    

            CNN has reached out to Frankfurt police for comment.
    

            The protests in Frankfurt came a day after climate activists staged a series of demonstrations at airports across Europe.
    

            On Wednesday, Letzte Generation members glued their hands to the tarmac at Germany’s Cologne-Bonn airport. Three protesters were detained in that incident, according to Oil Kills.
    

            In Norway, Oil Kills said three people were detained at Oslo airport after breaking onto the tarmac to demand “bold climate action from the Norwegian Government.”
    

            In Spain, Oil Kills said five people were intercepted by police at Barcelona airport, with one arrested and the others fined.
    

            Oil Kills said a further nine people blocked security gates at Helsinki airport in Finland, also causing disruption to passengers.

CNN_37,Japanese restaurants say they’re not charging tourists more – they’re just charging locals less,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/japan-restaurants-tourist-prices-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-25 11:17:00,world,"
            Kudos to you if you can speak perfect Japanese and order food at a neighborhood sushi bar in Tokyo.
    

            If you can, chances are that on your next trip to Japan, you may be able to score a better deal by blending in as a local.
    

            Japan has never been a destination known for hiking up prices for foreigners. But overtourism – fueled by a combination of pent-up post-Covid demands (aka “revenge travel”) and the weak local currency – has recently prompted restaurants in the country to consider the merits of differential pricing.
    

            “People say it’s discrimination, but it is really hard for us to serve foreigners, and it is beyond our capacity,” said Shogo Yonemitsu, who runs Tamatebako, an all-you-can-eat seafood grill in Shibuya, Tokyo’s bustling shopping district.
    

            He maintains that he doesn’t charge tourists extra. Instead, he offers a 1,000 yen ($6.50) discount to locals.
    

            “We need (this pricing system) for cost reasons,” Yonemitsu said.
    

            Japan only completely reopened in the fall of 2022 following the removal of pandemic travel restrictions.
    

            This year, spurred by a weak yen that has fallen to its lowest level against the dollar in decades, the tourists are back - in big numbers.

Japan may be sick of mass tourism. But the deer in this ancient UNESCO-listed city love it


            Visitor arrivals to Japan hit a record 17.78 million in the first half of 2024, according to government data - and are on track to break the country’s 2019 record of 31.88 million tourists.
    

            In response, places around the country have begun implementing tourist taxes, imposing visitor caps and even banning alcohol sales in an attempt to curb the effects of too much tourism.
    

            Earlier this year, a resort town in the foothills of Mount Fuji erected a giant net to block views of the iconic peak after tourists flocked to a photo-viewing spot, causing litter and traffic problems.
    

            Meanwhile, tourism authorities in Hokkaido, the country’s northernmost prefecture known for its scenic views and ski resorts, this month urged businesses to set lower prices for locals.
    

            And a mayor in western Japan said he was considering charging foreign tourists more than six times the local entry fee to the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Himeji Castle.
    

            Elisa Chan, associate director of the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s hospitality research center, said differential pricing can be an effective way to combat overtourism.
    

            “The owner may want to make sure that the sudden surge in tourist demand does not drive away all its loyal and frequent local customers. Charging tourists more may be seen as a solution to this,” she said.
    

            Yonemitsu, the restaurateur, said the influx of tourists isn’t simply an issue of adding extra tables.
    

            He said his seafood grill had to hire additional English-speaking staff to take orders, handle bookings and explain to tourists everything from how to tell the difference between sashimi and grilled food items to where to put their luggage. Failing to do so results in “mayhem,” he said.

            “Some people say, ‘We don’t do this in our country.’ But think about how bad Japanese people’s English skills are. We aren’t at that level where we can call ourselves a tourism powerhouse yet. We just can’t speak English, and yet we can’t say the wrong things. It’s really stressful,” he said.
    

            While it’s a new phenomenon in Japan, differential pricing is quite common in other parts of the world. As the less-expensive resident prices are often written in the local language, foreign tourists may not even know they paid more.
    

            In Japan, it’s up to every business to decide for themselves if they want to implement two-tiered pricing. That’s not always the case elsewhere, as governments can step in.
    

            In Venice, for example, officials introduced a fee to enter the Italian city and an online reservation system to cope with overtourism.
    

            Meanwhile, some Japanese business owners are trying to be creative.
    

            Shuji Miyake, who runs an izakaya, or informal pub, in Tokyo’s Tsukiji district, offers ramen topped with lobster for 5,500 yen ($35) - four times the price of the shrimp noodles his regulars often order. The premium dish is marketed to tourists, who he said have a higher budget to try new things.
    

            Australian tourist Phoebe Lee said she spent less on a recent two-week trip to Japan than on her previous trips to the country - and she wouldn’t mind paying a little extra if the weak yen is making life difficult for locals.
    

            “This helps support local businesses to continue providing us lucky visitors with amazing experiences and preserve important parts of Japan’s culture, like tiny mom-and-pop restaurants or authentic ryokans (traditional inns),” she said.

San Juan (AP) — Puerto Rico’s governor signed a law on Wednesday that prohibits discrimination against people wearing Afros, curls, locs, twists, braids and other hairstyles in the racially diverse U.S. territory.
    

            The move was celebrated by those who had long demanded explicit protection related to work, housing, education and public services.
    

            “It’s a victory for generations to come,” Welmo Romero Joseph, a community facilitator with the nonprofit Taller Salud, said in an interview.
    

            The organization is one of several that had been pushing for the law, with Romero noting it sends a strong message that “you can reach positions of power without having to change your identity.”
    

            While Puerto Rico’s laws and constitution protect against discrimination, along with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, a precedent was set in 2016 when a U.S. Court of Appeals dismissed a discrimination lawsuit and ruled that an employer’s no-dreadlock policy in Alabama did not violate Title VII.
    

            Earlier this year, legislators in the U.S. territory held a public hearing on the issue, with several Puerto Ricans sharing examples of how they were discriminated against, including job offers conditional on haircuts.
    

            It’s a familiar story to Romero, who recalled how a high school principal ordered him to cut his flat top.
    

            “It was a source of pride,” he said of that hairstyle. “I was a 4.0 student. What did that have to do with my hair?”
    

            With a population of 3.2 million, Puerto Rico has more than 1.6 million people who identify as being of two or more races, with nearly 230,000 identifying solely as Black, according to the U.S. Census.

            “Unfortunately, people identified as Black or Afro descendant in Puerto Rico still face derogatory treatment, deprivation of opportunities, marginalization, exclusion and all kinds of discrimination,” the law signed Wednesday states.
    

            While Romero praised the law, he warned that measures are needed to ensure it’s followed.
    

            On the U.S. mainland, at least two dozen states have approved versions of the CROWN Act, which aims to ban race-based hair discrimination and stands for “Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair.”
    

            Among those states is Texas, where a Black high school student was suspended after school officials said his dreadlocks fell below his eyebrows and ear lobes, violating the dress code.
    

            A March report from the Economic Policy Institute found that not all states have amended their education codes to protect public and private high school students, and that some states have allowed certain exceptions to the CROWN Act.
    

            A federal version was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in 2022, but it failed in the Senate. In May, Democratic lawmakers reintroduced the legislation.

CNN_41,The photographer capturing climbers at dizzying heights,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/style/art-of-climbing-simon-carter-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-25 08:45:00,world,"
            When Simon Carter first laid his eyes on the “Totem Pole,” a 213-foot-tall monolith rising dramatically from the seas of eastern Tasmania, Australia, he was faced with a dilemma: “To climb or to photograph?”
    

            He did both. While the rock had been scaled before, the Australian photographer and his friends decided to find a new route — and it paid off. As Carter abseiled around the narrow, imposing sea stack with his camera, he captured the other climbers in action from thrilling vantage points unseen from the ground.
    

            The photographer’s new book, “The Art of Climbing,” features a selection of these images, alongside more than 200 other striking shots of fellow climbers ascending towering and complex rock formations around the world.
    

            “I like to talk about climbing photography being on a spectrum. On one end you’ve got a very documentary style, where you go out and document whatever it is that’s going on,” said Carter in a video interview.
    

            “And at the other end of the spectrum, you got more conceptual kind of shots, which are the ones I really love — my book’s a mixture of them, but I really love conceptual ones.”
    

            The book divides his shots into thematic chapters with names like “Flow” (featuring climbers completely absorbed in the moment) and “Lines” (showing people tackling vertical crevices and natural cracks in rock faces). The photos also range in composition and proximity to the climber.
    

            Carter uses the sweeping vistas of his locations to highlight the sheer scale of the task facing his subjects. He often shoots them while at great heights himself: Take the shot of climber Monique Forestier hanging off a cliff edge in Australia’s Blue Mountains, which he captured after abseiling just a few feet below her.
    

            On the other hand, his more intimate images — ones where the climbers’ expressions are in sharp focus — reveal just how intense and challenging the ascents can be.

            Carter’s passion for photography began at the age of 15, preceding his love of climbing. The two interests merged, nearly a decade later, into a more serious pursuit.
    

            “In the 1990s, if you wanted to be a good climber in Australia, you’d go and live at Mount Arapiles (a popular climbing destination in western Victoria, Australia)… in a tent and just climb full-time,” said Carter, who for eight months did just that.
    

            “On my rest days, I started photographing my friends who were doing really incredible things in rock climbing — like some of the best climbers in the country — on these really spectacular cliffs,” he recalled.
    

            In 1994, Carter set up a photography and publishing business that produced a popular climbing calendar, among much else. In the 30 years since it launched, he has witnessed an explosion in the number of people pursuing climbing photography, thanks in part to the internet and the availability of digital cameras. But he worries about the dangers facing this new generation of photographers.
    

            “A lot of them haven’t got a lot of experience in climbing and rigging and what’s going on on a cliff,” he said. “So, one bit of advice I really like to give when I’m asked is: Get experience climbing before you try and add photography into the mix.
    

            “If you’re too scared or not comfortable in that environment, you’re not going to be able to nail very good shots; you’re not going to be able to … keep up with the pace or get in position.”
    

            Getting into position for a shot is one of the biggest challenges Carter has faced. “So often you’ve got this sort of hypothetical position you want to be in. And it’s often out in space, out from the cliff a little bit, because you might want to show more (of) the climb and the rock architecture, and the setting.”
    

            The difficulty of reaching the right spot, which may sometimes mean shifting just a few meters, is compounded by having to set up complicated rigs with ropes and other gear, Carter added.
    

            For the most part, Carter’s images in “The Art of Climbing” reflect this process. Rather than reacting to a particular moment, the photographer’s carefully composed shots account for the environment, the emotions of the climb and more technical aspects, like lighting and framing.
    

            One of Carter’s favorite shots is testament to this. It was taken during a temperature inversion (a phenomenon that occurs when air near the ground cools quicker than that above it, creating a layer of cloud), which forms a stunning backdrop for a climber as he scales a wall.
    

            Carter said he enjoyed the process of selecting images for the book, which he hopes are accessible for everyone, climbers and non-climbers alike.
    

            “Having spent 30 years photographing, putting these photos together… was, to me, the icing on the cake.”
    

“The Art of Climbing,” published by Thames & Hudson, is available now.

CNN_42,Fast-moving wildfire in the Canadian Rockies’ largest national park hits the town of Jasper,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/weather/jasper-national-park-canada-wildfire/index.html,2024-07-25 21:25:00,world,"
            A fast-moving wildfire hit the town of Jasper in the Canadian Rockies’ largest national park, causing significant damage and forcing thousands of people, residents and tourists alike, to flee.
    

            Jasper National Park officials said the fire entered the southern edge of the community Wednesday evening and crews were battling multiple structural fires and working to protect key infrastructure. There were significant losses in some areas, they said.
    

            Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday his government has approved Alberta’s request for federal assistance, saying it is deploying military resources and evacuation support, as well as coordinating firefighting and airlift assistance.
    

            “Alberta, we’re with you,” Trudeau posted on the social media platform X.
    

            Forest firefighters and others without self-contained breathing apparatus were told to evacuate to the nearby town of Hinton, with structural firefighters staying behind.

            Parks Canada spokesperson James Eastham told reporters outside Jasper that the town is filled with smoke and there “has been structural loss.”
    

            “At this point I can’t confirm how many, locations or specific structures. The fire continues to burn,” he said.
    

            Parks Canada said firefighters are working to save “as many structures as possible and to protect critical infrastructure, including the wastewater treatment plant, communications facilities, the Trans Mountain Pipeline and others.”
    

            On X, the account for the Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge says the flames have reached the hotel’s grounds, but the extent of damage, if any, is not yet known.
    

            A few hours earlier, many first responders were ordered out of Jasper National Park for their safety.
    

            Jasper is being menaced by fires from the north and south, and the town’s 5,000 residents — along with 20,000 more park visitors – fled on short notice late Monday night when the fires flared up.
    

            Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said she was “heartbroken.”
    

            A record number of wildfires in 2023 forced more than 235,000 people across Canada to evacuate and sent thick smoke into parts of the US, leading to hazy skies and health advisories in multiple U.S. cities.
    

            The northern fire was spotted 5 kilometers (about 3 miles) from Jasper earlier in the day. The southern fire had been reported 8 kilometers (about 5 miles) away from the town, but Katie Ellsworth of Parks Canada said strong wind gusts swooping in behind it sent it racing.
    

            Everything that could go wrong did go wrong as fire perimeters changed minute by minute.
    

            Ellsworth said bucketing efforts by helicopter failed. Crews using heavy equipment to build fireguards couldn’t complete the work before having to pull back for safety. Water bombers couldn’t help due to dangerous flying conditions.
    

            A last-ditch effort to use controlled burns to reroute the fire to natural barriers like Highway 16 and the Athabasca River failed due to “unfavorable conditions.”
    

            The hope was that rain forecast overnight would bring some relief.
    

            Ellsworth said the decision to relocate all first responders to Hinton, just outside the eastern edge of the park, “has not been made lightly.”
    

            She said, “Given the intensity of fire behavior being observed the decision has been made to limit the number of responders exposed to this risk.”
    

            Jasper National Park is considered a national treasure. The United Nations designated the parks that make up the Canadian Rockies, including Jasper, a World Heritage Site in 1984 for its striking mountain landscape.
    

            In 1953, Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe visited to make the movie “River of No Return.” More recently, the TV show “The Bachelorette” was filmed there.
    

            Residents and visitors streamed out by the thousands late Monday and Tuesday, and officials said Wednesday the evacuation of the town of Jasper was complete.
    

            Alberta has been baking under scorching temperatures that have already forced another 7,500 people out of remote communities. About 177 wildfires were burning across the province.
    

            Jasper resident Leanne Maeva Joyeuse was relieved but exhausted after reaching the Grand Prairie evacuation center following 20 hours on the road with her grandmother, parents and younger brother.
    

            “We’re just waiting to go back home and see how many days we’re going to be stuck here,” Joyeuse said.

            Dangerous wildfires forced a town and a major national park in Canada’s Alberta province to evacuate overnight Monday.
    

            Evacuation orders were issued around 10 p.m. for “everyone” in Jasper and Jasper National Park, according to the province’s emergency alert system. On Tuesday evening, the park said on Facebook the evacuation of the town was complete.
    

            Authorities were still trying to evacuate backcountry hikers, the post added.
    

            “If you have not yet evacuated town you must leave now,” the park said on Wednesday. “This is for your own safety and to allow these critical operations to protect the town of Jasper to continue unimpeded.”
    

            At least two fires are burning in Jasper National Park, which was closed Tuesday. Jasper National Park is one of Canada’s most popular parks and drew in nearly 2.5 million visitors last year, according to Parks Canada.
    

            The city has a population of around 4,100 and there were an estimated 10,000 people, including seasonal workers, in Jasper and 15,000 park visitors when the evacuation was ordered, Stephen Lacroix with the Alberta Emergency Management Agency told The Associated Press. Police officers were going to each residence to enforce the order to leave, Lacroix said.
    

            One fire was 6,750 hectares (16,679 acres) while the other fire was 270 hectares (667 acres), according the park’s Facebook post.
    

            “At this time, returning to Jasper is not possible,” park officials said on Facebook, responding to people inquiring about going back for their belongings. “The Town of Jasper and Jasper National Park remain closed, and it is crucial to comply with the evacuation order.”

            Evacuees had fled in darkness Monday with little time to prepare.
    

            The early stages of the evacuation were complicated by the location of the fires, which forced most of the traffic west toward British Columbia on the region’s Highway 16. By the earliest hours of Tuesday morning, some traffic was allowed to travel east.
    

            “Only when roadside fire conditions permit, small groups of escorted vehicles will be directed east on Highway 16,” an emergency alert stated.
    

            Officials in neighboring British Columbia mobilized quickly to support evacuees.
    

            “BC communities large and small along (evacuation) routes are doing what we can to get gas stations open, direct folks to rest areas, open welcome centres, and provide support,” Bowinn Ma, British Columbia Minister of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness, posted on social media early Tuesday morning.
    

            The wildfires are some of the at least 170 fires burning in Alberta province amid worsening fire activity in recent days.
    

            Canada raised the country’s national preparedness level for wildfires to the highest level last Monday. This means the “potential for emerging significant wildland fires is high to extreme,” according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.
    

            Firefighters were hoping Tuesday for downpours in the Jasper evacuation zone as any wet weather could help control fire spread. But forecasters also said there would be breezy conditions – which might cause fire behavior to become erratic at times.
    

            Wednesday’s intense fire activity and strong winds forced first responders to relocate to Hinton, an Alberta town about an hour’s drive from Jasper, a Facebook post from Jasper National Park said. Firefighters and a small group of staff will remain in Jasper in an effort to protect residents, the post said.
    

            “This decision has not been made lightly,” the park said. “Given the intensity of fire behaviour being observed the decision has been made to limit the number of responders exposed to this risk.”
    

            Widespread showers are expected to arrive Thursday morning and steady rain is forecast by the evening. Depending on exactly how the fires behave early this week, fire crews may be able to make notable containment progress Thursday.
    

            Wildfires have burned more than 5 million acres in Canada this year, which is right around average for late July. Despite millions of acres burned, this year’s fire season is pacing well below last year’s record-breaking, devastating season.

CNN_44,The USWNT kicks off in France as a team in transition – and one that’s looking to make a point,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/sport/uswnt-team-in-transition/index.html,2024-07-25 21:21:00,world,"
            As the US Women’s National Team made attack after attack last week in Washington, DC, the final pass was just a little bit off the mark or the decisive shot was just fired a few inches wide.
    

The USWNT’s scoreless draw against Costa Rica in their final game before heading to France for the 2024 Summer Games was as frustrating as the nation’s capital was hot that night with the thermometer reading 97 degrees at kickoff. But it also made for a neat encapsulation of the task ahead of head coach Emma Hayes and her squad during these Paris Games.


            The old reliable stars of the team’s golden generation are largely gone. And this will be the competition where new ones will have to be made – or a streak of disappointing major tournaments will go on for another frustrating few years.
    

            “We want to make this environment comfortable, but also know, you know, what the standard is – you’re here for a reason,” said Lindsey Horan, the midfielder who serves as the team’s captain. “Any new player coming in, that means you’re one of the best in the country and you have every right to be here. So, the nerves and all those things, they’re normal. That means this means something and you’re playing on one of the best teams in the world. And we want to get back to being the best in the world.”
    

            “So, we need those players. And like I said before, we have a lot of new players and new players that make up you know, the starting spots on this roster so we’re gonna need them to be great, be confident, and you know, everyone that’s come in so far – new players, young players, too – the confidence is outstanding.”
    

            For young stars like Sophia Smith and Trinity Rodman entering their first Olympics, and four other players playing in their first major tournament for the US national team, it’s the first major test in what they hope will be a long career in the red, white and blue. Other veterans like Rose Lavelle and Alyssa Naeher will be looking to redeem themselves from disappointing showings in Tokyo and Australia and New Zealand, where the US suffered its earliest-ever defeat in the World Cup.
    

            The US women kick off their Olympic play against Zambia at 3 p.m. ET at the Stade de Nice in Nice, France.
    

            When she set the roster, Hayes acknowledged the surprising decision to not bring Alex Morgan to France, picking players who she felt adapt to her style and could play in the tight turnarounds that Olympic competition requires.
    

            It was arguably Hayes’ first tough decision as the manager of the women’s team after coming on board in late 2023 following a successful decade-plus at Chelsea FC in London. She told reporters after the Costa Rica game that at that point she’d only had about a half-dozen training sessions with her team, leaving her not much time to build the kind of relationships that major competition victories are built on.
    

            Even still, she is finding it easier than anticipated to get her team to come together.
    

            “I’ve only had a half a dozen sessions and four games. No problem, like, I’ll make the most of those” she said. “And in the sessions we have leading into the Olympics will add another layer to prepare us for the opening game in Zambia, when we have to be patient. There’s a lot of young, inexperienced players that are still learning at this level. And yes, it’s a new era. Yes, we want to win. But we have to understand the steps to take to do that.”
    

            For first-time Olympians like defender Sam Coffey, that patience is key.
    

            While Coffey says she intends to enjoy her Olympic experience and live in the moment as much as possible, the 25-year-old added she and other players stepping onto this stage for the first time are going to be doing a lot of learning.
    

            While that learning is part of the path to success, it can be a difficult position to be in when so much is expected quickly of the US women’s national team.
    

            “This is a new group, there’s a new energy, there’s a new philosophy, culture, I think we’re learning a lot as we go. And in some ways, we need to have patience with ourselves as we do that. It’s not going to be linear,” she said, adding, “But I again, I think – I hope it’s evident in the way that we’re playing and the difference in the style of play.”
    

            While the team has been gelling – Hayes and multiple players described good vibes being prominent in the locker room as the trip to France will likely be an intense period of bonding for the veterans and younger players.
    

            “We’re in our little bubble so traveling to new places is difficult because you don’t have that much free time,” forward Trinity Rodman said when asked what she was looking forward to at her first Olympics. “So, I would just say, having family members and friends there to support us through everything. being far away from home. I think the togetherness is great.”
    

            That group mentality is key to Hayes’ preparation for the rigors of tournament play.
    

            “We do a lot internally in terms of, you know, getting them to focus on the things that happen in our environment,” Hayes said.
    

            She nodded at the pressure that comes with being a part of one of the most successful women’s soccer teams of all time, saying, “We can’t control the keyboard warriors. And for us, you know, we have to realize the privilege to play for USA at the Olympics. Not only is it, you know, the greatest honor for these players, but one that we did not want to waste and we certainly don’t want to waste that with, you know, remarks and comments that are happening away from us that – people are entitled to – but we should just focus on ourselves and look after each other.”
    

            It’ll be up to players like Mallory Swanson, who’s playing in her second Olympics and third major tournament, to guide the younger players through the pressure that is heaped on the American women’s team.
    

            Swanson said so far, the mix of younger and more veteran players has led to a positive atmosphere in a locker room full of some of the game’s top players.
    

            “You got a mix of not of veterans, and then some newer players and I think that makes us really, really good,” Swanson said. “I think. It’s like I said, like the vibe has been really positive and it’s been a lot of fun and, yeah, I think just going into the tournament, that’s important.”
    

            With Morgan left at home, it’s the first major tournament in many years for the US women where there is not one striker who is expected to pour in the goals.
    

            Smith, Rodman and Swanson made up an electric front three against Costa Rica, often blitzing down the flanks of Las Ticas to create chances. Their intricate passing and combination with Horan occasionally left Costa Rican defenders flailing.
    

            But the chances were left wanting. That leaves room for a concerning question – who’s the classic striker that can be counted on to finish off the build-up play like Morgan, Carli Lloyd, Abby Wambach and Mia Hamm once did?
    

            “It’s frustrating, obviously, when you’re creating those chances that it’s just not going in. And but yeah, I think that we’re getting in those positions, and I think that you take the positive from that,” Swanson told reporters after the July 16 game. “And then I think you just go back to the training ground, and you just continue to work on finishing that last little bit. And yeah, I think it’ll come and, and just be a little – me myself, I just had to be a little bit more clinical, and just go back to the training ground and just get some reps in.”
    

            Hayes is happy to be patient with her team while they forge their new identity, and said the teams the team played ahead of their trip to France allowed them to get great experience playing different types of defenses.
    

            “The last part in the box is that little bit of composure, whether it’s to find the right – the spear player in the right moment, and where it’s just execute,” Hayes said. “When I analyze the chances, should we win the game? Of course we should win the game. But for me I’m always, I’m always about analyzing what you have to do to be able to ensure that happens or at least we can get into the positions again and again. I cannot finish the ball for players, but I can certainly coach to put players in positions.”

CNN_46,10 athletes to watch from Team USA at the Summer Olympics,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/sport/team-usa-athletes-to-watch/index.html,2024-07-25 19:00:00,world,"
            Competition is already underway in Paris for the 2024 edition of the Summer Olympics and Team USA is set to take to the River Seine Friday for the Opening Ceremonies.
    

            Here are 10 athletes from the nearly 600 Americans heading to France to compete in this year’s Olympics that you need to watch:
    

            It’s hard to imagine that the greatest of all time has something to prove. But Biles – the oldest Olympian gymnast in decades at 27 – isn’t returning to the Olympics for a farewell tour.
    

            The taste of her stunning experience in Tokyo three years ago, suffering a case of the twisties – a sensation that gymnasts describe as a loss of rhythm and control during complex maneuvers – forced her to withdraw from multiple events. It was the biggest shock of the Tokyo Games and left many observers wondering if the career of one of the most incredible athletes of all time had just ended in a flash.
    

            Now that she is in Paris, Biles is aiming to cement her place atop the gymnastics mountain. She has been on a tear of late, dominating at the US Championships and looking toward Paris with an eye on repeating her historic run in Rio de Janeiro eight years ago.
    

            It’s the return of the King to the Olympic stage. Having skipped the competitions in 2016 and 2021, James – who is 39 – is likely playing in his final Olympics as the leader of the US men’s basketball team.
    

            James has been a part of incredible US Olympic teams – 2008’s Redeem Team comes to mind – but made his Olympic debut at the disastrous Athens Games in 2004. Two full decades later, the Los Angeles Laker will be saying farewell to the international stage looking to drape gold around his neck one last time.
    

            James’ return to the team is a harbinger of where the US men’s basketball team finds itself in world competition. Americans may expect the men’s team to run roughshod over the competition but – as two nail-biting wins ahead of the Games proved – the rest of the world is catching up. The return of the game’s greatest player over the last two decades is proof that the Americans are not messing around in their quest for gold and to assert dominance over the game worldwide.
    

            James will serve as one of Team USA’s flag carriers on Friday along with tennis star Coco Gauff.
    

            The seven-time Olympic gold medalist is aiming to create more iconic scenes in Paris. Fans will long remember the races in which Ledecky embarrassed her competition with sizable freestyle victories in 2016, and the much closer contests in 2021 as her competition began to close the gap.
    

            Her Olympic success – 10 medals in total – has made her one of the faces of Team USA coming into Paris.
    

            In the lead-up to the Games, the 21-time world champion has again been putting on impressive displays and is aiming to prove in her fourth Olympics that there is no one better in the pool.
    

            He’s the fastest man in the world and he enters the Olympics’ signature race as an underdog.
    

            Lyles, 27, is the world champion in the 100-meter dash but enters Paris as an underdog to Jamacia’s Kishane Thompson, setting up one of the most dramatic editions of the race in years – especially as the American has frequently talked about beating the world record set by Thompson’s countryman, Usain Bolt back in 2009.
    

            Lyles aims this year for four gold medals, competing in the 100-meter dash, 200-meter dash, 4X100 relay and 4x400 relay. It’s a full plate for Lyles, who is trying to bounce back from a disappointing Tokyo Games three years ago in which he finished third in the 200-meter dash – his signature race.
    

            It’s redemption time for Richardson.
    

            Suspended from the Tokyo Games due to a positive test for THC – the active ingredient in marijuana – ahead of her departure, Richardson comes into Paris looking to prove she is the fastest woman in the world. She has run well in the build-up to Paris, including setting multiple personal bests in 2023, but she’ll face an uphill challenge taking on her Jamaican rivals who have traditionally dominated sprint races.
    

            Richardson will be racing in the 100 meters, but did not qualify in the 200-meter race.
    

            Competing in his third Olympic Games, Dressel is the standout men’s swimmer on Team USA and is looking to cement his place in American swimming lore with another medal haul.
    

            Having already won seven gold medals in his Olympic career, Dressel will compete in fewer races in these Games. He’ll focus on the 100-meter butterfly, the 50-meter freestyle and the 4x100-meter relay team.
    

            Dressel has won gold in every Olympic event he’s entered so far in his career. It’s a sterling record that he’ll look to keep as he aims for double-digit gold medals over the course of his three Olympic Games.
    

            Heading to her first Olympics, Smith is the leading light of a new generation of stars for the US Women’s National Team.
    

            The forward, who plays her professional football for the Portland Thorns in the NWSL, is looking to make a major impact in her first time competing in the Olympics. With the US women struggling to find the crucial final touch in the matches leading up to their departure from Paris, it’ll be up to Smith to provide a spark at the front of the US’ attack.
    

            Smith leads a team looking for redemption after getting knocked out in the Round of 16 in last year’s World Cup and failing to take home the gold in Tokyo three years ago, settling for bronze after a triumphant stretch of major tournaments. With a new-look team, Smith looking to stake her claim as the next great American women’s striker as the rising generation of American soccer players comes into focus.
    

            The returning all-around women’s gymnastics gold medalist is looking to show that her victory in Tokyo was no fluke. Lee grabbed the gold in 2021 after Biles’ shocking exit and Lee’s victory can sometimes get lost in the memories of her teammate dressed in her warm-up gear, cheering from the sidelines instead of competing.
    

            But Lee remains one of the top performers in the world and is now attempting to do something that’s not been done since 1968: Win back-to-back gold medals in the all-around competition.
    

            Lee and Biles will also be looking to reclaim the American team’s gold medal in the team competition. While Biles was a part of the victorious 2016 team, Lee has yet to win a team gold medal and will be looking to get the taste of defeat to the Russian team in 2021 washed away.
    

            Wilson heads to Paris looking to prove to the world that she is the leading American basketball talent in the women’s game, even as newcomers like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese threaten to take that spot.
    

            With the talented rookies left at home by USA basketball decision makers, Wilson – a multiple time WNBA MVP and the top player on the back-to-back WNBA champion Las Vegas Aces – is looking to repeat the success she had in Tokyo, helping to win the gold medal for Team USA.
    

            It’s a massive moment for women’s basketball as Clark and Reese’s rise – and rivalry, both in college and in the pros – has driven new interest in the game. But Wilson has been leading the charge as the league’s best player for years now and she’ll use Paris’ grand stage to try and prove that she is the top American player at a time of great growth for the women’s game.
    

            Competing in the 400-meter hurdles individually and on the relay team, McLaughlin-Levrone is looking to go back-to-back in both races.
    

            One of the most electric athletes on Team USA’s track squad, McLaughlin-Levrone is entering her third Olympic Games. She’s the current world-record holder in the 400-meter hurdles and is looking forward to a massive showdown with Femke Bol, the Dutch hurdler who is the current world champion in the 400-meter hurdles.
    

            Bol and McLaughlin-Levrone have competed around the world in recent years, and their showdown in Paris is likely to be one of the most anticipated moments of the Games.

CNN_47,From ‘one of the lowest points’ of his life to interim UFC heavyweight champion: the rise of Tom Aspinall,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/sport/tom-aspinall-ufc304-profile-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-25 18:40:00,world,"
            Five wins to open his UFC career had Tom Aspinall on course for a title shot.
    

            Then everything changed for the heavyweight MMA fighter 13 seconds into his clash with American Curtis Blaydes in 2022 in a fight which headlined a sold-out show at the O2 Arena in London.
    

            A kick from Aspinall connected with Blaydes’ leg and the British fighter dropped to the canvas, clutching his knee in pain, with the fight ending prematurely.
    

            Blaydes looked confused. Aspinall was in pain. The magnitude of the situation was evident.
    

            Aspinall had torn his medial collateral ligament, his meniscus and suffered anterior cruciate ligament damage. He underwent immediate surgery and missed a year of action, which he says was “one of the lowest points of my life.”
    

            “That sounds pretty superficial, but I give everything to fighting really,” the 31-year-old told CNN Sport. “At the time, it was awful.”
    

            “A lot of people get injured in a gym with 10 people there. I got injured with 25,000 home fans screaming my name and millions watching around the world. It’s a big blow to the ego.”
    

            After returning from injury, Aspinall was victorious in his comeback bout before claiming the interim UFC heavyweight championship title in his most recent fight and will defend it for the first time in a rematch against Blaydes on Saturday.
    

            “This is actually the first time in my career, amateur or professional, that I’ve had a rematch. I’m looking forward to showing Curtis what this version of Tom is.”
    

            As a youngster, Aspinall spent time sampling various combat disciplines – he trained in jujitsu, submission wrestling, Olympic wrestling, boxing, Thai boxing and kickboxing – before eventually settling on one which incorporates different facets into one discipline: mixed martial arts.
    

            “As soon as I realized that people are like doing this full time, getting paid for and not working a regular job, I was like: ‘Well, I want to get paid for what I like doing.’”
    

            He rose up the ranks through various different MMA organizations, before eventually signing with UFC in 2020.
    

            The Manchester native won his first five bouts, becoming a must-watch competitor, given his knack of ending his fights early; four of them ended in the first round and the fifth finished in the second round.
    

            Aspinall currently holds the record for the shortest average fight time in UFC history (with a minimum of five fights) with his bouts on averaging lasting just two minutes and 10 seconds.
    

            The UFC is seen as the pinnacle of MMA and therefore comes with increased attention, but Aspinall was unfazed.
    

            “I realized: ‘Oh, it’s just the same. Just the same in the UFC as anywhere else. It’s just a guy. He might be a UFC fighter, he might be a top-10 guy, you might be a former world champion, but he’s just a guy and I still have a chance of beating him,”’ said Aspinall.
    

            “Once I got a few wins in the UFC, I was like: ‘Oh, I can do this. Like, I can really be No. 1 in the world and be one of the best of all time of this.’”
    

            During his time on the sideline with his injury, Aspinall reflected on his preparation before a bout, whether that be training, or as he describes it, “all the stuff that was dragging me down a little bit” as he plotted how he might become the heavyweight champion.
    

            “It’s really selfish in a way. … there’s a lot of friends I’ve cut off,” he said. “But you have to do that to. And you’ll always get people saying: ‘Oh, he’s forgot about this. He’s cut me off. He thinks he’s better than us.’
    

            “As ruthless as it sounds and as pigheaded as that sounds, sometimes you do have to believe that you’re better than people to get yourself to the next level. But to be elite at anything, you really have to believe: ‘Everyone around me has to be moving in the same direction.’”
    

            Aspinall returned to the Octagon after almost exactly a year away with a convincing, 73-second victory over Marcin Tybura.
    

            It vaulted Aspinall to near the top of the heavyweight rankings and possibly in contention for a title shot as current champion Jon Jones was then scheduled to fight former two-time champion Stipe Miocic at UFC 295 in November 2023.
    

            But, just two weeks prior to that event, Jones was ruled out through a pectoral injury and Aspinall was drafted in to face Sergei Pavlovich for the interim heavyweight title.
    

            Fighters usually have months to prepare for upcoming bouts, but Aspinall had just 14 days to get ready for the fight in New York’s Madison Square Garden.
    

            “That was absolutely wild,” said Aspinall. “Not something that I’d recommend, especially, like even small stuff like the time difference. I didn’t have a visa until the day before I left. I didn’t have a training camp barely at all. Like I sparred twice for that fight. Two sparring sessions isn’t significant for a world title fight.”
    

            Despite the short notice, Aspinall knocked out Pavlovich in the second round, dropping to the canvas in disbelief afterwards, as well as dedicating the victory to his father who trains him.
    

            “I pulled it off in literally the worst circumstances I could have possibly had. I flew across the world and won a world title,” said Aspinall, who has drawn praise from many of his contemporaries, including former flyweight and bantamweight world champion Henry Cejudo, who described the British fighter as having a “bag of tricks.”
    

            “He’s like the heavyweight division’s version of [Georges] St-Pierre with even swifter striking,” Cejudo said on his YouTube channel. “What’s next for a guy like this? His name is Jon Jones.”
    

            Arguably one of the greatest UFC fighters of all time, Jones is the reigning heavyweight champion but has not fought since March 2023 and, according to Aspinall, doesn’t look like he’ll do so anytime soon.
    

            “Is Jon Jones even fighting? Because there’s a lot of talk on Twitter, on X, but I saw him recently, the guy has not seen a gym for I don’t know how long. He’s not in shape and he doesn’t have a fight booked.”
    

            CNN has reached out to Jones’ representatives for comment.
    

            Aspinall has accused Jones of “holding up” the heavyweight division, and despite a unification fight between Aspinall and Jones being what fans want, it doesn’t look likely anytime soon.
    

            His rematch against Blaydes at UFC 304 is the first defense he’s had of his title belt, and it will come on a special evening for Aspinall as it will be held in his home city of Manchester on a card full of bouts involving fellow British fighters.
    

            Aspinall’s fight with Blaydes is the co-main event for UFC 304, with Leon Edward’s welterweight title defense against Belal Muhammad the other headliner.
    

            The main events aren’t scheduled to start until after 3 a.m. local time, with Aspinall admitting he may not fight until 5 a.m. He says that he has had to “switch my body clock up” to prepare for it.
    

            In the moments ahead of his own fight, Aspinall will be thinking the same thing he does every fight: “Ring the bell.”
    

            “The fight day, generally, is the longest day of your life,” he explains, detailing the often-arduous steps he takes to prepare ahead of a bout.
    

            “And generally, I’m just thinking: ‘Ring the bell and let these emotions be over.’ Because as soon as you like swap leather, that’s it. It’s gone. You’re just in flow then. That’s the part that I like.”

CNN_48,Biden’s Oval Office address now hands debate over democracy to Harris,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/biden-oval-office-address-analysis/index.html,2024-07-25 22:04:00,politics,"
President Joe Biden saved his most powerful argument against Donald Trump for the moment he explained to the nation why he was no longer the person to make it.
    

            In his primetime Oval Office address on Wednesday, Biden ceded the political stage to Kamala Harris, ushering in an unusual period heading into the election where the vice president, not the president, will lead their party.
    

            Apart from Biden’s announcement on Sunday not to seek reelection, after days of Democratic Party turmoil, the speech was the most critical moment in his attempt to pass power to Harris. The new presumptive Democratic nominee must now work quickly to carve her own political identity and to make a case for her own presidency — a task in which she must create a vision, program and aura that is distinct from Biden’s and his political liabilities.
    

            This reversal of power dynamics requires Biden to swallow his own aspirations, may at times compromise his dignity, and for Harris, at some point — perhaps as soon as this week over Gaza — to break from her boss for her own political good.

Biden calls his decision to step aside from 2024 race a matter of defending democracy


            The president explained his decision to end his bid for reelection after weeks of humiliating public debate over his age and mental cognition as instead motivated by a desire to pass the torch to a new generation of leadership at a time of unmatched peril. “I revere this office, but I love my country more. It’s been the honor of my life to serve as your president,” Biden said. “But … the defense of democracy, which is a stake, I think (is) more important than any title,” Biden said. “Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition.”
    

            Biden’s speech, which will be studied for generations, was direct but thematically dense and intended to address multiple goals.
    

            It was a valediction for a political career that has spanned half a century, that he decided, under pressure, to end — even if he would have preferred not to. Biden was seeking to preserve the viability of what is left of a presidency that has suddenly plunged into lame duck status and to dampen Republican calls for his immediate resignation as president. It was a warm endorsement of his preferred successor Harris and an attempt to weave for her a thesis about the successes of his term to present to voters. It was also a moment of political indulgence as Biden took credit for his achievements he thinks he’s been denied in the cacophony of the campaign trail.
    

            But most importantly, Biden’s speech, his allusions to history, his stylization of his decision to step aside as a service to the nation, and his detailed definition of what America means, represented a brutal political indictment of Trump.
    

            Biden opened his speech behind the Resolute Desk of the Oval Office referring to great presidents in the pantheon and how their lives and actions reflected the character of the nation they built and led.
    

            “Thomas Jefferson wrote the immortal words that guide this nation. George Washington showed us presidents are not kings; Abraham Lincoln, who implored us to reject malice; Franklin Roosevelt, who inspired us to reject fear,” Biden said. His implication from each historical example was clear. He sees Trump, the Republican nominee and an ex-president seeking to dedicate a new term to “retribution,” as the antithesis of all these values and is therefore the most un-American president to ever hold or seek the office.

            Biden was doing what presidents often do at a time of crisis, reaching into the national mythology to convince Americans to honor the foundational principles of the country built up through decades of words and action. In case anyone had missed the point, he returned to his historic narrative at the end of the speech, quoting founder Benjamin Franklin’s maxim: “A republic, if you can keep it.” Biden added: “Whether we keep our republic is now in your hands,” assigning to voters the task of what he regards as a fight to save democracy against Trump’s perceived threat, which he now won’t be able to do himself in November’s election.
    

            The president also presented his selflessness in ending a reelection campaign and bid to win a second term all president’s cherish as a direct comparison to what he sees as the self-serving corruption of Trump. “America’s going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division. We have to decide, do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy. … Does character in public life still matter?”
    

            The unspoken implication of Biden’s pleading was the question of whether the nation that he thinks he recognizes still exists. After all, millions of Americans believe Trump’s false claims that he won the last election and was cheated out of it and that his multiple legal problems caused by his assault on the rule of law amount to a tyrannical bid by Biden’s government to persecute him. And many voters do not recognize the picture of a strong economy that the president painted in his speech. Daily reminders of high prices at grocery stores and struggles to get mortgages or pay rent because of elevated interest rates often create a more immediate sense of crisis for people than the more elusive and abstract concept of a democracy in peril.
    

            So while Biden warned that the entire nature of the American experiment was in question during this election, there’s the half of the country that views the Democratic Party as a threat to their perception of what makes the country great and likely found the speech highly politicized.
    

            Biden’s words, in the storied surroundings of the Oval Office, cloaked in the familiar and scripted theatrics of a national address, allowed him to make the case against Trump and for his own presidency that he had failed so disastrously to put forward before an audience of 50 million people at the CNN debate in Atlanta a month ago.
    

            The moment when any leader publicly recognizes that their time is up is always poignant. In Biden’s case, it is even more so since he’s not just confronting the limits of waning political appeal but the ravages of advancing age.
    

            Biden appeared stronger than at the debate. But a few stumbles, his rather stiff manner and occasionally raspy voice showed why many Americans didn’t believe he could be president until he is 86. In that sense, Wednesday’s broadcast amounted to a moving recitation of why the president thinks he deserves a second term but was also a demonstration of why he might not have won one.

How Kamala Harris can beat Donald Trump


            With that in mind, Biden set himself up as a leader returning power to the people in a quintessentially American manner, implicitly referencing Washington’s farewell address after the aging and weary first president decided not to seek a third term by saying, “Kings and dictators do not rule. The people do. History is in your hands, the power is in your hands, the idea of America lies in your hands.”
    

            The elegiac nature of his address, and his attempt to summon national greatness, also recalled the spirit of President Ronald Reagan, a leader who had risen to the heights and reached a deeper understanding of the character of his nation and brought that perspective to his farewell address in 1989. Soon after he left office, he entered a retirement clouded by a slide into Alzheimer’s disease.
    

            “As long as we remember our first principles and believe in ourselves, the future will always be ours,” Reagan said, foreshadowing Biden’s remark on Wednesday, “You just have to keep faith … remember who we are. We’re the United States of America, and there’s simply nothing, nothing beyond our capacity, when we do it together,” Biden said.
    

            One of the most significant implications of Biden’s decision is that he’s now putting his entire political legacy in someone else’s hands. If Harris fails to win the election, everything Biden achieved — and much that also remains from Barack Obama’s presidency — could be at risk in a hardline new era of Trumpist rule.
    

            And if Harris is unable to complete the most exacting and compressed task handed to any presumptive presidential nominee in recent times, the president will surely attract criticism for waiting so long to pull out of the race, putting his personal ambition for another term over his party’s interests for months.
    

            His reputation in history is therefore at stake. But if Harris prevails over Trump, Biden’s actions and thinking spelled out in Wednesday’s address will be more likely to be remembered in his own terms — as a selfless political move motivated by deep patriotism.
    

            Engineering his exit and again blocking Trump from power would be remembered as the finest moment of his 50 years in Washington. His political farewell would be remembered much like the character in Shakespeare’s Macbeth who acted with dignity and humility at his execution and of whom it was said: “Nothing in his life became him, like the leaving it.”

CNN_49,Fact check: Trump made at least 10 false claims about Kamala Harris in a single rally speech,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/fact-check-trump-false-claims-kamala-harris/index.html,2024-07-25 22:41:00,politics,"
            Former President Donald Trump made at least 10 false claims about Vice President Kamala Harris in his first campaign rally since she became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.
    

            Trump, speaking in North Carolina, attacked Harris at length with a flurry of assertions about her personal and political past, her record as vice president and her policy stances. We’re still looking into some of his claims, but at least 10 were wrong.
    

            Here is a fact check.
    

Harris and the retirement age


            Discussing Social Security, Trump claimed of President Joe Biden and Harris: “They’re talking about, he was talking, she’s talking about – lifting the retirement age.”
    

Facts First: This claim is false about Harris. She has not spoken in favor of raising the age for receiving Social Security retirement benefits. (Biden did, as a US senator in the 2000s and prior, express support for or openness to raising the retirement age, but he has been a vocal opponent of the idea as president.)
    

            Harris has supported increasing, not reducing, Social Security benefits. In 2019, about two years before she became vice president, she co-sponsored a bill from Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, called the Social Security Expansion Act, that would boost Social Security benefits by raising payroll taxes on high earners.
    

Harris and abortion


            Trump said, “She wants abortions in the eighth and ninth month of pregnancy, that’s fine with her, right up until birth, and even after birth – the execution of a baby.” 


Facts First: Trump’s claim that Harris supports the execution of babies after birth is false. She has never said anything to endorse post-birth murder, which is illegal everywhere in the country; Trump has frequently claimed that some Democratic states allow such post-birth executions, but that claim is false, too.
    

            Harris, a vocal supporter of abortion rights, has declined to endorse specific limits on how late in a pregnancy an abortion should be permitted to occur. According to data published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, just 0.9% of reported abortions in 2020 occurred at 21 weeks gestation or later. Many of these abortions occur because of serious health risks or lethal fetal anomalies.
    

            Harris has called for legislation restoring the protections of the Roe v. Wade decision that was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2022; Roe allowed states to restrict abortion after the point of fetal viability, often considered to be around 23 to 24 weeks gestation, with exceptions for abortions necessary to protect the patient’s life or health. As a senator and vice president, Harris has supported a bill that would, like Roe, ensure abortion was available at least until fetal viability – and would also prohibit various state policies that make the process of providing or obtaining an abortion more onerous. 


            Asked about Trump’s comments, the Trump campaign provided various examples of Harris taking liberal positions on abortion policy and declining to endorse specific limits - but nothing to substantiate the claim that she supports “the execution of a baby” after birth.
    

Harris and red meat


            Trump claimed, “Kamala even wants to pass laws to outlaw red meat to stop climate change.”
    

Facts First: This is false. Harris has never expressed support for passing laws to outlaw red meat. At a CNN climate change town hall in 2019, when she was running in the Democratic presidential primary, she expressed support for changing dietary guidelines to try to encourage Americans to reduce their consumption of red meat, but she also said “I love cheeseburgers from time to time” and that she favored using “incentives” and education to encourage healthy eating. 


            After mentioning sodas and foods with copious sugar, Harris said in this same town hall answer that “the balance that we have to strike here, frankly, is about what government can and should do around creating incentives and then banning certain behaviors.” The phrase “banning certain behaviors” opened the door to claims that she wants to ban red meat. But she immediately proceeded to her comments about how she enjoys cheeseburgers and favors incentives to prod changes in behavior – making clear in context that she was expressing support for incentives rather than bans.
    

            Asked about Trump’s claim about Harris wanting to outlaw red meat, the Trump campaign provided two citations that did not substantiate it: a YouTube video of Harris’ comments that was correctly titled “Kamala Harris Wants The Government To Create ‘Incentives’ For Americans to Eat Less Meat” and an article headlined, “Flashback: Kamala Harris said she would support eating less meat if elected president.”
    

Harris and Trump’s legal cases


            Trump has claimed for months that Biden secretly orchestrated his criminal and civil legal cases. This time, he directed the claim at Harris. He said, “But it was all headed up by her. Because she’s a prosecutor.”
    

Facts First: This is false. There is simply no basis for claiming that Harris “headed up” the legal cases against him. Trump has never presented any evidence for this claim that Biden was the hidden hand behind his cases, let alone for suddenly switching the claim to make it about the vice president after months of saying it about the president.


            There is no sign that Harris had any role in bringing charges against Trump in Manhattan, New York (where he was convicted of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records) or Fulton County, Georgia (where an election subversion case against Trump is on hold); those prosecutions have been led by elected local district attorneys. Trump’s two federal cases, one dismissed by a judge earlier this month, were brought by a special counsel, Jack Smith. Smith was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, a Biden appointee, but that is not proof that Biden orchestrated the prosecutions – and certainly not proof that Harris did.
    

Harris’ immigration role


            Trump claimed of Harris: “She was the border czar, but she never went to the border.”
    

Facts First: Trump made two false claims here. First, Harris did go to the border as vice president, in Texas in mid-2021; many Republicans had criticized Harris prior to the visit for not having gone, and some later argued that she didn’t go frequently enough, but the claim that she “never” went has not been true for more than three years. Second, Harris was never made Biden’s “border czar,” a label the White House has always emphasized is inaccurate. In reality, Biden gave Harris a more limited immigration-related assignment in 2021, asking her to lead diplomacy with El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras in an attempt to address the conditions that prompted their citizens to try to migrate to the United States.


            Some Republicans have scoffed this week at assertions that Harris was never the “border czar,” noting on social media that news articles sometimes described Harris as such. But those articles were wrong. Various news outlets, including CNN, reported as early as the first half of 2021 that the White House emphasized that Harris had not been put in charge of border security as a whole, as “border czar” strongly suggests, and had instead been handed a diplomatic task related to Central American countries.
    

            A White House “fact sheet” in July 2021 said: “On February 2, 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order that called for the development of a Root Causes Strategy. Since March, Vice President Kamala Harris has been leading the Administration’s diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.”
    

            Biden’s own comments at a March 2021 event announcing the assignment were slightly more muddled, but he said he had asked Harris to lead “our diplomatic effort” to address factors causing migration in the three “Northern Triangle” countries (he also mentioned Mexico that day). Biden listed factors in these countries he thought had led to migration and said that “if you deal with the problems in-country, it benefits everyone.” And Harris’ comments that day were focused squarely on “root causes.”
    

            Republicans can fairly say that even “root causes” work is a border-related task. But calling her “border czar” goes too far.
    

Harris and the number of migrants


            Trump claimed that Harris “allowed 20 million illegal aliens to stampede into our country from all over the world.”
    

Facts First: Leaving aside Trump’s claim about Harris’ own responsibility for migration levels, the“20 million” figure is false, a major exaggeration. The total number of “encounters” at the northern and southern border from February 2021 through June 2024, at both legal ports of entry and in between those ports, was about 10 million – and an “encounter” does not mean a person was let into the country; some people encountered are promptly sent away. 


            Even if you added the estimated number of Biden-era “gotaways” (people who evaded the Border Patrol to enter illegally), which House Republicans said in May was nearly two million, “the totals would still be vastly smaller than 15, 16 or 18 million,” Michelle Mittelstadt, spokesperson for the Migration Policy Institute think tank, said in late June after Trump used those figures.
    

            The “encounters” figures can’t be described as figures on people successfully entering the US. Some encounters involve people who are deemed inadmissible at legal ports and are refused permission to enter. Also, the same person can be “encountered” multiple times if they keep returning to the border to try again – which is what happened in many cases under Biden when the Title 42 rapid-expulsion authority invoked by Trump during the Covid-19 pandemic was in place into May 2023.
    

Harris and fentanyl deaths


            Shortly after claiming there is a “Kamala Harris invasion” of the border, Trump said, “We’re losing 300,000 people a year through fentanyl that comes through our border.”
    

Facts First: Trump’s “300,000” claim is false. The number of US overdose deaths in 2023 involving synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, was approximately 75,000, according to estimated and provisional data published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC said in May that roughly 107,500 people in the US died from a drug overdose involving any kind of drug in 2023; even that larger number is nowhere close to Trump’s “300,000.”   


            When Trump made similar “300,000” claims earlier this year, Dr. Andrew Kolodny, medical director of the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative at Brandeis University, said “I have no idea where Trump is getting ‘300,000’ from and called it “a made-up number.”
    

            While Kolodny said it’s likely that the number of US overdose deaths is undercounted, there is no apparent basis for Trump’s insistence that the real number is nearly triple the reported number. And Kolodny said the undercount issue is centered not on overdoses from illicit fentanyl smuggled across the southern border but on seniors’ overdoses from accidentally taking too much of their legal prescription medications.
    

            It is also worth noting that fentanyl is largely smuggled by US citizens through legal ports of entry rather than by migrants sneaking into the country.
    

CNN’s Jen Christensen contributed to this item.


Harris and the Jewish community


            Trump criticized Harris for not attending Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Wednesday speech to Congress (though Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, also did not attend); Harris, who is planning to hold a meeting with Netanyahu on Thursday, traveled to Indianapolis on Wednesday to give a previously scheduled speech to a historically Black sorority.
    

            That’s fair game for criticism. But Trump said after criticizing Harris’ absence: “Even if you’re against Israel or you’re against the Jewish people, show up and listen to the concept. But she’s totally against the Jewish people.”
    

Facts First: Trump’s claim that Harris is “totally against the Jewish people” is nonsense. Harris has been married to a Jewish man, Doug Emhoff, for nearly 10 years – and she has repeatedly denounced antisemitism, expressed fondness for the Jewish community and its traditions, complimented Israel at length, and endorsed “America’s ironclad commitment to the security of Israel.” Though she has sometimes been pointedly critical of the actions of Israel’s government during the war in Gaza, drawing criticism from conservative Jews and others, there is no evidence she has a general antipathy toward “the Jewish people” as Trump claimed.


            The Jewish Telegraphic Agency news service reported this week: “Over the course of her life and career, she has been surrounded by Jews, from her schoolmates to her colleagues to her closest family members. That background has given Harris, 59, an easy familiarity with Jewish spaces, say those who have interacted with her. She has also encouraged Emhoff to embrace his Jewish identity as the second gentleman; for the first time, mezuzahs have been installed at the vice presidential residence, and Emhoff has taken a leading role in the administration’s efforts to fight antisemitism.”
    

Harris and the bar exam


            Trump claimed that Harris, a lawyer who was elected as San Francisco’s district attorney and then as California’s attorney general, “failed her law exams.” Then he continued, “You know that? She couldn’t pass her bar. She couldn’t pass her bar exams…Does anyone know that? … But she’s gonna be a great president, right? No, she couldn’t pass her bar exams. She couldn’t pass anything. Couldn’t pass everything. She couldn’t pass anything.”
    

Facts First: It’s not true that Harris “couldn’t pass anything.” She did fail on her first attempt to pass the bar exam, according to The New York Times, but then succeeded. She was admitted to the California bar in 1990, the year after she graduated from law school. 


            Trump could fairly say that Harris couldn’t initially pass the bar exam, but his rally comments made it sound like she never passed at all.

CNN_50,Ex-Uvalde schools police officer pleads not guilty to charges of child endangerment and abandonment in 2022 massacre,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/us/uvalde-shooting-police-officer-arraignment/index.html,2024-07-25 22:47:00,us,"
            One of the first officers who responded to the Uvalde school massacre in Texas pleaded not guilty Thursday to more than two dozen criminal counts.
    

            Former Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District police officer Adrian Gonzales faces 29 counts of abandoning and endangering a child in connection with the May 2022 slaughter that left 19 children and two teachers dead.
    

            Gonzales was arraigned Thursday, more than two years after the deadliest school shooting in more than a decade. It took law enforcement 77 minutes after the gunman walked into Robb Elementary School to take him down. As victims lay dead or dying inside classrooms, officers were seen on video waiting outside in hallways.

            The botched response to the mass shooting has been described as an “abject failure,” with officials and experts blaming multiple entities.
    

            Gonzales and former Uvalde schools police chief Pete Arredondo are the only law enforcement officers to be indicted on criminal charges so far.
    

            According to Gonzales’ indictment, the former officer failed to “follow his active shooter training.”
    

            “After hearing gun shots and after being advised of the general location of the shooter and having time to respond to the shooter, the said Adrian Gonzales failed to engage, distract or delay the shooter, to attempt to engage, distract and delay the shooter, and failed to otherwise act in a way to impede the shooter until after the shooter entered rooms 111 and 112 of Robb Elementary School and shot at a child or children in Rooms 111 and 112,” the indictment states.
    

            Gonzales’ attorney, Nico LaHood, said his client “feels he’s innocent.”
    

            “There were over 370 officers there. We have not seen or even heard of a theory of why Mr. Gonzales is being singled out,” LaHood said Thursday after the arraignment. “We’ll get into that more when we see the discovery. But that’s going to be a long process.”

            Gonzales told investigators he was at the high school when he heard a report of a vehicle accident near Robb Elementary and went to check. He said he heard shots and entered the south hallway along with Arredondo. Gonzales said he tried to call for a SWAT team on his radio but could not transmit inside the school building – so he left.
    

            “Once I got out to get radio reception, I never went back in,” Gonzales told investigators.
    

            While the gunman roamed freely inside the school, Gonzales said he spent much of the time waiting with emergency medics outside the west door. He said he found a set of keys and a floor plan of the school that had been requested by a Texas Ranger on scene.
    

            Gonzales, who was hired by the Uvalde school district in July 2021, left the department in February 2023. No specific reason was given for his departure, according to the Uvalde News Leader.
    

            Arredondo, who was considered the de facto incident commander at the scene, faces 10 counts of child endangerment and known criminal negligence, according to his indictment.
    

            Arredondo was fired by the Uvalde school board three months after the shooting. He waived his right to an arraignment and entered a plea of not guilty last week, CNN affiliate KSAT reported.
    

            Uvalde County Jail records show both Arredondo and Gonzales were released on $10,000 bond.

CNN_51,Wealth of global top 1% grew by $42 trillion over past decade: Oxfam,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/economy/wealth-tax-super-rich-oxfam-report/index.html,2024-07-25 22:20:00,us,"
            The last decade has been very lucrative for the world’s super-rich residents, fueling the drive by some advocates to tax them more.
    

            The top 1% has seen its wealth soar by $42 trillion over the past decade, according to a new analysis by Oxfam International, which is being released ahead of the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors’ meeting in Brazil. That’s nearly 34 times more than the bottom 50% of global population.
    

            The average net worth of the elite jumped by nearly $400,000 per person, after adjusting for inflation, compared to $335 for the bottom half of residents.
    

            “Inequality has reached obscene levels, and until now governments have failed to protect people and planet from its catastrophic effects,” said Max Lawson, Oxfam International’s head of inequality policy. “The richest one percent of humanity continues to fill their pockets while the rest are left to scrap for crumbs.”
    

            Oxfam regularly issues reports highlighting global inequality and pushes for changes to start evening the playing field. The latest analysis comes as the advocacy group, along with several partners, is calling on G20 leaders to hike taxes on the ultra-rich.
    

            As part of its G20 presidency, the Brazilian government recently commissioned a study on raising taxes on the wealthy. The report, prepared by French economist and inequality expert Gabriel Zucman, found that a 2% minimum tax on global billionaires’ wealth would yield between $200 billion and $250 billion from about 3,000 taxpayers annually.
    

            According to the EU Tax Observatory, which is run by Zucman, the super-rich in big countries pay a far smaller share of their income in taxes than ordinary people. Plus, their wealth is taxed at effective rates of just 0%-0.5%.
    

            “Momentum to increase taxes on the super-rich is undeniable, and this week is the first real litmus test for G20 governments. Do they have the political will to strike a global standard that puts the needs of the many before the greed of an elite few?” Lawson said.
    

            Finance officials from the world’s biggest countries began talks earlier this year on introducing a global minimum tax on billionaires. However, getting an agreement among the G20 leaders will be difficult and could take a long time. Such a tax would also be complicated to implement.

CNN_52,Delta’s CEO is off to Paris while his airline struggles to recover from massive meltdown,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/business/delta-ceo-paris-olympics/index.html,2024-07-25 22:06:00,us,"
            Delta CEO Ed Bastian arrived in Paris Wednesday morning for the opening of the Olympics as his airline struggled to recover from a five-day meltdown that left an estimated half-million customers stranded by thousands of flight cancellations.
    

            After a global tech outage that started Friday forced Delta to cancel nearly 8,000 flights on over the past several days, the company said it expects minimal cancellations on Wednesday and “normal” service on Thursday. But it could still be days before all of Delta’s passengers whose flights were canceled will be able to make it to their destinations, given the busy summer travel season and the lack of available seats on many flights. The company has also been unable to reunite many customers with their luggage.
    

            Meanwhile, Bastian traveled to Paris for the Olympics, accordingly, where Delta is a sponsor of the US Olympic Team.
    

            “Ed delayed this long-planned business trip until he was confident the airline was firmly on the path to recovery,” said a statement from Delta to CNN “As of Wednesday morning, Delta’s operations were returning to normal. Ed remains fully engaged with senior operations leaders.”
    

            Bastian flew to Paris on a Delta commercial flight, not a private jet, the airline said. As the official airline of the US Olympic Team, the company is flying athletes, coaches and other support staff to Paris. Most CEOs of Olympic sponsors will probably be attending at least part of the Olympics, but those other CEOs have not had the customer service problems over the last week that Delta has suffered.
    

            However, the union attempting to organize Delta flight attendants slammed the CEO for taking a “first class seat” to Paris instead of taking ownership of the massive meltdown.
    

            “While Ed was flying to Paris last night, crew were sleeping in airports across the country. Flight Attendants expect an apology and accountability,” the Delta Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA) organizing committee said in a statement. “We provided a roadmap to recovery and care for the affected crew members.”
    

            AFA is a union is seeking to win the right to represent flight attendants working on Delta’s mainline flights and already represents flight attendants on Delta subsidiary Endeavor Air, which operates flights under the Delta Connection brand. CNN reached out to Delta to confirm the type of seat Bastian sat in during his travels, and an airline spokesperson responded that the airline had nothing to add.
    

            The one union with significant membership at Delta is the Air Line Pilots Association, which has about 17,000 members at the airline. Asked about Bastian’s trip to Paris, Captain Darren Hartmann, the chairman of the union’s unit at Delta, said the union wasn’t particularly concern because it has been able to talk regularly with the front-line operations executives at Delta since the service problems began.
    

            “Frankly it’s more important that we’re meeting with them every day,” Hartmann said. As far as Bastian not remaining stateside until the end of the service issues, Hartmann said “Ed has to do Ed.”
    

            Delta has been asking employees to pull extra duty to try to address the company’s problems, with its IT staff working around the clock to try to fix a tech meltdown caused by a corrupted software update from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike late last week.
    

            That bug disrupted computer systems around the globe. Although many airlines’ operations were disrupted, the problems proved to be far more widespread and long-lasting at Delta than at other carriers. Delta encountered severe problems with its crew tracking software that made it difficult to locate the pilots and flight attendants it needed to operate the flights.
    

            Paris is a major European destination for the airline. Although there will be thousands of Americans traveling to Paris to watch the games, Bastian told CNBC in an interview earlier this month that Delta is, counterintuitively, likely to lose business because of the games. Many travelers are staying away from Paris if they were not planning to watch the Olympics, so travel volumes are less than they likely would have been without the event. Bastian estimated the Olympics will cost Delta about $100 million in lost revenue.
    

            “Unless you’re going to the Olympics, people aren’t going to Paris… very few are,” Bastian told CNBC. “Business travel, you know, other type of tourism is potentially going elsewhere.”

CNN_53,Yellowstone’s popular Biscuit Basin is closed for the summer after hydrothermal explosion,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/travel/yellowstone-biscuit-basin-explosion/index.html,2024-07-25 22:57:00,world,"
            Yellowstone National Park’s Biscuit Basin will remain closed for the remainder of the 2024 season following a hydrothermal explosion Tuesday morning that launched debris hundreds of feet in the air and damaged the surrounding area, officials with the National Park Service and the US Geological Survey said in a statement Wednesday.
    

            Biscuit Basin – located about 2 miles northwest of the famed Old Faithful geyser in Wyoming – was shuttered for the rest of the summer out of concern for visitor safety, according to park officials.
    

            The officials said the explosion, near the Sapphire Pool around 10 a.m. local time Tuesday, destroyed the walkway that surrounds the basin.
    

            “The explosion, which sent steam and debris to a height of hundreds of feet above the ground, destroyed a nearby boardwalk and ejected grapefruit-sized rocks tens to hundreds of feet from the source,” the USGS said in a Wednesday news release. “Some blocks closest to the explosion site are about 3 feet (1 meter) wide and weigh hundreds of pounds.”
    

            No injuries were reported after the incident, officials said.
    

            The explosion altered the shape of the park’s famous Black Diamond Pool, officials noted. The Black Opal Pool was also affected.
    

            “Both pools are murky due to debris, and the unstable ground around their edges occasionally slides into the water,” the release said. “Given the recent changes to the hydrothermal plumbing system, small explosions of boiling water from this area in Biscuit Basin continue to be possible over the coming days to months.”
    

            Geologists with the USGS and the National Park Service continue to monitor conditions at Biscuit Basin – mapping the debris field, and sampling water to assess any changes in the shallow hydrothermal plumbing system.
    

            Officials say Grand Loop Road, which surrounds Biscuit Basin and other notable sites in the park, remains open to vehicles. Other nearby thermal basins, like Black Sand Basin, are open as well, the release said.

Hydrothermal explosion leads to closure of parts of Yellowstone National Park


            A handful of hydrothermal explosions occur in the park each year, according to the USGS, however those typically occur in more remote areas.
    

            “Hydrothermal explosions are violent and dramatic events resulting in the rapid ejection of boiling water, steam, mud, and rock fragments,” according to the USGS.
    

            They “occur where shallow interconnected reservoirs of fluids with temperatures at or near the boiling point underlie thermal fields. These fluids can rapidly transition to steam if the pressure suddenly drops. Since vapor molecules take up much more space than liquid molecules, the transition to steam results in significant expansion and blows apart surrounding rocks and ejects debris,” the agency said.
    

            Biscuit Basin and other popular geysers have experienced similar explosions in the past, officials said.
    

            “Although smaller, hydrothermal explosions took place in 1989 at Porkchop Geyser in Norris Geyser Basin, and on April 15, 2024, from the Porcelain Terrace Area of Norris Geyser Basin,” the USGS said.
    

            Additionally, a small hydrothermal explosion occurred from Wall Pool, in Biscuit Basin, in 2009, according to officials.
    

            Large hydrothermal explosions occur on an average of every 700 years, the USGS said.
    

            Tuesday’s explosion does not indicate a volcanic eruption is imminent, the USGS said in an earlier release. “Monitoring data show no changes in the Yellowstone region. Today’s explosion does not reflect activity within (the) volcanic system, which remains at normal background levels of activity. Hydrothermal explosions like that of today are not a sign of impending volcanic eruptions, and they are not caused by magma rising towards the surface.”
    

            “Although large hydrothermal explosions are rare events on a human time scale, the potential for additional future events of the sort in Yellowstone National Park is not insignificant. Based on the occurrence of large hydrothermal explosion events over the past 16,000 years, an explosion large enough to create a 100-(meter)- (328-ft-) wide crater might be expected every few hundred years,” the USGS added.

CNN_54,What Delta passengers are entitled to in terms of compensation,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/23/travel/passenger-compensation-delta-air-lines-outage/index.html,2024-07-25 22:32:00,world,"
            Delta Air Lines reported “a significant return to operational reliability” on Wednesday after five days of widespread disruptions stemming from a global tech outage.
    

            And Thursday was expected to be a “normal day,” according to an update from Delta CEO Ed Bastian.
    

            While most airlines affected by a CrowdStrike software update that crashed Windows systems had largely resumed normal operations by the end of the weekend, Delta was still struggling with the crew tracking system needed to staff its flights well into the following week.
    

            Thousands of bags were separated from passengers who couldn’t make the same journeys upon which their luggage embarked. And some weary, frustrated passengers were still trying to reconstruct travel plans or abandon them for compensation. Passengers over the weekend reported wait times of six hours or more on customer service phone lines before they gave up without reaching agents.
    

            The Department of Transportation has opened an investigation into Delta’s service meltdown. Delta said it is cooperating with the DOT and remains “entirely focused on restoring our operation.”
    

            “Across our operation, Delta teams are working tirelessly to care for and make it right for customers impacted by delays and cancellations as we work to restore the reliable, on-time service they have come to expect from Delta,” the airline said in a statement.
    

            Here’s what we know about what they’re entitled to and how passengers can make claims with the airline.
    

            The Department of Transportation has been adamant that airlines offer money-back refunds to passengers affected by cancellations or “significant” delays, rather than e-credits for future travel. Travelers may choose e-credits, but portions of their trips not flown are refundable. Delta listed a “right to a refund upon request” in a Monday afternoon update on what it’s doing to serve affected customers. Delta refunds can be requested here.
    

            Delta said in a Wednesday update that it will also allow any passengers with travel booked from July 19-28 who no longer wish to travel to cancel and request a refund “regardless of whether their flight has been canceled or significantly delayed.”
    

            Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg hammered the refund requirement on X over the weekend.
    

            “I am hearing reports of some airlines only offering flight credits to passengers for cancelled flights. Let me be clear – you are entitled to get your money back promptly if your flight is cancelled and you don’t take a rebooking,” Buttigieg posted Saturday.
    

            While there was some question in the early hours of the outage on Friday whether the situation was within the airlines’ control, the DOT soon put that question to rest for US carriers, deeming the fallout from the system outage “controllable.”


            “A ‘controllable’ flight cancellation or delay is one that is attributable to the airline,” the DOT said in a statement Friday, which put commitments airlines have made to their customers in such events applicable. Those are detailed on this DOT dashboard.
    

            Delta outlined that it is responsible for covering expenses “resulting from this flight  disruption, including providing meal vouchers, hotel accommodations where available and ground transportation.”
    

            Lines stretched down concourses on Saturday evening at Delta’s hometown airport, Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International. Some passengers reported six-hour waits, and many affected passengers had trouble securing food and lodging over the weekend.
    

            Buttigieg addressed mounting complaints from passengers on Sunday: “Delta must provide prompt refunds to consumers who choose not to take rebooking, free rebooking for those who do, and timely reimbursements for food and hotel stays to consumers affected by these delays and cancellations, as well as adequate customer service assistance,” he posted on X.
    

            Travelers who made their own arrangements during the disruption can be reimbursed for expenses such as hotels, meals and ground transportation. (Among the expenses that are not eligible for reimbursement: hotel reservations at the traveler’s destination, vacation experiences, lost wages, tickets to concerts or other events).
    

            In an update on Wednesday, Delta said: “We know many customers have incurred unplanned travel expenses, including purchasing tickets on other airlines, rental cars, train tickets and more. Delta will cover reasonable costs for additional categories of expenses incurred during the duration of the travel waiver (which currently applies for flights between July 19 and July 28).”
    

            Impacted passengers can submit reimbursement requests here.
    

            The airline has also said it would issue Delta SkyMiles or a travel voucher “in an amount based on the customer’s affected travels.”
    

            Complaints can be filed online with Delta. Online complaints generate a case number that can be used to track them. An auto-response to one passenger complaint filed on Monday said most inquiries receive a response “within 7 days,” adding “however, due to the complexity of certain situations, additional time may be required to respond.”
    

            The Department of Transportation also fields air travel service complaints.
    

            “While you should first try to resolve issues directly with the airline, we want to hear from passengers who believe that Delta has not complied with USDOT-enforced passenger protection requirements during the recent travel disruptions. We will follow up,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg posted Tuesday on X.
    

            The DOT says on its website that contacting airlines directly may result in the fastest resolution of many service complaints, but the agency does require airlines to acknowledge consumer complaints filed with the DOT.  The agency also collects complaints in a database to help it spot trends in the industry that may inform future rulemaking.
    

            The operational meltdown has separated thousands of passengers from their luggage, which in many cases made it to destinations the passengers could not reach.
    

Claims for delayed, lost or damaged luggage can be submitted online. However, the form requires a file reference number that can only be obtained through a Delta agent. “Your file reference number is 8 or 10-digit alphanumeric code located on the front of baggage information folder given to you by the Delta agent with whom you first reported your baggage delay,” Delta’s online form says.
    

            In Atlanta on Monday morning, passengers waited in two-hour plus lines to speak with Delta agents at the Baggage Service Office to get those reference numbers and file claims. Claims can be filed at any Baggage Service Office.
    

            Customers can also call 1-800-325-8224 to make a baggage claim.
    

            “We have set up an internal Baggage Command Center in Atlanta, where we are seeing the highest number of displaced baggage, in an effort to expedite the process of reuniting customers with their belongings,” Delta said on Tuesday.
    

            Delta has extended its travel waiver for travel through July 28. Details are available here.

CNN_55,"‘You’re playing for something bigger than yourself’: Andy Murray withdraws from singles, looks to doubles in Olympics",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/sport/andy-murray-olympics-singles-withdraw-intl-spt/index.html,2024-07-25 22:48:00,world,"
            This year’s Olympics in Paris will be Andy Murray’s fifth – and final – appearance at the Games.
    

            Now, the competition will look a little different for Murray – the only man in history to win two Olympic singles gold medals – as he has withdrawn from that event, as well as having announced his retirement from the sport itself once his run at Roland Garros ends.
    

            However, the three-time grand slam champion will still play doubles alongside Dan Evans in what will be his last professional hurrah.
    

            Murray says he has played “some of my best tennis when I’ve competed for my country,” he tells CNN’s Christiane Amanpour.


            “The dynamics are quite different here being part of a huge team and representing your country, but I’ve always fed off that. I’ve really enjoyed the whole team.
    

            “You’re playing for something just bigger than yourself. And I’ve really enjoyed that,” he adds.
    

            While Murray doesn’t know who he will face in the Olympics, he adds that it would be “fun” to play against Spain’s Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz in the doubles.
    

            “It would be fun to play against them. I mean, you know, they’re obviously two unbelievable players. They’ve not played loads of doubles together,” the 37-year-old told Amanpour.
    

            “But, I mean, I think it’s brilliant for tennis and for the Olympics that they’re competing with each other. So it’d be a great opportunity [if] we got to play against them.”

Andy Murray confirms he will retire after the Paris Olympics


            Murray’s withdrawal from the men’s singles comes just days after he announced he was retiring from professional tennis in totality following the conclusion of the Olympics, noting that “a couple of months ago, I definitely was unsure about when I wanted to finish or if I wanted to finish.”
    

            He consulted his family and team, he adds, “but ultimately, the decision had to come from me. I’m really happy about it. I’m happy that I get to finish playing an Olympics.
    

            “Mentally, I still feel young, but physically … the last few years have been really hard for me. I’ve gone through quite a lot of surgeries … had a lot of injuries,” he explains.
    

            Murray has suffered a plethora of health setbacks this year, including an ankle injury in March and undergoing surgery on a spinal cyst just before Wimbledon, where he was eventually unable to play in the singles competition.
    

            “Recovering from those surgeries, it’s not the same as when you were in my early- or mid-20s. It takes, takes longer and with each one of those sort of… almost insults to the body, it just takes a little bit longer,” he explains.
    

            The Scotsman won the first Olympic gold of his career representing Team GB at London 2012 after beating Roger Federer in straight sets just weeks after a heartbreaking defeat to the Swiss legend in the Wimbledon final.
    

            That victory proved to be the catalyst for Murray’s first – and long awaited – triumph in SW19 the following year as he became the first British man in 77 years to lift the Wimbledon trophy.
    

            “At the time, I didn’t take it in as much as I wish I had done. I just felt so relieved to finally have done it,” he adds.
    

            He defended his Olympic title four years later in Rio, defeating Argentina’s Juan Martín del Potro in the final and also boasts a mixed doubles silver medal from London 2012.
    

            While Murray himself tells CNN’s Amanpour he is unsure of what his legacy will be, the tennis star has become almost as famous for his criticisms of misogyny and promotion of the women’s game as he has for his own prodigious talent on the court.
    

            The 37-year-old adds that sexism in the sport wasn’t something he had “given much thought to” in his teenage years and early 20s. Murray then turned to France’s former women’s No. 1 Amélie Mauresmo, becoming the first high-profile male tennis player to hire a woman as a coach – and the scrutiny heaped on the duo during their two-year partnership shocked him.
    

            “There was a big change in attitude in terms [of] the way the players in the locker room were talking to me about her – even people who were part of my team.
    

            “Each time I lost, I got asked a lot of questions about my coach and Amélie. I’d never experienced that before, and I realized that this was different. Around that time, I started to have a few more conversations with my mom about what it’s like – she’s worked in tennis for a long time as a female coach and some of the difficulties and challenges that she’s had. And, you know, it was quite eye-opening for me. And that was sort of when I started to realize that things needed to change a bit,” he explains.
    

            He is, however, hopeful about the future of tennis, in particular, equal pay at major tournaments.
    

            “I think there is still a way to go. But I also think that tennis is one of the best global sports in terms of how they treat men and women. It’s definitely not perfect, but I feel like tennis should probably celebrate that side of things more.”
    

            As for what’s next, Murray is undecided.
    

            “I don’t know exactly what my legacy is and I don’t feel like it’s for me to decide that, it’s more for others. And what’s next: initially, I’m going to go home and I’m going to spend time with my family and be around my kids.
    

            “I want to be home with them and take some time to, you know, relax and recover and have a think about what it is that I want to do next.
    

            “I definitely still see myself having some involvement in tennis. I’m looking forward to something new now. But I’m not entirely sure of what that new is yet,” he adds.

CNN_56,"Former AG Bill Barr personally involved in decision to publicize details of 2020 mail-in ballot probe, DOJ watchdog finds",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/bill-barr-2020-election-fraud/index.html,2024-07-26 00:20:00,politics,"
            A Justice Department watchdog has found that former Attorney General Bill Barr was personally involved in the decision to publicize an incident from the 2020 election – nine mail-in ballots for Donald Trump being discarded in a dumpster in Pennsylvania – that flamed the false narrative of widespread voter fraud.
    

            But the department’s inspector general stopped short of finding that Barr violated any internal policies, concluding that he had wide discretion as attorney general to disclose details from criminal investigations. Investigators ultimately determined that the ballots were discarded in error by a contractor, and no charges were brought.
    

            The inspector general looked at the decision to put out a press release about the incident from Justice Department prosecutors in the Middle District of Pennsylvania in September 2020. The release said investigators were looking into “potential issues with mail in ballots.”

Roger Stone sentencing proposal change was ‘highly unusual’ but politics didn’t play an improper role, DOJ watchdog says


            Barr “encouraged and authorized” US Attorney David Freed to issue the statement – a move several DOJ attorneys called “unusual” – and he “specifically approved inclusion of the details about the discarded ballots, including that all the recovered ballots had been cast for President Trump,” according to the inspector general’s report released Thursday.


            The inspector general found that Barr and Freed’s decision to issue the press release was contrary to DOJ rules, which limit public disclosure of ongoing criminal investigations and also discourage the department from taking public actions that can affect elections.
    

            However, the report concluded, neither man committed any punishable misconduct because of ambiguity within those rules that allows an attorney general to publicly disclose information about an ongoing criminal investigation if he or she believes it is in the interest of justice.
    

            Barr did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.
    

            “I handled this investigation properly from start to finish and my public statements were explicitly approved by the AG or his senior staff,” Freed said in a statement to CNN. “I am very grateful for the opportunity I had to serve the public as U.S. Attorney.”
    

            The press release on the Pennsylvania incident raised suspicions from critics at the time – particularly for its inclusion of details about whom the ballots were cast for – that the department was trying to boost the sensational claims of mass voter fraud being pushed by Trump.
    

            Freed’s initial statement about the ballot probe suggested that people involved in the ballot disposal incident had likely committed criminally chargeable acts. But at the time, the inspector general wrote, “Department leadership was aware of information that substantially undercut this narrative.”
    

            The watchdog also questioned Barr privately telling Trump details about the investigation – specifically whom the ballots were cast for – days before the press release. Trump revealed those details on a national radio show the next morning.
    

            Still, the inspector general said that Justice Department policy also gives the attorney general wide discretion to tell the president about a criminal investigation.
    

            The inspector general said that for its investigation, Barr submitted a three-page letter laying out his side of the story, but that it “did not address certain issues” that came up during the review. Both Barr and his chief of staff while he was attorney general declined the inspector general’s request for an interview in the probe.
    

            The new report comes on the heels of a report released Wednesday examining another “highly unusual” episode at the Justice Department under Barr. That report looked at the extraordinary move by the DOJ to submit a second sentencing memo in the Roger Stone congressional obstruction case that watered down the department’s initial sentencing recommendation. The report found that Barr was deeply involved in that reversal, though the inspector general did not find evidence of political meddling. Barr also declined to be interviewed for that investigation.
    

            As part of its review of the Pennsylvania ballot press release, the inspector general is recommending that the department make several clarifications about the internal policies implicated in the episode, calling for more clarity about what investigative details can be disclosed to the White House and whether DOJ protocols about public disclosures apply to the attorney general.

CNN_57,Fact-checking Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Congress,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/fact-check-netanyahu-congress-address/index.html,2024-07-26 00:04:00,politics,"
            In his speech to Congress on Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu struck a defiant tone, pledging to carry on with the war in Gaza until Israeli hostages are released and Hamas is eliminated.
    

            He defended Israel’s actions, pushing back against criticism that the war has gone on for too long and resulted in too many civilian casualties. In doing so, he made a number of claims about the war in Gaza that were either false, lacked context or were presented without evidence to support them.
    

            We break them down here:
    

Claim: Netanyahu said Israel has “enabled more than 40,000 aid trucks to enter Gaza” adding that it amounts to “more than 3,000 calories for every man, women, and child in Gaza.”
    

Fact: More than a dozen aid agencies working in the territory have said that Israel’s statistics on truck entries “fail to address several vital components necessary for an effective operational response”.
    

            “The mere entry of trucks into Gaza does not guarantee that the supplies reach the intended recipients due to safety and security reasons,” they said, adding that “reported numbers do not differentiate between types of cargo, often mixing commercial goods with critical humanitarian aid, which obscures the real picture of assistance reaching those in crisis.”
    

            CNN has reported on Israel’s arbitrary and contradictory criteria for the entry of aid and the strict rules it enforces at checkpoints.
    

Claim: Netanyahu said a commander in Rafah told him that there practically no civilian deaths in the city with the exception of “a single incident where shrapnel from a bomb hit a Hamas weapons depot and unintentionally killed two dozen people.”
    

Fact: There have been multiple reports of several strikes in Rafah that have resulted in civilian casualties.
    

            The incident Netanyahu appeared to refer to occurred in May and killed at least 45 people at a camp for displaced Palestinians. The airstrike injured more than 200 after a fire broke out at the camp following the strike, most of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and Palestinian medics.
    

            In the same week, at least 29 Palestinians were killed in two separate Israeli attacks on displacement camps in Rafah, according to Palestinian and UN officials.
    

            CNN has verified videos from Rafah and spoken to several health officials, humanitarian workers and eyewitnesses who have reported civilian fatalities as a result of Israel’s military assault on the city.
    

Claim: Netanyahu said the war in Gaza has “one of the lowest ratios of combatants to non-combatant casualties in the history of urban warfare.”
    

Fact: Israel has been saying since early on in the war that its ratio of civilian to terrorist fatalities is very low, but experts have cast doubt on the claim.
    

            In November, then-Israeli military spokesperson Jonathan Conricus told CNN that Israel believes that it has killed two Palestinian civilians for every Hamas militant, saying the ratio is “tremendously positive.” Asked about the claims, Democratic Congressman Seth Moulton, a member of the House Armed Services Committee who served in Iraq, told CNN the comments were “dead wrong,”

Israel military says 2 civilians killed for every Hamas militant is a ‘tremendously positive’ ratio given combat challenges


            Conricus said that when the Israeli military reported how many fighters it had killed, it was referring to combatants, “people who are fighting.” In Gaza, thousands of residents are employed in Hamas-run administrative agencies but carry out civilian duties.
    

            Gaza’s Ministry of Health doesn’t distinguish in its reporting between combatant and civilian deaths but has previously said that some 70% of casualties in all of Gaza have been women and children.
    

            Open-source monitoring by watchdog group Airwars found a “high correlation” between the Palestinian Ministry of Health’s civilian casualty data and what Palestinian civilians “reported online,” according to a new  report.
    

            More than 39,000 people have died in in Gaza since October, when Israel launched a war against Hamas after it attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages.
    

Claim: Netanyahu said that the US director of national intelligence recently revealed “that Iran is funding and promoting anti-Israel protests in America.” He also said: “When the tyrants of Tehran, who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering their hair, are praising, promoting and funding you, you have officially become Iran’s useful idiots.
    

Fact: The suggestion that most or all anti-war protesters are pawns of Iran is not accurate, but US intelligence has indicated that Iranian government actors have tried to pay some protesters.
    

            Last month, the Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said that Iran is attempting to covertly stoke protests in the US related to the war in Gaza, posing as activists online and, in some cases, providing financial support to protesters. But Haines also said she wanted “to be clear that I know Americans who participate in protests are, in good faith, expressing their views on the conflict in Gaza,” adding that the intelligence “does not indicate otherwise.”
    

Claim: Netanyahu said the International Criminal Court’s allegation that Israel is starving people of Gaza is “utter, complete nonsense” and a “fabrication”.
    

Fact: On October 9, Israel declared a “complete siege” on Gaza, with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant saying he would halt the supply of electricity, food, water and fuel to the enclave.
    

            Israel has since eased some of those restrictions, but aid agencies say the food that is getting into the strip is only a fraction of what is needed, leading to widespread hunger. Israel’s military operations in Gaza, they say, also hinder the safe distribution of food. In April, USAID Administrator Samantha Power said it is “credible” to assess that famine is already occurring in parts of Gaza.
    

Human Rights Watch has accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war, noting that high ranking Israeli officials “have made public statements expressing their aim to deprive civilians in Gaza of food, water and fuel” and that the “policy” is “being carried out by Israeli forces.”
    

Claim: Netanyahu said that if Palestinians in Gaza aren’t getting enough food, “it’s not because Israel is blocking it, it’s because Hamas is stealing it.”
    

﻿Fact: There have been some anecdotal reports from Gazans of Hamas stealing aid, although it’s not clear how rampant it is.
    

            Israeli officials have been making the claim that Hamas was stealing aid since October. UN Humanitarian Coordinator Lynn Hastings told CNN then that Hamas wasn’t stealing aid because aid wasn’t coming in.
    

            US Special Envoy David Satterfield in February denied the allegations that Hamas has stolen aid, saying that no Israeli official had presented him or the Biden administration with “specific evidence of diversion or theft of assistance.”
    

            US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller did however say in May that one shipment coming from Jordan was briefly diverted by the group before it was recovered by the UN. CNN cannot independently confirm the claim.
    

            Aid agencies have said that there have been cases of looting by the public due to Israel’s military operation leading to a breakdown in public order and safety.

CNN_58,"Obama expected to endorse Harris soon, source says",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/barack-obama-kamala-harris-endorsement/index.html,2024-07-26 00:00:00,politics,"
            Former President Barack Obama is expected to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris soon and his team has been in touch with the campaign, a source told CNN.
    

            Obama and Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, have been in touch regularly, and he is serving as a sounding board for her as he has over the 20 years they’ve known each other, the source said.
    

            Obama, who didn’t immediately endorse Harris following President Joe Biden’s announcement on Sunday that he was not seeking reelection, believed it was important for the Democratic Party to have a legitimate process through which delegates select their new nominee, and he thinks Harris is off to an impressive start, the source said.
    

            News of Obama’s expected endorsement was first reported by NBC News.
    

            Regarding Obama’s statement on Sunday, an adviser told CNN that the former president was taking the same approach as he did in the 2020 Democratic primary, watching closely with the intent of being able to unify the party when a nominee is chosen – whether it was Harris or someone else.
    

            Obama’s statement was intended to keep the focus on Biden on the day he announced he was no longer seeking a second term, the adviser said.
    

            The former president was supportive of Biden’s reelection campaign as he attended multiple fundraisers that raised millions of dollars, along with participating in moderated conversations with Biden and sending messages encouraging supporters to chip in as part of fundraising efforts.
    

            Democrats have been moving quickly in the process to nominate Harris as the party adopted the rules on Wednesday that they will use to choose their presidential nominee, with voting to officially nominate Harris likely to begin on August 1.
    

            The rules call for ceremonial votes for president and vice president, as well as a vote on the party platform, during the Democratic convention, which is scheduled to take place in Chicago from August 19-22. While the ceremonial presidential vote will be conducted as a roll call, the vote for vice president is likely to be a voice vote. Harris has not yet selected a running mate.

CNN_59,Biden expected to forcefully urge Netanyahu to accept ceasefire deal in Thursday meeting,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/biden-netanyahu-meeting/index.html,2024-07-25 23:17:00,politics,"
            President Joe Biden is expected to be as forceful as he has ever been in urging Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept a ceasefire agreement when the two leaders meet privately at the White House Thursday afternoon, sources tell CNN, as US officials believe that a deal may be on the cusp.
    

            “We’re closer than we’ve ever been,” one senior administration official said. “It’s up to the Israelis to accept it.”
    

            Biden’s in-person meeting with Netanyahu follows the Israeli prime minister’s speech to Congress on Wednesday, which sparked antisemitic and pro-Hamas protests in Washington, DC, that the White House condemned.
    

            The meeting, which is Biden’s first with a world leader since announcing he would drop out of the 2024 race, comes at a fragile point in their decadeslong relationship. A resolution to end the Israel-Hamas war that began in October now looms large over Biden’s legacy as a one-term president. Progress in the negotiations for a ceasefire have come in fits and starts in recent months, and Biden and his senior national security officials have been closely involved in trying to land the deal.
    

            Biden will also have a second separate setting Thursday afternoon where he could apply firm pressure on Netanyahu to finalize the ceasefire agreement – a joint meeting with the prime minister and the families of American hostages in Gaza.
    

            Multiple sources stressed that no major announcement about an agreement is expected on Thursday. However, as CNN reported this week, US and Israeli officials have voiced increased optimism about the prospects of an agreement.
    

            While Biden has remained firmly behind Israel, even as its campaign in Gaza has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, both leaders have traded not-so-subtle barbs in recent months over the future of the war and how Netanyahu has waged it.
    

            Biden has described Israel’s actions in Gaza as “over the top,” threatened to withhold some new arms transfers and repeatedly pressured Netanyahu to scale back and be more precise in his military operation in Gaza – criticism that reached a peak when an Israeli strike killed seven World Central Kitchen workers in early April. The Israeli leader has been steadfast in his position that the war will not end until Hamas is eliminated while accusing the US of withholding weapons from its closest ally – claims that American officials flatly rejected.
    

            Speaking in front of Congress this week, Netanyahu did not substantially address the status of ceasefire negotiations. He instead praised Biden for his “heartfelt support” for Israel after the October 7 Hamas attack while urging the US to fast-track military aid to “dramatically expedite an end to the war.”
    

            “As we defend ourselves on all fronts, I know that America has our back and I thank you for it – all sides of the aisle,” Netanyahu said.
    

US officials remain sensitive to Israeli politics that may be shaping Netanyahu’s calculations – including, as CNN has reported, the timing of Israel’s parliament going into recess at the end of the month, which would make it harder for right-wing opponents of the deal to move to collapse the government.


            The US does not believe, for now, that Netanyahu is standing in the way of or delaying a ceasefire and hostage deal, and believes that progress is being made amid ongoing negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Both the Israelis and Hamas, the official said, have elements they need to agree on before a deal is reached, and not one side is holding up negotiations at this point.
    

            The in-person meeting at the White House will be the first time the two men have met in person since Biden’s trip to Israel last year following the October 7 attack, although the two men have spoken frequently on the phone. It will be followed by the meeting with American hostage families, and then Netanyahu will meet with Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Biden has endorsed to replace him on the top of the Democratic ticket.
    

            The prime minister in his remarks to Congress criticized anti-Israel protesters as “Iran’s useful idiots” and falsely downplayed the role of Israel in causing the ongoing civilian suffering in Gaza.
    

            Biden’s support for Israel’s war had been one his most politically toxic issues within his own party for much of the year, with many of his public campaign appearances being repeatedly interrupted by protesters demanding a ceasefire in Gaza. Biden’s stance toward those protests has been conciliatory – he has repeatedly responded to them by saying that the protesters have a point, and that too many innocent people are dying in Gaza.
    

            But the national conversation surrounding Biden’s handling of Israel’s war took a back seat to the waves of Democratic concern about his ability to beat former President Donald Trump after his faltering debate performance last month. Trump and Netanyahu will meet Friday at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump announced Tuesday.
    

            Last week, Biden spoke extensively about the war in the Middle East for the first time in months – telling a Complex Networks interviewer that he considers himself a Zionist but adding that he’s “done more for the Palestinian community than anybody” while still calling for more aid to reach the Gaza Strip.
    

            “I’m the guy that opened up all the assets. I’m the guy that made sure that – I got the Egyptians to open the border to let goods through, medicine and food,” Biden said. “I have been very supportive of the Palestinians, but Hamas, they’re a bunch of thugs.”
    

            Biden and Netanyahu last spoke during a 30-minute call on July 4, during which both leaders “focused” on details about a possible hostage exchange and ceasefire deal.
    

            A deal was never finalized or assured during that call.

CNN_60,Nevada man indicted for threatening Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg and Judge Juan Merchan,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/nevada-man-threats-bragg-merchan/index.html,2024-07-25 23:09:00,politics,"
            A Nevada man was indicted on 22 federal charges for making threats against state and federal officials, including Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and the judge overseeing the hush money case against Donald Trump, according to an indictment and a person familiar with the matter.
    

            Spencer Gear was charged with multiple counts of transmitting a communication containing a threat to injure and threatening a federal official. He was arraigned earlier this week in Nevada federal court and pleaded not guilty. Gear remains in custody.
    

            Gear was charged with leaving threatening phone calls to federal and state officials in Washington, DC, and New York. The indictment identifies the targets of the threats by initials and a source confirmed that Bragg and New York Judge Juan Merchan were among them.
    

            Prosecutors allege Gear left a telephone message and “threatened to kill A.B. and J.M.,” according to the indictment. A person familiar with the investigation confirmed the initials refer to Bragg and Merchan.
    

            The Manhattan district attorney’s office has said threats to their office increased during Trump’s criminal trial earlier this year.
    

            Trump was convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records to coverup a payment made to silence a porn star before the 2016 election. He is scheduled to be sentenced in September. Trump has asked the judge to throw out the conviction based on the Supreme Court’s recent ruling on presidential immunity.

CNN_61,Gov. Gavin Newsom issues executive order for removal of homeless encampments in California,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/us/gavin-newsom-executive-order-homeless-encampments/index.html,2024-07-26 00:46:00,us,"
            California Gov. Gavin Newsom, buoyed by a recent US Supreme Court decision, issued an executive order Thursday calling on state officials to begin taking down homeless encampments.
    

            The move to begin dismantling thousands of encampments throughout California comes after the high court ruled last month in favor of an Oregon city that ticketed homeless people for sleeping outside. The ruling rejected arguments that such “anti-camping” ordinances violated the Constitution’s ban on “cruel and unusual” punishment.
    

            “This executive order directs state agencies to move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them — and provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same,” Newson said in a statement. “There are simply no more excuses. It’s time for everyone to do their part.”
    

            The order calls on state officials “to adopt humane and dignified policies to urgently address encampments on state property.”
    

            The move has drawn the ire of homeless advocates.
    

            “Newsom could have issued this order before the (Supreme Court) decision. The only difference now is that states and localities are free to confine and arrest people even when there is no shelter available,” said Chris Herring, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California Los Angeles.

            “So before the Supreme Court ruling cities were in the position where they would have to provide shelter offers before removing encampments. Now … they will be able to carry out these encampment sweeps with the very real threat of issuing people incredibly expensive fines of which people cannot pay and often results in a warrant or an arrest or can result in incarceration.”
    

            Herring said the timing of the order wasn’t surprising as Newsom seeks to “politically clear his name of the homeless crisis, especially as he’s in the national spotlight right now amid the presidential election.”
    

            In San Francisco, a spokesperson for Mayor London Breed said the city had already started to take action.
    

            “Our city encampment teams and street outreach staff have been going out every day to bring people indoors, and to clean and clear encampments,” spokesperson Parisa Safarzadeh told CNN in a statement. “This is why we are seeing a five year low in the City’s tent count on our streets.”
    

            Last month, Newsom praised the Supreme Court decision, saying it “provides state and local officials the definitive authority to implement and enforce policies to clear unsafe encampments from our streets.”
    

            “This decision removes the legal ambiguities that have tied the hands of local officials for years and limited their ability to deliver on common-sense measures to protect the safety and well-being of our communities,” Newsom added.
    

            The case was the most significant appeal involving unhoused Americans to reach the Supreme Court in decades, and it was closely watched by cities and states across the nation wrestling with a sharp increase in homelessness.

            A 19-year-old man and two juveniles suspected in a botched carjacking that led to the death of an Ohio woman were in custody Wednesday on murder charges, police said.
    

            Alexa Stakely, 29, saw her SUV being stolen July 11 with her 6-year-old son sleeping inside and was struck by the vehicle while trying to save the child, according to the Columbus Division of Police.
    

            A 16-year-old suspect told police he entered Stakely’s vehicle “and was about to drive off when Stakely appeared in front of the Honda,” according to an arrest report. The suspect says he “panicked” and drove off, hitting the victim, the report said.
    

            Stakely’s son was found unharmed in the vehicle, which had been abandoned near where Stakely was struck. Stakely had briefly left the boy in the vehicle with the engine running to retrieve the child’s belongings from his baby sitter, police said.
    

            The driver turned himself in Wednesday, accompanied by his parents. “It’s my understanding that his parents and his conscience got to him a little bit,” Sgt. Joe Albert told CNN affiliate WBNS.
    

            Another 16-year-old was connected to the car theft and arrested, as was Gerald Dowling, 19.
    

            Dowling’s jail record indicated he was scheduled for a first court hearing Thursday, but did not list an attorney. Court information for the 16-year-old suspects was not immediately available because they are juveniles.
    

            Although only one suspect was in the car at the time Stakely was hit, Albert told WBNS they are all equally responsible for her death under the law.

            “Since they were there as part of the motor vehicle theft, and unfortunately Ms. Stakely died as a result of that motor vehicle theft,” Albert said, “they all get charged with murder.”
    

            Stakely was a speech language pathologist at Winchester Trail Elementary, according to a social media post from Canal Winchester Schools.
    

            Canal Winchester Schools, with whom Stakely had been employed for five years, described her in a Facebook post as “a great mom who was incredibly dedicated to her son.”
    

            The post continued: “Ms. Stakely made a difference in the lives of the students and families she worked with and will be missed by so many in our community and beyond.”

            A former Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples a decade ago is appealing a ruling ordering her to pay thousands in attorney fees.
    

            The appeal filed by attorneys for Kim Davis in federal court argues that the landmark Obergefell ruling in 2015 should be overturned. Davis objected to same-sex marriage on religious grounds and was briefly jailed.
    

            A federal judge ruled in January that Davis, who is the former Rowan County clerk, must pay $260,000 in fees to attorneys who represented a couple who sought a license from her office. Attorneys from the group The Liberty Counsel filed a brief Monday asking the Sixth Circuit US Court of Appeals in Cincinnati to overturn that ruling.
    

            Davis’ refusal to issue a license to a same-sex couple led to weeks of protests as gay marriage opponents around the country praised her defiance. Davis, a Republican, ultimately lost her bid for reelection in 2018.
    

            Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said in a news release that Davis “deserves justice in this case since she was entitled to a religious accommodation from issuing marriage licenses under her name and authority.”
    

            The appeal brief takes aim at the 2015 Supreme Court ruling that allowed same-sex couples to legally marry, saying the ruling was a “mistake” and “has produced disastrous results for individuals like Davis, who find it increasingly difficult to participate in society without running afoul of” the law.
    

            Davis has also been ordered to pay $100,000 in damages to the couple who sued.
    

            Davis was released from jail in 2015 only after her staff issued the licenses on her behalf but removed her name from the form. Kentucky’s state legislature later enacted a law removing the names of all county clerks from state marriage licenses.

            A federal judge threw out a bankruptcy case filed by The Gateway Pundit, finding that the far-right conspiracy site was seeking bankruptcy protections in “bad faith” to avoid costly defamation lawsuits stemming from its publication of 2020 election lies.
    

            The ruling Wednesday from US bankruptcy judge Mindy Mora means the defamation cases will move forward. Two Georgia election workers and a former Dominion Voting Systems executive sued the outlet over its false claims that they rigged the 2020 results. The Gateway Pundit denies wrongdoing and said those cases forced them into bankruptcy.
    

            The Gateway Pundit “remains both balance sheet and cash flow solvent,” Mora wrote in her ruling. “There is no present financial distress, no looming foreclosure sale, no prospect of a market crash. There is only the (defamation cases) in which [The Gateway Pundit] must defend itself. That’s not a basis for bankruptcy relief; it’s the justice system in operation.”
    

            Lawyers for The Gateway Pundit did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.
    

            Brittany Williams, a lawyer from Protect Democracy representing the Georgia election workers, Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, said the judge “saw through The Gateway Pundit’s transparent attempt to abuse the bankruptcy process to avoid accountability.”
    

            “We will continue to work to ensure that no abuse of the legal system further delays justice for Ms. Freeman and Ms. Moss,” Williams said in a statement Thursday.

            Over the years, The Gateway Pundit has become infamous for its publishing of hyper-partisan blog posts, many of which advance dangerous lies and conspiracy theories. Founder Jim Hoft, a supporter of Trump and MAGA loyalist, has used the website to promote the former president, while disparaging his opponents.
    

            The Gateway Pundit is one of several right-wing media outlets grappling with the fallout stemming from its promotion of 2020 election lies. Fox News paid a record $787 million to settle a massive defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems, an election technology company. And the right-wing network still faces a similar lawsuit from Smartmatic, another election company.

CNN_65,‘Just shocking’: Delta passengers tell of airport agony and honeymoon travel woes during tech meltdown,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/business/passengers-delta-meltdown-stories/index.html,2024-07-26 00:24:00,us,"
            J.R. Reed’s three kids were scattered in different states across the country this week. They all had tickets to get home — on Delta.
    

            But they couldn’t even get onto planes. Delta paused its unaccompanied minors program during the airline’s meltdown in the wake of the global tech outage that started late last week.
    

            “Delta flew my kids out and won’t fly them home,” said Reed, a resident of Atlanta. He told CNN he wasn’t notified of the minors program embargo.
    

            His eldest, 15, was stuck in Charlotte for 12 hours. His middle child, 12, stayed stranded in New York’s LaGuardia Airport. His youngest, 10, was in Orlando after flying solo for the first time.
    

            Reed eventually resorted to buying a ticket to New York himself to pick up his middle child, while his sister flew out to Florida to do the same for his youngest. He arranged for a car to pick up his eldest son and bring him back to Atlanta.
    

            “As soon as Delta made the decision to not honor any child tickets flying by themselves, their first priority should have been rebooking those passengers, and they didn’t care,” he added.
    

            A Delta representative said in an email to CNN that the airline embargoed unaccompanied minor travel beginning July 19 to keep them from being separated from their caregivers should their flights be canceled or delayed due to the outage.
    

            “We take seriously the trust caregivers place in us with their children’s travel, and sincerely apologize that that trust was compromised through confusion around the embargo,” the company said.
    

            Reed is a longtime Delta loyalist who achieved “Million Miler” status. He’s seen his share of technology-related disruptions with the airline, but he described its handling of the fallout from the CrowdStrike outage as “the worst ever.”
    

            Similar tales of frustration and fury are mounting as Delta Air Lines lags behind other airlines in recovering from the global tech meltdown that swept across the world last week, prompting Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to launch an investigation into Delta. With the number of delayed and canceled flights hitting the thousands, he told reporters he estimated more than 500,000 passengers were affected.
    

            For newlyweds Jeremy and Kaylee Jones, the disruption upended their plans to celebrate their honeymoon on the Caribbean Island of St. Lucia.
    

            The couple flew to Atlanta, Georgia, from Spokane, Washington, on a Delta flight and encountered no issues, they told CNN. But upon arrival Tuesday, they discovered their flight to St. Lucia was canceled due to a lack of crew.
    

            The couple, who were married Saturday, said the flight issues caused five guests to miss the wedding, as well.
    

            “I get that things happen,” Jones said. “This is just shocking to me that a multi-billion-dollar corporation would struggle this much to get the ball rolling again.”
    

            In a note to customers Sunday, Delta CEO Ed Bastian apologized for the disruptions and attributed the problem to the computer program affecting its “crew tracking” software. The company followed up Monday, saying the CrowdStrike error required its technology team to manually reboot and repair impacted systems — and that additional time was still needed for the applications to sync up.
    

            The Joneses are also among thousands of passengers missing their baggage.
    

            At Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, Delta’s headquarters and largest hub, thousands of pieces of luggage were lined up on the floors of baggage claim on Tuesday. The bags made it to the world’s busiest airport — but, due to delays and cancellations, their owners didn’t.
    

            Dylan Steele, a federal worker from South Georgia, was stuck at Hartsfield-Jackson Airport in Atlanta since Saturday when he was supposed to travel to Washington, DC, for a conference. He told CNN on Tuesday his job requires him to fly Delta Airlines and that he was unable to pick up a flight from a different airline, forcing him to abandon his travel plans entirely.
    

            So instead, Steele planned to head back home — without his luggage, he told CNN.
    

            “My belongings are on the tarmac or being loaded onto a plane somewhere,” he said.
    

            A Delta Air Lines representatives told Steele his baggage will go to D.C. without him and will be sent to his home in about a week.
    

            “Delta, typically on a normal day, is pretty good,” he said. “The CrowdStrike glitch has caused a significant speed bump, and they’re just finding it hard to get their footing back.”
    

            At Hartsfield-Jackson, Delta is trying to boost staffing by mobilizing its volunteer team alongside employees from different departments to iron out the chaos.
    

            But exasperated flyers, like Arthur Ginolfi, say Delta needs to do better to take care of their customers.
    

            “It is frustrating to travel, but this is the worst experience I’ve ever had in my 35 years of business travel,” said Ginolfi, whose Delta flight from Philadelphia to Atlanta was originally booked for Sunday afternoon.
    

            Ginolfi said he was forced to drive two hours back to his home in New Jersey, arriving around 2 am on Monday.

            “There are lines that were unacceptable, there were people that were frustrated. I saw and I heard a lot of sad stories,” he said. “There should be some kind of compensation for this.”
    

            He told CNN the issues have cost him a significant amount of money.
    

            “I had to pay for parking for 12 hours, I had to pay for food, I had to pay for tolls,” he said.
    

            Bastian also told Delta passengers in a note on Sunday that the airline would “continue to offer meal vouchers, hotel accommodations and transportation where available. And as a gesture of apology, we’re also providing impacted customers with Delta SkyMiles and travel vouchers.”
    

            Included in the compensation being offered to Delta customers is a waiver that allows travelers who booked a flight from July 19 to 23 to make a one-time change to their itinerary as well as the option to request a refund for significantly delayed flights.

CNN_66,US Department of Justice finalizes plea deal with Boeing,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/business/boeing-doj-plea-deal/index.html,2024-07-26 00:24:00,us,"
            The US Department of Justice on Wednesday for the first time shared details of its finalized plea deal agreement with Boeing, in which the troubled aviation company will plead guilty to a felony charge of defrauding the US government.
    

            Boeing agreed to pay a fine of another $243.6 million as part of its plea agreement on top of a $243.6 million it already agreed to pay in 2021 and admitted it defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration when seeking permission for the troubled 737 Max plane to carry passengers. The plea deal is subject to approval of a federal judge, who could double the amount of the fine by not granting it a credit for the fine it already paid.
    

            “We will continue to work transparently with our regulators as we take significant actions across Boeing to further strengthen our safety, quality and compliance programs,” Boeing said in a statement.
    

Boeing agreed to plead guilty two weeks ago to one charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States for its role in two fatal 737 Max crashes, in an agreement that many critics of Boeing – including crash victims’ families – slammed as a sweetheart deal. The victims families’ attorney will now argue to the judge that the fine should be in the billions of dollars, not hundreds of millions.
    

            However, one additional condition detailed in a new filing on Wednesday is that Boeing’s board of directors will have to hold a meeting with victim families and their legal representatives within four months of the sentencing date.
    

            Boeing will also have to invest at least $455 million into its compliance, quality and safety programs, the agreement states.
    

            Boeing is to pay up to $487 million in fines — a fraction of the $24.8 billion that families of crash victims wanted the aircraft maker to pay. It had already paid half the fine as part of the original plea deal in 2021. The families of victims of two fatal crashes of the 737 Max oppose the deal, the Justice Department said.
    

            The guilty plea and subsequent terms further hurt Boeing’s reputation. The company has faced a series of questions about the safety and quality of its planes, beginning with the fatal crashes of the 737 Max jets. And in January, a door plug on a 737 Max flown by Alaska Airlines blew out early in a flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the jet.

CNN_67,Coco Gauff still can’t wrap her head around the honor of being Team USA’s flag bearer,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/sport/coco-gauff-team-usa-flag-bearer/index.html,2024-07-26 00:57:00,world,"
            Coco Gauff may be a tennis prodigy and one of the top American athletes to represent the USA at the Summer Olympics, but she still finds herself getting caught up in the glamour of the Paris Games.


            Gauff will serve as flag bearer alongside basketball superstar LeBron James – a role she has yet to truly wrap her mind around.
    

            “I don’t know when I’m going to meet him, but I’m already stressed about it really,” Gauff told CNN’s Coy Wire. “I’ve never met him before, I’m excited to meet him and I’m excited to be flag bearer alongside him. There’s no other athlete I think I would have chosen to do this with.”
    

            Gauff, just 20 years old, is entering her first Olympics after missing the Tokyo Games three years ago with a Covid-19 infection. She’s one of the faces of Team USA in Paris and says she’s finding the experience a little bizarre.
    

            She described meeting American Olympic legends Simone Biles and Katie Ledecky since arriving at the Olympic Village – where she’s spent her time trading pins and riding bikes – and found it hard to comprehend that they knew who she was even though she’s a superstar in her own right.
    

            It’s a lot for someone so early in their career to take in.
    

            “It took a while for it to sink in, (it still hasn’t really) sunken in,” Gauff told Wire just hours ahead of her big moment. “So many people are coming up to say congratulations, not just from Team USA but from other sports and countries as well. I don’t think it will, until maybe a year from now or something because I think it’s just going to be one of those things like, ‘I can’t believe I just did that.’”
    

            The women’s tennis competition gets started on Saturday and Gauff has drawn Ajla Tomljanović.
    

            The world No. 2 hopes that her play in Paris, along with those of her nearly 600 teammates on Team USA, goes a long way toward uniting a divided nation back home that is currently in the midst of one of the most intense election seasons in recent memory.
    

            “I just hope that me being a person representing Team USA … we all just want to promote positivity through our game, through our sport and through our competing,” Gauff said. “We all just want to show how passionate we are and share that passion with the supporters that we have and hopefully have a lot of success too.”
    

            But as she prepares for her moment in the spotlight leading Team USA down the River Seine in a unique Opening Ceremony, Gauff is trying to focus on what most 20-year-olds want to do: Having fun.
    

            “We just have a great team, the men’s and women’s team, we all get along we all have fun and I definitely think who your teammates are probably makes the biggest difference if you’re going to have a good experience or a bad one,” Gauff told Wire, “and so far, this experience has definitely been a once-in-a-lifetime type thing.”

CNN_68,French sprinter to take part in Opening Ceremony despite not being allowed to wear a headscarf,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/sport/sounkamba-sylla-headscarf-france-opening-ceremony-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-26 00:09:00,world,"
            French sprinter Sounkamba Sylla will now be taking part in the Opening Ceremony at this year’s Olympics, France’s sports minister told CNN, after the runner previously said she would not be allowed to because she wears a headscarf.
    

            “You are selected for the Olympic Games, organized in your country, but you can’t take part in the opening ceremony because you wear a scarf on your head,” Sylla posted on her private Instagram account Sunday, per Reuters.
    

            But in an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour, French sports minister Amélie Oudéa-Castéra said a solution has been found to allow Sylla to take part in Friday’s ceremony.

            “The issue is solved,” Oudéa-Castéra told Amanpour.
    

            Oudéa-Castéra outlined that it had been explained to Sylla that the rule exists based on the French constitution and that she would not be allowed to wear religious or political signs.
    

            “That’s the law and we need to obey by the law, and she understands perfectly that when you’re an athlete representing your country, you need to be exemplary,” the French sports minister explained.
    

            “So what we discussed with her is the fact that she can wear something, but not something that can be assimilated to a religious symbol.”
    

            France has pursued a series of controversial bans and restrictions on items of customarily Islamic dress in recent years.
    

            Last year, the United Nations’ human rights office criticized the French government for banning French athletes from wearing the hijab at the Paris Olympics.
    

            At the time, Oudéa-Castéra argued in favor of “a strict regime of secularism, applied rigorously in the field of sport.”
    

            On Thursday, Oudéa-Castéra said that Sylla and LVMH, who are designing France’s Opening Ceremony outfits, have now found a solution where the sprinter can cover her hair.
    

            “That’s a win-win and we are happy. I always say when you’re benevolent, when you’re constructive, when you’re pragmatic, you can have a solid respect of your rules but while finding the right, you know, avenues, to find solutions,” Oudéa-Castéra added.
    

            The Opening Ceremony takes place on Friday and will be held along the River Seine, marking the first time that the ceremony has not taken place inside a stadium.

Paris 2024 will truly feature an Olympics Opening Ceremony like no other. Here’s everything you need to know about this unique celebration.
    

            The Opening Ceremony for the Paris Summer Games will begin at 7:30 p.m. local time (1:30 p.m. ET) on Friday, July 26, as the first boats depart from the Austerlitz bridge.
    

            It will be available to view in the US on NBC and on will also be streaming on Peacock.
    

            For the first time in Summer Games history, it will be held outside of a stadium. Instead, athletes will this year parade down the city’s famous River Seine on boats.
    

            Going east to west through the city, 10,500 athletes on 94 boats will be ferried down a six-kilometer (roughly 3.7 miles) route that ends in front of the famous Trocadéro, opposite the Eiffel Tower, where the rest of the Opening Ceremony shows will take place, such as the lighting of the Olympic cauldron and the official opening speech from French President Emmanuel Macron.
    

            The boats will pass some of Paris’ most iconic landmarks, including the Louvre and Notre-Dame.
    

            Each boat will also have a camera on board so viewers can feel as if they’re amongst the action with their favorite athletes.
    

            The nations with bigger athlete delegations will have their own boats, while those with a smaller number of athletes will share.
    

            There will be 80 big screens up across the city and “strategically placed speakers,” organizers said, to allow as many fans as possible to watch the event.

            Fortunately for organizers, hundreds of dancers that were threatening to disrupt the Opening Ceremony over pay have called off strike action after reaching an agreement with Paris 2024, according to their union.
    

            On Monday, some 220 dancers stopped a rehearsal along the banks of the Seine to protest inequalities in pay and housing conditions between the dancers.
    

            A representative for the union previously told CNN that the ceremony was “in danger.”
    

            In total, there will be 400 dancers involved and dancers on every bridge along the route.
    

            French theatre director and actor Thomas Jolly is leading the Opening Ceremony and said earlier this year he wants to showcase all of France’s cultures.
    

            “I was overwhelmed at first. I wondered how I could create a show where everyone can feel represented as part of this great union,” he told AP.

CNN_70,"A look at Alpha Kappa Alpha, the legendary sorority repped by Kamala Harris",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/us/aka-alpa-kappa-alpha-kamala-harris-cec/index.html,2024-07-26 01:55:00,us,"
            As long as she’s been on the political scene, Vice President and likely Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has proudly repped the salmon pink and apple green of Alpha Kappa Alpha.
    

            Alpha Kappa Alpha is a historic African American sorority, founded on the campus of Howard University, Harris’ alma mater. It was the first Black sorority of its kind, and is a part of the “Divine Nine,” a group of Black Pan-Hellenic organizations.
    

            Members of Alpha Kappa Alpha and other groups in the Divine Nine have already rallied to support Harris’ bid for the presidency, networking and organizing to raise millions upon millions of dollars for her campaign. Harris is also a frequent presence at high-profile events, including Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.’s biennial convention earlier this month.
    

            The sorority has been a critical source of support and sisterhood not just for Harris, but for the 360,000 some women across the US and the world that make up its ranks. AKA members are political leaders, civil rights activists, literary icons and scientists, and the sorority’s cultural impact has deep, wide-reaching roots.
    

            “When you become a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, you become a member for life,” Danette Anthony Reed, international president and CEO of Alpha Kappa Alpha, Incorporated, told CNN.
    

            Here’s a look at the history of Alpha Kappa Alpha and how it become a force in American society.
    

            Alpha Kappa Alpha, or AKA as it’s familiarly known, was founded more than a century ago with the aim of connecting and empowering Black college-educated women. In the years since, AKA has been a springboard for its members to achieve academic and professional success, as well as leadership development and personal growth. The organization has also facilitates numerous community service initiatives across the country.
    

            Groups like Alpha Kappa Alpha were a natural evolution of Greek life on college campuses. The first fraternities and sororities in the US formed in the late 1700s and 1800s as forums where college students could discuss current events and literature outside their strict curriculums, according to Lawrence Ross, author of “The Divine Nine: The History of African American Fraternities and Sororities.”
    

            Greek life at predominantly White institutions eventually expanded and evolved into social clubs, but it excluded students of color. In the early 1900s, at a time of intense racial segregation and disenfranchisement, African American students at White institutions and historically Black colleges and universities founded the Greek letter organizations that make up the Divine Nine with an additional mission: To uplift each other and all Black people.
    

            “It’s very much centered upon not just the college experience, but the notion that those of us who get college educations have a responsibility — not just to our own selves or our own transformation, but the transformation of our communities,” Ross, a member of the historically Black Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, said.
    

            On January 15, 1908, Ethel Hedgemon — along with Anna Easter Brown, Beulah Burke, Lillie Burke, Marjorie Hill, Margaret Flagg Holmes, Lavinia Norman, Lucy Diggs Slowe and Marie Woolfolk — founded Alpha Kappa Alpha at Howard University as a community of women with shared values and goals. They chose an ivy leaf as their symbol, drafted a constitution and extended invitations to a group of sophomores on campus.
    

            It was the first Black sorority in the country.
    

            “We weren’t allowed to vote. We weren’t allowed to hold certain positions,” Evelyn Sample-Oates, a former international regional director of Alpha Kappa Alpha and a longtime member, told CNN. “These are women that came together because they had the like-minded agenda to gather strong Black women so that we could make a difference.”
    

            To ensure the longevity of Alpha Kappa Alpha, Nellie Quander, along with Norma Boyd and Minnie Smith, led the effort to incorporate the organization in 1913. Over the next decade, AKA grew in strength and numbers — it established new chapters at campuses across the country, held its first Boule and began publishing an official journal called The Ivy Leaf.
    

            As Alpha Kappa Alpha transformed into a national organization over the first half of the 20th century, its members looked to more ambitious goals.
    

            In 1913, Quander wrote to women’s rights activist Alice Paul, imploring her to include Black students from Howard in a women’s suffrage march without discrimination.
    

            Then in 1921, Alpha Kappa Alpha sent a telegram to President Warren G. Harding, urging the administration to back a bill that would have made lynching a federal crime, according to AKA’s website. 


            One of Alpha Kappa Alpha’s most significant and well-known initiatives was the Mississippi Health Project, which was launched during the Great Depression.
    

            From 1935 to 1942, AKA volunteers — led by President Ida Jackson and member Dr. Dorothy Ferebee — traveled to the Mississippi Delta and set up mobile health clinics for rural Black families who lacked access to health care. AKA compiled its observations into a report and elevated it to first lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who became a champion of many AKA initiatives and eventually an honorary member, according to the documentary “Twenty Pearls: The Story of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority.”
    

            Over the years, Alpha Kappa Alpha and its members took on a more prominent role in the fight for social justice.
    

            In 1938, Boyd, an educator and one of AKA’s earliest members, founded a congressional lobbying group to push legislation on issues concerning Black Americans. And in 1939, Alpha Kappa Alpha joined the NAACP as a lifetime member, paving the way for other historically Black fraternities and sororities to formally join in the fight for civil rights.
    

            Another hallmark initiative came in 1965 with the Cleveland Job Corps. For 30 years, Alpha Kappa Alpha operated a federal job training center, equipping numerous Black women with the skills and education needed to place them in jobs.
    

            Today, Alpha Kappa Alpha carries on this legacy of service, awarding millions of dollars in scholarships and grants, fighting food insecurity and building up the next generation of Black leaders, Reed said.
    

            “Whether it’s social activism, advocacy for civil rights, building economic wealth, impacting our communities, we make a positive change,” she added. “And we empower individuals to strive for excellence.”
    

            For all of its accomplishments as an organization, perhaps the most enduring legacy of Alpha Kappa Alpha is the individual contributions and achievements of its members.
    

            Women of Alpha Kappa Alpha have populated the highest ranks of their fields, whether in politics, law, literature or science.
    

Constance Baker Motley was the first female attorney for the Legal Defense Fund and wrote the original complaint in Brown v. Board of Education. The late Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a leading champion of Black American issues in Congress, was an AKA, as was Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison.
    

            Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson — three Black mathematicians who worked for NASA in the 1950s and were at the center of the film “Hidden Figures” — also started out as Alpha Kappa Alphas. NASA astronaut Mae Jemison, the first African American woman in space, repped the pink and green, too.
    

            Many more women were initiated into Alpha Kappa Alpha as honorary members, including civil rights icon Rosa Parks, jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald and director Ava DuVernay.
    

            With the ascension of Vice President Harris, Alpha Kappa Alpha is once again in the spotlight, and its political and cultural power is on full display from flashes of pink and green among Harris supporters to endorsements from fellow AKAs in politics.
    

            “I am 1908% in with you Madam Soror Vice-President!!!!,” Florida Representative Ashley Gantt posted on X after President Joe Biden announced his endorsement of Harris.
    

            AKA is a nonpartisan organization, but like every Greek organization, its members are often politically active. CNN’s Fredreka Schouten reported that Harris’ campaign saw more than 1,500 contributions of exactly $19.08 between Sunday afternoon — when Biden exited the presidential race — and Monday evening, nodding to AKA’s founding in 1908.
    

            Sample-Oates said Harris’ campaign — and the support her sorors have shown her — are a testament to the sisterhood of AKA and what Black women can achieve when they link arms. It’s part of what inspired her to join the sorority about 40 years ago at American University.
    

            “We’ve got a tough role out here in society,” she said. “We’re often underestimated, undervalued, underpaid, and it’s important that we come together and bond on these issues so together we can rise up.”

            An 18-year-old man has been detained on suspicion of killing a former Ukrainian lawmaker, local authorities say, after her fatal shooting in the city of Lviv.
    

            Iryna Farion, 60, died in hospital last Friday after she was shot in western Ukraine, the mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadoviy, posted on Facebook.
    

            A specialist team of Ukrainian security forces and criminal analysts tracked down the suspect on Thursday after 139 hours of investigative work, according to the country’s Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko. Authorities scoured about 100 hectares of forest and identified him using surveillance cameras, the minister said.
    

            “We checked every corner of the shooter’s escape route,” Klymenko posted on Telegram. “Identifying and detaining the offender was a laborious process that required the highest professionalism, endurance and discipline to avoid making any mistakes. I thank the entire team.”
    

            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised his country’s security forces.
    

            “I am grateful to each and every one of them who added more facts to the picture of the crime every day and brought the full truth closer,” he said in a post on Telegram on Thursday.
    

            A former nationalist parliamentarian and professor, Farion was known for her unfavorable attitude towards the Russian language, which is spoken in eastern Ukraine.
    

            The Security Service of Ukraine launched a criminal investigation against the academic last year, after she published a social media post with a screenshot of a message from a pro-Ukrainian student in occupied Crimea, containing the name, surname and other personal data of the sender. That information became the basis for his persecution by the Russian special services.
    

            During the investigation in November, Farion told authorities that she categorically rejected Russian-speaking members of the Armed Forces fighting against Russia’s full-scale invasion, according to Reuters, saying she could not call them Ukrainians.
    

            Her statement triggered a wave of outrage among sections of Ukrainian society.

            Democratic Rep. Jennifer Wexton of Virginia made history Thursday as the first lawmaker to use an artificial intelligence-generated model of her voice to speak for her on the House floor.
    

            “My battle with progressive Supranuclear palsy, or PSP, has robbed me of my ability to use my full voice and move around in the ways that I used to, rather than striding confidently onto the House floor to vote,” Wexton said on the floor through the AI model.
    

            Wexton had announced in September that she will not seek reelection, citing her health challenges, which she said she anticipates will worsen.
    

            “I rely on a walker to get around and in all likelihood before my term ends, I will appear on the House floor for votes in a wheelchair,” she said Thursday.
    

            Wexton is the first member to use an augmentative and alternative communication device on the House floor.
    

            When she first heard the AI rendition of her voice, Wexton called it “music to my ears.”
    

            “It was the most beautiful thing I had ever heard, and I cried tears of joy,” she said.
    

            The congresswoman said her diagnosis “has brought me a renewed sense of determination is the opportunity to use this unique platform to try to help others.”

CNN_73,US indicts North Korean hacker accused of helping extort US hospitals,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/us-indicts-north-korean-hacker/index.html,2024-07-26 02:27:00,politics,"
            The US Justice Department on Thursday announced the indictment of an alleged North Korean government-backed hacker for allegedly participating in a scheme to break into US hospital computer systems and extort them for ransom.
    

            Rim Jong Hyok is part of a group of hackers working for North Korea’s military intelligence agency that uses ransoms collected from health care providers to fund further hacking operations against US government agencies and contractors, the US government alleges.
    

            The hacks of health care providers locked up medical records and disrupted health care services in the US, US officials said. The North Korean hackers’ victims included hospitals in Florida and Kansas, health care firms in Arkansas and Connecticut, and a medical clinic in Colorado, according to the indictment unsealed in the US District Court for the District of Kansas.
    

            The State Department offered a reward of up to $10 million reward for information on Rim.
    

            US, South Korean and British government security agencies also on Thursday released information on the North Korean hackers’ tactics and warned that the hackers were targeting classified and other sensitive information at nuclear, aerospace and other sectors to advance Pyongyang’s military and nuclear programs.
    

            One hack in 2022 carried out by the North Korean group against a US defense contractor led to the theft of reams of sensitive data, including material used in military aircraft and satellites, according to the State Department. Much of the stolen information was from 2010 or earlier, the department said.
    

            North Korean hackers have stolen billions of dollars from banks and cryptocurrency firms over the last several years, providing a key source of revenue for the regime, according to reports from the United Nations and private firms.
    

            Thwarting North Korean hacking and money laundering has become a national security priority for the Biden administration. About half of North Korea’s missile program has been funded by cyberattacks and cryptocurrency theft, a White House official said last month.
    

            CNN previously reported on how South Korean spies and American companies try to intercept cryptocurrency stolen by North Korean hackers. Another CNN investigation identified one cryptocurrency entrepreneur who said his firm had unwittingly sent a North Korean IT worker tens of thousands of dollars.

            A 19-year-old man and two juveniles suspected in a botched carjacking that led to the death of an Ohio woman were in custody Wednesday on murder charges, police said.
    

            Alexa Stakely, 29, saw her SUV being stolen July 11 with her 6-year-old son sleeping inside and was struck by the vehicle while trying to save the child, according to the Columbus Division of Police.
    

            A 16-year-old suspect told police he entered Stakely’s vehicle “and was about to drive off when Stakely appeared in front of the Honda,” according to an arrest report. The suspect says he “panicked” and drove off, hitting the victim, the report said.
    

            Stakely’s son was found unharmed in the vehicle, which had been abandoned near where Stakely was struck. Stakely had briefly left the boy in the vehicle with the engine running to retrieve the child’s belongings from his baby sitter, police said.
    

            The driver turned himself in Wednesday, accompanied by his parents. “It’s my understanding that his parents and his conscience got to him a little bit,” Sgt. Joe Albert told CNN affiliate WBNS.
    

            Another 16-year-old was connected to the car theft and arrested, as was Gerald Dowling, 19.
    

            Dowling’s jail record indicated he was scheduled for a first court hearing Thursday, but did not list an attorney. Court information for the 16-year-old suspects was not immediately available because they are juveniles.
    

            Although only one suspect was in the car at the time Stakely was hit, Albert told WBNS they are all equally responsible for her death under the law.

            “Since they were there as part of the motor vehicle theft, and unfortunately Ms. Stakely died as a result of that motor vehicle theft,” Albert said, “they all get charged with murder.”
    

            Stakely was a speech language pathologist at Winchester Trail Elementary, according to a social media post from Canal Winchester Schools.
    

            Canal Winchester Schools, with whom Stakely had been employed for five years, described her in a Facebook post as “a great mom who was incredibly dedicated to her son.”
    

            The post continued: “Ms. Stakely made a difference in the lives of the students and families she worked with and will be missed by so many in our community and beyond.”

CNN_75,CenterPoint Energy officials apologize after lengthy Houston power outages from Hurricane Beryl,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/us/centerpoint-houston-power-outages-apologize/index.html,2024-07-26 02:19:00,us,"
            CenterPoint Energy executives apologized and promised to do better Thursday after power outages from Hurricane Beryl wreaked havoc for millions across the Houston area earlier this month.
    

            Appearing before the Public Utility Commission of Texas in Austin, the company’s chief executive was apologetic and outlined a series of steps that CenterPoint would take to improve its preparation strategies and response to storms.
    

            “I want to apologize to our customers for the frustration we caused. We will do better. While we cannot erase the frustrations and difficulties so many of our customers endured, I and my entire leadership team will not make excuses,” said Jason Wells, the president and CEO at CenterPoint. “We will improve and act with a sense of urgency.”
    

            Roughly 2.2 million customers lost power after the Category 1 hurricane struck the Houston area on July 8. CenterPoint restored power to 1 million in the first 48 hours and finished restoring power to all remaining customers who are able to receive power on July 20.

            At least 14 Houston-area deaths were confirmed to be hurricane-related, including seven people – ranging in age from 50 to 110 – who died from “heat exposure due to power loss,” according to the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences. Overall, more than 20 deaths in Harris and nearby counties were attributed to the storm, according to the Houston Chronicle and other local media outlets.
    

            The lengthy outages and lack of accurate information amid the scorching summer heat triggered anger and frustration across the city.
    

            Texas Gov. Greg Abbott asked the Public Utility Commission to launch an investigation into CenterPoint and present its findings by Dec. 1. The Texas State Senate is also holding a hearing on Monday on the outages.
    

            Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick blasted the company in a press conference on July 14. “A freight train’s coming. You just heard it. You better be prepared. Whether you’re at the top or any part of management who oversaw this response or preparation, everybody’s job should be on the line,” he said. “We will not and cannot tolerate this.”
    

            Wells, the CEO, and other executives summarized some of the initiatives on Thursday that they will launch to help enhance their communications with the public and efforts to improve from within the company.
    

            The company plans to hire a new senior leader on its executive team to focus on improvements to its emergency and storm response; seek independent analysis from experts; launch a new cloud-based outage tracker after their original one failed for customers; provide daily press briefings after storms; expedite estimated times for restoration to its customers; and improve its alert notifications directly to customers through text, email or phone.
    

            The company only has direct contact information for 42% of its customers, executives said Thursday, citing policies that limit the company’s ability to reach out for more information to reach its customers.
    

            CenterPoint officials said they would also increase their call center staffing by 165% to help reduce wait times for customers calling about their power situations.
    

            “While the thousands on the ground worked incredibly hard to restore power and achieve significant impact in the first 48 hours, it is clear we must continue to enhance the resiliency of our system to support faster restoration times,” said Randy Pryor, a vice president at CenterPoint who served as the incident commander during the storm.
    

            Thursday’s meeting opened with public comment. Savant Moore, a Houston resident and elected trustee for the Houston Independent School District, highlighted some of the struggles faced by the city’s most vulnerable during the power outages – such as seniors depending on oxygen and insulin.
    

            “Electricity was created in the late 1800s, yet we still haven’t figured out power outage solutions,” he said. “What will this board and the government do to protect Texans’ lives from such mismanagement?”

            Commissioners on the Public Utility Commission expressed frustration as well. Commissioner Lori Cobos complimented CenterPoint for outlining some of its plans to improve but said “a lot of what I heard seems like things that y’all should have already been doing.”
    

            Cobos, who toured the area after the storm, called the Houston aftermath “devastating.”
    

            “Your performance will be judged by your actions and the results from those actions,” she added. “Accountability is very important.”
    

            Commissioner Jimmy Glotfelty criticized the company’s admitted statistic that it only has contact information for 42% of its customers.
    

            “You all have equipment on their premises. So they are your customers. And if you don’t have the information to your customers, then that’s your fault,” he said. “And I know you want to change that, and I know, as we’ve restructured this industry, most of the contact has gone to the retail electric provider, you all are still the bread and butter of Houston, Texas, distributing electricity. So I hope you all find a way to become critical to your customers.”

CNN_76,Takeaways from latest GDP report showing US economy is making history,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/economy/takeaways-gdp-economy/index.html,2024-07-26 02:44:00,us,"
            The US economy just got its latest health check, and it looks promising.


            Gross domestic product, which measures all the goods and services produced in the economy, registered at a robust 2.8% annualized rate in the second quarter, after adjusting for inflation and seasonality, the Commerce Department said Thursday. That’s double the 1.4% rate seen earlier this year, and well above the 1.9% rate economists projected in a FactSet poll.
    

            A closer look shows that key parts of the economy improved from April through June compared to the prior three months, despite the highest interest rates in nearly a quarter century and persistent price pressures.
    

            The government’s GDP report isn’t always easy to decipher. Sometimes the headline number masks trends under the surface.
    

            But this time, there’s no mistaking that the American economy is truly on solid footing, from consumers to businesses. It also shows that the economy could pull off an extremely rare “soft landing.” That’s when inflation comes under control without the economy slipping into a recession, something that experts say has only happened once before, during the 1990s.
    

            Here are some key takeaways from Thursday’s GDP release.
    

            Consumer spending accounts for the vast majority of the US economy, about 70% of it. Spending accelerated sharply in the second quarter to an annual rate of 2.3%, up from 1.5% in the first quarter, as consumers spent a bit less on services but much more on goods. Separate data on spending shows that American shoppers are still shopping. Retail sales, excluding purchases at car dealerships, surged last month, including spending at restaurants and bars.
    

            Within the GDP report, there is a specific measure that is a good gauge of consumer demand in the economy, affectionately known as “final sales to private domestic purchasers” (don’t try to say that three times in front of a mirror.) That measure strengthened in the second quarter, rising to a 2.9% rate compared to 2.6% seen earlier this year.
    

            Generally, one risk that comes with an economy that’s expanding robustly is that price pressures can either get stuck or heat up. That’s not what happened in the second quarter. The report showed that inflation slowed from April through June, compared to the prior three-month period, even as economic growth accelerated.
    

            That’s a crucial development for the Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to pare back interest rates from a 23-year high in the coming months.
    

            “Buried deep in this report is good news on the inflation front, the PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) price index dipped below 3%—that’s substantial further progress on the road to a September rate cut,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, in a note Thursday.
    

            The Commerce Department on Friday releases June figures on household income, spending and the PCE price index (the Fed’s favorite inflation measure), though Thursday’s GDP release already offered a sneak peek.
    

            Businesses invested much more in the second quarter than in the first three months of the year.
    

            In fact, the contribution from business investment toward GDP actually doubled in the April-through-June period. The measure for that — known as “nonresidential fixed investment” — rose to a 5.2% rate in the second quarter, up from 4.4% in the first quarter. That was largely driven by a sharp acceleration in spending on “equipment,” which encompasses everything from laptops to milling machines.
    

            This development is important because businesses put their money where their mouths are, so the pickup in this category shows that businesses believe the outlook is good enough to invest in.
    

            “The story all along has been corporate investment. The consumer is healthy, but investment grew almost double digits over the last quarter,” Scott Helfstein, senior vice president and head of investment strategy at Global X, said in a note Thursday. “Companies are investing in automation and digitalization, which will drive margins higher, and valuations will continue to follow.”
    

            The one weak spot in the business investment category was a steep decline in spending on “structures,” or physical buildings, which declined 3.3% in the second quarter, down from the 3.4% gain seen previously. That pullback likely reflects the effects of still-high interest rates.
    

            “Elevated borrowing costs and tight bank lending standards will (continue to) pose headwinds for equipment spending and some facets of structures,” Oren Klachkin, financial markets economists at Nationwide, said in a note. “But we think that tech-related investment will continue to rise.”

            Make sure you’ve got enough pages in your passport, because TIME has just released its list of the world’s 100 greatest places to visit in 2024.
    

            From Costa Rica to Koh Samui to the Republic of the Congo, the team of editors at the New York-based news magazine has selected extraordinary destinations and exciting new experiences travelers need to know about.
    

            CNN Travel spoke to TIME senior editor Emma Barker about some of the trends they’ve seen emerging this year.
    

            This trend isn’t new but it’s certainly huge. Millions of us are choosing our vacation destinations because of how stunning they looked on other people’s TikTok videos or Instagram stories, and we want to go there and get some of that sweet shareable content, too.
    

            Barker points to “these sort of otherworldly art and design places” like Aranya, China. It’s “this amazing, minimalist-design seaside town that a lot of young people in China are going to for its slow pace of life and relaxing ethos” — and because it looks incredible on camera.
    

            “Those kinds of places that result in stunning photography are really popular,” she says.
    

            Gen Z has been sharing its love for wholesome outdoor adventures on social media, and it’s a big trend for travelers at large as well.
    

            Barkers says that when pulling together their list, TIME noticed lots of travel operators offering “a twist on a traditional experience,” such as Natural Selection’s guided cycling safari in Botswana.
    

            Instead of “going on a safari where you’re in a truck and you’re driving through nature, it’s a cycling safari where you’re biking, you’re doing something active, it’s more of a tour.”
    

            Space-related tourism is booming in China and elsewhere and travelers around the world are using their vacations to learn more about our world and our universe.
    

            Barker notes that the recent increase in Antarctic travel has been challenging because “it increases the footprint on a very delicate landscape.”
    

            So for their list they’ve highlighted tour operator White Desert, which has “really set a model for how that tourism can be more sustainable, by partnering with the scientists that are going to Antarctica.”
    

            Tourists share flights with scientists going out to the region and then get the chance to assist the researchers in their work.
    

            “They’re not increasing the number of flights coming in, they’re just kind of piggybacking on what’s already happening with the scientists,” says Barker. “And then the tourists also get to help with that science and learn about the landscape, and how they can protect it.”
    

            The Modern Elder Academy in Santa Fe, New Mexico, focuses on midlife self care.
    

            It’s “kind of like a middle-aged retreat,” says Barker, “which I think is really interesting and fun. It’s kind of like a twist on the wellness retreat.”
    

            The center offers people resources on working through this challenging life period, as well as offering a community where visitors can connect with people going through the same experiences.
    

            CNN Travel recently covered the rise in menopause retreats, while sexual wellness is also a hot trend.

            Voluntourism — where travelers work as volunteers in the regions they visit — “has become a little bit cliched, perhaps, in that it makes you feel good about what you’re doing, but maybe isn’t actually that helpful,” says Barker.
    

            The fresh new take on this theme is regenerative tourism, which is “more about really leaving the landscape and the place better than it was.”
    

            TIME wanted to bring attention to Maui, where West Maui reopened to tourism in November after being devastated by wildfires last summer.
    

            The indigenously-owned non-profit Maui Cultural Lands offer volunteer opportunities that are “legitimately fun,”says Barker. “You’re not wasting your vacation by doing hard labor, although it is work. You’re out in this stunning landscape, planting trees. You have a great time and then go support the local businesses.”

CNN_79,Exclusive: Haley offers no apologies for what she said about Trump during primary and defends choice to back him over Harris,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/nikki-haley-trump-harris-interview/index.html,2024-07-26 04:00:00,politics,"
            Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley offered no apologies Thursday for the “tough things” she said about Donald Trump during their bruising Republican primary fight, but she told CNN’s Jake Tapper she does not doubt her choice to support the former president over presumptive Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the November election.
    

            In her first interview since endorsing Trump and speaking at the Republican National Convention, Haley said President Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the race Sunday did not come as a surprise.
    

            “I wasn’t surprised, and I didn’t take happiness in it,” Haley said of Biden’s announcement. “I think through the whole campaign, I fought for mental competency tests. I wasn’t doing it to be disrespectful. I wasn’t doing it to be mean. I was doing it because I think it’s not just Joe Biden. There is an issue we have in DC, where people will go into office and they won’t let go. And then their staffers and their family keep propping them up, and it’s a problem for the American people.”
    

            Haley added: “I never thought he would make it to the election. I always said a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for Kamala Harris, and I think that’s what’s playing out.”
    

            But Haley – who said during the campaign that the first party “to retire its 80-year-old candidate” would win the election – argued that Democrats’ decision to elevate Harris gave them “the weakest candidate they could put in.”
    

            “She is much more progressive than Joe Biden ever was,” Haley said. “So, the fact they put in Kamala Harris – kudos for putting in someone younger – the fact that you put in one of the most liberal politicians you probably could have put in, it’s going to be an issue.”

What is DEI? Republicans are using the term to attack Kamala Harris, but experts say it’s widely misunderstood


            Haley criticized those Republicans who have gone after Harris as a “DEI” candidate, arguing there are better ways to attack the vice president such as on immigration, fracking and foreign policy.
    

            “It’s not helpful,” Haley said. “There’s so many issues we can talk about when it comes to Kamala Harris that it doesn’t matter what she looks like. It matters what she’s said, what she’s fought for, and the lack of results that she’s had because of it.”
    

            Haley’s comments come in the wake of her decision to endorse Trump and speak at the GOP convention last week following a tumultuous primary, during which she repeatedly attacked the former president as “toxic,” “unhinged” and lacking “moral clarity.” In a wide-ranging interview, Haley brushed aside the rhetoric as just part of a campaign – which included Trump’s attacks on Haley and her husband while he was deployed overseas.
    

            “I said a lot of tough things about him in the campaign. He said a lot of tough things about me in the campaign. That’s what happens in campaigns. I don’t think we need to apologize or take anything back. I don’t plan on doing that,” Haley said.
    

            In May, Haley said she would vote for Trump, sparking backlash from some anti-Trump Republicans who had supported her campaign. Even after she suspended her campaign in March, Haley continued to get a significant share of the vote in subsequent primaries.
    

            Her supporters, Haley argued, “wanted Americans to have a choice for someone they could be proud of.”
    

            “That was what we fought for, that was what we did, and millions joined us,” Haley said. “I wanted what they wanted. We were in it together, and I loved the fight we had together. But we’ve been given a choice. It’s Trump, or it’s Harris. And so, what I did, was I said this is who I would be voting for. I also said I don’t agree with Trump 100% of time, and I don’t expect them to agree with Trump 100% of the time to vote for him. But I wanted them to think about it through my eyes and how I thought about it.”
    

            Asked by Tapper about her previous comments that she didn’t know whether Trump would follow the Constitution if reelected, Haley said: “I hope he does. I hope that any president would follow the Constitution.”
    

            “So, yes, I hope that everything he does is in line with the Constitution, and I hope that Congress enforces that, and I hope that everybody he surrounds himself with enforces that. But I think the American people need to demand it,” she added.
    

            In her interview with Tapper, Haley, who served as US ambassador to the United Nations under Trump, continued to advocate a strong foreign policy, a stance that has put her at odds with the isolationist wing of her party, including Trump’s vice presidential pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance.

            Haley urged both Trump and Vance to stand up to Russia on Ukraine.
    

            “I think there’s a division in the Republican Party on where we should be on foreign policy, especially, you know, we’ve seen that play out with Ukraine,” she said. “What I will tell you is when Russia gets a little bit, they want a little bit more and a little bit more. And so that should send a warning sign to Trump and to Vance to go and show, ‘No, we’re going to stand for America, we’re not going to stand for Russia, and we’re going to stand with Ukraine because that’s the right thing to do.’ I hope they do that.”
    

            But Haley also defended Trump’s record on Russia during his first term.
    

            “I know that Trump kept dictators at bay, and that’s what I hope he will continue to do,” she said. “This is about moral clarity. Standing with Ukraine, standing with Taiwan, standing with Israel, that’s moral clarity. That’s what I want President Trump to have. I will always be vocal about that.”
    

            Haley criticized both Harris and Vance for not attending Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address before Congress on Wednesday. Both were away at other events – Harris is meeting with Netanyahu at the White House on Thursday while Trump is meeting the Israeli leader at Mar-a-Lago on Friday.
    

            “First of all, she was official, she should have been there,” Haley said of Harris, who serves as president of the Senate in her official capacity. “Israel is one of our strongest allies. What does that say to the people of Israel? More importantly, what did you just tell the Iranians? Because they love what they’re getting right now if she won’t even do her official job there.”


            “Should JD Vance have been there? Yes, of course,” she added. “We need to show a united front when it comes to Israel.”
    

            Haley brushed off criticism of her Republican convention speech from former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Trump critic and onetime GOP presidential rival, who said she backed Trump only so she could run for president again and was “unified by her own tortured ambition”
    

            “I think it’s funny coming from a guy who didn’t even play in Iowa and couldn’t even get out of New Hampshire,” Haley said of Christie. “I think he’s bitter to anybody that he’s ever dealt with, and I think it’s comical that it’s coming from a person who, in 2016, literally did that one thing – fell all over himself for Trump – to get a position in an administration, and he still didn’t get it.”
    

            “So, look, I wish Chris well,” Haley said. “I think he’s got a lot of tortured demons inside of him. But I know what I’m doing and why I’m doing it. And everything he said could not be more wrong.”

CNN_80,New York prosecutors say evidence in Trump trial was ‘overwhelming’ and conviction should stand,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/prosecutors-trump-hush-money/index.html,2024-07-26 03:34:00,politics,"
            Manhattan prosecutors said there is no basis to overturn Donald Trump’s conviction in the hush money case after the Supreme Court’s ruling on presidential immunity.
    

            Any error, they argued in a filing Thursday, is “harmless” when viewed against “overwhelming evidence” of the former president’s guilt.
    

            Trump’s lawyers argued his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records should be vacated after the Supreme Court ruled that evidence of a president’s official acts should not be used in a trial. They specifically highlighted testimony from former White House aide Hope Hicks and tweets from Trump’s Twitter account.
    

            Prosecutors with the Manhattan district attorney’s office said the conviction should stand.
    

            “For all the pages that defendant devotes to his current motion, the evidence that he claims is affected by the Supreme Court’s ruling constitutes only a sliver of the mountains of testimony and documentary proof that the jury considered in finding him guilty of all 34 felony charges beyond a reasonable doubt,” prosecutors wrote.

[Breaking news update, published at 3:05 p.m. ET]


            Arson investigators have arrested a man suspected of igniting the Park Fire in California’s Butte County, the district attorney announced Thursday.
    

            The wildfire near Chico ballooned overnight and has charred 45,550 acres.
    

            The 42-year-old suspect was identified after witnesses reported seeing someone “pushing a car that was on fire into a gully near the Alligator Hole in upper Bidwell Park shortly before 3:00 p.m. yesterday,” according to a release from Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey. “The car went down an embankment approximately 60 feet and burned completely, spreading flames that caused the Park Fire.”
    

            The DA says the man was seen “calmly leaving the area by blending in with the other citizens who were in the area and fleeing the rapidly evolving fire.”
    

            The arson suspect’s name has not yet been released. He is being held without bail pending his arraignment which is set for Monday, the DA’s office said.

The largest active wildfire in the United States has scorched almost 270,000 acres in eastern Oregon, as nearly 80 large active wildfires are burning in the US, including a California blaze that exploded in size overnight. Here’s the latest:


• The Oregon fire is 0% contained: The Durkee Fire – which has already burned an area larger than the city of Indianapolis – started on July 17 near the Oregon-Idaho state line. Amid high temperatures, extremely dry vegetation and strong winds, the fire has grown tens of thousands of acres since Sunday and is 0% contained as of Thursday morning.
    

• Durkee Fire threatens nearby communities: Three people were injured and two homes and 12 other structures were destroyed as the fire spread, according to the Oregon Department of Emergency Management. Officials have asked some residents to evacuate. Some communities do not have power, according to Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, who has deployed resources from the National Guard to assist.
    

            • California battles its own blaze: The Park Fire in California has exploded to 45,550 acres – growing 7 times larger just over four hours overnight – and is 3% contained, according to CalFire. The blaze has forced mandatory evacuations in Butte County, where the state’s deadliest wildfire, the Camp Fire, killed more than 80 people in 2018.
    

• Two fires threaten national park in Canada: The flames closing in on the nation’s largest national park from two directions sent visitors and residents fleeing the town of Jasper in Alberta, where buildings are burned. Officials say the losses are significant, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has deployed federal support to help battle the blaze.
    

            Some residents in Northern California’s Butte County were asked to evacuate, as the Park Fire grew nearly 40,000 acres overnight to an area roughly the size of Washington, DC. The fire has burned an average of nearly 50 football fields per minute since it started Wednesday afternoon. Triple-digit temperatures and high wind gusts have fueled the fire’s growth.
    

            There are more than 200 firefighters deployed to fight the blaze, according to CalFire.
    

            The lightning-sparked Durkee Fire is the largest of 31 large wildfires currently burning across Oregon, which has been the hardest hit by fires in recent days.
    

            Officials in Malheur County and Baker County issued evacuations for areas around the Durkee Fire. Meanwhile, dense smoke from the flames impeded traffic on Interstate 84, leading to periodic closure of the freeway.
    

            Kotek called it a “dynamic situation.”
    

            “The wildfires in Eastern Oregon have scaled up quickly,” Kotek said in a news release. “We are facing strong erratic winds over the region that could impact all fires. Rain is not getting through. Some communities do not have power.”
    

            More than 500 firefighters and resources from 22 states are working to fight the fire,  according to InciWeb.

            “We have been at this for a number of days, and those days just seem to keep getting harder and harder with the weather that we’re seeing in our area and the intense fire behavior,” Sarah Sherman of the Bureau of Land Management said in a video update.
    

            Over the weekend and earlier this week, the Durkee Fire exhibited extreme fire behavior, even creating it’s own weather in the form of pyrocumulus clouds.
    

            The clouds form over heat sources due to the intense, upward vertical motion of air cooling and condensing as it moves higher into the sky. They can reach heights of 50,000 feet and generate their own systems of thunderstorms.
    

            If fires burn hot enough, they can create clouds that produce lighting and rain, called pyrocumulonimbus.
    

            “Over the last week, firefighters have been challenged by hot temperatures and gusty winds that continue to push several wildfires across the state,” the Oregon State Fire Marshal said.
    

            Wildfire smoke, including from the Durkee Fire in Oregon, was spreading into Boise and beyond. Air quality alerts have been issued for parts of Colorado, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.
    

            Patrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, told the Associated Press that driving into town Wednesday morning was “like driving into a fog bank, because it’s so thick and low to the road.”
    

            “Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,” Nauman said of the smoke.
    

            A cold front has moved through the area Thursday morning, bringing high temperatures to the 80s on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. A red flag warning, which indicates increased risk of fire danger, has expired.

CNN_83,OpenAI is testing an artificial intelligence search engine,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/tech/openai-artificial-intelligence-ai-search-engine/index.html,2024-07-26 03:32:00,us,"
            OpenAI on Thursday announced its most direct threat yet to its stalwart Big Tech rivals: a search engine that uses artificial intelligence baked in from the beginning.
    

            The company is testing SearchGPT, which will combine its AI technology with real-time information from the web to allow people to search for information in the same way they talk to ChatGPT. While the search engine is currently in an early test for a limited number of users, OpenAI said it plans to integrate the tools into ChatGPT in the future.
    

            With the new feature, OpenAI will be directly competing with Google, which has for years dominated the online search market but has scrambled to keep pace with the AI arms race that OpenAI kicked off when it launched ChatGPT in November 2022. SearchGPT could also pose a threat to Microsoft’s Bing, the also-ran search engine player that last year incorporated OpenAI’s own technology in an effort to better compete with Google.
    

            With SearchGPT, users will be able to ask questions in natural language – the same way they talk with ChatGPT – and they’ll receive answers that they can then follow up on with additional questions. But unlike ChatGPT, which is often reliant on older data to generate its answers, SearchGPT will provide up-to-date information, with online links to what the company says are “clear and relevant sources.”
    

            For example, a demo clip shared by the company shows SearchGPT answering a query about the “best tomatoes to grow in Minnesota” with information about tomato varietals, as well as links to sites like “The Garden Magazine” and “The Gardening Dad.”
    

            The tool will also show a sidebar with additional links to relevant information – not totally unlike the ten blue links users are used to seeing on Google Search results pages.
    

            “Getting answers on the web can take a lot of effort, often requiring multiple attempts to get relevant results,” the company said in a blog post Thursday. “We believe that by enhancing the conversational capabilities of our models with real-time information from the web, finding what you’re looking for can be faster and easier.”
    

This is a developing story and will be updated.

CNN_84,What you need to know about America’s shockingly good economic report,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/economy/takeaways-gdp-economy/index.html,2024-07-26 03:12:00,us,"
            The US economy just got its latest health check, and it looks promising.


            Gross domestic product, which measures all the goods and services produced in the economy, registered at a robust 2.8% annualized rate in the second quarter, after adjusting for inflation and seasonality, the Commerce Department said Thursday. That’s double the 1.4% rate seen earlier this year, and well above the 1.9% rate economists projected in a FactSet poll.
    

            A closer look shows that key parts of the economy improved from April through June compared to the prior three months, despite the highest interest rates in nearly a quarter century and persistent price pressures.
    

            The government’s GDP report isn’t always easy to decipher. Sometimes the headline number masks trends under the surface.
    

            But this time, there’s no mistaking that the American economy is truly on solid footing, from consumers to businesses. It also shows that the economy could pull off an extremely rare “soft landing.” That’s when inflation comes under control without the economy slipping into a recession, something that experts say has only happened once before, during the 1990s.
    

            Here are some key takeaways from Thursday’s GDP release.
    

            Consumer spending accounts for the vast majority of the US economy, about 70% of it. Spending accelerated sharply in the second quarter to an annual rate of 2.3%, up from 1.5% in the first quarter, as consumers spent a bit less on services but much more on goods. Separate data on spending shows that American shoppers are still shopping. Retail sales, excluding purchases at car dealerships, surged last month, including spending at restaurants and bars.
    

            Within the GDP report, there is a specific measure that is a good gauge of consumer demand in the economy, affectionately known as “final sales to private domestic purchasers” (don’t try to say that three times in front of a mirror.) That measure strengthened in the second quarter, rising to a 2.9% rate compared to 2.6% seen earlier this year.
    

            Generally, one risk that comes with an economy that’s expanding robustly is that price pressures can either get stuck or heat up. That’s not what happened in the second quarter. The report showed that inflation slowed from April through June, compared to the prior three-month period, even as economic growth accelerated.
    

            That’s a crucial development for the Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to pare back interest rates from a 23-year high in the coming months.
    

            “Buried deep in this report is good news on the inflation front, the PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) price index dipped below 3%—that’s substantial further progress on the road to a September rate cut,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, in a note Thursday.
    

            The Commerce Department on Friday releases June figures on household income, spending and the PCE price index (the Fed’s favorite inflation measure), though Thursday’s GDP release already offered a sneak peek.
    

            Businesses invested much more in the second quarter than in the first three months of the year.
    

            In fact, the contribution from business investment toward GDP actually doubled in the April-through-June period. The measure for that — known as “nonresidential fixed investment” — rose to a 5.2% rate in the second quarter, up from 4.4% in the first quarter. That was largely driven by a sharp acceleration in spending on “equipment,” which encompasses everything from laptops to milling machines.
    

            This development is important because businesses put their money where their mouths are, so the pickup in this category shows that businesses believe the outlook is good enough to invest in.
    

            “The story all along has been corporate investment. The consumer is healthy, but investment grew almost double digits over the last quarter,” Scott Helfstein, senior vice president and head of investment strategy at Global X, said in a note Thursday. “Companies are investing in automation and digitalization, which will drive margins higher, and valuations will continue to follow.”
    

            The one weak spot in the business investment category was a steep decline in spending on “structures,” or physical buildings, which declined 3.3% in the second quarter, down from the 3.4% gain seen previously. That pullback likely reflects the effects of still-high interest rates.
    

            “Elevated borrowing costs and tight bank lending standards will (continue to) pose headwinds for equipment spending and some facets of structures,” Oren Klachkin, financial markets economists at Nationwide, said in a note. “But we think that tech-related investment will continue to rise.”

            Justice Elena Kagan on Thursday defended the code of conduct the Supreme Court created last year, but conceded there needs to be a way to enforce the rules for it to be more effective.
    

            “I think that the rules that we put out are good ones,” Kagan said at a judicial conference in Sacramento. “I think that the thing that can be criticized is, you know, rules usually have enforcement mechanisms attached to them. And this one, this set of rules does not.”

Supreme Court attempts to address ethics concerns with new code of conduct but leaves many questions unanswered


            After the Supreme Court came under intense scrutiny in 2023 following a series of blockbuster investigative pieces that turned a spotlight on the alleged ethical lapses of several of the justices, the nine justices released an ethics code in November in an attempt to assuage concerns raised by Democratic lawmakers and others that its members had no formal code of conduct they were required to adhere to.
    

            But notably absent from the code of conduct was an enforcement mechanism to hold justices accountable for any violations of the code, leading some court observers to regard it as a toothless Band-Aid for larger ethics issues that have dogged the court. The document leaves a wide range of decisions up to the discretion of individual justices, including decisions on recusal from sitting on cases.
    

            Kagan on Thursday called criticism of the code “fair,” and went on to say that she thought the best enforcers of it for the Supreme Court would be lower-court judges, but not the justices themselves.
    

            “I can’t think of other people who should enforce a code of conduct … against judges. And I think it would be quite bad … for us to do it to each other,” she said. “In other words, for the same judges who are sitting around the table trying to decide cases, to be to be the people who are saying, ‘Oh, no, you broke that rule or you didn’t break that rule.’”

            The comments were made before an audience of judges and lawyers at the 9th US Circuit Judicial Conference, in response to a question. Kagan made the first public appearance of the nine justices since the court wrapped up a historic and contentious session earlier this month in which Kagan and her two liberal colleagues found themselves on the losing side of many of the biggest cases.
    

            “I feel as though however hard it is that we could and should try to figure out some mechanism for doing this,” the liberal justice said. “I have a lot of trust and faith in the chief justice. You know, if the chief justice appointed some sort of committee of, you know, highly respected judges with a great deal of experience, with a reputation for fairness, you know, that seems like a good solution to me.”
    

            Kagan said that she was sharing only her own opinion.
    

            “I’m doing no intimating here,” she said, attempting to dismiss any speculation that she was revealing anything that the court was actively working on. “This is one person’s view and that’s all it is.”

CNN_87,Judge who ordered Trump to pay $454 million says he was ‘accosted’ by lawyer and won’t recuse himself from case,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/engoron-recusal-response-trump-civil-case/index.html,2024-07-26 04:22:00,politics,"
            The judge who found Donald Trump liable for fraud and ordered the former president to pay $454 million said he will not recuse himself from the case.
    

            Trump asked Judge Arthur Engoron to step aside from the case, which is on appeal, alleging he engaged in “prohibited communications” with a real estate lawyer about the case before his decision was rendered earlier this year.
    

            “I am supremely confident in my ability to continue to serve, as I always have, impartially,” Engoron wrote in an order Thursday. The judge said that over three years into the litigation, his recusal would result in “immense prejudice.”
    

            Trump’s lawyers asked for the recusal after NBC published an interview with real estate attorney Adam Bailey the day the verdict was rendered. According to the article, Bailey said he “had the ability to speak to [this Court] three weeks ago…I saw him in the corner [at the courthouse] and I told my client, ‘I need to go.’ And I walked over and we started talking … I wanted him to know what I think [about the case] and why … I really want him to get it right.”
    

            Bailey told CNN that he only spoke with Engoron about his September summary judgment decision “because that’s the only thing I discussed with reporters.” NBC said it stood by its story.
    

            Engoron in Thursday’s ruling said he was “accosted” by Bailey while leaving the courthouse one day in February.
    

            The judge described the “90-second incident” was a “nothingburger” from a “landlord-tenant lawyer ranting” and said that he did not base any part of his rulings on what Bailey said.
    

            “I did not initiate, welcome, encourage, engage in, or learn from much less enjoy, Bailey’s tirade. I did not base any part of any of my rulings on it, as Bailey has outlandishly, mistakenly, and defamatorily claimed,” Engoron wrote.
    

            The judge also said he was unaware of any investigation by the Commission on Judicial Conduct saying he has not been contacted by the review group.

            • California battles northern blaze: The Park Fire in California has exploded to nearly 71,500 acres and is 3% contained, according to CalFire.

            Over the weekend and earlier this week, the Durkee Fire exhibited extreme fire behavior, even creating it’s own weather in the form of pyrocumulus clouds.
    

            The clouds form over heat sources due to the intense, upward vertical motion of air cooling and condensing as it moves higher into the sky. They can reach heights of 50,000 feet and generate their own systems of thunderstorms.
    

            If fires burn hot enough, they can create clouds that produce lighting and rain, called pyrocumulonimbus.
    

            “Over the last week, firefighters have been challenged by hot temperatures and gusty winds that continue to push several wildfires across the state,” the Oregon State Fire Marshal said.
    

            Wildfire smoke, including from the Durkee Fire in Oregon, was spreading into Boise and beyond. Air quality alerts have been issued for parts of Colorado, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.
    

            Patrick Nauman, the owner of Weiser Classic Candy in the small town of Weiser, Idaho, told the Associated Press that driving into town Wednesday morning was “like driving into a fog bank, because it’s so thick and low to the road.”
    

            “Yesterday you could smell it, taste it, it just kind of hung in the back of your throat,” Nauman said of the smoke.
    

            A cold front has moved through the area Thursday morning, bringing high temperatures to the 80s on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. A red flag warning, which indicates increased risk of fire danger, has expired.

            Over the last couple decades, wildfires have increased in number and size, particularly in western states. This is likely due to climate change, which can affect precipitation, wind, temperature, vegetation and other factors that drive wildfires.
    

            These longer, more active fire seasons combined with increased housing have put more homes at risk. One study found the number of houses within wildfire perimeters has doubled since 1990.

            San Diego Padres pitcher Dylan Cease threw the second no-hitter in franchise history in the team’s 3-0 victory over the Nationals in Washington, DC, on Thursday.
    

            The 28-year-old struck out nine but walked three batters. He got Nationals All-Star shortstop CJ Abrams to fly out to right field to secure the no-hitter.
    

            After the final out, teammates mobbed Cease on the pitching mound to celebrate the momentous occasion.
    

            Cease threw 114 pitches, one over his season high.
    

            In a postgame interview, he said team manager Mike Shildt came over to him and said “nice job” while at 95 pitches. Cease then responded that he “felt great” and has thrown more pitches this season.
    

            “Thankfully they let me talk him (Shildt) into it, and here we are,” Cease continued with a smile on his face.
    

            Joe Musgrove threw the franchise’s first no-hitter in 2021.
    

            This is the second no-hitter this season, the first since Houston Astros’ Ronel Blanco threw one in April.
    

            Cease, who was traded to the Padres before the season from the Chicago White Sox, came into Thursday’s game with a 9-8 record and a 3.59 ERA.

CNN_92,Biden and Netanyahu meet with urgency to reach ceasefire deal at top of the agenda,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/biden-netanyahu-meeting/index.html,2024-07-26 05:34:00,politics,"
            President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met at the White House Thursday afternoon, where sources told CNN the president was expected to be as forceful as he has ever been in urging Netanyahu to accept a ceasefire agreement, as US officials believe that a deal may be on the cusp.
    

            “We’re closer than we’ve ever been,” one senior administration official said. “It’s up to the Israelis to accept it.”
    

            Biden’s in-person meeting with Netanyahu followed the Israeli prime minister’s speech to Congress on Wednesday, which sparked protests including instances of antisemitism or pro-Hamas rhetoric in Washington, DC. The White House has condemned such demonstrations.
    

            In brief remarks before the meeting, Netanyahu mentioned how the two men have known each other for four decades. He added: “From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish-American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the State of Israel.”
    

            Biden reminisced about meeting with previous Israeli leaders before making a joke about his age: “That’s how far back it goes. I was only 12 then.” Neither leader responded to shouted questions from reporters.
    

            The meeting, which was Biden’s first with a world leader since announcing he would drop out of the 2024 race, came at a fragile point in their decadeslong relationship. A resolution to end the Israel-Hamas war that began in October now looms large over Biden’s legacy as a one-term president. Progress in the negotiations for a ceasefire have come in fits and starts in recent months, and Biden and his senior national security officials have been closely involved in trying to land the deal.
    

            Biden also participated in a meeting with Netanyahu that includes families of American hostages in Gaza - a separate setting where he could apply firm pressure on Netanyahu to finalize the ceasefire agreement.
    

            “In this setting he will really be held accountable to his commitment of pursuing a ceasefire and hostage deal,” said one US official.
    

            Families of the American hostages have expressed frustration in recent months about the relative lack of outreach from Netanyahu and his office – particularly in comparison to the regular cadence of communication that has come from senior Biden administration officials since the war began.
    

            One family member who attended the Thursday afternoon meeting with Biden and Netanyahu told CNN before the meeting that they hoped the president would use the setting to exert serious pressure on his Israeli counterpart – particularly now that Biden is free from the political burdens of a reelection campaign.
    

            After their meeting with the president and Netanyahu, some family members struck an optimistic tone on the prospects of a deal being reached soon.
    

            “We feel more optimistic than we have since the first round of releases in late November, early December,” said Jonathan Dekel-Chen. “We got absolute commitment from President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu that they understand the urgency of this moment now. And to waste no time. And to complete this deal as it currently stands with as little change as humanly possible.”
    

            When the Biden administration proposed a joint meeting with the families, some US officials did not expect Netanyahu to accept the proposal, two US officials said.
    

            Other US officials believed that Netanyahu would have no choice but to accept the offer, and viewed it as an opportunity to put the Israeli leader in the hot seat in front of both Biden and hostage families amid ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage deal, officials said.
    

            Multiple sources stressed that no major announcement about an agreement is expected on Thursday. However, as CNN reported this week, US and Israeli officials have voiced increased optimism about the prospects of an agreement.
    

            While Biden has remained firmly behind Israel, even as its campaign in Gaza has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, both leaders have traded not-so-subtle barbs in recent months over the future of the war and how Netanyahu has waged it.
    

            Biden has described Israel’s actions in Gaza as “over the top,” threatened to withhold some new arms transfers and repeatedly pressured Netanyahu to scale back and be more precise in his military operation in Gaza – criticism that reached a peak when an Israeli strike killed seven World Central Kitchen workers in early April. The Israeli leader has been steadfast in his position that the war will not end until Hamas is eliminated while accusing the US of withholding weapons from its closest ally – claims that American officials flatly rejected.
    

            Speaking in front of Congress this week, Netanyahu did not substantially address the status of ceasefire negotiations. He instead praised Biden for his “heartfelt support” for Israel after the October 7 Hamas attack while urging the US to fast-track military aid to “dramatically expedite an end to the war.”
    

            “As we defend ourselves on all fronts, I know that America has our back and I thank you for it – all sides of the aisle,” Netanyahu said.
    

            US officials remain sensitive to Israeli politics that may be shaping Netanyahu’s calculations – including, as CNN has reported, the timing of Israel’s parliament going into recess at the end of the month, which would make it harder for right-wing opponents of the deal to move to collapse the government.
    

            The US does not believe, for now, that Netanyahu is standing in the way of or delaying a ceasefire and hostage deal, and believes that progress is being made amid ongoing negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Both the Israelis and Hamas, the official said, have elements they need to agree on before a deal is reached, and not one side is holding up negotiations at this point.
    

            The in-person meeting at the White House will be the first time the two men have met in person since Biden’s trip to Israel last year following the October 7 attack, although the two men have spoken frequently on the phone. It was followed by the meeting with American hostage families, and then Netanyahu met with Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Biden has endorsed to replace him on the top of the Democratic ticket.
    

            Harris welcomed Netanyahu and said they had “a lot to talk about” ahead of their conversation.
    

            The prime minister in his remarks to Congress criticized anti-Israel protesters as “Iran’s useful idiots” and falsely downplayed the role of Israel in causing the ongoing civilian suffering in Gaza.
    

            Biden’s support for Israel’s war had been one his most politically toxic issues within his own party for much of the year, with many of his public campaign appearances being repeatedly interrupted by protesters demanding a ceasefire in Gaza. Biden’s stance toward those protests has been conciliatory – he has repeatedly responded to them by saying that the protesters have a point, and that too many innocent people are dying in Gaza.
    

            But the national conversation surrounding Biden’s handling of Israel’s war took a back seat to the waves of Democratic concern about his ability to beat former President Donald Trump after his faltering debate performance last month. Trump and Netanyahu will meet Friday at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump announced Tuesday.
    

            Last week, Biden spoke extensively about the war in the Middle East for the first time in months – telling a Complex Networks interviewer that he considers himself a Zionist but adding that he’s “done more for the Palestinian community than anybody” while still calling for more aid to reach the Gaza Strip.
    

            “I’m the guy that opened up all the assets. I’m the guy that made sure that – I got the Egyptians to open the border to let goods through, medicine and food,” Biden said. “I have been very supportive of the Palestinians, but Hamas, they’re a bunch of thugs.”
    

            Biden and Netanyahu last spoke during a 30-minute call on July 4, during which both leaders “focused” on details about a possible hostage exchange and ceasefire deal.
    

            A deal was never finalized or assured during that call.

CNN_93,How older Democratic voters are responding to Harris replacing Biden,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/older-democrats-biden-harris-pennsylvania/index.html,2024-07-26 05:30:00,politics,"
            Darrell Ann Murphy is relieved, grateful and newly hopeful Democrats can win Pennsylvania and the White House. But she is also still upset, a little mad even.
    

            “Wow, we’re losing Joe Biden,” said Murphy, 83, a retiree who keeps busy teaching the Chinese tile game Mahjong to fellow seniors. “Joe was us. He was every one of us. He cared so much about the middle class and everyone else of course.”
    

            We revisited Murphy this week at her Easton home, and she assembled the same group for a Mahjong game as she did when we first stopped by five months ago. Then, three of the four women at the table said they believed Biden was up to the job and that criticism of his age was unfair. This time, all four said the 81-year-old president was doing the right thing by stepping away from the campaign.
    

            “Surprise and relief” was how Catherine Long characterized her reaction. Long said she believes it was the president’s decision in the end, but added, “I didn’t like how people were telling him to get out of the game.”
    

            Mary Ann Horvath also used the term relief and “much less anxiety.”
    

            We included these voters in our All Over the Map battleground state project because they are all above the age of 70, members of the country’s most reliable voting demographic and residents of one of its bellwether presidential counties. The project’s goal is to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of key voters — and what we heard, then and now, about their takes on the Biden age issue was telling.
    

            The debate was the decisive moment.
    

            “It was sad,” Horvath said.
    

            But all of our Northampton County voters also told us they saw things in the weeks, even months, before the June debate that gave them pause: incomplete thoughts, mixing up names, slower and stiffer movements.
    

            “I know how things can change when you’re older,” Murphy said. “Past 80, things can change on a dime.”
    

            The mood among Democrats here is suddenly very different. Before Biden’s decision, morale was low and losing seemed inevitable. Now, the energy is palpable, even though Democrats here understand Kamala Harris faces a tough challenge in Pennsylvania.
    

            “I don’t think a lot of men will vote for Harris,” said Pamela Aita, the one conservative voter in the Mahjong group. “I just don’t. … I just don’t think a majority of men are ready for a female president.”
    

            Murphy, though, voiced confidence that Harris in 2024 will fare better than Hillary Clinton 2016. Times have changed, she believes. And so have the issues that are front and center.
    

            “Reproductive rights. Come on, women,” Murphy said. “Here we are after Roe v. Wade. Here we are. … I think her age is, is really so important. You know, she’s, she’s at the perfect age. She’s committed, she’s vigorous. And overwhelmingly the women I talked to are, ‘let’s go, let’s go.’’’
    

            Murphy was not alone in our group to suggest Harris would improve her Pennsylvania odds by choosing Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro as her running mate.
    

            “I think he is incredibly smart,” Murphy said. “Very modest, understated guy. … He is focused like a beam when he wants to do something. I think he would be the perfect balance.”
    

            Local civil rights activist Marvin Boyer is a lifelong Easton resident who knows Northampton County well. The reaction to Harris, he said, convinced him she has a chance.
    

            “It also re-energizes this strong constituency of the Democratic Party – meaning Black females,” Boyer said in an interview at an Easton museum where he was instrumental in assembling the Black history exhibit. “There seems to be a great deal of support, a groundswell of support for her candidacy.”
    

            High Black turnout in Easton and Bethlehem is critical. Those two cities are the deep blue parts of this county. It takes just a short drive north or west to find Donald Trump flags dotting the lawns and homes.
    

            “Just the other day I was riding down one of the main streets and the guy drives by with a truck with an American flag and a F-Biden flag flying,” Boyer said. “The anger is something else that is very troubling, and the divisiveness is problematic.”
    

            Boyer is an independent but votes Democratic most of the time. He was loyal to Biden. He is excited about Harris.
    

            “One of the things I felt was lacking with the candidate, the Democratic candidate is being more assertive,” Boyer said. “When you are running against a candidate like Trump, you can’t be milquetoast, you can’t be middle of the road. You have to be aggressive. Because he’s coming after you. And I think she’s up to the challenge in that regard.”
    

            Boyer knows his innate optimism is about to be tested.
    

            “There’s still racism, misogyny in this country in 2024, no question,” he said. “Will we overcome it with this election enough that she can be elected? I hope so.”
    

            We put the same question to Larry Malinconico, a geology professor at Lafayette College: Is America ready to elect a woman of color as its president?
    

            “I hope so,” Malinconico said in an interview in the classroom where we first met him in February. “I’m a little nervous about that. … It’s an extremely big test. It will be incredibly exciting or incredibly disappointing come November.”
    

            The early buzz gives him optimism. Malinconico said his wife contributed to the Democrats as soon as news of Biden’s Harris endorsement broke. Students, too, he believes will rally around Harris. Younger voters were a giant crack in Biden’s coalition.
    

            “We don’t want Donald Trump as president,” Malinconico said. “And there’s an acceptable choice now. When before I think there was real skepticism about the viability of President Biden for another four years.”
    

            On our first visit, Malinconico said he had friends and colleagues who raised questions about Biden’s ability to do the job. Back then, he said he did not share those doubts, but that Biden needed to prove them wrong. But his opinion began to change over the spring, and the debate sealed it.
    

            “I initially thought, let’s be fair here,” Malinconico said. “Someone who is in their early 80s could be perfectly viable as a candidate as president of the United States. But as things were going on, you really have to start to question okay, what’s happening here. And as somebody who has seen, for example, my father go through an eventual decline to the point where I was asked to take over his affairs, I sort of recognize this. The time had come, and you don’t take over the affairs of the president, you have someone else do the job.”
    

            Still, he said he was confident Biden could finish his term now that he didn’t also need to deal with the rigors of a campaign.
    

            Malinconico very much hopes Harris and Trump reach agreement to debate.
    

            “I think that she should be able to push his buttons.”
    

            Pat Levin for months bristled at the Biden age conversation.
    

            She is a few weeks away from turning 95, is sharp as a tack, a vigorous and eager participant in pilates classes she jokes help keep her vertical.
    

            Performance, not age, is Levin’s test. And she sadly came to the conclusion that a president she admires can no longer pass it.
    

            “I love him. I think he has been just wonderful,” Levin said. “But he is definitely impaired in terms of his thinking, in terms of his presentation, in terms of his energy. He’s just not up to it.”
    

            Her advice to Harris is telling – so many voters who were loyal to Biden are now blunt about what was missing.
    

            “She needs to get out there,” Levin said. “Get into those into those swing states, show her enthusiasm and her stamina and her strength and be able to communicate strongly. She’s a very intelligent woman. She’s got a lot of confidence. She’s got a lot of stamina.”
    

            Biden was born in Pennsylvania. He won here in 2020 in part because he performed better than Hillary Clinton among white working-class voters. Democrats here understand Harris has work to do there, or in finding a different winning coalition.
    

            “It doesn’t look too good right now,” Levin said of the Pennsylvania odds. “But I think she can turn it around.”
    

            Levin tells anyone who seeks her advice that sure, inflation and immigration matter, but there is something more fundamental at stake.
    

            “It’s democracy,” she said. “This might be our last free and fair election. If we don’t win it. We cannot afford to lose this election for the American people.”
    

            Levin traces her political activism back to Franklin Roosevelt’s third term – the mid 1940s – as “just a kid, a really young kid.” Now, she is preparing to vote in her 19th presidential election, a record that traces back to just after World War II.
    

            She has seen a lot. But nothing like switching candidates with little more than 100 days left, in a contest where she sees the stakes as so consequential.
    

            “No, I’ve never experienced anything like this,” she said. “I’ve never seen anything like this.”

CNN_95,"Hollywood’s videogame performers to go on strike over AI, pay concerns",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/media/sag-aftra-video-game-performers-strike/index.html,2024-07-26 05:33:00,us,"
            Video game voice actors and motion-capture performers have called a strike over failed labor contract negotiations focused around AI-related protections for workers, bringing about another work stoppage in Hollywood.
    

            The SAG-AFTRA has called a strike of the Interactive Media Agreement that covers videogame performers, effective July 26, the union said on Thursday.
    

            The decision follows months of negotiations with major videogame companies including Activision Productions, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Take-Two Interactive, Disney Character Voices and Warner Bros Discovery’s WB Games.
    

            The Interactive Media Agreement expired in November 2022 and was being extended on a monthly basis during the talks.
    

            “Although agreements have been reached on many issues important to SAG-AFTRA members, the employers refuse to plainly affirm, in clear and enforceable language, that they will protect all performers covered by this contract in their AI language,” the union said in a statement.
    

            The SAG-AFTRA also represents the film and television actors who went on strike in July last year over concerns of inadequate safeguards against artificial intelligence (AI), putting Hollywood in the midst of two simultaneous work stoppages for the first time in 63 years.
    

            Apart from AI protections, the SAG-AFTRA’s most pressing issues in the contract negotiations for videogame performers are higher pay, medical treatment and breaks for motion capture performers.
    

            SAG-AFTRA is seeking wage increases for videogame performers, saying their pay has not kept pace with inflation, and pursuing more protections for the motion-capture performers who wear markers or sensors on the skin or a body suit to help game makers create character movements.
    

            “We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations. We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions,” said Audrey Cooling, a spokesperson for the videogame producers party to the Interactive Media Agreement.
    

            The offer presented to the SAG-AFTRA features AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA, Cooling said.

CNN_96,OpenAI is taking on Google with a new artificial intelligence search engine,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/tech/openai-artificial-intelligence-ai-search-engine/index.html,2024-07-26 05:31:00,us,"
            OpenAI on Thursday announced its most direct threat yet to its stalwart Big Tech rivals: a search engine that uses artificial intelligence baked in from the beginning.
    

            The company is testing SearchGPT, which will combine its AI technology with real-time information from the web to allow people to search for information in the same way they talk to ChatGPT. While the search engine is currently in an early test for a limited number of users, OpenAI said it plans to integrate the tools into ChatGPT in the future.
    

            With the new feature, OpenAI will be directly competing with Google, which has for years dominated the online search market but has scrambled to keep pace with the AI arms race that OpenAI kicked off when it launched ChatGPT in November 2022. SearchGPT could also pose a threat to Microsoft’s Bing, the also-ran search engine player that last year incorporated OpenAI’s own technology in an effort to better compete with Google.
    

            With SearchGPT, users will be able to ask questions in natural language – the same way they talk with ChatGPT – and they’ll receive answers that they can then follow up on with additional questions. But unlike ChatGPT, which is often reliant on older data to generate its answers, SearchGPT will provide up-to-date information, with online links to what the company says are “clear and relevant sources.”
    

            For example, a demo clip shared by the company shows SearchGPT answering a query about the “best tomatoes to grow in Minnesota” with information about tomato varietals, as well as links to sites like “The Garden Magazine” and “The Gardening Dad.”
    

            The tool will also show a sidebar with additional links to relevant information – not totally unlike the ten blue links users are used to seeing on Google Search results pages.
    

            “Getting answers on the web can take a lot of effort, often requiring multiple attempts to get relevant results,” the company said in a blog post. “We believe that by enhancing the conversational capabilities of our models with real-time information from the web, finding what you’re looking for can be faster and easier.”

AI tools make things up a lot, and that’s a huge problem


            The OpenAI search engine could cement generative AI — technology that can create original text, as well as other types of media — as the future of finding answers online, after Google and others have experimented with early efforts to incorporate chatbots and AI-generated answers into the search experience. But that future is not assured, given AI tools’ propensity to confidently assert false information with no indication that it may be incorrect or misleading.
    

            OpenAI’s new tool comes after Google in May rolled out new AI-generated summaries to top some search results pages so users don’t have to click through multiple links to get quick answers to their questions. Google quickly pulled back on use of the feature after it provided false, and in some cases totally nonsensical, information, in response to some users’ queries.
    

            The rollout of Google’s tool also raised concerns among some news publishers, who worried that the AI summaries could cannibalize their web traffic by removing the need for users to visit their sites to get information — and similar concerns could arise with OpenAI’s search engine.
    

            However, OpenAI said Thursday that it partnered with publishers to build the tool and give them options to “manage how they appear” in SearchGPT’s results. It added that sites can appear in SearchGPT even if they’ve opted out of having their content be used to train the company’s AI models.

CNN_97,Justice Elena Kagan says Supreme Court’s code of conduct needs an enforcement plan. Takeaways from her wide-ranging comments.,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/kagan-supreme-court-ethics-sacramento-conference/index.html,2024-07-26 06:58:00,politics,"
            Justice Elena Kagan on Thursday defended the code of conduct the Supreme Court created last year, but conceded there needs to be a way to enforce the rules for it to be more effective.
    

            “I think that the rules that we put out are good ones,” Kagan said at a judicial conference in Sacramento. “I think that the thing that can be criticized is, you know, rules usually have enforcement mechanisms attached to them. And this one, this set of rules does not.”

Supreme Court attempts to address ethics concerns with new code of conduct but leaves many questions unanswered


            After the Supreme Court came under intense scrutiny in 2023 following a series of blockbuster investigative pieces that turned a spotlight on the alleged ethical lapses of several of the justices, the nine justices released an ethics code in November in an attempt to assuage concerns raised by Democratic lawmakers and others that its members had no formal code of conduct they were required to adhere to.
    

            But notably absent from the code of conduct was an enforcement mechanism to hold justices accountable for any violations of the code, leading some court observers to regard it as a toothless Band-Aid for larger ethics issues that have dogged the court. The document leaves a wide range of decisions up to the discretion of individual justices, including decisions on recusal from sitting on cases.
    

            The comments were made during a wide-ranging conversation before an audience of judges and lawyers at the 9th US Circuit Judicial Conference, in response to a question from one of the event’s moderators.
    

            Kagan made the first public appearance of the nine justices since the court wrapped up a historic and contentious session earlier this month in which Kagan and her two liberal colleagues found themselves on the losing side of many of the biggest cases.
    

            Here’s a roundup of Kagan’s comments:
    

            Kagan on Thursday called criticism of the code of conduct “fair,” and went on to say that she thought the best enforcers of it for the Supreme Court would be lower-court judges, but not the justices themselves.
    

            “I can’t think of other people who should enforce a code of conduct … against judges. And I think it would be quite bad … for us to do it to each other,” she said. “In other words, for the same judges who are sitting around the table trying to decide cases, to be to be the people who are saying, ‘Oh, no, you broke that rule or you didn’t break that rule.’”

Biden to push for Supreme Court ethics reform, term limits and amendment to overturn immunity ruling, sources say


            In order to do this, Kagan suggests Chief Justice John Roberts look elsewhere in the federal judiciary.
    

            “I feel as though however hard it is that we could and should try to figure out some mechanism for doing this,” the liberal justice said. “I have a lot of trust and faith in the chief justice. You know, if the chief justice appointed some sort of committee of, you know, highly respected judges with a great deal of experience, with a reputation for fairness, you know, that seems like a good solution to me.”
    

            Kagan said that she was sharing only her own opinion.
    

            “I’m doing no intimating here,” she said, attempting to dismiss any speculation that she was revealing anything that the court was actively working on. “This is one person’s view and that’s all it is.”
    

            Kagan’s criticism of the court on Thursday was not limited to its new code of conduct. She also expressed frustration with the large number of concurrences her colleagues have been issuing in cases, which she described as “not a good thing for the court.”
    

            “It prevents us, I think, from giving the kind of guidance that lower courts have a right to expect, that the public has a right to expect. It muddies the waters of our decisions,” she said.

Takeaways from the Supreme Court’s decision upholding the domestic violence gun ban


            Kagan specifically pointed to the court’s decision in US v. Rahimi, a major Second Amendment case the court decided earlier this year in which the majority upheld a federal ban on domestic abusers having guns. Though the ruling was 8-1, with Roberts writing for the majority, a flurry of separate writings from many members of the court were also issued.
    

            “Everybody sort of tries to spin it one way or another way,” she said. “Often people use separate opinions to pre-decide issues that aren’t properly before the court and that, you know, may come before the court in a year or two and sort of to try to give signals as to how lower court should decide that, which I don’t think is right.”
    

            “There are definitely times where separate opinions make sense,” Kagan continued, noting that she wrote one this session. “I think all the time we’re in a position where we look at the majority opinion and we say, ‘Not the way I would have written it.’ But I think we should have a higher threshold for saying, ‘But it’s, you know, it will do. It’s OK enough, I agree with it enough. And the world doesn’t need to hear my separate thoughts on like a better opinion that could have been written.’”
    

            Kagan also made clear that she was growing impatient with the increased use of the court’s emergency docket, in which the court can issue unsigned and unexplained orders that allow the justices to act on a case while also shielding the legal analysis behind the decision and the vote count.


            Use of the emergency, or shadow, docket increased dramatically during the Trump administration, where the Justice Department used the docket to seek relief in cases that affect wide swaths of the country and that would have usually been decided by the justices following the normal process. Under President Joe Biden, GOP-led states and other private litigants have used the docket in challenges to various federal actions, often forcing the court to hear the merits of the disputes.
    

            “Because we granted a number of them and in the early years of the Trump administration, I think it encouraged people to keep bringing these kinds of petitions for emergency relief from us,” Kagan said.
    

            There are currently several matters pending on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket, including some challenging the Biden administration’s key student loan repayment program and the new rules issued by the Department of Education under Title IX, which prohibits sex discrimination in schools that receive federal funding.
    

            Those pending petitions, Kagan said, make the court work much more even as they have added fewer argued cases to their docket in recent years.
    

            “One of the great things about our calendar was that it was spaced out so that we would have a break before we sort of went back to the hothouse of decision making. And just the relentless, you know, bringing of these emergency petitions makes that not the case anymore,” she said.
    

            The justice went on to say that the court may have learned “a good lesson” this session when it agreed to hear oral argument in an abortion dispute that arose from its emergency docket only to later say it had improperly granted review in the matter.
    

            “And that may be as a good lesson for us to sort of say as to some of these emergency petitions, ‘No. Too soon, too early. Let the process play out,’” she said.
    

            Though Kagan and her two liberal colleagues eked out wins in disputes over abortion rights and a federal prohibition on domestic abusers having guns, they were left to pen dissents in cases concerning former President Donald Trump’s claims of presidential immunity, the power of federal agencies and whether cities can ticket homeless people for sleeping outside.

How the Supreme Court’s blockbuster ‘Chevron’ ruling puts countless regulations in jeopardy


            Kagan, who was appointed to the bench in 2010 by then-President Barack Obama, penned the dissent on behalf of her two liberal colleagues in the case this session that significantly curbed the power of federal agencies to approve regulations.
    

            Reading portions of her dissent from the bench last month, she denounced the “massive shock” that her conservative colleagues had delivered to a 40-year-old system in which courts gave deference to agencies when reviewing regulations for everything from the environment to public health and the workplace.
    

            On Thursday, she stressed that it’s unclear to her how the court’s overturning of the so-called Chevron precedent will play out in the coming years.
    

            ”So I think that there’s going to be a fair bit of instability, and there’s going to be some courts in some circumstances really putting a thumb on the scales for the agency, and others not,” she said.
    

            The Supreme Court has long been viewed as an institution above the usual deep division that exists in Washington, with justices on opposite ends of the ideological spectrum frequently touting their ability to maintain warm personal relationships.
    

            The late Justices Antonin Scalia, a conservative icon, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the court’s leading liberal for decades, famously enjoyed visiting the opera together and traveling together despite their deep disagreements about the law.
    

            But asked on Thursday whether she thought collegiality is important for the court, Kagan made clear that while she saw it as important, it shouldn’t ultimately matter to the public.
    

            Measuring how well the nine get along should not be in how often they go to the opera together, she reasoned.
    

            “I can’t imagine why the public should care if we go to the opera together, or we can talk about baseball together,” Kagan said.
    

            “What the public should care about is … if the collegiality brings about a certain kind of decision-making process. In other words, if it leads to people listening to each other in talking about the law and in talking about cases and making decisions,” Kagan said. “If it leads to people being able to step into each other’s shoes and see the world through another person’s eyes or see certain legal issues through a different perspective.”

CNN_98,"California top court upholds ballot measure treating Uber, Lyft drivers as independent contractors",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/business/california-supreme-court-uber-lyft-drivers-independent-contractors/index.html,2024-07-26 06:35:00,us,"
            California’s top state court on Thursday upheld a measure approved by voters allowing app-based services such as Uber and Lyft to consider drivers in the most populous U.S. state as independent contractors rather than as employees entitled to greater benefits.
    

            The ruling by the California Supreme Court is a major victory for the ride-hailing industry, which has said that many companies would end or limit service in the state if they were forced to treat thousands of drivers as their employees.
    

            The court dismissed a lawsuit by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and four drivers who say the 2020 ballot measure known as Proposition 22, which preserves drivers’ contractor status while granting them some benefits, was unconstitutional.
    

            Uber in a statement said that the ruling upheld “the will of the nearly 10 million Californians who voted to deliver historic benefits and protections to drivers, while protecting their independence.”
    

            SEIU California Executive Director Tia Orr said the union was disappointed by the ruling, but that rideshare drivers could continue to fight for their rights by seeking to unionize.
    

            “Gig workers are determined to ensure fairness in the gig economy and won’t stop fighting to win greater workplace rights and protections on the job,” she said.
    

            Whether gig workers should be treated as employees or contractors is a crucial issue for the ride-service industry. Employees are entitled to minimum wage, overtime pay, reimbursements for expenses and other protections that do not extend to independent contractors, who can cost companies up to 30% less, according to several studies.
    

            Uber, Lyft and other app-based services spent more than $200 million on a campaign to pass Prop 22, which they say allows drivers to continue earning money while enjoying the flexibility of part-time gig work.
    

            Passed in November 2020 by nearly 60% of voters in California, Prop 22 allows app-based transportation services to classify drivers as independent contractors if they are paid at least 120% of the minimum wage while passengers are in the car and receive expense reimbursements and subsidies to pay for health insurance.
    

            A state appeals court last year rejected SEIU’s argument that Prop 22 improperly limited the legislature’s exclusive power to regulate the state’s workers’ compensation system by barring app-based drivers from receiving those benefits, which are only granted to employees. The California Supreme Court on Thursday agreed.
    

            California is just one front in a nationwide legal battle over the classification of gig drivers and other contract workers.
    

            Minnesota lawmakers passed a measure in May that would set a minimum wage of $1.28 per mile and 31 cents per minute for gig drivers, replacing a higher minimum adopted by Minneapolis that spurred Uber and Lyft to threaten to cease operating in the city.
    

            In June, Uber and Lyft agreed to adopt a $32.50 hourly minimum wage for drivers in Massachusetts and pay $175 million to settle a lawsuit by the state claiming they improperly treated drivers as independent contractors. A proposal that would allow app-based drivers to unionize will go before voters in the state in November.

            Former Kansas City Chiefs defensive lineman Isaiah Buggs has been found guilty in an Alabama court of animal cruelty charges, Tuscaloosa County court records show.
    

            Buggs was arrested in May and charged with two counts of misdemeanor animal cruelty.
    

            He was sentenced on July 19 to “365 days of hard labor for Tuscaloosa County” and ordered to serve 60 days with credit from July 16, 2024, court documents show.
    

            “It is hereby ordered and adjudged that the execution of the remaining 300 days be suspended for 2 years, pending the behavior of the defendant,” the judge’s order states.
    

            Buggs cannot possess or be around firearms and shall not own dogs or cats, it adds.
    

            He has appealed the sentencing.

            “There was no guilty plea in the dog abuse case. Per District Court rules, he pled not guilty but stipulated to the underlying facts so the judge could find him guilty and he could appeal for the right to have a jury trial. He was released from jail on bond. The trial will be set in the future,” Buggs’ attorney Greg Gambril told CNN.
    

            Buggs’ agent Trey Robinson said he had no comment at this time.
    

            Buggs also has a pending domestic violence case in the county stemming from an arrest in June. At the time of that arrest, his agent told the NFL Network that Buggs “vehemently denies” the animal cruelty allegations, adding that the dogs didn’t belong to him. Robinson also said his client was being targeted as part of an ongoing “subversive campaign” to force the closure of a hookah lounge he owns in Tuscaloosa.
    

            The domestic violence case is scheduled for a preliminary hearing in August.
    

            Buggs was drafted in the sixth round of the 2019 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was also a member of the Las Vegas Raiders and Detroit Lions before signing with the Kansas City Chiefs, where he was on the practice squad. He received a ring after the team won Super Bowl LVIII earlier in 2024. He was later released and is currently a free agent.

            Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday touted her “unwavering” support for Israel while saying she told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu it is time to get a ceasefire “deal done,” adding that she “will not be silent” about the suffering in Gaza.
    

            Her remarks provided one of the clearest explanations yet of her views on the conflict as she warned Netanyahu’s government that it matters how the war is conducted.
    

            “There has been hopeful movement in the talks to secure an agreement on this deal. And as I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu it is time to get this deal done. So to everyone who has been calling for a ceasefire, and to everyone who yearns for peace, I see you and I hear you,” Harris told reporters in remarks after the meeting.
    

            Recalling the details the US-backed deal proposed, Harris said that “it is time for this war to end and end in a way where Israel is secure, all the hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can exercise their right to freedom, dignity and self-determination.”

            Four days into the most consequential week of Kamala Harris’ political life, she confronted the most fraught foreign policy issue facing the country by looking directly into the eyes of an Israeli prime minister who decided not to even give her a passing name check in his address to Congress Wednesday afternoon.
    

            Up until now, Harris has been defined by working for President Joe Biden, arguably the most explicitly pro-Israel American president, even though his relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu has frayed.
    

            But now that she’s the presumptive Democratic nominee, Harris has to define what kind of president she wants to be — on this and every other issue, while Biden remains at the White House trying to nail down a Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal and with some around him thinking that restarting the normalization of relations with Saudi Arabia could be a top legacy project for the remainder of his term.

Harris says she told Netanyahu to get ceasefire deal done while pledging ‘unwavering’ support for Israel


            Harris didn’t preside over Netanyahu’s speech to Congress on Wednesday, instead choosing to stick with a pre-scheduled trip to a sorority event in Indiana, as antisemitic protests erupted near the US Capitol where fences were put up like in the days following the January 6, 2021, riot.
    

            But after her meeting with the prime minister Thursday afternoon, she laid out what she wanted to be a very clear position, speaking to reporters in a way she has not done after previous meetings with foreign leaders.
    

            Harris started by recalling a history of connection to Israel that dates back to her childhood collecting money to plant trees there, and she ran through her work in the administration. She has, she said, “unwavering commitment” to Israel, its right to exist and its security.
    

            She called Hamas a “brutal terrorist organization.” She read the names of the American hostages still being held, and those who have died in captivity.
    

            “Israel has a right to defend itself,” she said, “and how it does so matters.”
    

            And the toll on the Palestinians matters, she said, as she called for everyone involved to push for a hostage release and ceasefire deal, and eventually, a two-state solution.
    

            “What has happened in Gaza over the last nine months is devastating,” she said. “We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies, we cannot allow ourselves to be numb. And I will not be silent.”
    

            Harris is trying to clear up uncertainty about her position toward Israel, which has left even people who have talked in depth with her about it responding with pauses when CNN has asked whether, for example, she would have done the same as Biden in sending some, and halting other, weapons to Israel.
    

            And her remarks follow a statement on Thursday condemning the protests around Netanyahu’s speech in Washington as unequivocal: “I condemn any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organization Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate the State of Israel and kill Jews.”
    

            Change is coming, predicted Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee who has been critical of Israel in this period and observed Harris’ foreign policy thinking when they served on the Senate Intelligence Committee together.
    

            “President Biden brought to the White House a lifelong relationship with Bibi Netanyahu and a very mature history on the US-Israel relationship,” Murphy said. “This certainly seems to be a moment for a reconsideration of the relationship and for some fresh thinking on how to approach an Israeli political landscape that is lurching further to the right than we could have ever imagined.”
    

            Murphy added, “I think we would all benefit from getting a fresh set of eyes on this conflict and the way that the United States could try to create a viable Palestinian state.”
    

            But Harris has so many different pulls on her that an aide did not give a direct answer when asked if the vice president considers herself a Zionist — a term Biden again proudly embraced just weeks ago.
    

            That’s a reflection of how much Zionism, which for a century meant believing in the right of a Jewish homeland to exist, has been co-opted by anti-Israel forces, who argue it has come to symbolize colonialism and the killing of Palestinians.
    

            It’s also a reflection of the difference in thinking and rhetoric between the Democratic Party’s new standard bearer and a president who has made allegiance with Israel one of his defining positions for 50 years in national politics.
    

            “The vice president has been a strong and longstanding supporter of Israel as a secure, democratic homeland for the Jewish people. She will always ensure Israel can defend itself from threats, including from Iran and Iran-backed militias such as Hamas and Hezbollah,” said Harris’ deputy national security adviser Dean Lieberman when asked if she considers herself a Zionist. “One can criticize specific policies of the government of Israel while still strongly supporting the state of Israel and the people of Israel. And that support for Israel in no way conflicts with the vice president’s strong view that the Palestinian people deserve freedom, dignity, and self-determination.”
    

            Many close observers see a sign of where Harris’ inclinations are in her choice of Phil Gordon to be her national security adviser. A former Obama administration official, Gordon in 2016 co-authored a report for the Council on Foreign Relations, which, seven years before the October 7 attacks, begins: “The U.S. relationship with Israel is in trouble.” The root of the problem, the authors wrote, is that while America and Israel used to agree on the threats to Israeli security and what to do about them, now those threats have become broader and more complicated, and the opinions about how to tackle them have too.
    

            Gordon has traveled to the region since October 7, holding meetings separate from the ones that Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan and others have been having.
    

            One official who has been deeply involved with Biden administration policy on Israel said that Harris’ differences will actually be key to keeping the overall relationship from getting worse.
    

            “She’ll be able to communicate with another generation. She has the ability, because of who she is, to be enormously helpful to us who care deeply about Israel and how we’re going to get through this disaster,” said the official. “She is the future of the relationship between us and Israel.”
    

            Aides and allies who have talked with Harris – from her Senate days up through her being on the line for nearly every conversation Biden has had with Netanyahu – insist that substantively there is little daylight between her and the president.
    

            The difference is rhetorical, but that difference, they say, is very important. She has been concerned since right after October 7 both about expressing empathy for the Palestinians and about thinking of what the political reverberations could be back home from the way Biden hugged Netanyahu close, figuratively and then literally on his trip to Israel two weeks after the attacks.
    

            It’s the explanation, aides involved tell CNN, for the fury that erupted from the West Wing in March about the way Harris punctuated prepared text that both decried the “humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza and thoroughly condemned Hamas. She built up to her reading of “there must be an immediate ceasefire,” taking a long pause, then adding the rest of the approved sentence: “for at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table.”
    

            Many Democrats outside the White House are making optimistic guesses that she aligns with them.
    

            “Like most Americans, the vice president falls within the pro-Israel mainstream—somewhere between the ‘Greater Israel’ far right and the ‘Free Palestine’ far left,” said Rep. Ritchie Torres, a New York Democrat who has positioned himself as one of the most stalwart defenders of Israel. He added that he expects that position to translate into being for a two-state solution, keeping up security aid and Iron Dome funding for Israel and supporting the Trump administration-negotiated Abraham Accords.
    

            For all the Biden speeches that had to be paused as protesters were removed from the rooms, Harris’ first week effectively on the top of the ticket hasn’t seen such an interruption so far. That doesn’t mean the politics of this are settled.
    

            Abbas Alawieh – a delegate who won a spot at the Democratic convention because he represents some of the 730,000 people who voted “uncommitted” in Michigan’s Democratic primary – told CNN on Wednesday that he remains “very curious how she will differentiate a Gaza policy.”
    

            Alawieh said he’s hopeful. At the very least, he thinks that the party under Harris’ leadership will no longer make him and others aligned with him feel “neglected, ignored—and in some cases maligned,” as happened on a Tuesday night call of state delegates when another person told him to shut up when he tried to speak.
    

            The Michigan Democratic Party chair condemned that behavior in an email to delegates.
    

            Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition released an online ad on Wednesday repeatedly referring to Harris by a mispronounced version of her first name and falsely claimed that she “sided with the pro-Hamas demonstrators” and snubbed Israel by not attending Netanyahu’s speech to Congress.
    

            Trump also accused her of this, saying at a rally in North Carolina that “she’s running away from Israel” and “totally against the Jewish people” for not going. Neither the ad nor the candidate mentioned that Ohio Sen. JD Vance also skipped the speech, though he had no other public schedule, with campaign spokesman Jason Miller telling CNN he “has duties to fulfill as the Republican nominee for vice president.”
    

            Harris’ connection to these issues is more than policy. It touches second gentleman Doug Emhoff’s daughter, who has been noticeably active on pro-Palestinian causes since October 7. It has come up at Seder dinners at the Naval Observatory. And more than anything, it is rooted in the second gentleman.
    

            Emhoff has talked at length about feeling a sense of duty, not just when he became the first Jewish spouse of a vice president or president, and channeling that into helping develop the administration’s strategy to combat antisemitism. He’s also talked about how much pain he felt personally after October 7.
    

            Halie Soifer, the CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, recalled a trip to Jerusalem she took with Harris and Emhoff in 2017, when she was working in the California Democrat’s new Senate office. She still has photos of Harris taking out a traditional kippah head covering for Emhoff when they visited the Western Wall.
    

            Soifer said she is satisfied that Harris remains committed to Israel — even after being read the indirect answer about whether the vice president considers herself a Zionist.
    

            And Emhoff has stressed that even as this campaign picks up, he is going to keep talking about Judaism and Israel, as he has throughout this administration with his wife’s encouragement.
    

            On a quickly organized Zoom call Wednesday afternoon hosted by the Jewish Democratic Council of America and Jewish Women for Kamala, where he made made a surprise appearance, Emhoff started by reiterating Harris’ unwavering support for Israel.
    

            But he also told the story of not being with his wife on Sunday when the news broke about Biden exiting the race, dropping a little Yiddish by blaming “this flight mishigas” that had him stuck in Los Angeles.
    

            Then he made a promise to the 1,700 people listening: “I’m going to keep living openly like a Jew and maybe there will be a mezuzah on the White House, like there is on the vice president’s residence.”
    

This story has been updated with Harris’ remarks following her meeting with Netanyahu.

CNN_102,"Missouri lawsuits allege abuse by priests, nuns; archdiocese leader in Omaha among those accused",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/25/us/missouri-lawsuits-allege-abuse-priests-nuns/index.html,2024-07-26 07:33:00,us,"
            Sixty people allege in new lawsuits filed in Missouri that they were abused as children by dozens of priests, nuns and others, and the man who now leads the Archdiocese of Omaha, Nebraska, is among the accused.
    

            Five separate lawsuits seeking unspecified damages were filed this week in St. Louis and neighboring counties. All told, the lawsuits name 56 alleged abusers. The suits seek unspecified damages.
    

            Among those named is Omaha Archbishop George Lucas. A lawsuit filed Wednesday in St. Louis County Circuit Court said the unnamed accuser was 16 when he met Lucas at the now-closed St. Louis Preparatory Seminary in the late 1980s, where Lucas was a priest and dean of education. The lawsuit accused Lucas of sexually abusing the boy multiple times and offering better grades for sexual favors.
    

            Lucas, in a statement on Thursday, strongly defended himself.
    

            “I categorically deny the accusation made by an anonymous person,” Lucas said. “I have never had sexual contact with another person. I referred the matter to the apostolic nuncio, Pope Francis’ representative in Washington, DC, for his guidance.”
    

            The lawsuits allege abuse dating as far back as the 1940s, and as recent as 2015. David Clohessy of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, said at least 10 of the alleged abusers are still alive, and he expressed concern that they could abuse again. Some of those named have previously been convicted of crimes or named in previous civil cases.
    

            In one case, a lawsuit alleges that both a priest and a nun sexually abused a girl with an intellectual disability from 1999 through 2002, when she was 8-12 years old. The lawsuit said the priest threatened to kill the girl if she resisted. When she went to another school from 2002 through 2004, she was abused by another priest, the lawsuit said.
    

            The lawsuits also name the Archdiocese of St. Louis and its current archbishop, Mitchell T. Rozanski, alleging that St. Louis church leaders have “known of the sexual abuse perpetrated upon its young parishioners and children in the community” without stopping it.
    

            “This shameless cover-up spanned decades and allowed various clergy and other employees to access and sexually abuse numerous children,” the lawsuits state.
    

            Messages were left with the Archdiocese of St. Louis.
    

            In 2019, the Archdiocese of St. Louis released the names of 61 clergy facing what it determined to be “substantiated” allegations of sexual abuse of children. The investigation in St. Louis followed the release of a 2018 report in Pennsylvania that cited the abuse of more than 1,000 children by hundreds of priests since the 1940s and the efforts of church leaders to cover it up.

CNN_103,Researchers discover site of 1893 schooner wreck in Lake Michigan in just 50 feet of water,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/margaret-muir-schooner-shipwreck-lake-michigan/index.html,2024-07-26 07:40:00,world,"
            The November 1975 shipwreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald is probably the most famous one of the Great Lakes, thanks to Gordon Lightfoot’s hit ballad. But a new discovery is putting another ship – the Margaret A. Muir – on the map.
    

            An intrepid team of maritime historians working with the Wisconsin Underwater Archeology Association recently located the schooner that was lost to a fierce gale on the morning of Saturday, September 30, 1893.
    

            The Muir – a 130-foot, three-masted ship built in 1872 – was found under about 50 feet (15 meters) of Lake Michigan water off Algoma, Wisconsin, according to a WUAA news release.
    

            It sank only a few miles off the entrance to Algoma Harbor, according to the release. It went undetected for more than a century despite hundreds of boats passing over it each fishing season.
    

            Maritime historian Brendon Baillod, who found the ship on May 12, 2024, along with teammates Robert Jaeck and Kevin Cullen, said it’s a significant archaeological discovery.
    

            “One of the things that’s important about this wreck is that it’s opened up – we call it ‘filet of schooner’ – where the deck came off and then the sides opened up. And we can see the architectural construction details of how a 19th-century Great Lakes wooden vessel, a schooner, was built,” he told CNN Travel.
    

            “This is almost like somebody architecturally dismantled it to show you exactly how it was built,” he said. In addition, all its deck gear remains, including two giant anchors and hand pumps.
    

            This is not too unusual in the Great Lakes, whose cold, fresh waters often provide an environment for preservation, according to the University of Buffalo.
    

            Altogether, these commercially vital waters are estimated to hold the remains more than 6,000 ships going back to the 17th century, creating a mysterious and fascinating lore of which the Muir is a part.
    

            Like other working ships of the late 1800s, the Margaret A. Muir was part of the booming maritime trade economy of the Great Lakes, which had access to the Atlantic Ocean via the St. Lawrence Seaway.

            “This was … the engine that fueled the Industrial Revolution in America. All the raw goods – the copper, the iron ore, the lumber that built our cities came out of the Great Lakes via this huge freshwater freeway,” Baillod said.
    

            The Muir “was intended primarily for the Great Lakes grain trade, although it carried many diverse cargoes, frequenting all five Great Lakes over her 21-year career,” according to the release.
    

            On that calamitous day when the Muir’s labors ended, Capt. David Clow reported the schooner, carrying a load of salt, had cleared the Straits of Mackinac and was making its way to the Wisconsin coast. According to the release, a 50-mile-per-hour gale struck at about 5 a.m.
    

            The ship was holding up to the sudden storm well until about 7:30 a.m. when the waves increased dramatically, with some breaking over its decks.  The vessel was nearing Algoma (back then called Ahnapee) when Clow discovered several feet of water in the hold.
    

            Reports said he “immediately ordered the crew to abandon ship.  No sooner than the order was given, the ship lurched violently and plunged for the bottom, taking Captain Clow’s faithful dog and ship’s mascot with it,” according to the WUAA release.
    

            Fortunately for the crew of six, they were able to make their way through 15-foot seas to the safety of shore. Townspeople spirited the freezing and soaked crew to a hotel and gave them dry clothes.
    

            The loss of his faithful pooch was tough for Clow, though. He was reported as saying that “I would rather lose any sum of money than to have the brute perish as he did.”
    

            The loss of the Muir was covered by major Great Lakes newspapers such as the Chicago Tribune, Detroit Free Press and the Plain Dealer of Cleveland.
    

            In a roundup of “Marine Notes” on October 4, 1893, the Tribune reported the survivors had arrived in Chicago, and “had lost everything except what they had on.”
    

            It also quoted Clow as saying, “I have quit sailing for the water seems to have no liking for me.” It’s understandable that he felt the lakes had turned on him. In the previous sailing season, the Tribune wrote that Clow had run the schooner A.P. Nichols on rocks at an entrance to famed Green Bay.
    

            Demonstrating how treacherous this line of work could be, the Free Press reported the gale that took down the Muir claimed other ships as well, resulting “in a long list of wrecks being added to the remarkably heavy marine losses of the present season.”
    

            The Margaret A. Muir eventually became just another name, another footnote in the vast sea of Great Lakes shipwreck history. It might have remained that way if not for the efforts of Baillod and his team.
    

            Baillod grew up on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, and his fascination with a couple of wooden hulks in Lake Superior near his house sparked a lifelong interest in the maritime history of the Great Lakes.
    

            About 30 years ago, Baillod began compiling a database of Wisconsin’s missing vessels, he said. The Muir stood out to him as one that had a good possibility of being found.  He graded the ships on factors such as accurate accounts from survivors of where a ship went down.
    

            “The Margaret Muir was in the top 10 because I had a very good account from her captain, and I also had really good accounts from the local newspapers because her masts were breaking the surface after she sank and she was a hazard to navigation,” Baillod said.  “She was sort of in the way of the harbor mouth a few miles out. So I had a strong inkling that I could find her.”
    

            In 2023, Baillod approached the WUAA about undertaking a search for the Muir. A year later, it all came together.

            Baillod and his team struck gold at the very end of the very first day of looking.
    

            It was “around 4 o’clock. And as we’re pulling up the sonar, the darn wreck crawls across the screen, we caught her in the last 30 seconds that we could have.
    

            “We were very excited to find her because we had done all this research, like I had done genealogies of the captain and of the builders and the owner and I had traced her entire career,” he said. “So it was really exciting to actually find the physical remains of the vessel itself on the bottom.”
    

            Within weeks, thousands of high-resolution images of the site were made, the release said.
    

            The WUAA is now working to nominate the site for the National Register of Historic Places. If it’s accepted to the register, it would join the schooner Trinidad, which the team located in deep water off Algoma in June 2023.
    

            “The reason we look for these wrecks is we want to share them with the communities of Wisconsin because these are some of the last tangible hooks that these communities have to their maritime history,” Baillod said.

NYT_1,Newsom Will Order California Officials to Remove Homeless Encampments,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/us/newsom-homeless-california.html,2024-07-25 21:00:00,,"Gov. Gavin Newsom will order California officials on Thursday to begin dismantling thousands of homeless encampments, according to officials in his administration, calling on government leaders to act on a recent Supreme Court decision “with urgency and dignity.”
The executive order, which is expected to affect tens of thousands of people, represents the nation’s most sweeping response to a June ruling that gave governments greater authority to remove homeless people from their streets.
Homeless encampments have vexed California, where housing costs are among the nation’s highest, more than any other state. An estimated 180,000 people were homeless last year in California, the most in the nation, and about 123,000 homeless people on any given night were unsheltered, according to the most recent count. Unlike New York City, most jurisdictions in California do not guarantee a right to housing.
Governor Newsom will instruct California cities and counties on how best to ramp up enforcement on a signature issue of his administration. He also will mandate that state agencies not simply move campers along, but also work with local governments to house people and provide services into which the state has pumped billions of dollars.“The state has been hard at work to address this crisis on our streets,” Mr. Newsom said in a statement.
“There are simply no more excuses,” he added. “It’s time for everyone to do their part.”
Mr. Newsom, who is widely viewed as having presidential aspirations, has channeled about $24 billion into homelessness since he took office in 2019. His administration says it helped move more than 165,000 homeless people into temporary or permanent housing two fiscal years ago, the most recent period for which data is available.

NYT_2,Trump and His Allies Adapt to a New Role: Fighting for Attention,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/us/politics/trump-gop-kamala-harris.html,2024-07-25 17:03:00,,"For the first time since Donald J. Trump was indicted in the spring of 2023, he has lost his grip on the news cycle and — temporarily at least — his message. Instead of commanding morning-to-night media attention, the former president and his allies suddenly find themselves reacting to their opponents.
It’s an unfamiliar experience for Mr. Trump, who has monopolized America’s televisions, newspapers and smartphones for more than 12 months through indictments, primary victories, 34 felony convictions, an assassination attempt and a Republican National Convention at which he was celebrated as a quasi-religious figure.
In the three days since President Biden announced he was quitting the 2024 race, Mr. Trump has entered foreign territory. He has been largely crowded out from “earned media,” or organic news coverage that spreads rapidly among voters and costs campaigns nothing to produce. And his message has been, for the moment, scrambled as Democrats have replaced an old, frail white man with a younger Black woman who is campaigning energetically and giving new life to the Democratic base.
Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Mr. Biden endorsed on Sunday and around whom Democrats rapidly coalesced, has enjoyed a political hot streak that Mr. Biden’s advisers could have only dreamed of during the 2024 campaign.She has brought in more than $120 million in new donations. She has already drawn bigger crowds than he ever did this election season. She has electrified TikTok and put a jolt into Democrats’ volunteer efforts, especially among Black voters and women. And, unlike Mr. Biden, she is receiving blanket news media coverage that is, so far, overwhelmingly positive.
The Trump team was not unprepared. They had planned for the possibility of Mr. Biden’s dropping out, produced anti-Harris videos and tested her vulnerabilities in private polls. But they were still somewhat surprised when Mr. Biden actually did it. Some of Mr. Trump’s advisers thought he seemed too stubborn — “too Irish,” one aide said — to buckle to the pressure to quit a race against a man he viscerally hated and believed he was best positioned to defeat.

NYT_3,Homicides in U.S. Continue to Fall from Pandemic Highs,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/us/homicides-crime-report.html,2024-07-25 17:03:00,,"Homicides in the United States are continuing to dramatically decrease from the surge in violent crime in the first years of the coronavirus pandemic, according to an analysis released on Thursday by the nonpartisan Council on Criminal Justice.
The sharp decline began in 2023, with one of the largest yearly drops in homicides, and the decrease has continued over the first six months of this year, the council found in its analysis, which is based on about three dozen cities.
Of the dozen crime categories analyzed, only one showed an increase in the first half of this year: shoplifting. The surge in reported shoplifting — it was up 24 percent over the first half of the year in the 23 cities for which the council was able to obtain data — comes amid debates around the country, especially in California, about what to do about retail theft.
The analysis cautioned that more investigation was needed to determine how much of the recorded increase reflected a rise in actual shoplifting, and whether any of it was driven by retailers being more likely to report the crime.But ordinary Americans have become increasingly frustrated by so many products being locked away on store shelves, and outraged by so-called smash-and-grab robberies that are captured on surveillance video and widely shared on social media.
On the matter of violent crime, not only have many offenses fallen sharply this year, especially homicide — which is down 13 percent this year — but they are now at levels not seen since before the pandemic in the cities that the council studied.

NYT_4,Two Uvalde Police Officers to Enter Pleas Over Shooting Response,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/us/uvalde-shooting-police-arraigned.html,2024-07-25 17:03:00,,"Two years after one of the nation’s deadliest school shootings, one of the two police officers who face criminal charges over the delayed police response was scheduled to be arraigned in court on Thursday.
Adrian Gonzales, who was one of the first officers to arrive at the scene of the May 2022 shooting in Uvalde, Texas, was expected to enter a formal plea to charges stemming from his failure to confront the gunman before backup arrived.
Pete Arredondo, the former school district police chief, who was identified in various investigations as the effective incident commander, waived his right to attend the hearing and entered a plea of not guilty in court filings.
The two officers — among more than 370 who were involved to some degree or another in the police response that day — were indicted by a grand jury on charges of abandoning and endangering a child, the first criminal charges to stem from the shooting and its aftermath.The shooting occurred on May 24, 2022, when a teenage gunman armed with an AR-15-style rifle made his way into two connected classrooms at Robb Elementary School and terrorized fourth-grade students and their teachers. Meanwhile, police officers from a variety of agencies waited outside in the hallway. Some 77 minutes elapsed before a tactical team, led by federal Border Patrol agents, confronted and killed the gunman.
Mr. Arredondo has said that he had considered the gunman to be no longer an active shooter but a barricaded subject, and that he had focused on safely evacuating nearby classrooms until a team with sufficient armament could storm the gunman’s location.

Thousands of firefighters and emergency personnel have been deployed in the region. The growing blazes have raised fears of a repeat of last year, when record wildfires in Canada blanketed cities as far south as Florida with dangerous smoke and haze.
There were 40 active wildfires, none of which were under control, in Oregon and Washington covering more than 870,000 acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Many fires are exhibiting “extreme fire behavior,” the center said.In Northern California, the authorities issued evacuation orders for parts of Tehama County and Butte County, where a fire had started in Bidwell Park, a large recreational area with hiking and biking trails and swimming holes, in the city of Chico. It had grown to cover more than 45,500 acres early on Thursday, from almost 6,500 acres late Wednesday. The authorities in Oregon issued air quality warnings for several counties, saying that the wildfires and strong winds could combine to raise pollutants to unhealthy levels. There were similar warnings in effect in parts of Washington and Idaho, with residents in the affected areas advised to limit their time outdoors.
The Durkee fire in Oregon, near the border with Idaho, is the largest wildfire in the United States, covering almost 240,000 acres as of Wednesday, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.In Canada, there were 175 active wildfires on Wednesday in the province of Alberta, where thousands of people have been under evacuation orders since last week.The fires forced the evacuation of Jasper National Park on Monday. On Wednesday evening, a blaze swept into the town of Jasper, setting several buildings on fire. The Fairmont Jasper Lodge, a well-known resort in the town, was on fire, according to CBC Radio, Canada’s national public broadcaster.
The local authorities said most of the remaining firefighters were being evacuated because of safety concerns. In a post on X, the park authorities said that several had stayed behind to protect the town’s wastewater treatment plant, communications infrastructure and facilities for an oil pipeline that passes through the park to the Pacific Coast.
Mike Ellis, Alberta’s minister of public safety and emergency services, said on social media that he had asked the military for help.
The authorities in Calgary, Alberta’s largest city, issued a health advisory saying smoke from the wildfires was expected to cause very poor air quality. The government of British Columbia, the province west of Alberta, also warned of poor air quality."
WaPo_1,"He was a basketball pro. Now, he’s a chef feeding the Olympic Village.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2024/07/25/paris-olympics-food-chef-alexandre-mazzia-athletes/,2024-07-25 21:45:02.702650,,"MARSEILLE, France — On a recent Tuesday, nearly a dozen people were milling in and out of AM, the three-Michelin-star restaurant of chef Alexandre Mazzia. The restaurant was closed, though you couldn’t tell from the level of activity in the kitchen. The chef’s fleet of staff was preparing ingredients for some of the dishes that have made Mazzia famous: trout roe and wild salmon in a smoky, hazelnut milk or lemon-geranium langoustines with a seaweed popcorn.Presiding over the whirl of activity was Mazzia, who at 6-foot-4 towered over the room. The 47-year-old former pro basketball player has a disarming smile and the demeanor of a coach. He talked frequently about the importance of teamwork in the kitchen, and — like a good coach — he seemed aware of everything happening around him. At one point, he jumped up from our interview with an “excusez-moi” to open the door for a sous-chef carrying metal trays and plastic tubs.The bustle of the restaurant is a good fit for the frenetic atmosphere of Marseille, an ancient port city more than 400 miles south of Paris whose varied reputation in France includes its stunning natural gorges, fresh fish and drug trafficking. (Marseille is often described simply as “gritty.” Or “sulfurous,” according to one French radio station.)The Mediterranean Sea is a short walk from AM, and Mazzia’s signature style includes lots of local seafood and vegetables, often spiced, roasted and smoked. His fresh, clean approach — coupled with his background in professional sports — made him a natural choice for his next challenge: cooking for the athletes descending on Paris this month for the Olympic Games.He and two other French chefs (Amandine Chaignot and Akrame Benallal) are designing and executing menus for 15,000 athletes in the Olympic kitchen, which is  open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In addition to the chefs’ menus, a caterer will provide 40 entrees daily, plus a salad bar, a grill, a cheese cart, a boulangerie, a hot bar, a dessert bar and a fruit stand. All told, the Olympic kitchen expects to serve 40,000 meals per day for the Games. It’s a unique challenge, especially for a three-star chef such as Mazzia, who’s used to cooking for people who live to eat, rather than people who eat to compete. There’s an added challenge for the Paris Olympic Games: France is renowned worldwide for its cuisine, so serving the dry chicken breast and brown rice of athletic training meals would be seen as a kind of national shame.“These people think of food as fuel, that’s for sure, but fuel needs to be fun,” Mazzia said. “For me, it wasn’t a question of constraint, but of playing the game and thinking, ‘How we can bring something joyful and fun to the athletes?’”The way Mazzia talks about his menu for the athletes almost makes it sound like a sport, one in which he’s trying to perform his best while also representing his country to the world. “The challenge was to highlight the products of our local region, in our own way — but above all, to bring in the imprint of our kitchen to the athletes.”Mazzia’s style is not old-school French, with its focus on butter-heavy sauces such as the classic béchamel or hollandaise. For the first 15 years of his life, he grew up in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, where his French parents lived as expats.The area he grew up in is called the Côte Sauvage, which translates to the “Wild Coast,” and it lived up to its name. Mazzia remembers seeing surfers riding massive waves and hammerhead sharks swimming in the turquoise water. He and his school friends sometimes played with stingrays. Because of the oppressive midday heat, classes were held in the morning and in the late afternoon. In between, Mazzia went to the beach, where he liked to watch the fishing canoes hauling in their fresh catch each day.Food is woven into his memories. On weekends, his family would head to the coastal village of Diosso, outside the city. After a full day of playing in the water, he and his family would eat grilled and spiced meat and fish or mafé, a thick tomato-peanut stew of chicken or beef, spiced with chile peppers and aromatics. Even now, he says, a good barbecue takes him back to his childhood. And then there was the fresh fruit: perfectly ripe mangoes and papayas to pair with meals or to eat raw as a dessert.When his family returned to France, the culture shock was extreme for 15-year-old Mazzia. He had gone from school days spent partly at the beach to the strict regimen of a Jesuit boarding school outside of Paris. As he was tall for his age, he started playing basketball, which became a safe haven. “It was more than a refuge,” Mazzia recalled. “I got to know a brotherhood of some pretty incredible people.”Mazzia said he loved the accountability of being on a team, how he found himself being relied upon by others and being able to rely on them in the same way. “You had this responsibility to make baskets, not for yourself but for the team. So you’re quickly in this system of work, of performance.” After finishing school, it was an easy transition to start playing professional basketball as a shooting guard, first for a team in Marseille and then in nearby Avignon.Mazzia likes to clarify that he’s not a basketball player who became a chef; he thinks of himself as a “cook who played some basketball.” Incredibly, for many years, he was doing both. He landed his first restaurant job at the Vénitien Prestige in Paris suburb Rueil-Malmaison in 1995 at age 19, before going on to train at the Parisian establishment Fauchon under the legendary pastry chef Pierre Hermé. “I was lucky enough to meet chefs who listened to me, allowing me to do both,” Mazzia said. “It was intense. I didn’t get any special treatment from either side.”Since then, he had trained in other Michelin-starred restaurants but also cooked in retirement homes and for corporate catering. By 2007, he left his basketball team in Avignon, and in 2014, he opened AM in Marseille, racking up three Michelin stars over the following decade. It is Mazzia’s ability to straddle both worlds — haute cuisine and professional sports — that made him such a natural choice to cook for the Olympians.Mazzia has spent nearly two years researching, brainstorming and consulting nutritionists and sports medicine doctors to devise his menu for the Paris Olympics. He, of course, focused on lean protein and nutrient-rich vegetables, but there were also surprises along the way. Rice, he learned, isn’t necessarily the best fuel for athletes, as its nutritional quality depends on its origins and the way it’s processed, which is too difficult to control on a large scale, he said. So he chose to avoid rice and flour for his Olympics menu.He asked himself almost existential questions in his research and drafting of recipes. For instance: “How can we make green beans, which are not very rich, more gourmet — but, above all, have a more exhilarating depth of taste?” The resulting dish is a green bean risotto of sorts, with a blackberry and black currant vinaigrette.The menus Mazzia landed on put a twist on some of his favorite ingredients in the restaurant, such as white fish and chickpeas. One recipe is adapted from a classic dish served in AM, tweaked to be healthier for the athletes. It’s a spiced hake with tapioca in a vegetable broth, cooked to keep the juicy, nutritional qualities of the fish intact.There’s also an herbaceous chickpea pomade with peas and smoked fish milk. It’s similar to a hummus made with verbena water, as well as peas and beets reduced for their residual sugar. He’s also planning a mackerel dish, a fatty fish rich in iron and vitamin B, served with grilled broccoli shoots.In brainstorming his menus, Mazzia said, he was thinking about food as fuel and food as part of the recuperation process — after all, some of the athletes will be eating his meals after they’ve competed. (In any event, his meals sound infinitely tastier than the late-night pizzas Mazzia would eat after big basketball games.) There’s also the fact that a runner’s nutritional needs are different from those of a wrestler or a gymnast. It’s a tall order, especially considering the 200 nationalities represented at this year’s Games, each coming with their own food cultures and personal tastes.As France’s second-largest city, Marseille will play a special role in the Games, hosting the Olympic sailing competition and some of the soccer matches. In May, when the Olympic Torch Relay arrived in Marseille from Greece, Mazzia was part of the all-star lineup of torch bearers.The chef talks about his menu as a good host would: in terms of joy and comfort. Many of the athletes likely won’t get to visit much of France other than its stadiums, and Mazzia’s cuisine seeks to bring out his personal terroir, he said. The word shares the same root as terre, meaning earth in French, and it signifies not just what grows in the ground in a certain region but also the local flavor. For Mazzia, that’s the fresh seafood and vegetables of southern France as well as the spiciness and smokiness of the food from his childhood in Congo. “Above all, it was a question of trying to make people happy,” he said.That shines through in his cooking — and in the way he talks about food. Despite all the lavishness and artistry required to earn one Michelin star — much less three — it’s clear that Mazzia is thinking not about more than Jackson Pollock-ian plating. He spoke often of trying to communicate something to the people who eat his creations, whether it’s the diners in the 24 seats at AM or the 15,000 athletes eating from the Olympic kitchen.The Olympics set out to promote “excellence, respect and friendship” in the world, and Mazzia’s approach includes an aspect of friendship, even family. He spoke warmly of what he ate at his grandparents’ house as a kid: the first fresh eels of the season, caught by his fisherman grandfather, the French toast made over the heat of the fireplace, or the comfort food his grandmother cooked at the brasserie she ran on Île de Ré, an island off the western coast of France. There’s a hint of that homey feel to his Olympics menus.When I first asked him to describe his signature style, he struggled for words. Eventually, he settled on a simple definition.“It’s really a cuisine of the soul,” Mazzia told me. Soon enough, several thousand of the world’s best athletes will get to take a bite and see for themselves."

Dungeons n’ Drafts at Atlas Brew Works
The age-old hardship of Dungeons & Dragons fans is finding people willing to dedicate an evening to playing the role-playing game in person. Dungeons n’ Drafts, an events organizer that hosts D&D “one-shots,” or one-session games, up and down the East Coast, is solving that problem.

But the Folger also wants you to wind down the week with an opportunity to explore its gardens. This Friday has a Cuban theme, with the salsa sounds of the Gerardo Contino Band coupled with dance lessons and demonstrations by D.C. Casineros.

Previous Industries at Songbyrd
Previous Industries is composed of three Chicagoans residing in LA.

D.C.’s homegrown Broccoli City Festival has a new venue in 2024, swapping the RFK Stadium grounds for Audi Field. But this annual rap extravaganza still features two days with some of the biggest names in the game (Megan Thee Stallion, Gunna), as well as some of the most exciting (Veeze, Sexyy Red). Nota bene: Do not miss Karrahbooo — one of the most cool-minded, numb-tongued rappers to emerge in years — when she performs with Lil Yachty and the Concrete Boys. There’s much to experience beyond the music: appearances by actress Issa Rae and comic Desi Banks, a set with amapiano star Uncle Waffles, Trap Karaoke, and interactive art experiences. Saturday and Sunday from 2 to 11 p.m. $225-$1,200 for two-day passes; $89.50-$544.50 for one-day passes.
SAAM Arcade at the Smithsonian American Art Museum
For one day each summer, the Smithsonian American Art Museum’s Kogod Courtyard transforms into the world’s most beautiful video game arcade. The 11-year-old SAAM Arcade is, on its face, about the museum’s endorsement of “video games as part of the national visual culture” and video game graphics as art. But it’s also a chance to explore brand-new games from nine independent developers, this year with the theme “Adventure Awaits,” as well as play on console and old-school arcade games that span the decades — a joyful interactive experience for multiple generations. After you’ve played a few games, go on a scavenger hunt through the museum, or win prizes on a “side quest” asking questions of game developers. The first two hours of the day are “quiet hours” with reduced noise. 11:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Free.
Kids World at Franklin Park
Kids rule in Franklin Park this weekend, as Kids World lets them take over downtown D.C.’s largest green space. The day includes (deep breath) live music and poetry; workouts with costumed superheroes; story times and read-alongs with favorite characters; crafting and painting areas, including face painting; a teddy-bear-themed space where little ones can have tea with Paddington or make their own bear; bubble mazes and giant bubbles; vehicles to climb; double Dutch jumpers; video games; and a trackless train traversing the whole park.

Tales of Cinema: The World of Hong Sangsoo at the National Gallery of Art
The National Gallery of Art, the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Asian Art, the AFI Silver Theatre and the National Museum of Korea have teamed up to honor Hong Sangsoo, the prolific and acclaimed South Korean filmmaker who has produced 25 feature films since 2000, turning everyday life into epically structured and memorable dramas. Seven films are shown over three weekends, beginning with “On the Occasion of Remembering the Turning Gate” (Saturday at 2 p.m.) and “Tale of Cinema” (Sunday at 2 p.m.) Through Aug. 17. Free; registration required.
WalkingTown D.C. Summer Tours
Every September, WalkingTown D.C. offers dozens of free walking tours that show Washingtonians a different side of their city, from the rebirth of Southwest to the mansions of Meridian Hill to key sites in LGBTQ+ history. In honor of WalkingTown’s 25th anniversary, the group is offering special preview tours over the summer. There are two in coming days: On Saturday, explore the history of Blagden Alley and Naylor Court, two of the city’s remaining alley communities, including a meet-and-greet with Kim Williams, the author of “Hidden Alleyways of Washington, D.C.” (3:30 p.m., Free.). On Monday, attention turns to an overlooked aspect of the Walter E. Washington Convention Center: one of the largest public art collections outside of a museum, with more than 130 pieces by artists like Sam Gilliam and Sol LeWitt. (6:30 p.m. Free.) Registration is required for both tours, and space is limited.
Adobo Gigante at Echostage
Over the last six years, Adobo has blossomed into one of D.C.’s most popular dance parties, sprinkled with Afrobeats, soca, bachata, hip-hop, go-go, amapiano and other Afro-Latinx sounds at clubs across the city. Adobo’s sixth anniversary finds a truly heavy lineup with Nina Sky, Pedro Night, DJ Puffy and Yvain Amour playing for the crowds at Echostage. After this, organizers are taking Adobo on a coast-to-coast road trip, so get a taste while you can. 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. $20-$25.
Olney Outdoors at Olney Theatre
Olney Theatre’s Olney Outdoors series brings six weeks of music and comedy to its outdoor stage. This weekend includes comedian Glen Tickle (Friday, $40); Grateful Dead tribute band Better Off Dead (Saturday, $35); and afternoon Drag and Drinks hosted by Evon Michelle Dior of Baltimore’s Sad Brunch and featuring local queens (Sunday, $35). Saturday afternoon is Olney’s annual Summerfest open house, with backstage tours, performances, a prop sale, games and food trucks (1 to 6:30 p.m., free). The grounds offer a mix of seating options, from bleachers to open lawn where attendees can dance or, as the theater puts it, lie back and “stare at the stars.” Upcoming weeks include tributes to Dolly Parton (Aug. 2) and Queen (Aug. 24), magic shows (Aug. 3), and sing-alongs with Disney princesses (Aug. 17). Through Aug. 31. Prices vary; Saturday’s Summerfest is free.
Mubadala Citi DC Open at Rock Creek Tennis Center
This year’s Mubadala Citi DC Open coincides with the Olympics, when many of the world’s top tennis players will be in Paris. Still, the ATP-WTA 500-level tournament held in Rock Creek Park snagged some heavy hitters who are focusing on their hard court game during the lead-up to the U.S. Open instead of on French clay. This year’s lineup includes hometown tennis hero Frances Tiafoe, No. 10 Grigor Dimitrov and No. 14 Ben Shelton, while British star Emma Raducanu, 2024 Australian Open champion and No. 3 Aryna Sabalenka, and U.S. favorites including Sloane Stephens and No. 13 Madison Keys feature on the women’s side. Through Aug. 4. Single-session tickets for outer courts start at $22.
Jerk x Jollof and Souled Out Dates at the Bullpen
Detroit’s Afro-Caribbean party starters Jerk x Jollof could have probably thrown a successful event at the Bullpen by themselves, but they’re teaming with the high-energy vibes of D.C.’s Souled Out Dates — a combination of nine DJs that should ensure an amazing afternoon on Half Street SE. And, yes, there will be jerk and jollof platters available. 2 to 10 p.m. $20-$50.
Aslin Summer Games at Aslin Beer Company
The same weekend the Olympics kick off in Paris, teams of tipsy contestants in Washington can compete for something even better than the gold: Aslin gift cards, trophies and bragging rights. Eighteen teams of four players will compete in sprint versions of lawn and party games, like bean bag tossing, Big Wheel pedaling and … eating the most ice pops in an allotted time frame. The games will earn teams points, but extra points can be won via costume and fan favorite contests. Four players are required to play per team, which must be registered in advance. 3 to 8 p.m. $40 per team; free to watch.
Ballroom on the Block at the Clarendon Ballroom

Shark Bites and Brews at the Wharf
The Discovery Channel hosted its annual Shark Week a few weeks ago, and now it’s time for selachimorphaphiles — that is, lovers of sharks — to gather at the Wharf. Try riding a mechanical shark, which is like a mechanical bull but with teeth instead of horns, and enjoy a dunk tank and outdoor games, live cover tunes from the 7 Deadlies Band, a doughnut-eating contest with shark-shaped treats, and a beer garden. 5 to 8 p.m. Free.Broccoli City Festival at Audi FieldD.C.’s homegrown Broccoli City Festival has a new venue in 2024, swapping the RFK Stadium grounds for Audi Field.

WaPo_3,How memorizing poetry can expand your life,https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/07/25/memorizing-poetry-dickinson-derrida/,2024-07-25 21:29:02.702650,,"Decades ago, my friend Caetlin received a peculiar assignment from the poet Robert L. Hass, who was then her undergraduate literature professor. He instructed each student to memorize three poems of their choosing from the Norton Anthology — not for any urgent pedagogical reason, he claimed, but instead to prepare them for their inevitable future divorces. At some point, Caetlin recalls him saying, you’re going to be alone outside of a courtroom and poetry is going to be all you have. He may have been joking, but it sounds a little like he was speaking from experience.If the task was a strange one, though, it was less because of its faintly misanthropic framing than because the act of memorizing a poem feels curiously old-fashioned in an era when few of us encounter poetry at all. Perhaps we learn the basic form of the haiku in grade school or the shape of the Shakespearean sonnet a few years later, but at some point, two Frostian roads diverge in a yellow wood and most of us take the one with fewer poems on it. In general, that choice makes no difference at all.That was mostly my path, too. Even in graduate school, working toward a degree in English literature, I mostly confined myself to prose. It was only in my 40s, only in the last few months, actually, that I began to change my ways. In April, I flew to Seattle, partly to say goodbye to the writer Lesley Hazleton, who had decided to end her life in the face of a terminal cancer diagnosis. On the flight, I began to read Clive James’s “Sentenced to Life,” a stirring 40-line reflection on life with the cancer that would ultimately lead to his death. Never giving way to pure pathos, James — an uncommonly witty writer — revels in the world that mortality has opened up to him, his fate sharpening his vision, both within and without.For hours, I read nothing else as we coursed across the country. Sometimes I spoke its lines aloud, my voice masked by the airplane’s thrum. Sometimes I went through the whole poem at once, and sometimes I repeated a single stanza over and over. I didn’t mean to memorize it at first, but I did want to hold it the way we soon wouldn’t be able to hold Lesley anymore, to keep it the way she kept the smoke of her American Spirits in her clothes. I wanted it as a long, endless inhalation, and by the time my plane landed on the West Coast, I had it that way. The whole thing, all 40 lines of it, in my head. They’re still with me — I could recite them to you now as easily as I can call up the bemused lilt of Lesley’s voice.In the months since, that small comfort has grown into the assurance of ritual. I’ve tried to memorize a poem every week since, either because they felt right in the moment or because the moment brought them to me. Struggling to make sense of my changing life, I memorized the Polish poet Adam Zagajewski’s miraculous “Transformation,” which I’d first read in my dorm room 22 years before. Now older, I found a mirror as much in Zagajewski’s description of a sunset — “(crimson, anxious)” — as I did in his opening portrait of paralysis:Later, on my way to a wedding, I wrote to a friend about the sailboats I saw from my train. She responded by sending Lucille Clifton’s “blessing the boats.” I memorized that, too, longing to be carried “out / beyond the face of fear.” If I am gathering a canon, it is a private one, shaped by circumstance and sentiment rather than obligation or authority.My almost accidental process with “Sentenced to Life” — revisiting words and phrases until they dissolve into mere sound, disassembling stanzas like a butcher carving primal cuts off a carcass, catching myself in error and laboriously struggling to correct it — has become my method. I have memorized poems on park benches and in bed. Sometimes I walk through the neighborhood in the morning, mumbling the words of a half-known poem to myself, sheepishly stopping when a dog walker comes around the corner.Because the process is as simple as it is stultifying, memorizing a great poem always begins as a crime. The tedium of repetition reduces the hewn gemstone to a pile of gravel in which only the occasional dull agate stands out. But as you run your hands through the rock, the lines at last come together again, and the scattered text transforms back into a treasure, often a more valuable one than it was before. I think of James’s claim in “Sentenced to Life” that illness had only made his vision “more defined”:When you are memorizing a poem, a similar kind of noticing begins at the level of form. Demolition reveals the joints that articulate a structure, the way every part supports up every other, and attention begins to give way to understanding: The three single-word lines that conclude Clare Cavanagh’s translation of “Transformation” — “lightning, / transformation, / you.” — expand and then contract, like an exhale followed by a sharp gasp at the unexpected appearance of a beautiful face. Because such details help to secure the poem in the mind, noticing them goes beyond the ordinary academic labor of close reading. You dissect the poem to graft it into yourself; in the process, its meanings become not objects to be discovered over there, on the page, like birds on a branch, but instead found here, within you, where the tree takes root.That “within” is not just a metaphor for the mind; memorized poetry resides in the body, as well. As the French philosopher Jacques Derrida notes in his short essay “What Is Poetry?” (the title of which is typically given as “Che cos’è la poesia,” even in translation), versions of the phrase “learn by heart” crop up in numerous languages to describe poetic memorization: English, of course, but also, he writes, French and Arabic, among others. For Derrida, this is no accident. He argues that lyric poetry, by nature, asks to be learned by heart, but also, “I call a poem that very thing that teaches the heart, invents the heart, that which, finally, the word heart seems to mean.” Glossing these lines, the scholar Jonathan Culler writes in his book “Theory of the Lyric” that poetry’s “efficacy depends upon its success in making its words memorable, having them remembered.”In other words, poetry perpetuates itself by becoming a part of those who read it. It can do so only because it is so specific, so entirely different from us, that taking it in expands our own sense of what we are. As you repeat a line or a stanza again and again, signification temporarily gives way to the felt texture of language: its rhythms, pressures, temperatures. These are gestures that say nothing but speak to every part of you.Some of the poems I’ve memorized are already fading, and that’s fine. I know that if I spend a little time with them, they’ll sing in me again. Others keep thumping in me like a new pulse. Emily Dickinson asks me, “If at length the smouldering anguish / Will not overcome — / And the palpitating vineyard / In the dust, be thrown?” and I still couldn’t quite tell you what those protomodernist, grammar-averse lines mean, but they roll around at the base of my throat, where my anxiety otherwise sits. I won’t promise you that memorizing poetry will make your life better, but it will make you more: more in touch with language, with other minds, maybe with what you might yet become.Or maybe you’ll just go on living, blessed with a little more than you need. A few months ago, I was getting drinks in an airy hotel bar downtown with Caetlin and Seth, her partner of 17 years, who is both a poetry scholar and a poet. “When we are talking about nothing, I / am talking about you,” he writes in a sonnet to her that I am memorizing now. “For instance, when / the weather complicates things, you sweep my / legs from under me.”Do you remember any of the poems you learned for Hass? I asked Caetlin. She did, and “Her Kind,” by Anne Sexton, came spilling out of her, hesitantly at first, but all there in the end, entirely intact. She and Seth have been together for almost as long as I’ve known them both. When they met, I thought they were too different to stay together long, but in their mutual strangeness, they remade each other. And though it’s no business of mine, I believe they’ll be together much longer still. I don’t expect Caetlin will ever really turn to that poem in the way Hass imagined she might, neither as a buffer against heartbreak nor as a companion in some dingy courthouse corridor. But it stuck with her all the same, exactly as vital as she is, and as full as the lasting love that she and Seth share."
WaPo_4,Shalom Auslander finds another taboo to break,https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/07/25/feh-shalom-auslander-review/,2024-07-25 21:00:02.702650,,"Shalom Auslander’s literary career has been built on equal parts comedy, heterodoxy and self-loathing. In his 2007 memoir, “Foreskin’s Lament,” he recalled a Jewish upbringing in New York state in which he flayed his teenage self in shame over just about everything, but especially his libido. (One attempted solution involved his dropping an unabridged dictionary on the source of the trouble.) In his novel “Hope: A Tragedy” (2012), he imagined a still-living Anne Frank as a bitter old woman; in “Mother for Dinner” (2020), a family of cannibals squabble over their mom’s deathbed wish that they eat her.His oeuvre is deliberately unsettling and funny, if inconsistent — “Hope” is brilliant, “Mother” a dismal misfire. In his  new memoir, “Feh,” Auslander is wondering where all of it has gotten him. One answer: a hospital stay. Lifelong body-image issues have drawn him to carcinogenic, organ-corroding supplements, “banned” labels be damned. “Banned just means it works,” he insists. “Banned is good. It doesn’t get better than banned.” He’s being sarcastic but not entirely — the whole memoir is driven by the question of whether the official story is one worth adhering to.Most of the time in “Feh,” he’s dwelling on the most official story of all. Putting his shul training to good use, he revisits the Torah and finds that “feh” — Yiddish for “disapproval or disgust” —  is God’s prevailing sentiment toward his creation. God named the first man Adam, “from the Hebrew word Adamah, which means dirt. He named his son Dirt.” The book of Job, he notes, “is the beloved tale of a man learning to despise himself. This is what God says when he does: ‘Good.’” Auslander takes it personally: Every calamity he faces becomes a plot point in “God’s favorite comedy.”But rather than simply riffing on the feh-ness of it all, “Feh” has a plot: Auslander’s attempt to escape the clutches of “feh,” which means rethinking what he knows not just about his story, but all stories. As a middle-aged parent, the stakes are higher: He has two children to raise, a wife to care for, a (failing) career to maintain, and he’s witnessed what self-loathing has done to himself and others.The self-deprecating humor is playful when he’s talking about himself: “Like geese heading south for the winter seeking warmth, Fehs head to vitamin shops for the summer seeking self-esteem.” But the mood is more somber when feh claims a friend, in this case Oscar-winning actor Philip Seymour Hoffman who died of a heroin overdose in 2014. Shortly before he died, Hoffman had signed on to star in a sitcom that Auslander had written, later made as “Happyish.” In Hoffman, Auslander sees a needless victim of self-directed anger and fear, and the injustice makes Auslander overheat, infuriated at “a single story, forever changeable but never changing, a single story told by humans, to humans, that dehumanizes us all.”The single story of feh, he concludes, is in its way just as damaging as heroin or sketchy supplements — a gateway drug in itself. And because the story is all-pervasive, Auslander has plenty to satirize. Advertising’s key concept is that “the more feh you can make someone feel, the more inclined they will be to purchase the product that promises to unfeh them.” The Bible? “Feh.” “Atlas Shrugged?” “Feh II.” (Ayn Rand is a Swiss Army knife of feh-ness — wounded, bitter, selfish, pitiless.) Capitalism is built on cruel feh fables like “The Man Who Was Lazy” and “The Man Who Deserved It.” Zillow makes you fantasize about inaccessible dream homes; Nextdoor tells you that every street, everywhere, contains a horror.So if the problem is story, Auslander concludes, we need some new ones, stories that invert our received notions of heroism and failure. “What if mankind is the hero, and God is the bad guy? What if it’s God who is feh?” That’s not a new concept — religion is often criticized as a way to restrict and humiliate. But Auslander’s particular counternarrative is that the abuse is all-pervasive, invading secular life as well. His literary heroes — Kafka, Cervantes, Voltaire — all thrived when they pushed against convention, where “the desire to be heard overwhelms the desire to be loved, where the voice whispering Speak! becomes louder than the one shouting Feh.”Exploring this idea doesn’t, strictly speaking, require an extended commentary about Auslander’s adolescent fascination with the Victoria’s Secret catalogue, or for Borscht Belt-ish riffs on the old men in L.A. coffee shops constantly mishearing one another. A cynic in the world never runs out of material, and Auslander doesn’t always hone or organize it well. But the persistent blackness of the book’s black comedy makes the tiny shafts of light in the  latter chapters shine that much brighter. None dare call it a redemption narrative — that’s feh-talk — but Auslander does find a place where he doesn’t have to be overwhelmed with contempt for himself or others.“Mankind is the only creature that hates itself,” Auslander writes. And: “Mankind is the only creature that tells itself stories.” The two are intertwined. Even if we work to fix our predicament — expunge ourselves of pointless shame, stop courting needless self-harm — it’s unlikely we’ll ever stop entirely hating ourselves. But we can try, as Auslander does for much of “Feh,” to write a story that’s still honest, without feeding into the hate.Mark Athitakis is a critic in Phoenix and the author of “The New Midwest.”A MemoirBy Shalom AuslanderRiverhead. 368 pp. $29"

Serve the tomatoes with a simple green salad, as well as rice, pasta, polenta or bread, to make a complete meal, or make it a side dish with any simple main course, such as air fryer salmon or roast chicken.Although the recipe stands on its own in the book, Tomatoes Casino appears in a chart of recipes for stuffed vegetables. What do I mean by that? The whole book is a collection of charts that each show you the basic infrastructure of a recipe with examples for how to riff on it. Then there are the recipes for each example. In addition to stuffed vegetables (so fun!), there are also tons of simple, useful things such as salad dressings, roasted vegetables, one-bowl baked goods and more. It’s also a very personal book: It includes a number of essays; I took all the photos myself; and my sweet parents designed the whole thing.It has been so much fun hanging out with all of you, and although I will no longer be writing this column, I am excited to get back to reading it along with you.

COPPA 2.0 would ban targeted ads to children and teens and require companies to obtain consent from parents before collecting data on users 16 years old and under, up from the current 12.Both measures have garnered broad bipartisan support, with KOSA being backed by more than two-thirds of the Senate. But that bill faces enduring opposition from digital and human rights groups, who argue it would squelch speech, particularly for marginalized groups, and trample on privacy.India McKinney, director of federal affairs for the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation, said in a statement that KOSA would amount to “an unconstitutional censorship bill” and urged lawmakers to focus instead on a broader privacy bill that “would protect young people without infringing on the First Amendment rights of everyone who uses the internet.”While Senate passage would be a milestone for the measures’ proponents, they face significant uncertainty in the House, where lawmakers abruptly yanked the bills from consideration at a legislative markup last month.The House’s move dealt a major blow to the prospect of getting the bills to the desk of President Biden, who endorsed the bills a year ago Thursday, telling Congress: “Pass it. Pass it. Pass it. Pass it. Pass it.”“Our colleagues have had discussions with the House to try and get this done,” Schumer told me after delivering remarks at a news conference on Tuesday, where parent and youth advocates, child safety advocates, and lawmakers rallied ahead of the expected vote.House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) told CNBC this week that he loves “the idea” behind the bills, but it’s unclear whether he will support bringing them to the floor. And with the House set to start August recess early, time is running short ahead of the 2024 election.Nvidia tries to tamp fears about AI’s climate footprint in WashingtonThe artificial intelligence boom is sparking fresh concern in Washington about the technology’s impact on the environment, given that the tools require vast amounts of energy to power.That has put a bigger spotlight on efforts by tech companies to limit their climate footprint, including chipmaker Nvidia, whose stock has soared over its role helping to fuel the AI rush.Now the company is taking its message to Washington, meeting with lawmakers in a bid to persuade them that fears about AI’s potential to drain the power grid have been overstated, and that in fact the technology could be a net positive for the environment.Josh Parker, Nvidia’s senior director for corporate sustainability, told the Tech Brief that he met recently with the House’s bipartisan AI task force to make that case. “We’ve been very impressed with the level of interest and expertise from policymakers,” he said Wednesday.Parker argued that AI will help “achieve energy efficiency across industries, not just in data centers, but also potentially in manufacturing and transportation and other sectors.”Lawmakers are starting to pay more attention to the issue. A bicameral group of Democrats led by Sen. Edward J. Markey (Mass.) introduced a bill earlier this year directing the federal government to study and issue a report on AI’s impact on the environment.“I think any research into this topic is beneficial because, again, we really want people to have the best information available so that we can plan for the future accordingly,” Parker said of Markey’s proposal.5th Circuit Court strikes down FCC’s Universal Service FundThe 5th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the Federal Communications Commission’s Universal Service Fund on Wednesday, calling the program to subsidize telephone service to low-income households unconstitutional.“American telecommunications consumers are subject to a multibillion-dollar tax nobody voted for,” the court wrote in its majority opinion, which pointed to a provision of the Constitution granting all legislative powers to Congress. “The size of that tax is de facto determined by a trade group staffed by industry insiders with no semblance of accountability to the public.”The ruling was a victory for conservatives who say agencies like the FCC have gotten too expansive in their powers. Proponents of the Universal Service Fund expressed hopes that the Supreme Court would take up the case. FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement that the decision was “misguided and wrong” and that the FCC would pursue all available avenues for review.Andrew Jay Schwartzman, Benton Institute for Broadband and Society senior counselor, said he expected the ruling to have “no immediate short-term impact,” noting that two other circuit courts recently ruled differently.Trump allies crush misinformation research despite Supreme Court loss (Cat Zakrzewski and Naomi Nix)Who’s Behind Project 2025?

WaPo_7,Ask Sahaj: My brother stopped talking to me after a heated political discussion,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/07/25/ask-sahaj-brother-political-discussion/,2024-07-25 21:00:02.702650,,"Dear Sahaj: I have one living brother, and we always have had a good relationship, although not a very close one. He lives far away, but I see him almost every year with other family, and we have talked every three or four months and emailed more frequently.About six months ago, we accidentally backed into a political discussion. While I have long known our views of the world were somewhat different, I discovered that he holds pretty extreme views contrary to mine. During this discussion, he made a personal comment about me that I found insulting, and I responded that I had been trying to keep our discussion from being personal.Since then, I have received very little or no response to emails to the general family, and no response in recent months. Through reflection, I have decided to completely set aside the insult and the difference in our values and simply maintain the relationship that we had, but I apprehend that the feeling is not mutual. How should I proceed?— SiblingSibling: Before you figure out how to proceed, I encourage you to dig deeper and consider: What does it even mean to maintain the relationship with your brother? In your letter, it sounds like there wasn’t that much intimacy or connection before the political discussion. This isn’t to say that what it was isn’t enough (only you can determine that), but it does make me curious about whether you are grieving what this relationship is not.When I work with clients who are navigating tension in familial relationships, often our work leads to processing grief and acceptance. For you, this may look like grieving a sibling you lost already and grieving the sibling relationship you don’t have with your brother. It means exploring the brother you have versus the brother you want. This work is not easy nor is it fast. A therapist or professional can help you process accepting who your brother is — and who he is not.Even more, you want to be honest with yourself about your relationship with your brother. What is the dynamic, and how has it been impacting you? You mention that he made a personal comment that was “insulting,” and yet I don’t sense that he has taken accountability for hurting you. So, what needs do you have in the relationship that you could explore communicating — or have to accept won’t be met? What are you motivated by when it comes to repairing the relationship? Maybe it’s that you don’t want to be estranged from your only sibling, or maybe it’s a hope that things can be different. Whatever it is, be completely, radically honest with yourself.With that said, you don’t know what you don’t know, so have a conversation with your brother to remove any question of where he stands regarding your relationship. This may be sending an email or a text directly and only to him. You may say something like, “I feel as though things are a bit off since our last chat. I’d love to talk about ways we can reconnect. Is that something you’d be up for?” Or, “I’ve been thinking about you. I don’t like how we left things and I’d love to reconnect and find a way to maintain our relationship. If you’re open to it, let me know and we can find a time to talk.” Your brother may choose not to have a relationship — or any communication — with you because of your political differences. Staying in contact with your brother may mean agreeing on how you handle these issues in the future, or it may simply mean respecting your brother’s boundaries even though it’s hurtful to you.All you can do is explicitly share how you feel about him and the relationship while also asking for what you want and need. The rest is up to him … which brings us full circle. You can be open and honest, and yet, you still may not get what it is you are hoping for in return. You want to find ways to accept and grieve what you may not get while also taking care of yourself through nurturing other forms of connection and community."
WaPo_8,Amazon is building a sports media empire. What’s next?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/25/amazon-prime-video-nba-nfl-sports-rights/,2024-07-25 21:00:02.702650,,"Jay Marine, the head of Amazon Prime’s sports division, got a call in mid-April from NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who had news. Both ESPN and TNT Sports, who then had an exclusive negotiating window with the NBA for the league’s next broadcast rights deal, had agreed to allow Silver to bring in Amazon as a third rights partner — even though the rights had not hit the open market.Marine was elated. He had talked to Silver for years about Amazon’s interest in the NBA. Earlier this year, he had breakfast with Silver in which the two kibitzed about working for icons as their respective bosses: Marine had spent decades working for Jeff Bezos at Amazon; Silver had worked for years for former NBA commissioner David Stern.A deal came together quickly soon after the call, culminating in an announcement Wednesday that will have Amazon pay nearly $20 billion over 11 years for NBA and WNBA games, including six NBA conference final series, the annual playoff play-in tournament and three WNBA Finals.Suddenly, Amazon, already home to the NFL’s “Thursday Night Football,” is a major broadcaster of the two most popular North American leagues — with rights to playoff games in each.“This is not some small streaming package,” Marine said in an interview Wednesday. “This is one of three major packages.” He added: “We will now have 12 months of sports, and the good news is that it’s working. Which is why you see us make another very large investment.”The NBA-Amazon deal is worth $1.8 billion annually over those 11 years, according to people familiar with the figures, and when it goes into effect the company, founded 30 years years ago as an online book seller in Jeff Bezos’s garage, will be spending nearly $5 billion a year on sports rights in North America and Western Europe. (The Washington Post’s owner, Jeffrey K. Bezos, founded Amazon.)But Amazon’s NBA deal did not work out exactly as TNT anticipated, and that longtime NBA partner is not included in the new deals announced this week. TNT has attempted to match Amazon’s terms — and keep the rights — based on a provision in its previous contract. The NBA declined TNT’s match, pushing ahead with Amazon, though it’s possible the dispute winds up in court. Marine declined to comment on TNT, saying only, “We’re moving forward.”American sports leagues and teams have been waiting for years for tech companies to move into live sports, particularly as the traditional buyers of sports rights struggle through the disruption of linear and cable TV. Why? Capital. Amazon is valued at $2 trillion, compared with $7 billion for Paramount, the parent company of CBS, and around $20 billion for Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns TNT Sports.It’s finally happening. Netflix outbid Amazon and will air NFL games on Christmas Day next season, and Google’s YouTube last season took over Sunday Ticket, the NFL’s out-of-market package that for years aired on DirectTV. Apple has a deal with Major League Soccer and has done a small deal with Major League Baseball.But it’s Amazon and its more than 200 million Prime members worldwide, more than any other tech behemoth, that has shown the biggest commitment to shell out billions for sports.“The NBA is tripling its rights fees because Amazon got involved,” said Mark Shapiro, president and chief operating officer of Endeavor and TKO, the parent company of WWE and the Ultimate Fighting Championship.Added another high-level executive in sports media, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss companies the executive does business with: “If you’re a league looking for a 10-year deal and you’re saying who am I going to be with in 10 years, you’re picking Amazon, not Warner.""Amazon slowly built its sports portfolio, adding the NFL (including a game on Black Friday), NASCAR and the WNBA Finals, as well as Champions League and grand slam tennis events in Europe. It owns a piece of the YES Network, which broadcasts New York Yankees games, and recently proposed an investment in some regional cable sports networks. With the long-anticipated NBA deal announced if not quite official, one question hanging over the sports industry is how much more Amazon wants. Marine isn’t exactly sure.“I believe we will be a major sports broadcaster in every major market around the globe,” he said. “In terms of what does that mean? How many properties? I don’t know.”Amazon launched Prime Video, its streaming service, in 2011 as a way to boost sign-ups for Prime membership, which offered two-day shipping to Amazon shoppers. Its first original show launched two years later: “Alpha House,” a political comedy starring John Goodman. The push into live sports came in 2017, when Amazon began simulcasting “Thursday Night Football” and acquired the rights to exclusively stream the U.S. Open tennis tournament in the United Kingdom. The goal, Marine said, was to be a first mover.Netflix had been streaming since 2007 but still hadn’t dabbled in live sports.“There’s not an inherent reason why sports won’t move over,” Marine recalled thinking. “So why don’t we get started first?”Cable TV’s collapse — there are some 40 million fewer homes paying for a TV bundle than in 2011 — began with entertainment. Live sports were a riskier proposition, with concerns about whether streamers could attract big audiences and deliver the technology required to support them.Amazon’s U.K.-only U.S. Open deal eventually led to its landmark partnership with the Premier League to show exclusive games starting in the 2019 season. Marine recalled being in the office for the first day of coverage with a group of 200 engineers, cheering and crying, watching the sign-ups roll in and the technology hold up. The media research firm Ampere Analysis estimates that some 30,000 people signed up for Prime on the coverage’s peak day.In the U.S., Amazon remained on the periphery, but it wasn’t for lack of trying. According to multiple people familiar with the talks, Amazon offered more money than NBC for the Big Ten’s Saturday night football package in 2022. The conference chose NBC instead, in part because university presidents were concerned about fans finding the games on a streaming platform.But that fall, Amazon quieted any doubts when it debuted its exclusive “Thursday Night Football” broadcasts, after shelling out around $1 billion a year for the rights. Amazon hired established broadcasters Al Michaels and Kirk Herbstreit to call the games, and it debuted an alternate broadcast that allowed viewers to see the entire field for the first time — one of the most notable advancements in sports viewing in recent memory. The tech has been mostly seamless.Fewer people are watching “Thursday Night Football” than when it was broadcast on Fox. But Amazon’s viewership jumped more than 20 percent last season. “The NFL changed the way people looked at us,” Marine said. (One of the first people to congratulate Amazon on the viewership increase, Marine said, was Bill Koenig, the NBA’s point person on rights negotiations.)And for a company such as Amazon, ratings are not the best measure of success. Amazon wants to add — and retain — Prime customers and keep them shopping. Ampere estimated that Prime Video received around 100,000 new sign-ups on its peak day leading into its first exclusive NFL game. (NBC’s Peacock, which has many fewer subscribers — around 30 million — attracted around 3 million new subscribers over three days around its exclusive NFL playoff game season.)Amazon declined to comment on Ampere’s research, but one company executive, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal figures, called that estimate low.It all means the power dynamics of Amazon’s relationship to sports is fundamentally different from that of a traditional media partner. Take Amazon’s proposed $115 million investment in Diamond Sports, which would help the beleaguered owner of some 20 regional sports networks sort out a messy bankruptcy. (Diamond’s bankruptcy proceedings are still in flux, as is final approval of Amazon’s deal by a federal bankruptcy court.)The investment, if approved, would allow fans to purchase Diamond Sports’ local RSN channels through Prime Video. It would also keep Diamond’s contracts intact, making it harder for the leagues to either pool all their teams’ rights, sell them to someone else or some combination. ESPN and Fanatics have contemplated getting into local streaming, according to Puck.One high-ranking league executive said the Diamond deal was good for Amazon but perhaps not for the leagues, which in some cases had expressed to Amazon that they were ready to move on from Diamond, according to people familiar with the discussions.The executive noted that Amazon has essentially taken no risk; it can pull out if Diamond doesn’t emerge from bankruptcy, and if Diamond survives, Amazon has jumped to the front of the line on local sports distribution without an auction for the rights. “Give them credit, they made themselves a hell of a deal,” said the executive. “They have market power.”Or consider CBS and Fox, which have built their entire businesses around the NFL. Amazon is a multitrillion dollar company without sports.“CBS without the NFL is zero,” said Rich Greenfield, founder of LightShed Partners, a media venture fund. “Amazon without the NFL is fine. That’s a scary place to be.”At this year’s Super Bowl in Las Vegas, Marine, 51, sat at breakfast in the corner of a hotel bistro on the Strip. The entire sports industrial complex had descended on the city — executives, athletes, agencies, every form of hanger-on. Now Marine was contemplating the big news from the week: ESPN, Warner Bros. Discovery and Fox had just announced the formation of a new streaming platform, the latest strategy from legacy media companies to remake themselves. Regional sports networks, a cash cow for leagues and mainstay for fans, were in a perilous state. Marine was asked whether Amazon was going to be the sports industry’s savior.“That’s a big statement,” he said. “I would not sit here and say we’re going to save sports.”A few minutes later, Marine was in Amazon’s hospitality room at the Aria Hotel for an industry happy hour, where blown-up photos of Michaels and Herbstreit dotted video screens and a NASCAR driving simulator was set up in the corner. (Herbstreit had the second fastest time.)Marine, dressed in a Lululemon hoodie and Nike sneakers, palled around with Ryan Fitzpatrick, the former quarterback turned studio analyst for Amazon. As a camera snapped promotional photos of them, they traded faux boxing punches and then pretended to snap a football. “You be the center, put your hands under my crotch!” Fitzpatrick yelled.The two often text during NFL games.“He lets me talk Xs and Os,” Marine said.“When I got the job, my dad asked if I could get him free Prime,” Fitzpatrick said.Marine’s job, in some ways, is to bridge the worlds of sports and tech. He went from the Super Bowl to speak on a panel at the NBA’s All-Star Weekend. Asked what was different about the Super Bowl crowd and the tech summits, Marine said: “Fewer hoodies, less Patagonia.” He added: “I can’t beat up anyone here.”Marine makes regular trips to the league offices to share updates on Amazon, Prime and the evolution of streaming. It’s a bit dreamy for a sports-obsessed kid from the Detroit suburbs who has spent most of his career at Amazon. He was part of the team that launched the Kindle and spent time as Bezos’s chief of staff.The familiarity with Amazon is important because its business model is different than that of traditional media companies, which rely on selling advertising and charging cable companies to distribute their channels. Amazon is in a different business: using sports to sell more “everything.”Prime Video launched an ad business this year and it has the tech to show different ads from the same advertiser to different demographics of viewers. Those ads, Amazon said, resulted last NFL season in 80 percent more purchases versus traditional static ads. And during its Black Friday game, the company said, QR codes that appeared in ads had a more than 350 percent higher engagement rate than during other games. The QR codes in many cases led directly back to Amazon shopping.“They have the most compelling closed-loop system there is,” Greenfield said. “You’re able to take content that people are immersed in, show them ads on products they might want to consider. Then you know what gets bought directly from your platform.”As for what comes next, Marine said Amazon is looking at both “tier one” sports that can drive the largest audiences and up-and-coming properties such as women’s sports. “Not the stuff in the middle,” he said.There aren’t many top rights that will be up in the near term. The NFL, SEC, Big Ten, College Football Playoff, World Series, NHL and now NBA are tied up in long-term deals, mostly with traditional media companies such as ESPN, Fox and NBC. (“They are absolutely a legitimate competitor,” ESPN President Jimmy Pitaro said of Amazon. “But brand matters. ESPN is viewed as a destination for sports over four decades, so we like our position.”)But those deals, too, will one day come up again.“Would I like to broadcast the Super Bowl [in the next rights cycle]?” Marine said. “Yes.”"
WaPo_9,Oldest person in the U.S. turns 115 today: ‘She’s surprised us all’,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2024/07/25/oldest-person-elizabeth-francis-birthday/,2024-07-25 21:00:02.702650,,"When Elizabeth Francis turned 114 years old last year, she said if she made it to her 115th birthday, she had a simple wish: two slices of cake.Today, Francis — the oldest person in the U.S. — celebrates that birthday. Her family plans to present her with a large floral-covered vanilla cream sheet cake, her favorite flavor.She can have as many slices as she’d like, said Francis’s granddaughter Ethel Harrison, 69.“She’s earned something special, but the cake won’t have 115 candles,” Harrison said. “Instead, we’ll make it easy and light three: two number 1s and a 5.”Francis, who lives in Houston, was the second-oldest person in the U.S. until Feb. 22, when the previous longevity record holder, Edie Ceccarelli, died a few weeks after her 116th birthday in Mendocino County, Calif.In April, Ben Meyers of LongeviQuest — an organization that tracks the oldest people in the world — presented Francis with a plaque celebrating her milestone as the new oldest American.“She was just shocked to hear she was now the oldest — she couldn’t believe it,” said Harrison, who handles the family parties and puts in a cake order for Francis every year.“We all know that we have to punch that [final] ticket someday, so we’re amazed and grateful that she’s still here,” she said. “She’s surprised us all.”Francis has slowed down in recent months and now speaks in a faint whisper, Harrison said. But she said her grandmother still has a sparkle even though she spends most of her time in bed at the home she shares with her only child, Dorothy Williams, 95.The pair are looked after by several caregivers, including Harrison.“My grandmother sleeps much more than she did six months ago, but she still says exactly what she thinks and doesn’t hold back,” she said.Meyers said he’s seen that firsthand in the times he’s visited her.Francis’s advice to living a long life at age 115 is the same as it was last year at 114, he said. She told him, “Speak your mind and don’t hold your tongue.”She is the fourth-oldest person in the world, and the oldest person still living at home, Meyers said, adding that humor, warmth and confidence have carried her through.“Elizabeth Francis is America’s grandmother, beloved by her family and community and admired worldwide,” he said. “Her story is about faith, fortitude and family more than it is about longevity.”Born in Louisiana in 1909, Francis was 11 when her mother died, and she and her five siblings were separated and sent to live with relatives, Harrison said.Francis spent her teen years with an aunt, and later as a single mom, she ran a coffee shop at ABC 13 News in Houston for 20 years.Her grandmother was known for her tea cakes and chicken and dumplings made from scratch, and she always shared everything she grew in her vegetable garden, Harrison said.Francis never learned to drive, so she took the bus or walked, which might be one reason she is now deep into her supercentenarian years, she said.“She’s led a simple life and has always stayed busy with her family,” Harrison said, explaining that Francis’s family regularly stops by, including three grandchildren, five great-grandchildren and four great-great-grandchildren.Francis is now content to spend her days at home with her daughter, who is wheeled into Francis’s sunny bedroom every morning.“They enjoy sitting next to each other to laugh and watch old episodes of ‘Good Times’ and ‘The Jeffersons’ on television,” Harrison said. “They also love watching ‘The Price is Right.’ They both feel lucky and blessed to be together so late in life.”While Williams is on medication for various ailments, Francis doesn’t take anything except an aspirin now and then, Harrison said.“I asked her the other night how she feels about turning 115 and she smiled and said, ‘I just thank the good Lord that I’m here,’” she said. “She says she has nothing to complain about, and the rest of our family feels the same way.”She said she hopes there’s a chance that Francis could make it to age 117 — the same age of the current living oldest person in the world, Maria Branyas of Spain.“Every year that I have to order another birthday cake for my grandmother is an occasion worth celebrating to know she’s still with us,” Harrison said."
WaPo_10,The lawyer who fights for people’s right to grow ‘weeds’,https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2024/07/25/lawyer-helps-people-fighting-weed-ordinances/,2024-07-25 20:00:02.702650,,"Val Weston and J. Brandon knew the yard needed help. In 2021, the couple had bought a 1970s-era fixer-upper in Silver City, N.M., on a corner lot carpeted in weeds, including the invasive goathead, notorious for its spiky leaves. “The yard was completely abused,” Weston says. “Neglected.”Weston, a certified naturalist, was eager to ditch the lawn altogether in favor of native grasses, flowers and trees.She and Brandon thought they had done everything right: They sought landscaping advice and joined their local Native Plant Society chapter. Before buying seeds, they let the plants already in the ground grow to see what they had. A meadow began to take shape. Left unmown, the native prairie grasses grew as tall as four feet and attracted birds that nested in the safety of the new landscape.But the following summer, when the grasses were near their seasonal height, a pair of Silver City code enforcement officers knocked on the couple’s door.The officers said that the yard violated a local nuisance code. It was, they said, full of overgrown “weeds” and would need to be mowed immediately. Weston and Brandon later learned that a neighbor had complained.These codes, common in cities across the country, allow municipalities to regulate landscaping decisions on private property, in the interest of public safety and aesthetic sensibilities. The intentions are good: An overgrown hedge can block the view of a driver pulling onto a busy road; a nest of noxious weeds or debris can attract pests. But at a time when homeowners are increasingly favoring native plants over turf grass lawns, weed ordinances can conflict with the personal choices of residents.At the time, their meadow blossomed with orange globe mallow, a drought-resistant perennial, alongside wild poppies and prairie coneflowers, which bloom deep red and thrive in bright sunlight. Native grass, such as cane bluestem, sideoats grama and blue grama, grew tall. Cues for care were evident on the property, with freshly mowed lines along the public sidewalk.“We said, ‘we don’t have weeds,’” Brandon says. “We have native plants and grasses. We were insisting, ‘what are the weeds?’”Brandon asked for specifics about the violations and to see the ordinance in question. The officers agreed to bring it to the house a few days later, then left the couple with a warning and handwritten instructions that read, “Weeds need to be cut.”The officers returned with the ordinance language. The city nuisance codes forbade “Noxious weeds or other rank vegetation which produce noxious odors” or anything that “provides harborage for rats, mice or other rodents, snakes or other vermin.”Pointing to the language, the officers said the yard was at risk of harboring vermin, which Brandon and Weston denied.When the officers returned a third time to find that the plants were still not cut back, they issued a formal citation.By then, the interaction had grown tense. Brandon says that when he tried to explain his side, he was told that he could tell his complaints to the judge in court. (A representative for the Silver City Police Department, which enforces the city code, did not return a request for comment about the interaction.)Feeling that they had done nothing wrong, but facing a showdown — one rife with potential legal consequences — with their new community, they went searching for professional advice.They found it in an attorney from the prairie-lands of Iowa who specializes in weed ordinance law: the auspiciously named Rosanne Plante.As an assistant city attorney for Sioux City from 2002 to 2008, Plante had made a career of defending her town’s weed ordinances and prosecuting those who ran afoul of them. She oversaw a team she dubbed “the weed police” that drove around searching for infractions.Since leaving her post with the city, Plante, a lifelong gardener, has used her intimate knowledge of municipal flora law to benefit the very types of offenders she once prosecuted. Attitudes about gardening have shifted over the last few decades, as people have become more tolerant of landscaping without turf grass and more aware of the benefits of native plants. She says the regulations need to improve so local governments take these changes into account, while still considering public safety.These days she takes a balanced approach to weed ordinances, trying to bridge the divide between local governments and gardeners. The rules, she says, are necessary “to a certain extent,” but she wants to see them written more precisely, to allow exceptions for homeowners growing native species that don’t look “traditional.”“I’m able to help because I know what the other side is doing,” Plante says. “And that’s a real powerful tool.”Plante says she would approach her old job differently if she were doing it today. Instead of writing citations, she would focus on teaching people about native plants to guide them about what falls within regulations.“People should have the freedom to have native plants and things that don’t look like Barbieland,” she says. “But we do need to have some parameters so people don’t have a yard full of eight-foot plants.”
For Plante, who was named a certified Iowa master gardener in 2004 and a master conservationist in 2019, this work felt like a natural pairing of her personal interests and her professional background. She also incorporates agriculture into her other personal passion: beauty pageants. In addition to her work with gardeners, Plante is known nationally as “the pageant lawyer” because she represents pageants around the country. She’s also a contestant: In the Mrs. Iowa International pageant, she showcased gardening as part of her campaign. Plante reigns as the 2023-2024 Mrs. Agriculture America Elite.
Gardening, a hobby she learned from her grandmother, has always been a part of Plante’s life. She and her husband, Chad, started a garden on an acre of land they own, where she retreats for stress relief while working on challenging cases. In 2016, Chad was severely injured when a public bus struck his car, an accident that left him in a coma for nearly two weeks with a traumatic brain injury. As part of his recovery, Plante guided him through a regimen of garden therapy, techniques she now teaches others.These days, Plante chairs a group of attorneys known as “the Wild Lawyers,” who provide guidance and advice for native plant gardeners charged with violating city codes or homeowners association rules. The lawyers are part of an organization called Wild Ones, with native plant activists working in chapters around the country. As part of her role, she leads seminars on combating and avoiding weed ordinance citations.She also encourages governments to shape ordinance language in a way that protects public safety while still allowing native gardening and nontraditional landscaping. Plante has written a sample weed ordinance that she says can help jurisdictions manage that balance.A well-written ordinance, she says, must strictly define what it means by a “weed.” Many don’t, allowing city enforcement agencies broad leeway to interpret the rule however they see fit.“Usually the biggest problems are that they’re vague and their definitional sections are very bad,” Plante says. “The very first chapter of any good ordinance should be definitions.”As native plant landscaping grows in popularity, cities are starting to rethink their ordinances. The National Wildlife Federation has called on municipalities to update their weed ordinances to take native plants into account, and over the past few years, many cities have done so. Moves like that could reduce tension between gardeners and local governments, says Jim Poznak, a retired attorney who helped organize the Wild Lawyers in 2021.“I would hope that as awareness grows, incidents would decline because people would not only know what the landscape is, but appreciate it,” Poznak says. “Even if you don’t like how it looks, at least appreciate that it has ecological significance.”When gardeners like Weston and Brandon call asking for help, Plante urges them to react calmly. A citation isn’t a conviction, and those cited will have a chance to defend themselves. Even though a visit from an officer can feel intimidating, it doesn’t mean you have to immediately pull out the lawn mower and tear everything down. Start by asking them to specify exactly what you’ve done wrong, she says, and to show you the exact wording of the ordinance in question.She also recommends responding by showing officials that your landscaping approach is intentional. Knowing the benefits of cultivating plants native to the area can help you be more persuasive.“Most communities are open to having you talk to them,” Plante says.Because most citations are complaint driven — as was the case for Weston and Brandon — gardeners can take steps to avoid a visit from the city in the first place. This starts with implementing what are known as “cues for care,” or visible signs that your yard design is intentional. That includes mowing around the edges of the property and creating neat walking paths through taller grasses. Or putting up signs educating the public on the benefits of the native plants in the garden. You can even designate the land as a certified wildlife habitat with the National Wildlife Federation.Benjamin Vogt, founder of the Nebraska-based landscape design firm Monarch Gardens, says that although awareness of the benefits of native plants is increasing, it’s still important to make aesthetics a part of the calculus.“Anything but a lawn will feel like a breach of the social contract in so many urban and suburban neighborhoods,” says Vogt, author of “Prairie Up: An Introduction to Natural Garden Design.” “Even though a natural landscape is cleaning and cooling the air, reducing urban flooding, rebuilding soils and providing for the insects and bugs that literally make our world work.”Vogt also recommends being able to identify each plant in your garden.“The number one defense you can have if you are reported is to know your plants,” Vogt says. “And by that I mean be able to recite the Latin names in a conversation or, at the very least, have a list you can quickly print up or email. Knowledge is power and makes advocacy for natural gardens more possible and successful. Show others you know what you are doing, have researched the plants and didn’t just stop mowing then hope for the best.”In her seminars, Plante recommends pushing back if you’re issued a citation. She advises people to take time preparing their argument by backing it with facts about what’s in the garden and the role those plants play in the local ecosystem.“I urge everybody to plead not guilty immediately. Never admit to any of these folks that you agree with them and you have broken the law,” she says. “You don’t have to prove that it’s not a weed. They have to prove that it is a weed.”For Brandon and Weston, Plante read Silver City’s regulations and urged them to continue with their case. (While the Wild Lawyers are open to offering broad guidance through their educational programs, they do not represent clients in any formal way.)“She was extremely helpful to us. She encouraged us to stand our ground,” Brandon says. “A lot of people would just roll over and say, ‘okay, I’ll mow my yard down because a guy with a badge showed up and told us to.’”In 2023, Weston and Brandon prepared to take their case to court. They carefully documented each plant in their yard. They delivered their evidence to the town and subpoenaed expert witnesses to speak on their behalf.Two days before the trial date, the judge dismissed the case. Their meadow could remain.Chris Moody is a writer based in Boone, N.C., where he teaches journalism and broadcast media at Appalachian State University. He last wrote about the rise of native plant gardening for The Washington Post in 2022."
WaPo_11,"In ‘Deadpool & Wolverine,’ Emma Corrin plays one of MCU’s scariest villains",https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/2024/07/24/cassandra-nova-emma-corrin-deadpool-wolverine/,2024-07-25 20:00:02.702650,,"Cassandra Nova isn’t like other Marvel villains. She isn’t purple with massive gold armor. She doesn’t have a mythical staff. She’s not a super soldier with a metal arm. She’s actually a lot like her brother, Charles Xavier. Only, instead of opening a school for the gifted to help mutants and humans live together, she’s … gouging out eyeballs (through mind control) and trying to exterminate every last mutant on the planet.Cassandra Nova, a Marvel villain who got her start in the X-Men comics in the early 2000s, will see her first live-action debut in the upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe film “Deadpool & Wolverine.” She’s among the deepest of Marvel deep cuts when it comes to finding an antagonist for Wolverine and Deadpool’s buddy-cop duo, and she just happens to be one of the most threatening and evil villains out there.Emma Corrin, who plays Cassandra in “Deadpool and Wolverine,” never read the comic book material to prepare for the character. Instead, they skimmed through Marvel’s character database, collecting notes and nuggets about the character’s origin. Corrin chose to drill into Cassandra’s relationship with her brother.“She is the way that she is because of being hurt or feeling rejected by family, or feeling like he rejected her before they were born,” Corrin said. “And now he’s just a very benevolent, revered person and she has become the opposite out of bitterness or because she had no other choice.”Without getting into too much detail, Corrin’s version of Nova spends time inflicting gruesome pain on people (presumably through mind control). “She’s manipulating minds. She does a lot of mind work,” Corrin said.In the comics, Cassandra Nova’s story is rather gnarly. She’s the long-lost sister of Charles Xavier (she’s actually “chaotic cell matter” that survived after Charles “murdered” his twin in the womb, but sister is the easiest way to describe her). Her debut came as something of a twist: She covertly put Charles Xavier’s mind into her body, and hers into his, to the eventual shock of the X-Men (and readers).Early on, Cassandra ordered a “Wild Sentinel” — that is, a mutant-killing robot — to commit the genocide of millions of mutants. Yeah. Dark.The X-Men eventually thwarted her by — bear with me — trapping her in a sluglike alien and basically erasing her brain. She’s returned from time to time since, most recently as a member of the Marauders team, though they left her stranded somewhere in the past. We should all be relieved.Though Corrin never read the comic book material, they say their version of Cassandra shares a bond with the original. They’re both humans who feel like they’ve lost a piece of themselves and want to do whatever they can to reclaim it. Even if it means bloodshed and broken minds.“You don’t just end up as a villain, you’re not born a villain,” Corrin said. “As fantastical as these characters are, I’d like to believe the same applies. I don’t think she was born evil. I think certain things happened, and she was made that way.”In the movies, Cassandra Nova resides in The Void, a portion of the multiverse first seen in the “Loki” television series that basically serves as a plot and Easter egg trash can for the MCU. It’s littered with variants of MCU characters (there’s an entire batch of Lokis there) and locations from multiple timelines. Everything that ends up there has been “pruned” by the Time Variance Authority, which controls the flow of time (or as I like to call them, the Plot Hole Police).Cassandra, it appears from the trailers, lives within a dead variant of Ant-Man, whose enormous skeleton rests in The Void. We don’t know much else about her role, though it’s clear from preview footage shared with journalists that she’s got mind-bendy powers and is seeking something from Deadpool and Wolverine, who end up there after a run-in with the TVA (who are hunting them down because they’re skipping through timelines).Cassandra’s arrival is another sign the X-Men are now a major part of Marvel Studios’ plans for their cinematic universe, after Disney won the franchise in the acquisition of 21st Century Fox, which had produced the X-Men films over the last two decades. After that cameo at the end of “The Marvels” last November, the animated series “X-Men ’97” revived the popular heroes for MCU fans. “Deadpool & Wolverine” promises a few nods and winks to the characters, too. Case in point: Wolverine is now wearing his classic yellow-and-blue X-Men uniform. (There are also rumors of an “Avengers vs. X-Men” film on the way, but for now they are just that.)According to Corrin, the MCU will be the perfect playground for more Cassandra Nova — if the villain survives this film, of course. “I was given so much freedom,” they say, “and it was like a real playground. You can kind of try anything, and there were no wrong answers, and that’s kind of rare.”"

But while tipping in the United States is the norm, in Europe it can be more complicated.Minimum-wage laws across Europe mean that waiters don’t need tips to make up their salary. Nowhere will you need to tip like an American, even if businesses in tourist hot spots may hope you do.Customs around tipping in restaurants, bars, taxis and hotels vary depending on the country, but a general guideline is that tipping 5 to 10 percent in recognition of fine service is appreciated. Another guideline is that the fancier and more expensive your surroundings, the more you are expected to tip.Asking a porter to take your bags in a five-star hotel? Give them five euros for the trouble. Getting the tasting menu at a chic restaurant? Leave at least 10 percent. And “free” walking tours aren’t really free — tip guides at least five euros per hour, wherever you are in Europe.Learn the norms around the continent and avoid faux pas with these tips for tipping.French people have a relaxed approach to tipping. I’ve lived in France for 11 years and have gotten used to tipping not being compulsory. You are not expected to tip in taxis or Ubers — unless you particularly enjoyed the driver’s conversation or they were especially helpful with your bags — and the same goes for the person who greets you at your rental apartment, bar staff and even hotel staff.
In a good restaurant with attentive service, you can tack on five to 10 euros, or if you got a croissant and a coffee at a sidewalk cafe that cost you €4.80, you can leave five euros rather than hanging around for your change.
Apart from that, just relax. No one is going to chase you out of a bistro demanding their tip.French people have a relaxed approach to tipping.

In some big cities, you may be able to do so with card, but there are still parts of the country, particularly rural ones, where you’ll need to have cash on you. Tell the server when paying your bill how much you’d like to add on for their gratuity, rather than leaving cash on the table.
Many Germans “feel morally obliged to leave something, but within reason,” said Linda Kaiser, a manners expert and a consultant for the German Etiquette Society. “We only give 15 to 20 percent if the service was better than excellent.”It’s standard at table-service establishments in Germany to leave a 5 to 10 percent tip in cash at the end of a meal.

Leaving a tip shouldn’t be something you do robotically.
“In Greece, generosity and hospitality go hand in hand,” explained Melina Thalassinou, a content and social media manager for Greeking.me, a bespoke travel consultancy. “It is seen as a gesture of appreciation rather than an obligation — more about building good relations than adhering to strict percentages.” She advises tipping a tour guide 10 to 15 percent of the tour’s cost, tipping hotel porters one to two euros per bag and leaving a small tip for housekeeping (one to two euros per day).
Keep in mind that salaries in Greece for waiters and tour guides can be low and that work hours can be long. That, plus the fact that prices can be lower than back home, may make you want to leave generous tips at restaurants or cafes, though there’s still no need to give more than 10 percent. If you’re eating at a simple taverna, leave some cash on the table when you leave; one to three euros should suffice. After a fancier, more expensive meal, leave five to 10 euros. Tip with cash so that the money is more likely to get to the waiters.

“People don’t expect to be tipped,” said John McKiernan, a sales supervisor with Vagabond Tours. “People may even refuse tips if they think it’s not necessary. If you don’t know if it’s appropriate or not, it’s always good to ask. They’ll be honest with you.”
If you’re in a restaurant and in a large group, it’s polite to tip 10 percent if service is not already included. Some restaurants automatically will add a 20 percent service charge if you’re in a group of 10 or more. In a pub, it’s advisable to have cash on you if you want to leave a tip. Leave a euro per round of drinks brought to your table.
If you’re one of those travelers who likes to get haircuts when you go abroad — and yes, some people do — in Ireland you have to tip both the hairdresser and the person who washes your hair. You should also tip taxis, at least rounding up to the nearest 10.Tipping in Ireland usually falls under one of two explanations: because you had good service or because you had spare coins on you.“People don’t expect to be tipped,” said John McKiernan, a sales supervisor with Vagabond Tours. “People may even refuse tips if they think it’s not necessary.

You do!” said Elizabeth Minchilli, a Rome-based food tour operator and author. She suggests tipping 5 percent at restaurants, adding that “10 percent is seen as generous.”
Coffee bars, Minchilli said, can be confusing for visitors. Drinking your coffee while standing at the counter will cost less than drinking it at a table, and while you don’t need to leave a tip for the former, you do for the latter.
If you’re getting anything to take away, like a panino or a gelato, then tipping is optional. But whenever there’s table service, Minchilli advises leaving something, even if it’s just a euro for a cappuccino or a cornetto.
Be aware of a few Italian terms before you go. A coperto, or cover, charge on a restaurant tab represents the cost of the cutlery, tablecloth and complimentary breadsticks. Don’t confuse it with a service charge, which you’ll see marked as “servizio incluso”(if it’s already included) or “servizio non incluso” (if it isn’t). Leave your tip on the table, unless you’re in a busy public place where it might be swiped or forgotten, in which case you can hand it to the server directly.
If you rent a car in Italy and need to fill up, some gas stations offer the option of a servito (serviced) lane where an attendant will do it for you. The service costs more than filling up at the pump yourself, so you don’t need to tip, though the attendant probably won’t say no. If you ask him for any other services, like washing your windshield or checking your tires, you can tip a few euros.“I think a lot of Americans come here and fall into the trap of thinking that you don’t need to tip in Italy.

For a tapas meal, think three to five euros. If you’ve just dropped into a bar to have a caña of beer or a café con leche in the daytime, you can leave change next to your empty glass.
Amy Bingham, co-founder of the food tour company Walk and Eat Spain, has some cardinal rules when it comes to tipping there. “If you’re drinking on a terrace, always tip,” she said, because servers “have to work so hard to run those drinks across a crowded sidewalk.” And if the bill comes to more than 40 euros per person, make sure you’re paying with paper, not just coins.If a server in Spain is friendly and efficient, you can thank them and leave a tip with the bill.

If the service charge is included but you’ve had a bad experience, you are within your rights to ask for it to be taken off the bill.
Remember that in London, like in most of the U.K., cards do reign supreme. You even can pay with card now in the capital’s traditional black cabs, where tipping has always been optional.

Some didn’t want to compete on clay courts. One broke her leg during a freak accident in a garden.All will miss the Summer Olympics in Paris, along with dozens of other elite athletes who will be absent for a variety of reasons.“Unfortunately, I won’t be having the fairy-tale ending I was hoping for,” said American runner Matthew Centrowitz, a 2016 gold medalist in the 1,500 meters who missed the Olympic trials because of a hamstring injury, in an X post.Many high-profile absentees compete in track and gymnastics.Jamaican star Elaine Thompson-Herah became the first woman to win consecutive 100- and 200-meter titles after taking gold at the Rio de Janeiro Games in 2016 and the Tokyo Games in 2021. She hoped to repeat the feat in Paris, but she suffered an Achilles’ tendon injury in June during the New York Grand Prix. Shortly after, Thompson-Herah said she would not defend the 200-meter title but hoped to make the relay team and defend her 100-meter crown. Instead, the injury will force her to miss the entire competition.“It’s a long road, but I am willing to start over and keep working and to make full recovery and resume my track career,” Thompson-Herah wrote on Instagram. “I am hurt and devastated to be missing the Olympics this year but at the end of the day it’s sports and my health comes first.”Athing Mu’s star rose during the Tokyo Games, where she won a gold medal in the 800 meters. But the American won’t defend the title in Paris after she fell during the first lap of the event final and finished last at the U.S. Olympic Trials in June. Mu’s coach argued that she was clipped by another runner, but USA Track & Field denied her appeal and she was left out of the relay pool.Keni Harrison and Lolo Jones, 100-meter hurdlers, failed to qualify at the U.S. trials, as did 400-meter star Dalilah Muhammad. American sprinter Trayvon Bromell did not make it to the trials after suffering an adductor injury in May, ending his bid for a third-straight Olympic appearance. Centrowitz’s injury will cost him a shot at his fourth and final Olympics.Injuries were a central story at the U.S. gymnastics trials in Minneapolis, where Shilese Jones and Skye Blakely entered the event as favorites to earn Olympic berths. Jones, a six-time medalist at world championships, injured her leg while practicing a vault during warm-ups before the first day of competition. Blakely tore her right Achilles’ tendon two days before the women’s competition began. Contender Kayla DiCello also suffered a competition-ending injury. Their absences give the U.S. a much lower scoring ceiling in Paris, though the Americans are still favored to win gold.Gymnast Oksana Chusovitina, an eight-time Olympian from Uzbekistan, will miss Paris, too. The 49-year-old had competed in every Summer Games dating back to 1992, but that streak will end after she suffered an injury during podium training for the Asian Gymnastics Championships.“You see somebody else getting hurt, you’re like: ‘What the heck? Am I next or what?’” said Laurent Landi, coach of star gymnasts Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles, of the injuries during trials.The Australian women’s soccer team held out hope that captain Sam Kerr could recover in time for Olympic selection, but she will miss the competition after suffering an ACL injury in January with her club team Chelsea.U.S. women’s national team legend Alex Morgan was left off new coach Emma Hayes’s roster for Paris just before her 35th birthday. Hayes announced on July 12 that forward Catarina Macario, Kerr’s teammate at Chelsea, also will miss the Summer Games because of “minor knee irritation.”The U.S. men’s basketball team replaced six-time all-star Kawhi Leonard, who had been working back from a knee injury, with Boston Celtics guard Derrick White on Wednesday.David Taylor, a 2020 Olympic gold medalist and three-time world champion wrestler, will miss out after he was upset by Aaron Brooks during April’s Olympic trials.Tennis stars Aryna Sabalenka and Ons Jabeur said they did not want to switch between the grass courts at Wimbledon to the clay courts at Paris’s Roland Garros this month, with the hard-court season in North America on the horizon.“We [and my medical team] have decided that the quick change of surface and the body’s adaptation required would put my knee at risk and jeopardize the rest of my season,” Jabeur, a three-time Olympian, wrote last month on X.So, what about the garden incident?That involved British cyclist Katie Archibald, who won gold medals at the past two Olympics.“I tripped over a step in the garden and managed to, somehow, dislocate my ankle; break my tibia and fibula; and rip two ligaments off the bone,” Archibald wrote last month on Instagram. “What the heck.”"

All four of Bonner’s OB/GYNs left by last summer, some citing fears that the state’s ban exposed them to legal peril for doing their jobs.The exodus forced Bonner General to shutter its labor and delivery unit and sent patients scrambling to seek new providers more than 40 miles away in Coeur d’Alene or Post Falls, or across the state border to Spokane, Wash. It has made Sandpoint a “double desert,” meaning it lacks access to both maternity care and abortion services.One patient, Jonell Anderson, was referred to an OB-GYN in Coeur d’Alene, roughly an hour’s drive from Sandpoint, after an ultrasound showed a mass growing in her uterus. Anderson made multiple trips to the out-of-town provider. Previously, she would have found that care close to home.The experience isn’t limited to this small Idaho town.A 2023 analysis by ABC News and Boston Children’s Hospital found that more than 1.7 million women of reproductive age in the United States live in a “double desert.” About 3.7 million women live in counties with no access to abortion and little to no maternity care.Texas, Mississippi and Kentucky have the highest numbers of women of reproductive age living in double deserts, according to the analysis.Amelia Huntsberger, one of the OB/GYNs who chose to leave Sandpoint — despite having practiced there for a decade — did so because she felt she couldn’t provide the care her patients needed under a law as strict as Idaho’s.The growing provider shortages in rural states affect not only pregnant and postpartum women, but all women, said Usha Ranji, an associate director for Women’s Health Policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.“Pregnancy is obviously a very intense period of focus, but people need access to this care before, during and after, and outside of pregnancy,” Ranji said.The problem is expected to worsen.In Idaho, the number of applicants to fill spots left by departing doctors has “absolutely plummeted,” said Susie Keller, CEO of the Idaho Medical Association.“We are witnessing the dismantling of our health system,” she said.KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF — an independent source of health policy research, polling, and journalism.Long covid presents a growing public health challenge worldwide, with potentially tens of millions affected by lingering post-infection symptoms.

The Justice Department is probing Steward over fraud allegations.The HELP committee’s probe has bipartisan support: Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.), the panel’s chair and ranking member, have both spoken out about their frustrations with Steward, including de la Torre’s prior refusal to testify.Cassidy’s statement: “Subpoenas should only be used when absolutely necessary. When all other efforts have failed. The subpoena we are voting on today meets that criteria.”How we got here: Steward has been in HELP’s crosshairs for months, with lawmakers saying they are worried about patient care in communities served by the now-bankrupt company.Sens. Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren, the HELP committee’s two Massachusetts Democrats, held a field hearing in Boston in April where they criticized Steward and its former private equity owners.Ahead of the vote: Markey and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) will introduce the Health Over Wealth Act, which aims to boost transparency for private equity firms and for-profit companies that own health-care entities.The bill seeks to enact safeguards to protect workers and patients, as well as ensure the quality, access and safety of health care. The final version, building on an April discussion draft, also includes language requiring bankruptcy courts to consider the impacts on health-care access and provider employment in its decision making, among other provisions.In case you missed it: The Health Brief spoke to Markey earlier this year about the bill, which was inspired by Steward’s bankruptcy filing.

Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) and John Cornyn (R-Tex.) directs the Government Accountability Office to investigate how transnational criminal organizations finance synthetic-drug trafficking to help federal officials target them more effectively.Why it matters: There were an estimated 107,543 overdose deaths nationwide in 2023, 74,702 of which were attributed to synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, according to provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Across South Texas, we see the drug trade's impact on our cities and towns.

In its announcement, the carrier said it expects about one-third of seats across its fleet to offer more legroom.“Moving to assigned seating and offering premium legroom options will be a transformational change that cuts across almost all aspects of the Company,” Southwest CEO Bob Jordan said in a statement.The company said its research showed that 80 percent of its customers and 86 percent of “potential” customers prefer an assigned seat.“When a Customer elects to stop flying with Southwest and chooses a competitor, open seating is cited as the number one reason for the change,” it said in a  news release.Jordan first hinted at the change in April. “But early indications both for our customers and for Southwest look pretty darn interesting,” he said at the time.The changes are the most significant shifts in decades for the airline, which built its reputation as a scrappy discount underdog but has evolved to become one of the dominant carriers in the United States. Even so, Southwest has been under pressure to boost revenue. As other airlines have found ways to charge for various “upgrades,” including more legroom and early boarding, Southwest’s model left it with few options.The carrier will also begin offering overnight “red-eye” flights, confirming an announcement from earlier this year. It said the flights will begin in February, with the first overnight flight landing on Valentine’s Day 2025. Customers can begin booking those trips now."
WaPo_17,Israel recovers bodies of five hostages amid delay in latest talks on deal,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/25/israel-gaza-hamas-hostages-netanyahu/,2024-07-25 20:00:02.702650,,"The bodies of five Israelis killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack and then taken to Gaza have been recovered, the Israel Defense Forces said Thursday, as families of hostages reacted angrily to news that an Israeli negotiating team has delayed its latest trip to talks on a deal with Hamas.The hostages’ bodies were retrieved from an unguarded tunnel in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, according to Israeli radio. The IDF said it has eliminated dozens of fighters during multiple operations in the area over the week.The bodies recovered were those of Maya Goren, 56, a civilian, and four soldiers: Oren Goldin, Tomer Ahimas, Kiril Brodski and Ravid Aryeh Katz, according to the IDF statement. News about the recovery of the bodies emerged around the time Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was addressing Congress and describing his efforts to free the hostages. In his speech, he promised their families that he “will not rest until all their loved ones are home,” as protests against him continued outside the U.S. Capitol.In Israel, families of hostages reacted negatively to the news that the negotiating team’s expected trip to Qatar on Thursday  has been delayed until next week. The families demanded their own meeting with the team.“For two weeks, the Prime Minister has refrained from responding to the mediators’ inquiries regarding the implementation of the deal,” said the Hostages Families Forum Headquarters in a statement Thursday morning. “It has now become apparent that the information provided to the hostages’ families did not accurately reflect the situation’s reality.”The group accused Netanyahu and the negotiating team of “a deliberate sabotage of the chance to bring our loved ones back,” and it demanded to know who was obstructing the hostage deal and why.While Netanyahu’s speech received numerous standing ovations from lawmakers who attended, much of the reaction in the Israeli press was critical and contrasted the address with the discovery of the hostages’ corpses.“While Netanyahu was speaking in Congress, the IDF was working to identify the bodies of dead hostages,” columnist Nahum Barnea wrote in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper. “One world in Washington, another world in Israel.”The daily Maariv quoted Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is being held hostage, as saying that Netanyahu was delaying the deal “for personal reasons.”“Even if we receive news of more hostages dying in tunnels, he will continue with his public relations campaign in the United States and will continue to drag his feet,” she said.A Netanyahu ally, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, hit back at the media for what he called its overly negative portrayal of the prime minister’s “impressive” speech and accused commentators of trying to weaken the country.“The bitter band of sourpusses in [the media] has illustrated once again the enormity of its disconnect from Israeli experience and is doing everything to ruin the celebration,” he wrote on Facebook.Goren, whose body was taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz, was confirmed dead in December, according to a statement from the office of Israel’s prime minister. Around a quarter of residents of the kibbutz were reported killed or missing after the attack, and about half of the houses were destroyed.Talks to release hostages and end the war in Gaza have been stalled for months, with each side blaming the other for the lack of progress.At the core of the deadlock is the issue of how the war in Gaza will end. Hamas has demanded that the release of hostages be followed by the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a permanent cease-fire. Netanyahu has vowed to completely destroy Hamas.In its response to Netanyahu’s speech in front of Congress, Hamas accused him of obstructing negotiations.“He is the one who thwarted all efforts,” the group said, blasting Netanyahu’s claim that efforts to reach an agreement have intensified and calling it “a complete lie.”Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid also criticized Netanyahu’s speech to Congress, calling it a “disgrace” for not addressing the hostage deal.“An hour of talking without saying one sentence: “There will be a hostage deal,” Lapid said on social media.Russian President Vladimir Putin met Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the Kremlin on Thursday. “Considering all the events that are taking place in the world as a whole and in the Eurasian region today, our meeting today seems very important to discuss all the details of the development of these events,” Assad told Putin through a Russian  interpreter.Many Palestinian families are continually forced to seek new places of refuge inside the Gaza Strip, where there is no safe place,  the U.N. agency for Palestinians refugees said Thursday morning. “Children are crying and screaming. Everybody is in this horrible position once again. It keeps happening over and over and over,” said Louise Wateridge, a spokeswoman for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency in Gaza. “They are forced from place to place, promised safety where there is none.”At least 39,175 people have been killed and 90,403 injured in Gaza since the war started, the Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday. It does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack, including more than 300 soldiers, and it says 326 soldiers have been killed since the start of its military operations in Gaza."

WaPo_19,"What can sharks teach us about life? A lot, it turns out.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/07/20/shark-scientist-career-memoir/,2024-07-25 20:00:02.702650,,"At the height of the pandemic and George Floyd protests, marine biologist Jasmin Graham stumbled across a picture on Twitter: It was of Carlee Jackson Bohannon, a Black female scientist, decked out in all-pink gear, diving with a nurse shark in Belize.Buoyed by the feeling that she “discovered a unicorn,” Graham, who is also Black, tweeted a message of appreciation. Within two weeks, she and Bohannon teamed up with two other Black women scientists to found Minorities in Shark Sciences, or MISS, a group dedicated to bringing more women of color out on the ocean.In her new book, “Sharks Don’t Sink: Adventures of a Rogue Shark Scientist,” Graham chronicles how she fell in love with elasmobranchs, a group of fish that includes sharks, skates and rays, while growing up in Myrtle Beach, S.C., and elsewhere. That passion for marine biology brought her to academia, though she eventually abandoned that path due to the overt racism and misogyny she says she encountered there.Instead, she launched her own research projects with the support of a network of women in marine biology, which she has expanded through MISS. Four years after its founding, the organization has over 400 members around the world, and offers fellowships, mentorship, workshops and educational opportunities for students, with the help of grants and donations from groups such as the Monterey Bay Aquarium, the Save Our Seas Foundation and the Schmidt Ocean Coalition.One of the early MISS-led research vessels she worked on flew three flags: the Stars and Stripes, Black Lives Matter, and a Pride flag.The Washington Post spoke to Graham about her work with sharks, her organization, and her book. This interview has been edited for clarity and length.Washington Post: How did you get your start in marine biology, and why were you drawn to sharks?Jasmin Graham: I always grew up [in South Carolina] going out fishing with my dad, and I just really loved being in and around water from a very young age.I met a professor in undergrad [at College of Charleston] who studied sharks and I started working with them. I just figured out, “Oh wow, these animals have been around for such a long time, and they have so many cool adaptations.” They haven’t changed that much in hundreds of millions of years so they’re obviously doing something right.People assume they’re man-eaters or they’re out to get them. And I was really drawn to trying to turn that around. They’re in the same part of the food web as dolphins, which are also predators. Why do dolphins get movies that are happy where little kids befriend them, and then sharks get scary music and they’re eating people? That’s not fair. I was really interested in helping people move from fear to fascination.WP: In the book you weave fascinating information about various shark species through the telling of your life story. Why did you write it that way?JG: I wanted to help people make a human connection with me as the person telling the story. Once we have that rapport between reader and author, helping them connect with sharks.People sometimes assume I am scary because of my race and other factors I cannot control. People assume that sharks are scary because they have sharp teeth and they’re predators, but they’re really just trying to live their lives. I’m trying to take people step by step to make the logical connection of, we’re all here sharing this planet, no matter what being we are.WP: You sometimes speak about these species as though they’re people — you call the bull shark “grumpy,” for example. Was that on purpose to draw that connection?JG: There’s a big divide in the shark world [and among] scientists who study animals about how much is too much anthropomorphizing. You don’t want to make people think that non-human animals think like people because they don’t.But I’m trying to put things in the perspective of the reality of what people understand. People understand “grumpy” and “agitated.”That’s the closest human emotion that I could connect to the shark. It was really important to me to use language that was approachable to people. Science doesn’t have to be dry. We can talk about things that are silly, like animals that have a hedge trimmer on their face.At the end of the day, we have to talk to people about what they understand. People have seen a hedge trimmer before. Let’s talk about those things and then introduce the scientific words once people have made the connection to what is their reality: “I understand this concept and now I can link it to the scientific word.”WP: In the book, you chronicle your departure from traditional academia after getting your graduate degree from Florida State University, saying you went “rogue.” How did you forge this new path?JG: Someone said, “the beautiful thing about rock bottom is that there’s only one way to go, and that’s up.” When you’re in a place of despair you just have to move forward. That’s [the idea behind] the title of the book, “Sharks Don’t Sink.” If sharks stop swimming, they literally will sink.I needed to get somewhere I felt safe and secure, and where I felt connected to the ocean. If you keep walking forward, eventually someone will open a door.WP: Tell me about Minorities in Shark Sciences and what it does.JG: We’re trying to broaden participation in marine science as a whole and create a culture shift in the way that we do science, the way we treat each other as human beings in science.We do that in a number of ways, all the way from kindergartners learning about the ocean through grade school to undergrads and early-career professionals learning the skills they need to be successful, and then supporting researchers as they’re doing their research to make sure it’s collaborative and inclusive.We believe that diversity in science leads to diversity in thought, and that’s how you get innovation. That’s what we need to solve these problems that our oceans are facing.WP: What does a MISS-led research trip look like?JG: It’s all people of color for the most part. Our [principal investigators] are typically women of color. The culture on our research boats is very open and welcoming.Unfortunately, in shark science there’s a lot of like, “Me man, me tackle shark,” and that attitude permeates through how people interact with each other too, like screaming at each other.It’s not a very conducive place for learning or growing, so we try to be the opposite of that, where we’re high-fiving people and talking them through things. Whenever they mess up, being like, “That’s okay, we all mess up, here’s how we can do it better.” No one’s getting blamed if something goes wrong.That network of support never goes away. For a lot of our members, it’s the first time they’ve had someone they felt truly understood them, saw them, valued them, respected them.And then we also get to have fun conversations about our hair and nails. This one time we were on the boat and almost everyone had a full set of acrylic nails. There was one guy and he was like, “Oh, yeah, I have some questions about nails.” It’s great because usually it’s very male conversations. It’s flipping the script on that.WP: What have you learned from sharks that you’ve applied to your career and your personal life?JG: Sharks have much simpler lives than humans.They’re just doing whatever they need to do that’s best for them. But there’s still a decision-making process and ultimately their self-preservation is what they’re putting above everything else. That’s something that I like to remind myself from the animal kingdom: You can’t accomplish anything if you get eaten. So metaphorically, I can’t let myself get eaten. I have to be worried about myself at the end of the day and make sure I’m taking care of myself because [otherwise] I can’t take care of anyone else.Sharks do something similar with their young. There’s a process called maternal offloading when female sharks get a lot of pollutants in them, like mercury and toxins. To ensure they keep living to produce more young, they will dump a lot of their pollutants in their litter. Those pups might die but the mother has gotten rid of all of [the toxins] so now she can reproduce more. That is a self-preservation tactic.WP: In early June, there were three shark strikes in the Florida panhandle. What would you tell people about the human-shark relationship to put them at ease or address the threat of a shark strike?JG: The ocean has so many beautiful and wonderful things to offer. You should never let a fear keep you from all of these amazing things because the benefits greatly outweigh the potential threat.There are people like me who study sharks and we’re around them all the time. Swimming with them, interacting with them. And most shark scientists that you see, we have all ten fingers and toes.WP: And you’re yanking them out of the water.JG: Yeah, and we can’t explain to them, “Hey, we’re just trying to help you,” right? So they’re going to be antsy. I’m in a much more intense situation than somebody just casually swimming.Sharks aren’t any more evil than any other animal. You can do a lot to make sure that you’re not putting yourself in a position where you’re making an animal feel threatened.I’m not saying that there aren’t any unprovoked attacks. And when those things happen, it’s very sad. But hundreds of thousands of people drive cars every day, and people die in car accidents all the time. There are things that we do to protect ourselves, but it doesn’t stop us from driving.Sharks have every reason to be afraid of us; we have very little to be afraid of them. We kill a hundred million sharks a year every year, and sharks kill somewhere between 6 and 10 people a year.We just have to be really mindful of the language that we use because animals in and of themselves aren’t scary. We should be trying to protect them, not vilify them.WP: What is your advice for younger people or people who are interested in going into shark sciences or marine biology, but feel like they are up against racism and misogyny?JG: You have to know your value and your worth and have that intrinsically in yourself, so deep that no matter what anyone says, you know that you deserve to be there.You shouldn’t have to pay a price to do a job. If that cost is too high — and I’m not talking about money, but mentally, physically, emotionally — it is totally fine to say, ‘This is not worth it anymore.’That’s what I did when I left academia. You can find other ways to engage, other organizations to work for. People will tell you, “Oh, well, if you leave this job, you’re never going to get another job.” That’s a lie.WP: What’s next for your group, or your own research?JG: MISS is going to keep doing its thing. For my research, I have a red tide project that I’m working on.I’m just going to keep following questions that I find interesting. That’s the beauty of going rogue: There’s no, “You have to do this, you have to do that.” Whenever I find a scientific question I find interesting, I will explore it."

Her small TikTok following had only ever seen videos about her personal life and Taylor Swift. But in the moment, “it just felt like something had given me life again,” she said. The video has since been viewed more than a million times.Harris’s rise as the Democrats’ likely presidential nominee following President Biden’s announcement he would step down has triggered a flood of online energy in the form of videos and memes designed to bolster her mass appeal.I literally could not help myself. Go queen kamala #bidenharris #kamalaharris #harris2024 #harris #kamala #potus The videos, often called “fan edits” or “fancams,” have cast Harris in the kind of light typically reserved for pop-culture icons, with thumping soundtracks, fast cuts and glittering visual effects. Many feature what supporters see as her most endearing moments, such as her marching dance alongside a drum line at a 2019 event in Des Moines.The flood of viral political content carries echoes of the online “meme armies” that have flanked former president Donald Trump’s campaigns, built by supporters who see them as a critical way to reach mainstream audiences, using what one booster called the “21st century version of political cartoons.”But the Harris videos show how the memes have evolved for a new TikTok era, fueled in part by young Americans fluent with the culture and craft of online video editing and eager to apply their skills to what they hope will be offline political gain.Many of the most popular pro-Harris fancams come from political novices. Some, like Richter, said they had never made a political video; one account, whose pro-Harris video has more than 500,000 views, specializes in fancams about Sammi “Sweetheart” Giancola, from the reality show “Jersey Shore.”But the fan videos could play a crucial role in helping introduce Harris to new voters and hype up those already loyal during a hugely contracted campaign calendar, with just over 100 days before the election.“They’re so absurd that they work,” said Annie Wu Henry, a digital and political strategist who helped run Sen. John Fetterman’s TikTok during his 2022 campaign. “The videos draw people in and keep them engaged.”On TikTok, Harris “edits,” “remixes” and memes rank among the top political searches, and many of the videos have millions of views. Her official campaign account there had gained nearly 400,000 followers on Tuesday, according to the data firm Social Blade — about as many as the Biden campaign’s now-closed account had gained after five months online.made this so quickly but #KAMALAHARRIS #fyp #biden #coconuttree #omgpage #edits #president #brat #bratsummer #bratedit #charliexcx Trump has for years boasted a giant online audience, and his supporters have boosted him through fan edits of their own. But Alex Pearlman, a comedian and news-content creator in Philadelphia with nearly 3 million TikTok followers, said social media has been flooded with the pro-Harris videos in a way he hasn’t seen since the campaigns of former president Barack Obama, who fans promoted with parody videos showing him kicking open doors and riding skateboards.Many Harris videos, he noted, have worked to subvert Republican attacks seeking to portray Harris as flighty or “weird.” One clip of Harris posted to X last year by the Republican National Committee’s social media team, in which she laughed over her mother’s old saying about falling out of a coconut tree, has since become one of her supporters’ main emblems; many TikTok users jokingly refer to their goal of promoting her as part of “Project Coconut.”If Kamala’s team is smart, they’ll have 🥥🌴 merch by tonight 😂😂😂 #KamalaHarris  • • Before you start, i don’t care… #Coconuttree #2024election #president “These are clearly clips that worked — people stopped and watched — but now with the addition of musical tracks and different edits, they’re being put into a new context,” Pearlman said. “A still image lasts only so long. But these fan edits … can fuel a whole narrative on their own.”Fancams began as a hallmark of K-pop superfans, who would splice together their favorite songs and stars into vibrant video collages to showcase their adoration and pride. They have since evolved into one of the more dominant genres on short-video platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels, encompassing not just entertainment but political advocacy. The format has become so pervasive it was parodied last year on “Saturday Night Live.”“K-pop paved the way for people to realize that fancams are a really good vehicle for people to express their excitement about someone,” said Don Caldwell, the editor in chief of Know Your Meme, a site that catalogues internet trends. “They get a lot of reach, and anytime you can get a lot of reach you’re able to potentially move the needle on public opinion.”Lynsey Yunker, a 28-year-old freelance social media worker in Seattle, took about 15 minutes on Sunday to stitch together a fan edit of Harris with the Chappell Roan song “Femininomenon,” saying she’d made it as “a form of self-expression” while she tried to make sense of the news.But as it quickly racked up attention online, including more than 6 million TikTok views, she began seeing impact in the form of comments like “I just registered to vote” and “hopefully society can meme her into presidency.”
Yunker called memes “a language” for her generation, comparing them to “a modern-day version of guerrilla marketing.” But she also said the videos’ mass appeal reflect a broader shift in energy among young liberals.
“We’re so used to just feeling like there’s nothing we can do ... and we have to just kind of laugh and watch,” she said. “This is the first time in a long time where we’ve thought maybe, maybe, fingers crossed, things could start turning around.”
Harris’s campaign has tried to ride the enthusiasm with its own social media activity, including by posting fancam-inspired videos to its rapidly growing TikTok account. Its most successful so far — juxtaposing photos of Harris at work with Trump playing golf, also set to “Femininomenon” — has been viewed more than 35 million times.
But some worry the campaign’s videos could backfire if their intensity turns off voters who see them as inside jokes for the terminally online. Jules Terpak, a content creator and digital strategist, said the Harris campaign needed to try hard not to undermine the trend’s sense of novelty and spontaneity, thereby spoiling the fun.
“It’s fine for Kamala HQ to tastefully lean into a meme or trend when it’s growing, but they need to be careful about leaning in too far and messing with the organic nature of the movement,” Terpak said.
Trump’s campaign, she said, had won viral success on TikTok by offering “fly-on-the-wall content” of the former president’s life. Rather than make their own fancams, Terpak said, Harris’s team could work to provide more raw material for fans online to create their own.
“Online marketers have learned over time that you have to let fans do what they’re going to do,” Pearlman said. “Otherwise you can come out looking like the out-of-touch substitute teacher saying, ‘You’re all that and a bag of chips.’”Jamie Cohen, a media professor at Queens College in New York, said the videos seemed to flourish by offering a lighthearted counter to the divisive “rage-baiting dumpster fire” that has grown to characterize political discourse online.For Gen Z voters, who have “only seen garbage when it comes to campaigns,” the fancams have helped highlight what he called Harris’s “endearing awkwardness” — her openness to “being herself and showing what others might traditionally think is cringe.”What made them especially powerful for Americans, he added, was that they were not crafted by a central campaign team but by the users themselves. “I actually don’t know where this is going, and that’s part of the joy,” he said.But the enthusiasm is not just among Americans. Ronnie Parsons, 16, used a booming rap song to make and post a Harris fan edit on Monday while bored on summer break — despite living in London, and therefore being unable to vote.Some of his 16,000 followers were surprised by the pivot from his usual videos about TV shows like “The Boys” and “Heartbreak High.” But Parsons said he felt nervous enough about Trump’s global impact that he wanted to apply his talents toward boosting Harris’s chances. His video, which drew comments like “PROJECT COCONUT IS A GO,” has since been viewed more than 250,000 times.
“As 16-year-olds, people act like we don’t necessarily have the life experience. But our videos can reach millions of people,” he said in an interview. “I just feel like, as Gen Z, we’re being taken more seriously on social media. Even just me getting on my laptop and posting can support the movement.”"
WaPo_21,Wildfire reaches resort town of Jasper as Alberta battles over 170 blazes,https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/25/jasper-wildfire-alberta-canada/,2024-07-25 18:00:02.702650,,"Wildfire reached the Canadian alpine resort town of Jasper on Wednesday evening as authorities reported more than 170 blazes across the western province of Alberta.There has been “significant loss” within the site of the town, Jasper National Park said in a post on social media. Thousands of people fled their homes after an evacuation order earlier this week.“Today has been an exceptionally difficult day for Jasperites, incident personnel and everyone who loves Jasper,” park authorities said.The authorities added that they are “sensitive that residents ... and those with connections to Jasper want to know the state of their homes, businesses, treasures and favourite places” but that they could not provide specific information about the damage Wednesday night.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wrote on social media late Wednesday that Alberta had requested federal assistance with the fires, adding that “we’re mobilizing every necessary resource available.”As of Wednesday afternoon, 59 of the fires were classified as “out of control” and more than 17,500 people were estimated to be under evacuation orders, according to the Alberta government.This summer’s outbreak of blazes comes after an unprecedented wildfire season in Canada last year, during which more than 45 million acres burned and smoke affected air quality in the country as well as large swaths of the United States.Wildfire was driven into Jasper, a popular tourist destination in the Canadian Rockies with a population of about 4,500, on Wednesday by “strong wind gusts from the south and southeast,” according to an earlier post from Jasper National Park. “If you have not yet evacuated town you must leave now,” it urged park visitors and residents, who were first ordered to evacuate Monday.Kimberly Getz, 38, regularly spent summer weekends in Jasper growing up and describes the town as small, friendly and “breathtakingly beautiful.” She watched the images coming out of the town in “shock and utter disbelief,” she said in a text message.Getz’s great-grandfather, Donald “Curly” Phillips, settled in Jasper in the early 1900s and helped it become a tourist destination, building boats and lodges and opening a fishing and mountaineering business there, she said.As the fire progresses, she’s worried about losing everything from her favorite candy store to the cabin her great-grandfather built. “It’s hard to even comprehend how much will be lost and how irreplaceable everything is,” she said.Getz’s aunt Lorri Anne Maley-Bell said she has “a lifetime of wonderful memories made in Jasper” and credits Jasper National Park with inspiring her to become an artist. She fears for the potential loss of life as flames engulf the town and says losing archives containing local history will “hit hard many Jasperites.”Katie Ellsworth, an incident commander with Parks Canada, told the Edmonton Journal that the wildfire “is significantly larger and more aggressive than the wildfires we’ve seen in the past few years,” and “has much closer proximity to the community.”By 8:30 p.m. local time, only some first responders could remain in Jasper because air quality had deteriorated to a level that required “wildland firefighters and others without self contained breathing apparatuses” to evacuate to a town nearby, park authorities said on social media.Up to 20 millimeters of rain is forecast in the next 24 hours, the park said, noting it could “help to reduce fire activity.” Earlier Wednesday, suppression efforts by helicopter bucketing were not effective and water bombers could not assist due to dangerous conditions."
WaPo_22,Sanctions crushed Syria’s elite. So they built a zombie economy fueled by drugs.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/interactive/2024/us-syria-civil-war-sanctions-drug-trafficking/,2024-07-25 17:00:02.702650,,"KOM AL-RAF, JORDAN
On clear days, the Syrian villages along the border here look deceptively empty. The Jordanian soldiers peering north across no man’s land see only dusty ghost towns where nothing moves except feral dogs and an occasional farmer working fields that have seen too little rain and too much war.
But on nights when the fog rolls in over the hills, the frontier takes on a sinister, alternate existence. Dozens of men — in trucks, on dirt bikes and on foot — emerge from the mist to form heavily armed columns for a race across the border.
They carry assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, even machine guns. Concealed in their vehicles and backpacks are hundreds of packages containing many tens of thousands of small white pills. The drugs, a synthetic stimulant called Captagon, are fresh from factories in the Syrian heartland that churn out an estimated $10 billion worth of illicit drugs each year.
In a country where traditional industry has all but ceased to exist, the pills are the fabulously profitable core of a zombie economy that has helped Syria’s political and military elite cling to power after 13 years of civil war and a decade of crushing sanctions. Having swollen to a massive scale with tacit government approval, according to U.S. and Middle Eastern officials, the trade increasingly threatens Syria’s neighbors, flooding the region with cheap drugs.
“If visibility is bad, they are coming — every single time,” said Col. Essam Dweikat, commander of a Jordanian Armed Forces unit responsible for defending the western sector of the country’s 200-mile border with Syria. “The problem is, the people who come across now are armed, and they are ready to fight.”
The U.S. government is putting more sanctions on foreign governments, companies and people than ever. But these powerful tools of economic warfare can have unintended consequences, hurting civilian populations and undermining U.S. foreign policy interests. The Money War investigates the proliferation of U.S. financial sanctions and the dangers of overuse.
Jordan has twice dispatched fighter jets into Syrian airspace to carry out strikes against smugglers and their safe houses, according to intelligence officials in the region — operations the government in Amman has not acknowledged publicly.
Yet, despite extraordinary efforts to stem the tide, billions of Captagon pills from dozens of manufacturing centers continue to pour across Syria’s borders and through its seaports. The trade’s ripple effects are expanding ever outward, to include rising levels of addiction in wealthy Persian Gulf countries and the appearance of drugmaking labs in neighboring Iraq and as far away as Germany, according to Iraqi and German officials.
Huge profits from the pills — which cost less than a dollar to make but fetch up to $20 each on the street — have attracted a host of dangerous accomplices, from organized crime networks to Iranian-backed militias in Lebanon, Iraq and Syria, according to U.S. and Middle Eastern intelligence officials. In recent months, smugglers began moving weapons as well as drugs, the officials said. Jordanian raids on smuggling convoys have netted rockets, mines and explosives apparently intended for Islamist extremists in Jordan or possibly for Palestinian fighters in Gaza and the West Bank.
Most profoundly, the drugs have provided a lifeline for the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has seized on Captagon as a way to stay in power, current and former U.S. officials said. As the United States and other Western countries ramped up pressure with sanctions — to hold Syrian officials accountable for war crimes or to pressure Assad to negotiate an end to the conflict — Syria’s ruling class found salvation in a small white pill, one that conferred massive profits and partial insulation from the punishment U.S. policymakers were serving up.
“This is the stream of revenue on which they are relying in the face of sanctions pressure from us and from the European Union,” said Joel Rayburn, the U.S. special envoy to Syria from 2018 to 2021. “The Assad regime could not withstand robust sanctions enforcement, except for Captagon. There is no other source of revenue that could make up for what they lost due to sanctions enforcement.”
The Syrian mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment. The Assad government has repeatedly denied having any involvement with illicit drugs, and in the past year, it announced arrests of several low-level traffickers and the seizure of small quantities of the white pills. Yet Treasury Department documents have identified close relatives of Assad — including his brother Maher al-Assad, commander of the Syrian army’s 4th Armored Division — as key participants in Captagon trafficking. Most of the pills are produced in regime-held areas and moved through borders and port facilities under government control.
A 2023 study extrapolating from known seizures of drugs since 2020 estimated that Captagon generates about $2.4 billion a year for the Assad regime, “well above any other single licit or illicit source of revenue,” wrote the authors at the Observatory of Political and Economic Networks, a nonprofit that conducts research on organized crime and corruption in Syria.

The industry’s rise illustrates the complexities of trying to change a foreign power’s violent repression by ratcheting up economic pressure on its leadership and business elites. U.S. officials and experts say sanctions remain the most powerful tool, short of war, for punishing a government that has been accused of numerous war crimes since Assad began brutally crushing a pro-democracy uprising in 2011.
The long list of offenses includes the systematic torture and executions of civilians, the deliberate targeting of hospitals and food distribution centers, and the killings of hundreds of women and children with outlawed sarin nerve gas, according to U.S. officials, U.N. investigations, and human rights and exile groups. Syria is officially listed by the United States as a sponsor of international terrorism and is regarded as an increasingly vital ally and strategic partner to Russia and Iran.
Assad has defied calls for his ouster while presiding over the destruction of this once moderately prosperous country of 22 million. At least 12 million Syrians are now refugees or internally displaced, and 90 percent of the country’s citizens live in poverty. The country’s GDP fell from a prewar high of $252 billion to just $9 billion in 2021, according to World Bank estimates. The economy continues to shrink, as does the life expectancy for young Syrians.
The emergence of industrial-scale Captagon production beginning around 2019 prompted U.S. officials and Congress to shift the focus of sanctions to specifically target the drug trade and its sponsors. In April, Congress approved legislation targeting Syria’s drug kingpins as part of the $95 billion bipartisan foreign aid package signed into law by President Biden. That followed a Treasury Department announcement of new sanctions against Syrian business executives with alleged ties to Captagon smuggling.
Yet Captagon production continues to soar, and Assad is unshaken and apparently wealthier than ever, U.S. officials acknowledge. While the sanctions imposed against his government enjoy broad support among Syrian opposition leaders and human rights advocacy groups, the experience of the past decade underscores a perplexing reality: While sanctions remain a vital tool for punishing criminal behavior by governments, the targets of sanctions inevitably find ways to blunt their impact, often with painful consequences for ordinary citizens.
“The most profound point is that sanctions strengthen the bad actor relative to the rest of the population,” said Ben Rhodes, the former deputy national security adviser for the Obama administration who worked on Syria policy in the early years of the civil war. “The people who are most able to withstand this are the people with guns and power.”
Syria’s Captagon crisis came on fast and hard.
A few well-connected Syrians and Lebanese nationals built the foundations for a vast drug empire amid the chaos of the country’s fragmentation.
Before the start of the conflict in 2011, Captagon was regarded as a niche product for a small number of crime groups in Lebanon and Turkey. These manufacturers developed a knockoff version of the drug that was first developed in the 1960s by a German pharmaceutical company and marketed under the Captagon brand. The original version combined amphetamine with a second drug that stimulates the central nervous system. It was used by German physicians to treat hyperactivity and depression until the 1980s, when U.S. regulators and the World Health Organization recommended outlawing it because of the high risk for abuse.
Beginning around 2018, U.S. and Middle Eastern officials said, cottage-scale manufacturing of the drug in Lebanon expanded to a handful of Syrian towns in a border region north of Damascus.
A key figure, according to Treasury Department sanctions documents, was Hassan Daqqou, a dual Syrian-Lebanese national and onetime car dealer who began buying up properties on both sides of the border for production centers and warehouses. Daqqou — dubbed the “King of Captagon” by the Lebanese news media — succeeded in building his empire through alliances with powerful friends within government and security circles in Syria and Lebanon.
Among his collaborators, U.S. and Middle Eastern officials said, were operatives with the Lebanese militia group Hezbollah as well top Syrian political and military leaders — not only Maher al-Assad, but also several Assad cousins and business executives close to the Syrian leader.
Two Biden administration officials, citing U.S. intelligence assessments, confirmed in interviews that Maher’s 4th Division has been an active participant in the Captagon trade since at least 2020, controlling distribution and transportation hubs, including port facilities in Latakia on the Syrian coast. Syrian control of operations increased after Daqqou was imprisoned in Lebanon for drug trafficking in 2021.
Biden administration officials say they have no evidence that Assad is personally directing the Captagon trade. But by naming his brother and cousins as key facilitators, U.S. officials made clear their view that drug manufacturing in Syria is now a state enterprise.
“Syria’s security forces now provide protection for drug traffickers,” said one Biden administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence assessments. White House officials believe Assad is now using Captagon as leverage with Arab states, offering to selectively restrict the flow of drugs as a reward to governments that normalize ties with Syria.
“It is clear that he could shut this down if he wanted to,” the administration official said.
Also clear is the massive scale of drug manufacturing in Syria, which U.S. officials say now produces most of the world’s Captagon supply. Administration officials say ingredients for the drug, such as amphetamine, are purchased legally from several countries, including Iran and India, and imported through Latakia. The precursor chemicals are mixed in factories and machine-pressed into tablets bearing a distinctive double-C logo.
Since the start of the decade, law enforcement agencies intercepted huge shipments of Syrian-made drugs in busts at ports in Italy, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Malaysia. In 2021, the Malaysian authorities discovered more than 95 million Captagon tablets hidden inside a cargo ship — a record haul with a street value of $1.2 billion that was routed through Malaysia to hide its ultimate destination: Saudi Arabia.
The biggest maritime busts showed smugglers going to extraordinary lengths to conceal their cargo. The 84 million tablets seized by customs officials in the Italian seaport of Salerno in 2020 had been hidden inside industrial-size spools of paper. Saudi police found millions of the white pills stashed inside containers of pomegranates and flour in separate incidents in August 2022 and April 2023. In one of the most recent attempts, uncovered by Dubai investigators this past September, drug traffickers hid 86 million pills inside prefabricated wooden panels and doors labeled for delivery to construction companies. Nearly all the pills were traced back to ports in Syria.
While it’s not technically accurate to call Syria a narco-state — Captagon is a stimulant, not a narcotic — the country has become so dependent on drug income that Assad would be hard-pressed to shut down the drug factories if he decided to, said Caroline Rose, a researcher who oversees the Special Project on the Captagon Trade at the New Lines Institute, a Washington nonprofit.
“They’ve taken Captagon to such a level that the industry can sustain itself,” Rose said. “It’s no longer mobile facilities, but permanent factories that can accommodate industrial-scale production. And on top of that, there’s an active security apparatus that provides guards, protection and support and even facilitates the movement of the drugs.
“It’s a perfect system,” she said.
For Syria’s neighbors, it’s a disaster.
Captagon has now become a drug of choice — and a public health crisis — among young people across the Middle East, making deep inroads in countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates where alcohol is banned or, for locals, proscribed. Habitual use brings addiction and a wide array of health problems, from insomnia and depression to hallucinations and heart problems, according to medical researchers.
The drug is also a tool for Islamist groups, including Islamic State militants, because it provides users with a burst of euphoric energy and a feeling of invincibility and emotional detachment on the battlefield. Some fighters call it “Captain Courage.”
Surging drug trafficking has forced Jordan to deploy hundreds of soldiers on its northern border. In the past year, Jordanian forces have waged running battles with groups of up to 100 traffickers that left multiple people dead and wounded on both sides.
On a recent late-winter afternoon near Kom al-Raf, a dozen soldiers in full combat gear traced the southern edge of no man’s land, checking for signs of breaches in the barrier system of berms and coiled concertina wire. As they walked, other soldiers stood guard from atop armored vehicles and watchtowers that have been erected at half-mile intervals along the perimeter road. In recent months, officers said, the smugglers had begun using drones to conduct surveillance or, in some cases, to ferry small parcels to confederates across the border.
But vastly more drugs are hauled overland. Near Kom al-Raf, a firefight in 2022 killed a Jordanian soldier when his patrol surprised a large column of smugglers — at least 68 gunmen on foot, according to the after-action report — as they attempted to cross in dense fog.

After a brief firefight, the smugglers fled back into Syria, leaving behind 100-pound packs filled with Captagon tablets as well as bolt-cutters and weapons, Jordanian officials said.
The convoy’s large size and willingness to engage a military patrol startled the Jordanians and prompted army commanders to adopt more aggressive measures.
“We’ve had to change our rules of engagement multiple times because their methods have changed,” Brig. Gen. Mustafa al-Hiyari said in an interview at the headquarters of the Jordanian Armed Forces, perched on a heavily fortified hilltop just outside Amman. “Smugglers generally don’t want to fight, but these are armed.”
Since 2020, the border region has seen at least a dozen armed clashes that resulted in deaths, injuries or arrests. One encounter in January resulted in the capture of 15 alleged traffickers, according to photos shown to The Washington Post. Jordanian officials said the men acknowledged during interrogations that they had undergone professional military training to qualify for the job of courier. At the time of the arrests, several were high on Captagon, the officials said.
In one of the most recent cases, Jordanian authorities tracked a suspected drug shipment last month as it traversed more than 100 miles of open highway before police swooped in at a border crossing with Saudi Arabia. Millions of pills were found hidden inside construction equipment bound for the gulf kingdom, officials said.
Based on interrogations and other evidence, Jordanian intelligence officials said they have concluded that the most recent bands of smugglers are linked to Iranian-backed Syrian militias, including some of the same groups that have fired rockets at U.S. forces based in eastern Syria. There is no evidence of direct involvement in drug trafficking by Tehran, but Iranian officials have provided weapons, money and intelligence to the groups.
U.S. and Jordanian officials say the militias may be responsible for the increasingly sophisticated weapons carried by traffickers. In several instances, smugglers have left caches of weapons inside Jordanian territory, possibly with the intention of providing them to other Iranian-backed militants in the West Bank or the Gaza Strip. The Post was shown photos of some of the hidden weapons, which included Claymore-type anti-personnel mines.
“The Iranian proxy groups operate like warlords,” constantly competing for fighters, better weapons and cash, said Charles Lister, director of counterterrorism programs at the Washington-based nonprofit Middle East Institute. “Drugs are just an easy way to make money and become more powerful than your neighbors.”
The U.S. policy of maintaining harsh sanctions enjoys broad bipartisan support. The toughest measures to date came in 2020, nine years after the start of the war and the same year that the first massive seizures of Captagon drugs were being recorded. The congressionally approved Caesar Act was named in honor of a Syrian military photographer and defector — known publicly only as “Caesar” — who used his camera to document the Assad regime’s torture and murder of more than 11,000 Syrian prisoners. The sanctions targeted the country’s largest remaining industrial sectors, including energy production and construction, and are explicitly intended to discourage international business agreements that could help Assad repair the country’s battered infrastructure.
As a means of inflicting well-deserved punishment on Syria’s leader, the sanctions are widely regarded as a triumph. Supporters of the measures warn that the world cannot “normalize” Assad or allow his regime to enrich itself through construction contracts to rebuild cities that Assad helped to depopulate and destroy.
The Caesar Act, together with this year’s Captagon sanctions, sends an important signal to the Assad regime and its allies that the United States is standing with ordinary Syrians, said Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a Washington-based nonprofit that advocates for victims of Syrian war crimes.
“There are strict humanitarian exceptions to ensure that no Syrian civilians, regardless of their political outlook, are harmed by these sanctions,” Moustafa said. “The sanctions are focused on the people who are harming ordinary Syrians with chemical weapons, torture and indiscriminate bombardment. The drugs were part of a deliberate strategy by these same people to ensure that they have a revenue source, and that they have complete control over it.”
Yet even the most ardent supporters acknowledge that no “victory” in Syria is completely clean.
While there may be few viable alternatives to sanctions, the measures always come with unwanted side effects — including the inevitable certainty that the elites of society will find ways to survive and even profit, said Peter Andreas, professor of international studies at Brown University and the author of a study on how sanctions increase illicit trade.
“The targets of sanctions, because their survival depends on it, are willing to go through all kinds of alliances to succeed,” Andreas said.
Sanctions can eventually “put the whole economy in an underworld,” he said. “It’s an unintended but very real and long-lasting consequence.”

WaPo_23,Kamala Harris’s first important decision: Her running mate,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/25/kamala-harris-vice-president-choice-shapiro-kelly/,2024-07-25 20:00:02.702650,,"Vice President Harris’s first major decision as the putative presidential nominee will be her running mate. She will need to balance a variety of considerations — personal compatibility, capacity to step into the presidency, geographic and ideological balance (or, conversely, ideological reinforcement, as Bill Clinton did in picking another moderate Southerner, Al Gore), ability to deliver a key state, media and campaign skills, and, finally, a background to complement the top of the ticket. While many names have been bandied about, four seem to be the most likely to make her short list.As a preliminary matter, I suspect she is unlikely to pick a lesser-known House member or another member of the Biden administration, such as Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. She likely wants to convey both that the Democratic ticket is in every way more qualified than the GOP duo and that she will pick her own administration, not simply inherit President Biden’s.However, the assumption that she should only consider White, male governors from states not on the coasts seems misplaced. Simply because two women have never run does not mean Harris necessarily must pick a White man. (After all, for most of our history two White men ran on both major party tickets.) Certainly, Democrats do not want to give up on male voters (a majority of whom vote Republican), who might like to see one man on the ticket. But a female candidate who checks many of the other boxes and who has herself won handily among both male and female voters should not be excluded.Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, for example, won 48 percent of male voters in her reelection race. She represents a critical swing state and brings tested executive experience. As the subject of a thwarted kidnapping and murder plot, she can be a powerful voice to deplore the rise of political violence and extremism. She has plenty of moxie, shines in interviews and, at 52 years old, emphasizes the relative youth of the ticket. Still, there will be many voices telling Harris that Whitmer is too risky and will only exacerbate Democrats’ problem with male voters.Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro will certainly also be on Harris’s short list. He comes from arguably the most important swing state, does offer gender balance and is well versed in emergency management, having handled the I-95 collapse and then the horrible assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump. Shapiro comes across as unflappable on TV. He trounced his Republican opponent in a purple state by double digits in 2022. Shapiro appears to be the best-known and favorite option among Democrats, but one wonders if the party wants to give up the governorship of such a critical state. Some voices have also questioned putting a Jewish politician on the list — as if that might represent “too much diversity.” Frankly, those uncomfortable with diversity likely won’t be voting for Harris anyway. And, in any event, religion is not the barrier for most voters it was decades ago. (Biden’s Catholicism was a nonissue in 2020.) Moreover, Shapiro, a vocal supporter of Israel, is the perfect counter to Trump’s antisemitic claim that American Jews are crazy or bad Jews if they vote for Democrats.If Harris is looking for more geographic diversity, Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina fits the bill. At the least, he might compel Republicans to spend money to contest his state. He’s seen as a moderate, has a 20-year friendship with Harris going back to their days as attorneys general of their states and has shown that Democrats, even in a conservative state, can stand up to culture war bullies. (Repealing the “bathroom bill,” Cooper argued, “For over a year now, House Bill 2 has been a dark cloud hanging over our great state. It has stained our reputation, it has discriminated against our people, and it has caused great economic harm in many of our communities.”) However, at 67 he does not exactly reinforce the message of “handing the baton to the next generation.”Finally, buzz has increased around Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.). A veteran Navy pilot and astronaut, he has been seen as a moderate on immigration. He has strong support among Hispanic voters (carrying 58 percent in 2022), and could put Arizona back in play. Along with his wife, Gabby Giffords, the victim of a near-fatal shooting, he has become an unstinting advocate for gun safety. Like Harris, he will be 60 at the time of the election, reinforcing the perception that these are mature, experienced public servants but not geriatric.If Harris wants to play it safe, she might be more inclined to go with Shapiro. If she wants to rebuild the Obama coalition, reinforcing her party’s standing with Hispanic voters and recapturing men who might be impressed with his military career, she might go with Kelly. Truth be told, any of these would be a capable No. 2 for her. And any of them would match up well against the awkward, extremist and unaccomplished Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio).As you might have noticed, the Democrats have an exceptionally deep bench. Another benefit of Harris’s ascension to the top of the ticket: A new Democratic star can emerge onto the national stage."
WaPo_24,"‘Not going to be nice’: Trump, Harris trade sharp attacks as 2024 race resets",https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/07/24/harris-trump-presidential-campaign/,2024-07-25 10:00:02.702650,,"INDIANAPOLIS — Vice President Harris, in a Wednesday address here, cast the election as a fight against “extremists” who want to take the country backward, delivering one of her first speeches as the likely Democratic nominee for president to women who represent the base voters she needs to energize.“We are not going back,” she told the crowd of thousands, to big cheers.Former president Donald Trump, her Republican opponent, took the stage a few hours later in Charlotte for his first rally since President Biden withdrew from the race. He portrayed Harris as a “radical” liberal, lobbing an assortment of attacks against her over immigration and other topics.“They say something happened to me when I got shot, I became nice,” Trump said, referencing the attempt on his life at a rally less than two weeks ago. He said his opponents were too dangerous. “If you don’t mind, I’m not going to be nice, is that okay?” The crowd roared its approval.The competing appearances provided a glimpse of what strategists in both parties expect to be a contentious matchup in the coming months. They offered a chance for each candidate to try to frame the stakes of the contest as it plunges into uncharted territory, with Trump no longer running against his ideal opponent and Harris seeking to take charge of the Democratic ticket a little more than 100 days before the election. Democrats are hoping that Harris can refocus the contest on Trump’s flaws, while Republicans want to quickly define Harris and saddle her with Biden’s weaknesses.Biden’s exit — triggered by a dismal June debate performance — has filled Democrats with new hope for November. In a Wednesday morning memo, Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said the vice president is less known than Trump and Biden and “opens up additional persuadable voters,” especially in groups that lean Democratic. “This race is more fluid now,” she wrote.Harris will select her running mate by Aug. 7, according to two officials familiar with her timeline, to ensure the full ticket is in place ahead of the Democratic National Convention virtual roll call. The date, which was approved Wednesday, is ahead of the convention later next month to ensure the ticket meets state ballot deadlines. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private deliberations.Trump’s team, meanwhile, is bracing for a “Harris honeymoon” that it says could intrude on Trump’s summer of momentum and polling gains. In a Tuesday memo, Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio predicted that Harris would see a polling bump starting in the next few days — but he said it would pass. With voters upset about inflation, the border and other issues, he wrote, the “fundamentals of the race stay the same.”A CNN poll published Wednesday found that Harris performed better than Biden against Trump, gaining more support from young voters, women, and Black and Hispanic voters. The poll showed Trump still apparently receiving more support, 49 percent to 46 percent for Harris, within the margin of error.Both the Harris and Trump events were held indoors. But the summer heat outside was still a factor, as more than a dozen people were transported from Trump’s Charlotte rally over medical concerns, said Grace Nelson, a spokesperson for the Mecklenburg EMS Agency, which serves the area. Nelson said the agency received calls about heat, fainting and general illness and transported one patient in critical condition.Harris arrived in Indianapolis just before noon on Wednesday and delivered a 15-minute keynote speech at the Grand Boulé, the national convention of the Zeta Phi Beta sorority. Zeta Phi Beta is one of the “Divine Nine,” a group of historically Black sororities and fraternities that includes Harris’s sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha.Women across the convention hall stood up to applaud several times throughout the speech. Some live-streamed the remarks on Facebook. They cheered loudest when Harris said, while discussing abortion rights, “When I am president of the United States … ”Harris praised Biden as “a leader with a bold vision” before moving on to her pitch. She ticked through policies such as a new government rule to remove medical debt from credit reports. She zeroed in on Project 2025, a conservative policy blueprint that is independent of the Trump campaign but counts many former Trump aides among its creators.Trump has aggressively tried to distance himself from Project 2025 as Democrats attack it, and over the weekend called it “seriously extreme.” Many of the project’s policy ideas overlap with Trump’s, but it also notably calls for more restrictions on abortion than Trump has advocated on the campaign trail. On Wednesday the former president wrote on social media, “I have nothing to do with, and know nothing about, Project 25.”Harris called Project 2025 “a plan to return America to a dark past.” The audience booed when she mentioned the initiative and laughed when she said, “Can you believe they put that in writing?”“In this moment, I believe we face a choice between two different visions of our nation,” Harris said. “One focused on the future, the other focused on the past. And with your support I am fighting for our nation’s future.”Democrats are hopeful that Harris — who is Black and Indian American and would be the first female president — can motivate key left-leaning constituencies in a way that Biden did not. The sorority Harris addressed is nonpartisan, but Black women have long been a key voting bloc for the Democratic Party. While the Divine Nine does not endorse candidates, officials say it will work aggressively to mobilize voters ahead of the election.In interviews, Black women gathered for the Grand Boulé said they were excited about Harris’s candidacy but also nervous about her chances. They worried that voters would hold her race and gender against her.“If you had your eyes closed and you just go based on her qualifications versus [Trump’s] qualifications, yes, she’d definitely win,” said Lora Rice, 55, from Georgia. “But they’re not going to do that.” She said Biden, “the White guy,” would have had a better shot.Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-Calif.), a Zeta who traveled with Harris, drew massive applause when she called for attendees to “reclaim the words that are being used against us, like diversity, equity, inclusion, justice, being the most qualified” — and said, “Let’s let our values lead us into a bold, Black and very female future from Kamala Harris.”Hillary Clinton, who made history as the country’s first female presidential nominee from a major party and lost to Trump in 2016, wrote in a New York Times op-ed that Harris’s “record and character will be distorted and disparaged” as she runs against Trump, and that “she and the campaign will have to cut through the noise.”Stacie NC Grant, the president of Zeta Phi Beta, said she was thrilled to have Harris speaking before the convention’s roughly 6,000 attendees. “It is hard to put into words what it feels like to be living history because that is where we are right now,” she said.“It’s a serendipitous moment,” Grant added.In Charlotte, Trump focused squarely on Harris, branding her “Lyin’ Kamala Harris” and “Border Czar” and bashing his old opponent, “Crooked Joe Biden,” mostly in passing. He called Harris “ultra liberal” and the “driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe.” He highlighted past comments, including her support for a ban on fracking.“Kamala, you’re fired!” he thundered at one point, riling up the crowd. Throughout his remarks, he mispronounced Harris’s first name — a pattern among prominent GOP politicians. Critics of the tactic have said they see it as an attempt to “otherize” Harris.Harris would be worse than Biden, Trump said, “because he’s a fake liberal.”“He wasn’t that liberal … she’s a real liberal,” Trump said — a remarkable pivot from his previous attacks on Biden.Trump also mocked Harris’s efforts to frame the race as a battle between a longtime prosecutor and a felon, a reference to Trump’s conviction in New York on charges of falsifying business records.“I don’t think people are going to buy it,” Trump said.Trump tends not to talk much about abortion at his rallies. But he defended his position on Wednesday, calling Harris a “radical” on the issue and saying he believes in exceptions to bans for cases of rape, incest and threat to the life of the mother. People close to Trump expect that Harris will be a more effective messenger on abortion than Biden was, The Washington Post previously reported.In her campaign memo, O’Malley Dillon laid out her case for confidence in Harris. She led the charge on abortion rights, an issue on which Democrats have demonstrated a clear political advantage. In Milwaukee on Tuesday, she drew the campaign’s largest crowd to date. Some $126 million in donations have flooded into the campaign since Sunday, when Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris.O’Malley Dillon said the campaign would continue its focus on the “blue wall” states — Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — as well as the Sun Belt battlegrounds of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina.“We intend to play offense in each of these states, and have the resources and campaign infrastructure to do so,” she wrote.Trump’s campaign is still trying to expand the map: The former president has another rally planned for Saturday evening in Minnesota, a state that Biden won by seven percentage points in 2020.Even as Trump’s campaign pivots to attacking Harris, the former president has tried to keep attention on Biden.“Does Lyin’ Kamala Harris think Joe Biden is fit to run the U.S.A. for the next six months? She must answer the question,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, his social media site, on Tuesday.MAGA Inc., the main super PAC supporting Trump, has started airing its first attack ad against Harris, accusing her of misleading voters about Biden’s health and also criticizing the Biden administration’s response to undocumented immigration and inflation.Biden gave a speech Wednesday night from the White House about his decision to bow out, saying “nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,” including “personal ambition.”When Trump and Harris might meet for a debate is not yet clear. Trump and Biden had planned to participate in an ABC debate in September, but Trump has backed away from the idea since Biden dropped out, saying he does not want ABC to host and would prefer Fox News. Fox News this week contacted the Trump and Harris campaigns about a possible Sept. 17 debate.After the sorority event, Harris went to Houston, where on Thursday she plans to speak to a convention of the American Federation of Teachers.Trump’s team, eager to needle Harris about immigration policy, quickly highlighted her planned proximity to the southern border. Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley put out a statement Wednesday criticizing Harris for not traveling to “see firsthand the results of her failed policies.”In a brief interview with WBT, a radio station in North Carolina, Trump appeared irritated at news reports that Harris had drawn more than 3,000 people to a Tuesday event in Wisconsin. Trump, who takes pride in his massive rallies, insisted without explanation that the number was too high and added, “If I ever had 3,000, they’d give me front-page headlines that nobody showed up.”Trump returned to the topic later at his rally, still irked. “The fake news said, ‘Ohhh, her crowd was amazing!’” he said, adding later: “They never mention our crowds.”Trump has several events lined up later this week. He plans to speak Friday evening in West Palm Beach, Fla., at an event hosted by the conservative group Turning Point Action. On Saturday, he will deliver a keynote speech at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, underscoring his newfound interest in cryptocurrency. Trump was once skeptical of cryptocurrency but has embraced it after aggressive lobbying by executives in the industry.Knowles reported from Washington. Kornfield reported from Charlotte.

WaPo_25,"In Vance’s ‘Hillbilly’ home, his story rings true — but not always his message",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/25/jd-vance-hillbilly-elegy-jackson-kentucky/,2024-07-25 18:00:02.702650,,"JACKSON, Kentucky — Deep in a quiet mountain holler called Panbowl Branch, outside a decaying town of 2,000 in one of America’s poorest counties, sits a ramshackle red brick home. The roof is roughly patched with torn tarps, the front porch is heaped with discarded goods and the yard is littered with cars and boats in disrepair.Three decades ago, this home sheltered a young J.D. Vance as he fled a tumultuous life in Ohio to spend summers with his grandparents — a period he cited as pivotal to his success in his speech last week accepting the vice-presidential nomination. Today, the battered house sits amid a community that has suffered deeper decline since Vance described the region’s ruin eight years ago in “Hillbilly Elegy,” his bestseller, which was turned into a 2020 film.Vance’s experience with a dysfunctional extended Appalachian family here and in Ohio formed the backbone of the book, as he recounted how generations of abuse and violence had shaped him and his relatives. It includes tales of his uncle nearly killing a man by slicing him with an electric saw and his grandmother soaking his grandfather with gasoline and lighting him on fire.Those dramatic stories primarily involve Vance’s close relatives — who are either deceased or did not respond to requests for comment. The incidents aren’t documented in court records in a community often loath to involve authorities in family disputes, but numerous friends and neighbors who are close to Vance’s family said they don’t doubt that the stories are broadly true.What many in Jackson take issue with, though, are the conclusions that Vance reached in “Hillbilly Elegy” about the root causes of the area’s poverty and violence. In the book, Vance argues that a lack of personal responsibility is partly to blame, writing that “Public policy can help, but there is no government that can fix these problems for us.”In fact, many in Jackson say government help is a key lifeline in a distressed region. At Jackson’s city hall, on a downtown street near closed-up storefronts, Mayor Laura Johnson ticked off the recent run of calamities that have required help from federal agencies: After the steep decline of coal-mining came the pandemic and then two successive historic floods in 2021 and 2022.“Unfortunately, I would say that since I’ve been in office, we’ve had one disaster after another,” said the mayor, who is starting her sixth year in the nonpartisan job. “So it’s been hard to govern.”Although registered Democrats vastly outnumber Republicans in Breathitt County, Trump won the 2020 vote here by a margin of more than 3-to-1, according to election records.Vance himself has seemingly shifted his rhetoric on what ails Jackson and other poor, mostly White parts of the United States, a change that mirrors the Republican Party that once preached personal responsibility becoming one that has focused more on the populism of former president Donald Trump, in which elites can be blamed for the problems of the working class. In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night, Vance blamed big businesses for decimating towns where he grew up — not the residents who live there.“America’s ruling class wrote the checks. Communities like mine paid the price,” Vance, 39, told the crowd in Milwaukee.Vance’s spokesman did not respond to a list of questions from The Washington Post for this story.For those still living in Jackson, as Vance’s family did for generations before his grandparents moved to Ohio in search of better opportunities, his stories in “Hillbilly Elegy” echo truths about life in this hardscrabble region — but don’t offer the easy answers for relieving them that his political career has harnessed.Vance describes “Hillbilly Elegy” as “a fully accurate portrait of the world I’ve witnessed,” writing that while he changed the names of some people, there are no composite characters. Where possible, he wrote, he “corroborated the details with documentation” such as letters — but noted, “I am sure this story is as fallible as any human memory.”Vance’s family traces its roots deep into rural Kentucky, back to legendary fights between the Hatfields and the McCoys. One ancestor was a powerful Democrat and county attorney, another oversaw the local jail, but most were poor. Times were so bad in the 1940s that Vance’s grandparents, Bonnie and James, whom he calls Mamaw and Papaw, left Jackson for Middletown, Ohio, an industrial town 200 miles away. His grandmother was 14 years old and pregnant and his grandfather was 17 years old, Vance wrote. The baby died days after birth.But life in Middletown could be as violent as in Jackson. Vance wrote that Mamaw warned Papaw that “she’d kill” her husband if he came home drunk. When Papaw did exactly that and fell asleep on the couch, Mamaw “calmly retrieved a gasoline canister from the garage, poured it all over her husband, lit a match, and dropped it on his chest,” Vance wrote. Papaw “burst into flames” and was saved by a daughter who doused him. (The incident, which may have happened more than 50 years ago, was not found in available court documents.)Vance’s mother, Beverly, was raised in Middletown and gave birth to Vance in 1984. Vance writes bitingly about his mother’s failings, particularly her heroin use, and she married five men who often were absent in his life. (His mother has been sober for a decade, and appeared with Vance at the Republican National Convention last week).In what Vance described as a turning point in his life, his mother got so angry while driving with him that “she pulled over to beat the s--- out of me.” Vance escaped to a nearby house, where he said he told the resident that “My mom is trying to kill me.” His mother was arrested on charges of domestic violence, a misdemeanor, Vance wrote. But when the case went to court, Vance said he lied to keep his mother out of jail, saying nothing happened, and the matter was dismissed. The Post could find no records of the case.The confrontation with his mother led Vance to move in with Mamaw, who lived in a nearby house in Middletown. Vance said that during his early childhood, he traveled every summer with Mamaw to Jackson, a pilgrimage he made until he was 12 years old. Vance wrote that while his childhood address was in Ohio, he considered “my home” to be the ancestral homestead “in the holler, in Jackson, Kentucky.”“Most of the horrific episodes were in Middletown,” Michael Rose, who has long known the family, said in an interview at the department store Rose’s family has long owned in Jackson. “That’s why this place was special to him, because he was getting away from them here.”Vance’s great-grandmother lived in the modest brick home in Panbowl Branch, with a large screened porch through which Vance regularly dashed to the nearby creek. And it was here that he heard tales of his family’s brutal past.In one episode, Vance wrote about a man he called Uncle Pet, who he said got in an argument with a man nicknamed “Big Red” who called him a “son of a bitch.” Pet “pulled the man from his truck, beat him unconscious, and ran an electric saw up and down his body. “Big Red nearly bled to death” but didn’t press charges, Vance wrote. Pet was identified by family members who spoke to The Post as Vance’s uncle Blaine Blanton, Jr., who died in 2007. The identity of Big Red was unclear.The story was so sensational that it prompted Stephen Bowling, the Breathitt County library director whose cousins lived across the road from Vance’s ancestors, to research court records and newspaper archives for any evidence. He found none.“That doesn’t mean that didn’t happen, because numerous members of the family said it did happen,” Bowling said in an interview at his Jackson office. “It’s hard for people who aren’t from here to understand. There’s a mountain chivalry where you might assault me today, I’m not going to press charges, but the opportunity will present itself when I can repay the favor. So there are lots and lots and lots of those type of incidents that aren’t reported.”Indeed, Bowling said Vance was “rather generous” in writing about his family and could have told about much worse incidents — a view shared by numerous others here. Mark Wireman, a Jackson resident who has long known the family, said the book was “tame” based on his knowledge.As a Yale law student, Vance organized a reading group to study why many in the White working class, unlike his grandparents, did not leave Appalachia. Writing in 2013 to classmates, he said they should learn “why these general trends seem to affect the white working class so acutely,” according to an email reviewed by The Post.Three years later, those same musings were woven into the fabric of “Hillbilly Elegy,” which uses tales of Vance’s tumultuous family to draw broader conclusions about what afflicts the White working class.In the book, Vance writes with deep sympathy for those who couldn’t escape the cycles of poverty, as he did, but also argues many of the community’s enduring problems are self-inflicted. He tells the story of a man he calls “Bob,” whom he met one summer working at a tile factory. The 19-year-old with a pregnant girlfriend missed work, was often late — and then blamed managers when he was fired. There is no way to verify that story, which Vance argued demonstrated there are “too many young men immune to hard work.”As the book sold hundreds of thousands, it resonated deeply with conservatives — particularly as Donald Trump ascended to the White House on a swell of White working class support. Vance was called a Trump interpreter, even though he was highly critical of him at the time.But in his ancestral hometown, some Jackson residents who know Vance’s family said the experience he described in the book didn’t reflect their own and said some of his conclusions perpetuated unfair stereotypes.While the book may be an accurate portrait of Vance’s family, “that does not mean that it’s a portrait of my family or every family in Appalachia,” said Bowling, who is also a leading historian of the area. “It became so easy in 2016 for pundits to extrapolate, ‘This is the Appalachian experience. This is what happens to everybody who’s raised in the mountains.’ And that’s not the case at all.”Anthony Harkins, a professor of history at Western Kentucky University who has studied Appalachia for 30 years, said that Vance did a disservice to those trying to build opportunities in the region by relying on anecdotal tales and discredited economic theories.“The idea that he should be a voice of an entire 13-state region with differences, that his own story is indicative of a broader society, I find that very problematic,” said Harkins, who co-edited a 2019 response to Vance’s book called “Appalachian Reckoning: A Region Responds to Hillbilly Elegy.” “He reinforces stereotypes of poverty and frames it as an individual choice instead of larger socioeconomic forces.”Vance also faced some blowback for never being a full-time Kentucky resident — a view captured by a 2016 opinion piece in the Lexington Herald-Leader titled, “Author too removed from culture he criticizes.”But few in Jackson have bristled at that part of Vance’s identity as he’s risen to U.S. Senator and now Republican vice-presidential nominee while claiming the “hillbilly” mantle.Rose said he believes the criticism has come mostly from locals who reacted to the title without fully reading the book. “People here, we can call ourselves ‘hillbilly.’ Somebody else calls us hillbilly, it’s go time. So if they see a book that says ‘Hillbilly Elegy,’ they think, that’s somebody from up North attacking us,” said Rose, noting that instead, Vance had deep roots in the area.With Vance now potentially poised for higher office, many in Jackson are wondering anew what his elevation could mean for a region that remains desperately poor.The coal-mining backbone of the economy, still evident on scarred hillsides, has long since declined. An epidemic of addiction, overdoses and deaths has swept the region. Breathitt County is often listed as one of America’s 10 poorest, and the most recent unemployment rate was 8.4 percent, compared with 4.1 percent nationally. Hundreds of residents have left the county in recent years, mainly in search of jobs, just as Vance’s grandparents did 80 years ago.Johnson, the mayor, said the message she heard from Vance is that “He came from a bad situation and he has become very successful, obviously on his own, without the government propping him up. And so why aren’t we doing that more here?”But that kind of leap isn’t possible for many without some aid, especially when economic and natural disasters repeatedly assail the area. “We can whine about who was the poorest and who walked the furthest barefoot and all that stuff,” she said. “I get the message, but I also get that you have to have some basic level of support.”While stressing that she wanted to sound positive and hopeful, she said she wondered if places such as Jackson will still receive Vance’s attention now that he is a national candidate.“Given his agenda, do you think that’s on his list?” she asked, adding, “I would certainly hope so.”Bowling, the library director, said that while the region had become “dependent on aid” through federal programs, there is a real need for government to be a “regulating, calming, encouraging entity.”As Vance has shifted from Trump critic to full-fledged MAGA vice-presidential candidate, he’s embraced Trump’s protectionist and populist views on the economy. While accepting the vice-presidential nomination last week, he castigated President Biden for supporting trade deals that “destroyed even good American middle-class manufacturing jobs.”His speech didn’t touch on the individual failings of people like “Bob” that featured in Hillbilly Elegy’s narrative.Miles away from the now-dilapidated Vance family ancestral home outside Jackson, around hairpin curves and past some mountain homesteads, his family’s cemetery is all but hidden in the woods, holding a spot where Vance has said he wants to be buried near his Mamaw and Papaw. Their graves are marked with a large headstone with the name “Vance” and the phrase, “Beyond The Sunset” — the title of an old country song about the hereafter.On the afternoon of Vance’s acceptance speech, Wireman, the family friend and the mayor’s brother, visited the remote site and said it proved wrong those who said Vance is not really of this place.“The pushback that says he’s not from around here, he’s not one of us,” Wireman said, shaking his head. “But we’re standing here. Right there’s his people. His blood.”Alice Crites and Hannah Natanson contributed to this report"
WaPo_26,Carolyn Hax: Brother-in-law and his wife go on about themselves. And that’s it.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/07/25/carolyn-hax-in-laws-talk-themselves/,2024-07-25 12:00:02.702650,,"Adapted from an online discussion.Dear Carolyn: My wife and I recently moved back to the area where she grew up, near her brother and his wife. When we’re at a family gathering with them, they never express any interest in our lives or our children’s lives by asking questions, but love to talk at us about their interests and possessions. The conversation usually runs out when we are done asking them questions.Is it possible to politely bring up the lack of interest in our lives without offending them, or is it even worthwhile attempting to change the trajectory of our relationships?— In-LawsIn-Laws: Seems kind of pointless. If they’re not interested, then they’re not interested. Or they’re self-centered, or bad at conversation, both of which tend to change only when they’ve made themselves the targets of hard inner work.What you can do is throw in a question like this here and there: “Would you like to know what the kids are up to?” Ha — defy them to say no!But seriously, it’ll give you a tiny little platform for a quick update: “Ralphie is enjoying his official Red Ryder BB gun, and here, look at this picture of Randy trying to move his arms in his snowsuit.” Then they can glaze over and nod as you refresh your mental note that these are people you are related to, not emotionally connected to. One doesn’t guarantee the other.Or, they can grab your conversational lifeline, make approving noises — not everyone has even the most rudimentary social skills, after all, and it’s not helpful to anyone to assume they do — and maybe even form some basic follow-up questions about you.In other words, if they’re just a little lost or awkward, then your pointed question will give them some needed direction. At worst, it’ll just go cold between you like an unclaimed hot hors d’oeuvre.Best to go into all these encounters just not expecting you’ll ever be close, but letting your effort give them a chance.Dear Carolyn: I recently got married. Right after the ceremony, my in-laws started addressing me as “Mrs. MyHusband’sLastname,” with great, fond emphasis on the “Mrs.”I know they are doing it with affection, as a signal that I am one of them, a member of their tribe. It’s sweet — except I don’t intend to change my name. Telling them this sounds a little snotty, especially now that I have let it go for a couple of months. How do I set the record straight without rejecting them?— Newly MarriedNewly Married: It’s not snotty to have your own name.Next time one of them calls you “Mrs. Husband’sLastname” or addresses something to you that way, explain that you’re still Ms. YourLastname and hope you haven’t unintentionally misled them. “You have welcomed me into your family so fondly, I didn’t want to mistakenly correct someone on an endearment.” Meaning, proceed as if they’ve known this all along, of course, they’re just goosing you.Your husband also had a couple of months’ worth of opportunities to clear this up with his parents. Why hasn’t he taken any of them?"
WaPo_27,How four U.S. presidents unleashed economic warfare across the globe,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2024/us-sanction-countries-work/,2024-07-25 17:00:02.702650,,"Scroll to continue
In Cuba, sanctions imposed by the United States more than 60 years ago have failed to dislodge the communist regime — but they’ve made it more difficult to get critical medical supplies to the island.
In Iran, U.S. sanctions that date to the 1970s have not forced out Tehran’s theocratic rulers — but they have pushed the country to forge close alliances with Russia and China.
In Syria, dictator Bashar al-Assad remains in power despite 20 years of U.S. sanctions — but the country is struggling to rebuild from civil war, and more Syrians than ever are expected to need critical humanitarian assistance this year.
In country after country, sanctions have emerged as the key instrument of U.S. foreign policy.
Today, the United States imposes three times as many sanctions as any other country or international body, targeting a third of all nations with some kind of financial penalty on people, properties or organizations. They have become an almost reflexive weapon in perpetual economic warfare, and their overuse is recognized at the highest levels of government. But American presidents find the tool increasingly irresistible.
By cutting their targets off from the Western financial system, sanctions can crush national industries, erase personal fortunes and upset the balance of political power in troublesome regimes — all without putting a single American soldier in harm’s way.
But even as sanctions have proliferated, concern about their impact has grown.
In Washington, the swell of sanctions has spawned a multibillion-dollar industry. Foreign governments and multinational corporations spend exorbitant sums to influence the system, while white-shoe law firms and K Street lobbying shops have built booming sanctions practices — in part by luring government officials to cash in on their expertise.
Elsewhere, sanctions have pushed autocratic regimes into black market trade, empowering criminal networks and gangs of smugglers. U.S. adversaries are ramping up their efforts to work together to circumvent the financial penalties. And like military action, economic warfare can leave collateral damage: Sanctions on Venezuela, for instance, contributed to an economic contraction roughly three times as large as that caused by the Great Depression in the United States.
Sanctions — or even just the threat of them — can be an effective policy tool, a way to punish bad behavior or pressure an adversary without resorting to military force. Sanctions have allowed U.S. governments to take moral, economically meaningful stands against perpetrators of war crimes. They helped bring an end to South Africa’s apartheid regime and contributed to the eventual overthrow of Serbian dictator Slobodan Milosevic. Even when they fail, proponents say, they can be preferable to the alternative, which might be doing nothing — or going to war.
Still, North Korea has been sanctioned for more than a half-century without halting Pyongyang’s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles. U.S. sanctions on Nicaragua have done little to deter the authoritarian regime of President Daniel Ortega. Two years of sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine have degraded Moscow’s long-term economic prospects and raised the costs of military production. But these sanctions have also spawned a “dark fleet” of ships selling oil outside international regulations, while bringing the Kremlin into closer alliance with Beijing.
Alarm about sanctions’ rise has reached the highest levels of the U.S. government: Some senior administration officials have told President Biden directly that overuse of sanctions risks making the tool less valuable. And yet, despite recognition that the volume of sanctions may be excessive, U.S. officials tend to see each individual action as justified, making it hard to stop the trend. The United States is imposing sanctions at a record-setting pace again this year, with more than 60 percent of all low-income countries now under some form of financial penalty, according to a Washington Post analysis.
“It is the only thing between diplomacy and war and as such has become the most important foreign policy tool in the U.S. arsenal,” said Bill Reinsch, a former Commerce Department official and now the Scholl chair in international business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.
“And yet,” Reinsch said, “nobody in government is sure this whole strategy is even working.”
Economic warfare has been around for millennia: Ancient Athens imposed trade sanctions on its adversaries in the 4th century B.C., and U.S. presidents have restricted foreign trade since the dawn of the republic. In 1807, Thomas Jefferson closed U.S. ports to export shipping and restricted imports from Britain. Today’s sanctions have their foundation in laws passed during the Cold War and World War I.
The U.S. government is putting more sanctions on foreign governments, companies and people than ever. But these powerful tools of economic warfare can have unintended consequences, hurting civilian populations and undermining U.S. foreign policy interests. The Money War investigates the proliferation of U.S. financial sanctions and the dangers of overuse.
Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 gave rise to a new form of the weapon: an international blockade of exports to Iraq. After the Gulf War, comprehensive sanctions made it impossible for Iraq to export oil or import supplies to rebuild its decimated water and electrical systems, and illnesses such as cholera and typhoid surged.
At the same time, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States was emerging as the world’s unrivaled superpower, both financially and militarily. Governments and banks around the world were dependent on the U.S. dollar, which remains the dominant currency on Earth.
Today, the dollar buys access to the American economy but also undergirds international trade even when there is no connection to an American bank or business. Commodities like oil are priced globally against the greenback, and countries trading in their own currencies rely on dollars to complete international transactions.
That financial supremacy creates a risk for U.S. adversaries and even some allies. To deal in dollars, financial institutions must often borrow, however temporarily, from U.S. counterparts and comply with the rules of the U.S. government. That makes the Treasury Department, which regulates the U.S. financial system, the gatekeeper to the world’s banking operations.
And sanctions are the gate.
Treasury officials can impose sanctions on any foreign person, firm or government they deem to be a threat to the U.S. economy, foreign policy or national security. There’s no requirement to accuse, much less convict, anyone of a specific crime. But the move makes it a crime to transact with the sanctioned party.
Coming under U.S. sanctions amounts to an indefinite ban from much of the global economy.
The system built slowly. Initial targets (in addition to communist Cuba) were drug cartels in places like Mexico and Colombia and rogue regimes like Libya. As recently as the 1990s, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) was responsible for implementing just a handful of sanctions programs. Its staff fit comfortably in a single conference room. One of its major responsibilities was blocking American sales of Cuban cigars.
All that changed after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Congress enacted legislation to compel financial institutions to maintain records of consumer transactions and hand them over to law enforcement. Suddenly, U.S. officials had volumes of information on the world’s banking customers, just as the rise of digital banking gave new insights into the worldwide flow of money.
As the Treasury Department became a key player in the global war on terrorism, U.S. policymakers began to understand the power of the nation’s financial hegemony. Experts urged a more sophisticated approach than the blunt embargo used in Iraq. “Smart sanctions,” these advocates hoped, would be more precise, applying maximum pressure by cutting off only malicious actors.
Proof of concept soon materialized. In 2003, North Korea alarmed the world by withdrawing from a nuclear weapons treaty. Treasury officials under President George W. Bush not only targeted the Macao bank that processed payments for Pyongyang, but also threatened any banks that traded with that one.
North Korean officials howled — and the measures stymied Pyongyang’s finances. The episode was a revelation for Treasury staffers: America appeared to have cowed a foe halfway around the world without firing a single bullet or spending a single penny.
“It was a pivotal moment,” said Kristen Patel, who served in senior roles at the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network from 2015 to 2017 and now teaches sanctions policy and illicit finance at Syracuse University. “Treasury got the go-ahead to start pounding things with this hammer.”
The playbook soon shifted to include bigger targets and more aggressive enforcement. In 2010, President Barack Obama worked with Congress to approve sanctions designed to force Iran to give up its nuclear ambitions. The Justice Department began levying billions of dollars in fines on Western banks that defied Treasury prohibitions.
These sanctions applied not just to Iran, but also to firms trading with Iran, undercutting Tehran’s links to international markets. Iranian leaders buckled, deciding to seek a nuclear deal that promised an end to financial isolation.
This display of power led to fresh demand. By Obama’s second term, sanctions had been imposed on a growing list that included military officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo, suppliers of the Yemeni military, Libyan officials connected to Moammar Gaddafi and — after a brutal crackdown on civilian protesters in Syria — President Bashar al-Assad.
Congress got in on the act, flooding the State Department and the White House with requests for sanctions that, in some cases, appeared intended to cut off foreign competition to home-state industries.
In 2011, at a holiday party in the Hotel Harrington in downtown Washington, Adam Szubin, then director of OFAC, sang a song titled “Every Little Thing We Do Is Sanctions” to the tune of “Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic” by the Police, Szubin confirmed in an email.
Some experts saw the surge as spiraling out of control.
“Smart sanctions were meant to be a buffet of choices where you fit the particular imposed sanction to the offense and vulnerability of the country,” said George Lopez, a sanctions scholar at the University of Notre Dame who is widely credited with helping to popularize the idea more than 20 years ago. “Instead, policymakers walked into the buffet and said, ‘I’m going to pile everything onto my plate.’”
In 2014, Russia’s illegal invasion and annexation of Crimea from Ukraine presented Treasury with a huge challenge. Countries like North Korea and Iran were viewed as serious national security threats, but nobody believed they were integral to global finance. Now Treasury was forced to confront one of the 10 biggest economies in the world. A wrong move could send global markets reeling.
Treasury aides who had once labored in obscurity took recommendations directly to Cabinet officials, who were simultaneously hearing from alarmed Fortune 500 CEOs and the heads of Wall Street banks. Sanctions were suddenly a key feature in the reemerging “great power” competition among Washington, Beijing and Moscow.
“You’d get requests and comments from seemingly every corner of the government: ‘Why have you not imposed sanctions on these people? And what about those people?’” said Adam M. Smith, who served as senior adviser to OFAC and director for multilateral affairs on the National Security Council during the Obama administration.
“Regardless if you were a Democrat or a Republican, the thought process was always: Why would you not continue to do this?” Smith said.
But government officials began to notice problems with Treasury’s complicated new regime. Sanctions on Russia targeting allies of President Vladimir Putin and state banks had no apparent effect on control of Crimea. European leaders grew angry over fines levied on their banks. Wall Street power brokers started to grumble about the costs of complying with the dizzying new instructions.
The number of sanctioned entities appeared to be growing too fast for OFAC to keep up. Nuance bred confusion; requests for clarification poured in, and the number of lawsuits against the agency tripled. Turnover intensified, as the rising stakes allowed Treasury staffers to bolt for private-sector paydays that could quadruple their earnings.
A more existential challenge emerged, as well: The power of sanctions lay in denying foreign actors access to the dollar. But if sanctions make it risky to depend on dollars, nations may find other ways to trade — allowing them to dodge U.S. penalties entirely.
In March 2016, Obama Treasury Secretary Jack Lew warned publicly of “sanctions overreach” and the risk that their “overuse could ultimately reduce our capability to use sanctions effectively.”
And yet the incoming Trump administration again found new uses for the financial weapon as it applied more sanctions than ever. As president, Donald Trump used sanctions for retribution in ways never conceived — ordering them, for instance, on officials with the International Criminal Court after it opened a war crimes investigation into the behavior of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
The Trump administration also hit Venezuela with crippling sanctions, aiming to discredit the dictatorship of Nicolás Maduro and encourage an opposition movement. The penalties failed to oust Maduro — and are now often blamed for exacerbating one of the worst peacetime economic collapses in modern history.
“The abuse of this system is ridiculous, but it’s not Treasury or OFAC’s fault: They are good professionals who have all this political work being shoved on them. They want relief from this relentless, never-ending, you-must-sanction-everybody-and-their-sister, sometimes literally, system,” said Caleb McCarry, who served as a senior staffer to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and was the State Department’s lead on Cuba policy during the George W. Bush administration. “It is way, way overused, and it’s become out of control.”
By the time of Biden’s inauguration, a consensus had emerged among his transition team that something had to change.
In the summer of 2021, five Treasury staffers worked up an internal draft proposing to restructure the sanctions system. It ran roughly 40 pages, according to two people involved, and would have represented the most substantial revamp of sanctions policy in decades.
But like the three previous administrations, Biden’s team found the power difficult to give up.
Treasury staffers watched their bosses take out key parts of their plan, including a provision that would have created a central coordinator, said the people familiar with the document, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reflect confidential discussions. By the time Treasury publicly released its “2021 Sanctions Review” in October that year, the 40-page draft had dwindled to eight pages and contained the earlier document’s most toothless recommendations, the people said. (Two people familiar with the matter blamed internal disagreements with the State Department for the extent of the changes. A State Department spokesman declined to comment.)
Four months later, Russian troops marched into Ukraine, and Biden unleashed an unprecedented volley of more than 6,000 sanctions in two years. And not only on Russia: The Biden administration has penalized targets including Israeli settlers in the West Bank, former government officials in Afghanistan, alleged fentanyl dealers in Mexico and a North Macedonian spyware company. Meanwhile, sanctions that Biden had said he would ease, such as those imposed by Trump on Cuba, were largely maintained under pressure from Capitol Hill, despite the view among top administration officials that the embargo is counterproductive and a failure.
The Biden administration has taken steps to mitigate unintended consequences. Last year, Treasury announced it had hired economists to staff a new division analyzing the economic impact of sanctions. Humanitarian groups have praised Biden administration efforts to ensure that critical medical supplies and food can enter countries under sanctions. And some of critics’ worst fears have not materialized: The dollar remains the world’s top reserve currency, at least for now.
“Sanctions are an important tool that can help promote our national security, but they should only be used as part of a broader foreign policy strategy,” Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in a statement. “The 2021 Treasury Sanctions Review has provided a useful road map to help us refine the use of this important tool.”
But other problems appear to be getting worse. Current and former U.S. officials describe OFAC’s workload as overwhelming, the agency inundated with tens of thousands of requests from the private sector. Some White House officials have outsourced national security questions to nonprofits, as they brainstormed scenarios in which sanctions would have to be massively ramped up to confront U.S. adversaries, according to two people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal talks.
In late 2022, senior White House advisers again held discussions about reforming U.S. sanctions. In closed-door talks that included Biden, aides talked about the need to set guidelines for economic statecraft, including limiting the use of sanctions to moments when “core international principles that underpin peace and security are under threat,” one of the officials said.
But those ideas were shelved in the face of more pressing demands.
“The mentality, almost a weird reflex, in Washington has just become: If something bad happens, anywhere in the world, the U.S. is going to sanction some people. And that doesn’t make sense,” said Ben Rhodes, who served as deputy national security adviser in the Obama administration.
“We don’t think about the collateral damage of sanctions the same way we think about the collateral damage of war,” Rhodes said. “But we should.”

To examine the rise of U.S. sanctions, The Post obtained and analyzed 30 years of historical data scraped from the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control by Enigma Technologies, a data and entity resolution company that specializes in sanctions screening and business intelligence. Reporters compared U.S. sanctions with those issued by other authorities using data provided by Castellum.ai, a compliance platform covering global sanctions, export controls and other financial crime risks.
The Post used the Global Sanctions Database, an academic project coordinated by the Hochschule Konstanz University of Applied Sciences, the Austrian Institute of Economic Research and the Drexel University School of Economics, to determine which countries were subject to U.S. sanctions from 1950 to 2022. The World Bank income classification framework helped reporters assess whether low-income countries had been targeted more than others; the bank’s regional classification helped illustrate which regions had been targeted."

WaPo_29,J.D. Vance can’t go back in time — and neither can the rest of us,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/25/vance-economics-politics/,2024-07-25 20:00:02.702650,,"For one of the youngest vice-presidential candidates ever nominated, J.D. Vance sounds a little crotchety. His convention speech last week pined for an America that the 39-year-old himself never knew — a land before drugs and deindustrialization ravaged the Rust Belt, when housing was cheap and families were intact, and proud American craftsmen made the world’s best products with their own hands.Of course, there’s nothing wrong in wishing for things you don’t remember —  if they were really good, as many things were during the United States’ manufacturing boom: There were job opportunities, families formed easily and people felt support from society. I have sympathy for Vance’s desire to “put people to work making real products for American families.”The problem is that Donald Trump cannot bring those days back. And I suspect Vance is too smart to truly believe the former president could.It’s not just that economies have become too complicated to take apart and reassemble in some simpler, more desirable form. It’s also that American voters would never stand for it. To see what I mean, consider a talk that Vance gave last February in which he suggested that “economics is fake” — based on his experience owning a 40-year-old refrigerator.“The refrigerator we had,” he told the audience, “you would put lettuce in the icebox and it would be good a month later. … You cannot at any price point buy a refrigerator today that can do that.”During Vance’s more recent convention speech, the Lettuce Fountain of Youth surfaced on social media to much giggling — because it sums up both the hazy appeal and the implausibility of “Make America Great Again.” Yet there is some truth in Vance’s remark, which is more than a lament for the country’s lost manufacturing might. It’s also a complaint about the way society has become monomaniacally focused on consumer prices, to the detriment of many other things that make our lives better.This complaint comes not only from MAGA America but also from left-leaning thinkers such as Lina Khan, the chair of the Federal Trade Commission. It resonates on both the right and left because the government and corporations do pay more attention to prices than to other things that are harder to measure, but no less important. People also care about quality, about having things that last. And they care about their identity as producers, as well as consumers.Forcing manufacturing workers to compete with lower-wage counterparts elsewhere not only reduced their earning power, but also destabilized their communities, a process that began in the 1960s and ’70s, but accelerated with the “China Shock” of the past 20 years. Many have had to choose between moving for work, sacrificing essential networks of friends and relatives, or staying put and contending with community decline. This has been a real loss.What’s more, some of the goods they could buy — including, yes, home appliances — did get worse in significant ways. Dishwasher cycles have lengthened into eons, which helps them reduce noise and save water, but wastes our time. Refrigerators come with internet connections but break more frequently (it’s not your imagination). And when an appliance stops working, repairs are so expensive, people often just give up and buy a new one.It’s not crazy to want to return to the old ways, or at least try to create options for people who want more expensive but more durable goods, made by Americans living in prosperous manufacturing towns. It’s just impossible. Not just practically, but also politically.Voters might care about the quality of the goods they buy, but they still care a lot about prices, as our recent bout of inflation has demonstrated. Indeed, this is the reason that Vance looks so likely to become vice president in January.And prices would have to rise a lot to bring back the fridge economy of yesteryear. The 10-percent, across-the-board tariffs Trump is proposing would be only a down payment.In 1966, Sears sold customers a 21-cubic-foot capacity, self-defrosting, side-by-side refrigerator for as little as $545. Today, the store’s cheapest equivalent model is more than $1,000. The bigger difference is that, in 1966, the U.S. median family income was $7,500, while in 2022 it was $97,750. If the price of fridges had held constant as a percentage of family income, that new one would cost more than $7,000.Now, one can argue that higher relative prices were a good trade-off for supporting a stable manufacturing sector that provided high-paying jobs to men with no education beyond high school. Those workers had the satisfaction of making tangible products and also the wherewithal to create stable families, buy homes and grab a piece of the American Dream. J.D. Vance is a smart guy, and I’m not sure I’d win that debate with him.But I don’t think he is smart enough to win his argument with a voter who just walked into Sears and discovered that new appliances suddenly cost seven times what they used to."

WaPo_31,‘Hug your IT folks’: The CrowdStrike outage turned technicians into heroes,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/25/crowdstrike-microsoft-outage-it-technicians-bsod/,2024-07-25 19:00:02.702650,,"It was 3 a.m. Friday when Tyson Morris got a wake-up call that would send him into crisis mode for days. Atlanta’s trains and buses were expected to be running in two hours, but all systems were down, showing the dreaded “blue screen of death.”“It’s the one phone call a chief information officer never wants to get,” said Morris, CIO for the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority. “I jumped out of bed, and my wife was wondering what was going on. She thought someone had died.”Morris sprang into action to mobilize his team of 130 for an all-hands-on-deck operation. Was it a hack? Had an employee gone rogue and brought down their operations? For hours, no one knew.The outage, caused by a faulty update from security software firm CrowdStrike, was the kind of event IT staff train for but hope never happens. The incident brought down an estimated 8.5 million Windows devices around the globe, paralyzing operations at hospitals, airlines, 911 call centers and more. Insurers estimate the outage cost companies more than $1 billion in revenue, with Fortune 500 companies potentially losing more than $5 billion.While the outage made it difficult to impossible for many to work, IT technicians were toiling overtime — some spending the night at the office, feverishly trying to get systems back up and running through the weekend. It also revealed vulnerabilities that companies can use as lessons for the next big outage.“It was a heightened sense of stress that I haven’t experienced,” said Morris, who’s been in the industry for more than two decades. “Every second counts.”The event shined a bright light on the importance of IT workers, said Eric Grenier, an analyst who covers endpoint security for market research firm Gartner. CrowdStrike sent out a fix to users, but it required people to manually fix each system. The only other time Grenier recalls a massive outage that came close to this was the buggy McAfee update in 2010.“The fact that we’re seeing reports of hundreds of thousands of devices that were remediated over the weekend, that’s huge,” Grenier said. IT workers were “the superheroes of this.”On the ground, it was a mad dash. Kyle Haas, a systems engineer for IT consulting firm Mirazon in Louisville, spent Friday driving across the city to help clients get back online. During the car rides and in between clients, he shot off emails and took phone calls to help others. For nine hours straight, Haas was in overdrive.“I skipped my coffee that morning,” he said, adding that he woke up to panicked emails and messages from clients who didn’t know what was happening. “It was touch as many things as you can. Fix it all.”Haas said his team of about 40 people spent 12 hours ensuring all their clients were back up and running. Though the day was intense and stressful, he said he was grateful that the issue was purely due to a bad update, and the fix was relatively easy. That meant he wouldn’t have to fight off bad actors or try to recover lost data, which are common in ransomware attacks or system failures.His big save of the day? Helping one of the water companies that was an hour away from having to go into manual override, which would have prevented it from testing water quality.One TikTok user, who goes by plumsoju and said he was part of the IT team at his company, showed what his day was like by unmuting his computer. Inbound messages from colleagues were dinging continuously — something he said had been happening for hours. He compared the experience to the viral meme of a dog drinking coffee while the house is on fire saying, “this is fine.” The TikTok creator did not respond to a request for comment.I’m so desensitized and overwhelmed that I don’t care at this point lol #itoutage #crowdstrike #bluescreenofthedeath #softwareengineer #oncall #itsupport #bluescreen #outage #microsoftoutage For Morris, the event was a big shock. He had been CIO of the transit agency for only three months. Fortunately, the IT department had a preexisting emergency plan, which included a phone tree and dedicated channels for communication. But that didn’t mean it was easy. Morris, who was on a family trip in Tennessee, drove down to Atlanta to help. Meanwhile, the team was working around-the-clock, with some members pulling 18-hour shifts and sleeping at the office.By 9 a.m. Friday, buses and trains were rolling again, and by Monday morning every last laptop had been fixed.“We were getting positive feedback. … A lot of thank-you’s came in,” Morris said. “That continued to help boost morale.”On the West Coast, signs of the outage started to appear late Thursday night, giving IT workers a head start at identifying the problem. Jerry Leever, IT director at accounting, tax and advisory firm GHJ in Los Angeles, said he received an email from the company’s outsourced IT members at 10:30 p.m. Pacific time, which was quickly followed by server system detector alerts.Leever was brushing his teeth and checking his email before bed when he saw the message. His stomach dropped.“I had a moment of worry and then a moment of understanding that we are trained to handle this situation,” Leever said. “You don’t have a lot of time to stay in the panic because you have to get things online as soon as possible.”By 3 a.m. Pacific, Leever and his teammates had the servers up and running. They had an automated email set to send at 5 a.m., informing their 200-plus colleagues about what happened and how to fix the issue. They also had a 6 a.m. call set up for colleagues who needed IT to guide them step-by-step. By about 10:30 a.m. Pacific, everyone was back online, a feat Leever credits to their communication plan and early warnings.But all the IT people who spoke with The Washington Post admitted there were lessons that came from the CrowdStrike outage. It helped magnify the importance of having an up-to-date business continuity plan that emphasizes communication procedures, which can get complicated if systems are down. It also left some leaders questioning whether they have enough contingencies  in place so that operations can continue when something goes down.It left some to question whether they should diversify providers more so that the entire operation doesn’t suffer because of a problem with one. Some organizations are also evaluating if they are staffed properly for emergencies or whether they need to have outsourced help on standby. And it also highlighted the importance of storing key data like recovery codes for encrypted systems in different places in case a server goes down.For Leever, who characterized this outage as the worst incident he’s dealt with, the end of the day Friday couldn’t come soon enough. He headed straight to his favorite restaurant bar for a burger and an Aperol spritz.“Just hug your IT folks,” he said. “It helps when folks are understanding and gracious in times of crisis.”"
WaPo_32,These people hated their mattresses — so they built their own,https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2024/07/25/how-to-build-your-own-mattress/,2024-07-25 19:00:02.702650,,"Hanging art. Painting a room. Building a fire pit. These are commonly accepted DIY projects. But a fervent group of hobbyists wants to add one more to the list: building your own mattress.Frustrated by high prices and dissatisfied with the comfort and life span of store-bought mattresses, these folks research and buy the individual layers that make up a mattress, subbing out various latexes, coils and other components until they have stacked the perfect pallet. Many have found one another online, forming niche communities on forums such as Reddit where they swap tips and crowdsource information.Some, like Andrew Gerges, need a mattress that alleviates a particular ailment. The New Port Richey, Fla., resident has dealt with lower-back issues since a motorcycle accident, and he had been waking up in pain after years on the same mattress. “I was trying to find a mattress that was firm yet still soft enough to side-sleep,” he says. “And that’s a very hard thing to do.”While looking at reviews on Reddit, he saw a post about the DIY route. At first, he was surprised this was even an option, and he thought it might be too complicated. But seeing the price tag of the mattresses that fit his specifications sent him circling back to the idea.The first step entails copious research into the options, of which there are many. Degrees of firmness. Coil count. Thick vs. thin. A bevy of different materials. There is no lack of information — aficionados are all too happy to share their builds in great detail online and offer advice to newcomers.“The easiest thing is putting them together,” Gerges says. “The hardest thing is picking out what you want.” (Also tough: convincing his skeptical wife. “She was like, ‘What do you mean, build a mattress? Can’t we just buy one that’s already made?’”)Once Gerges felt confident about his choice of materials, it was time to start shopping. He and his wife sleep on a king-size bed, but he ordered most layers in size twin XL so each person could have a customized side of the mattress, built to their preferred level of firmness. He ordered eight-inch coils, three-inch microcoils, layers of Dunlop latex and wool mattress pads, all of which get stacked on top of one another and shoved into a zippered encasement. (You can source such supplies from specialty vendors, or just peruse Amazon.) The actual process of building isn’t as involved as it sounds — it’s kind of like making a seven-layer dip.“It takes 5, 10 minutes to do once you have everything,” Gerges says. He started experimenting with the order, feeling the minute differences when he would, say, put the micro coils on top or in the middle of the configuration. “You can really play around with it,” he says. “I like that aspect of it, I think, the most.”He made some key adjustments as he went. At first, he wanted to use wool because he liked that it was a natural fiber, but when he got sick, he sweated through the wool layer, causing an indent. He replaced it with latex. When his wife was pregnant, she wanted a softer mattress, but after she gave birth, she preferred more firmness. No problem — all he had to do was sub out a layer. And once you zip up the encasement, it looks like a normal mattress, rather than some kind of harebrained garage experiment.Ultimately, he estimates that it cost between $1,200 and $1,500, for a luxury mattress that could retail for 10 times that price. But the cost wasn’t his main motivation. “It wasn’t really to save money as much as it was to find the perfect bed,” he says. And in the end, his wife was convinced, too. “Once everything came in, my wife was like, ‘This is the best bed I’ve ever slept on,’” he says.Jess Powell’s DIY mattress journey has many similarities. She faced excruciating back pain when she slept and mistrusted name-brand mattresses. She would watch videos on YouTube of mattress autopsies — where people take apart mattresses to show what’s inside — and felt as though big companies were overselling their components. (“I literally googled, ‘Mattress shopping is sucking my soul,’” she recalls.) When she discovered the prospect of making her own, she felt more excited than intimidated.“I was that kid who took toys apart to see how they worked and then put them back together,” she says. “This is just what I really like to do.”Powell, who lives outside Seattle, will happily discuss the pros and cons of using two-inch and one-inch latex layers versus one three-inch layer. In fact, she became so consumed by the project that her wife got sick of hearing about it and laid down the law: “She had to limit my mattress data dumps to one time a day,” says Powell. Luckily, she found a community on Reddit delighted to discuss the finer details — the difference between Dunlop latex and talalay latex, for instance, or whether you need a transition layer between your comfort and support layers.Powell says her wife is now fully on board. “She’s super happy with all the work that I put into it now,” says Powell, who feels the difference every night and every morning. “The thing we lay on all the time to regenerate us, to be able to live, can be causing a lot of problems.”Matan Wolfson, vice president of sales and business development at Texas Pocket Springs, says he fields calls from DIYers every day. The bulk of his company’s business is wholesale, but he says he started getting requests to sell the company’s patented Quadcoils to individuals early in 2023.Although figuring out how to package and ship a single unit of coils — the amount needed for one mattress — was a challenge, he decided last summer to give it a try. At first, Texas Pocket Springs sold one or two units a week to individuals. Now, a year later and with zero marketing budget, the company sells about 50 per week, Wolfson says.Dealing with the customers is a significant time commitment: “There’s a lot of hand-holding doing this,” he says. “You do have a lot of people that want to talk to you and have questions about the build. … There is no standard sort of way to do it.”Still, there are some nuggets of commonly accepted wisdom. The first is to start with your support layer, which is commonly made of pocket coils or high-density foam. “That’s the most important part because that’s your foundation,” Wolfson says. As the name suggests, that layer provides the structure for the mattress.Then, you can decide what type of “comfort layer” to add on top. This is the part of the mattress that relieves pressure; it’s what your body directly lies on. There are far more options for consumers here because a person could buy any kind of mattress topper. Oft-used materials include latex, natural fibers and memory foam.The other mantra repeated in the DIY space is that it’s easier to make something softer with new layers, whereas it’s more difficult to make a mattress firmer. So, it’s better to err on the side of firmer rather than softer from the get-go.There are also some necessary warnings: This process isn’t for everyone. A person needs to enjoy the iterative process. And, in terms of safety, commercial mattresses must have some kind of fire barrier. DIYers need to add their own.Some of Wolfson’s customers are one-and-done — “you’re going to have someone who’s like hardcore into it while they’re doing their build … [and then] you never hear from them again” — but he’s starting to see repeat patrons working on mattresses for friends or family.Wolfson says investing in this community makes sense because it builds up the Quadcoil reputation among the most passionate mattress maestros. Next up, he wants the company to start making other layers for mattress builds and is starting to prototype covers.So where did this trend start? The man who takes credit for the DIY mattress idea is Ken Hightower, a longtime innovator in the industry who is CEO of retailer Arizona Premium Mattress. His experience selling water beds that incorporated a zippered cover influenced his thoughts about making a mattress’s innards accessible. He was also one of the first to sell mattresses over the internet.As Hightower tells it, living in Phoenix means a lot of his customers are retirees, and he was sick of seeing elderly people come in with two-year-old mattresses that already had dips and other wear-and-tear. “This just kept happening over and over and over again. It was bothering me,” he says. “And I had the knowledge to show them how they could actually fix their mattress.”In 2016, he began posting videos to YouTube that showed people how to open up their brand-name mattresses, keep their coils and replace their flagging top layers with the latex his company sells. (Experts don’t recommend taking apart really cheap mattresses, which could contain and release fiberglass. And you should definitely avoid opening one with a label that explicitly states the mattress contains glass fiber.)The videos, Hightower says, “just started craziness.” Coils tend to last far longer than the top layers, so the intent was for people to salvage the part of the mattress that was still in working order and toss the layers that no longer served them. But sometimes, the coils were also kaput.DIY mattresses are now a huge part of Hightower’s business, he says. “It’s definitely been gathering steam. And you know, when I think it’s peaked, it hasn’t peaked.”There’s a transparency component for Hightower, too. He wants people to be able to see inside their mattresses so they know exactly what they are sleeping on.“People were intimidated by mattresses. You know, ‘Tear them apart? How do I do that?’” he says. “We’re giving them power, education, knowledge.”"
WaPo_33,Work Advice: My co-worker is cheating on his wife. Should I tell her?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/25/work-advice-mixing-love-and-work/,2024-07-25 19:00:02.702650,,"Reader: My co-worker is cheating on his wife with a woman who works at our company. They’re on separate teams with different projects, so management won’t care. I walked in on them in a supply closet so I’m absolutely certain about the affair, but it would be my word against theirs. They’re not stupid, so it’s unlikely they’re using company email for communicating.I feel complicit for not telling his wife about this. I’ve met her twice, once at a happy hour and another time when she dropped by the office and joined us for coffee. I can’t pretend she’s a stranger, but we’re not close enough that I know what’s going on inside their marriage. They have a small child and are trying for a second.I want to help this woman, but not at the cost of my job. If I inform her anonymously, she’ll brush me off as some troll, and he’ll immediately know it was me because I don’t think anyone else knows about this. I don’t care if he knows it was me, but how do I do this without getting in trouble with HR for creating a hostile work environment?Karla: Are you sure you’d be helping the wife by telling her what you witnessed?In short, I don’t see any way for you to take action that does the wife — or you — more good than harm. You don’t have enough of a personal connection to justify involving yourself in a deeply personal matter.I know. That answer doesn’t satisfy my sense of justice, either. But how badly do you really want to board this train wreck?Let’s try a hypothetical: How would you approach this if you happened to stumble upon their steamy supply-closet scenario — but you didn’t know your co-worker’s wife at all? It’s no less a betrayal on his part, but as far as you’re concerned, it’s now a matter of two colleagues behaving unprofessionally, even if they’re not technically violating company policy. What would you do in that situation, based only on what you personally witnessed?Would you say something to HR or your manager, if only to find out what your reporting obligations are or to get what you know on the record?Would you say something to your co-worker? “I have the impression I saw something I shouldn’t have the other day. I don’t plan on getting involved, but I also can’t lie if anyone asks me about it.”Would you needle him? “How’s the wife doing? Will she and the kiddo be at the company picnic?”Would you play town crier next time you find them necking by the notepads? “OH HEY, DON’T MIND ME, JUST GRABBING SOME INKJET TONER, AS YOU WERE.”Or would you just keep a cool distance from the canoodlers as much as your job allows?Any one of these is an option, depending on how close you and the co-worker are, how vindictive he is, how much protection you think you need, or other factors specific to your workplace. (And I would be interested to hear from readers via email who have tried any of these options.)Otherwise, this might be a job better left to karma. You say they’re not stupid enough to communicate personal matters on company technology. But getting caught snogging by the sticky notes doesn’t say “skilled clandestine operatives” to me. If this is in fact a recurring pattern, my money is on them becoming increasingly careless until they blow their own cover and face the repercussions."

Fire personnel are “focusing on evacuations and structure defense” while “building direct containment lines,” the department said, and the cause of the fire is under investigation.As of 9:30 p.m. local time, no structures had been reported damaged or destroyed. An evacuation center has been set up in Chico, according to Cal Fire.Butte County has had an active fire season this year. Earlier this month, more than two dozen structures in the county were destroyed as the Thompson Fire burned more than 3,700 acres. And several other wildfires have been reported in the county, including the Junes Fire, which burned more than 1,000 acres in June.Jamie Grettum, a Salesforce instructor, lives in Chico and said she could see plumes of smoke all afternoon from her neighborhood. Wednesday evening, she joined hundreds of locals at a nearby park to watch the fire on the horizon and get a sense for “how nervous we need to be right now,” she told The Washington Post.Chico is less than 15 miles west of Paradise, which was ravaged by the Camp Fire, the deadliest fire in California’s history, in 2018. Grettum said she could sense the anxiety in the air on Wednesday night. “We know for sure we’re standing out there with survivors of that,” she said, referring to the Camp Fire. “It was tense and silent and sad.”Grettum is also a wildfire survivor — the 2007 Witch Fire burned down her neighborhood in San Diego County. On Wednesday, she was “doing a little mental checklist” of what to take with her if she has to evacuate, she said. “When you’re packing and evacuating, you never think your house will burn. … I know better than that now.”"

WaPo_39,House GOP is in a funding stalemate once again,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/25/house-gop-is-funding-stalemate-once-again/,2024-07-25 19:00:02.702650,,"Good morning, Early Birds. Even if Kamala Harris wasn’t the likely Democratic nominee, we still support Maya Rudolph returning to SNL. Send tips to earlytips@washpost.com. Thanks for waking up with us.In today’s edition … Indivisible, Republican Voters Against Trump launch pro-Harris efforts … J.D. Vance broke off talks on bipartisan childbirth plan amid VP search … but first …In March, House Republicans embarked on funding the government for the 2025 fiscal year after a painful funding process the previous year that often halted governing for weeks at a time.And just like last year, Republicans now find themselves in a stalemate of their own doing.That’s even after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) pledged to pass all 12 bills before their month-long break from Washington in August. Johnson has been bringing bills to the floor, only to pull them from consideration before they failed as far-right Republicans take hard-line stances on their own priorities.At first glance, the funding process appeared to be looking up: GOP appropriators passed all 12 bills — including some controversial ones they failed to advance last year — out of the House Appropriations Committee. Plus, Republicans were able to strip a controversial abortion amendment from the Agriculture bill that doomed its passage after moderates blocked it last year.But the same tensions remain that led to the successful ouster of then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and contributed to a motion to vacate threat against Johnson seven months later.That much became clear earlier this month when Republicans failed to pass the Legislative Branch funding bill over disagreements surrounding member pay. Then, on Tuesday night, GOP leadership pulled the Energy and Water bill moments before a final vote to pass it, which ultimately contributed to leadership deciding to kick off August recess one week early after today’s votes.Before the House voted last night on a bill funding the Interior Department, Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee, said he had “no idea” if it would pass.The bill — which some Republicans thought would fail — ended up passing, 210-205, but not without some suspense during the final minute when the vote was tied at 206 members both in support and against it. Five Republicans ended up voting against the measure.Athina Lawson, a spokeswoman for Johnson, pointed out that the Senate has yet to consider an appropriation bill on the floor this year. House Republicans have already passed five funding bills in the same period.No issue has plagued Republicans more than funding the government. The pragmatic “governing” bloc of the conference is willing to make concessions in the hopes of setting Johnson up to have a stronger hand in final negotiations with the Democratic-led Senate and White House.But that clashes with far-right members who demand all or nothing, hoping Republicans can pass red-meat bills to put the onus on the Senate to either send President Biden their ultraconservative bills or own a shutdown.Rep. Dave Joyce (R-Ohio), who chairs the moderate Republican Governance Group and an Appropriations subcommittee, called it an “exercise in futility” to go through an amendment process with proposals that would never get adopted rather than taking the more pragmatic approach of conferencing all 12 committee-approved bills with the Senate.Republicans have known for months these dynamics would ultimately plague them, leaving many to predict that Johnson would have no choice but to break his promise of passing all 12 funding bills before August recess. Many within the conference have begun to discuss the obvious need to pass a continuous resolution — known colloquially as a “CR” — that would extend current fiscal levels until a certain date, preferably after the election, to avoid a government shutdown on Oct. 1.“I personally wouldn’t have a problem with it unless it shuts down the CR and you end up shutting down the government. That would be a problem,” Simpson said.Biden is considered a master eulogist in politics, having delivered many in his life. But last night he delivered the first of what will probably be several eulogies of his own five-decade career in politics before he leaves the White House in January 2025.“There is a time and place for long years of experience in public life,” Biden said in a speech that lasted a little over 10 minutes, as family members listened off camera. “There’s also a time and place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now.”Both Biden and Vice President Harris are scheduled to separately meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today.Netanyahu delivered a fiery and divisive speech yesterday to a joint meeting of Congress, where he argued it would be a national security threat for the United States not to support Israel. He didn’t discuss prospects for a cease-fire, the status of a hostage deal or how he would get more humanitarian aid to Gaza. Instead, he defended his actions in the war against Hamas and said that some dissenting Americans are believing Iranian propaganda.We’re watching for the tone of the readout of his meeting with Biden and Harris.Harris will also travel to Houston to deliver the keynote address at the national convention for the American Federation of Teachers, which has endorsed her.The Senate is going to take its first procedural vote on two bills today to protect kids online.The pair of bipartisan bills, the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) and the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act, known as COPPA 2.0, have been in the works for years. KOSA has 69 co-sponsors, far more than the 60 votes necessary to advance the legislation.“Together, the bills would force tech companies to take steps to mitigate potential harms to kids and widen many existing federal children’s privacy protections to include teens up to 16,” is how our colleague Cristiano Lima describes the bills.We’ll be watching to see who doesn’t back today’s procedural vote.Ahead of leaving Washington for over a month, House Republicans are expected to vote on a resolution that would condemn Harris and the Biden administration for their handling of the border. It’s the first action on the House floor that goes after Harris since she became Democrats’ likely presidential nominee.We are watching new GDP numbers out this morning, which often offer ripe campaign fodder.First in The Early: The liberal activist group Indivisible is launching a huge effort to recruit volunteers and voters for Harris. The “All in for Kamala” effort will run from today until the Democratic convention in the third full week of August.This is a sharp shift for the group now that Harris is expected to become the nominee and an attempt to capture enthusiasm from the Democratic base for Harris. The group had previous plans to hold policy-focused events that championed Biden’s policies but didn’t mention him by name.A memo sent to activists provides suggestions for events to generate excitement in their communities, including hold phone banking, postcard writing parties or recruitment drives. Drop a large banner over a freeway overpass, is another suggestion.The group’s members voted nearly unanimously to endorse Harris on Sunday. Indivisible Action PAC is contributing half a million dollars to the effort.First in The Early: Republican Voters Against Trump is launching a new $500,000 billboard campaign in the Blue Wall swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania featuring Republican voters who will back Harris.More than 70 billboards will feature voters from these three states and will dot Detroit, Grand Rapids, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, Madison and Milwaukee. In one example, a billboard with a picture of Dwight from Michigan reads: “I’m a former Trump voter. I’m a gun owner. I’m voting for Harris.”The group, which is working to sway Republican voters uneasy about voting for Trump against him, launched a similar campaign earlier this summer highlighting Republican voters who planned to back Biden.The new billboard campaign is combined with a 60-second video version of the group’s message that will run on streaming platforms and YouTube.For roughly a year, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) was working with Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) on legislation to reduce childbirth costs by prohibiting insurance companies from charging new mothers co-pays or other expenses related to childbirth — a clear break from GOP orthodoxy.But in June, around the time Donald Trump’s campaign began seriously considering Vance as a running mate, he broke off the talks, The Post’s Jeff Stein reports.“The break in the talks — at least for now — captures the broader puzzle facing the man who is suddenly the second-most important figure in the Republican Party,” Jeff writes. “In his brief time in the Senate, Vance indicated a vision for a more active role for the government in GOP policymaking on everything from taxes to antitrust. Vance’s allies characterize those proposals as in line with Trump’s priorities, but some of the Ohio senator’s plans — such as clawing back the pay of Wall Street executives whose banks fail — have already prompted grumbling from some Trump allies.”“The distance between Vance’s policy positions and Trump’s raises the question of whether the Ohio senator will move the party in his direction — or whether Vance will have to jettison some of the ideas he backed as a senator,” Jeff adds.Must reads from The Post:‘Not going to be nice’: Trump, Harris trade sharp attacks as 2024 race resets.

WaPo_40,"U.S. economy grew 2.8% in second quarter, a robust unexpected strengthening",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/25/gdp-q2-economy/,2024-07-25 21:10:02.702650,,"The U.S. economy grew at a surprisingly robust 2.8 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, capping two years of solid expansion, despite some signs of softening.Gross domestic product for the quarter ending in June was double the 1.4 percent reading in the previous quarter, but reflects a general cool-down from last year’s brisk pace, according to Commerce Department data released Thursday morning.“Economic growth is solid, not too hot and not too cold,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at Fwdbonds, a financial research firm. “The soft patch we had at the beginning of the year has gone away and with it, the risks of a recession are dying on the vine.” Consumer spending and business investments drove almost all of the second quarter’s growth. Continued government spending at the federal, state and local levels also helped prop up the GDP reading, which sums up goods and services produced in the United States.However, a slowdown in home construction and other residential investments, and an increase in imports, dragged down economic growth — a turnaround after three straight quarters of solid growth.“GDP came in significantly stronger than anticipated,” Matt Peron, global head of solutions at Janus Henderson Investors, wrote in a note to clients. But, he added, “The economy does seem to be downshifting and that may cause continued volatility in the coming months.”Consumer spending, which slowed earlier in the year in part as cold winter temperatures kept shoppers at home, came roaring back in the second quarter. Americans spent heartily on goods such as cars, recreational vehicles and furniture. But economists say those spending jumps aren’t likely to be sustainable — income growth has weakened, pandemic-era savings have run out, and more people are falling behind on loan payments. The rapid post-pandemic recovery has recently lost steam, as high borrowing costs force households and businesses to rethink spending. Home sales have stalled, manufacturing is slowing and factories are seeing a drop-off in demand for U.S.-made goods. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate — at 4.1 percent as of June — has edged up for three straight months.Still, economists say a gradual cool-down is a welcome reprieve from years of too-hot growth that stoked inflation. The labor market remains strong and consumers are still spending, albeit with less gusto than they were a year ago.The surprisingly upbeat GDP report adds new uncertainty to whether the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates in September, as previously expected. The central bank has kept borrowing costs at a two-decade high since last summer to temper inflation. In congressional testimony this month, Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said the United States is “no longer an overheated economy,” thanks in large part to a moderating labor market. “Conditions have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic: strong, but not overheated,” he added.Although much of the economy is humming along, some pockets, such as housing and construction, have retreated more dramatically. Sales of new homes are down 7.4 percent from a year ago, while existing-home sales have fallen by 5.4 percent, according to fresh data this week.In Seattle, new business at home-remodeling firm Gasper’s Construction has dropped 30 percent in the past year. Clients, who tend to rely on home-equity lines of credit, have pulled back in response to higher interest rates.“Remodel projects are smaller and people are not willing to extend themselves as much,” owner Sarah Henry said.Even so, Henry is optimistic. She’s looking to add three more people to her staff of 57, and says the Seattle housing market has been surprisingly resilient. Plus, the Fed appears poised to ease monetary policy in the coming months.“Interest rates are going to give and, at some point, they’re going to come down,” she said. “That is very much going to help us.”"
WaPo_41,"Democrats hope bad polls were a Biden problem, not a policy problem",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/25/biden-age-congress-democrats-senate-house/,2024-07-25 18:00:02.702650,,"For almost six months, Democrats struggled with a strange paradox in which President Biden lagged behind in critical states while their Senate candidates built clear leads in those same battlegrounds.Even after Biden’s disastrous debate performance at the end of June, Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) had an 11 percentage-point lead over his GOP foe, David McCormick, in mid-July, doubling his advantage from a New York Times poll from two months earlier. Biden trailed former president Donald Trump, 48 to 45.The same polling outfit found Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) with a resounding 18-point lead last week over his little-known opponent, as Biden had drifted down into a statistical tie with Trump.Now, with Biden stepping aside and Vice President Harris taking the mantle as the likely nominee, Democrats will find out whether the president’s struggle with voters this year was something unique to him and his frailty. Polling has been a bit uneven since Biden’s withdrawal on Sunday, but several surveys seem to suggest that the vice president has energized Democrats and pulled back some voters who had preferred a third-party choice rather than Biden.Democrats believe their message and their campaigns were properly structured, but that their messenger had his own unique flaws. Democrats are betting that Harris, 59, can re-energize a liberal coalition that has delivered popular-vote victories in four straight presidential elections and replicate their defeat of Trump four years ago.“I have never seen such a quick reversal of an emotional state. The anti-Trump coalition was just waiting to be reactivated. We are back,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said after Harris and allies raised $250 million in two days.Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.), an early Biden endorser in 2020, cited the June 27 debate as “the pivot point” from which Democrats could not escape questions about the president’s ability to serve another four years.“We as Democrats have an enormous record to run on,” Houlahan said in an interview, saying those accomplishments got drowned out by voter perceptions of the 81-year-old incumbent’s ability to perform the job.“We were constantly talking about the debate,” she added.With Harris at the top of the ticket, Democrats hope the gloomy issue of Biden’s age will fade or even shift onto the backs of GOP candidates supporting the 78-year-old Trump, with his own questions about fitness to serve into 2029.“We can talk about the future,” Schatz said, accusing Republicans of a social policy agenda that would take America back to “the late 1950s.”Republicans dismiss the argument that Biden was the only thing dragging down Democrats as overly hyped. They argue that overlooks how poorly voters viewed Biden’s handling of key issues such as inflation and the border for several years before his debate debacle last month.“Obviously, Biden’s age and everything were pulling down his support, but the policies that he embraced are the same policies that Harris has embraced,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) told reporters on Tuesday.Cornyn, who is running to be Senate Republican leader next year, said he would welcome a campaign that was less of a “personality race” and focused more on those policy issues.Yet for almost a year, GOP challengers have pounded away at Democratic candidates in those same battleground states on those issues, with only marginal impact so far.In Pennsylvania, both Casey and McCormick have been airing television ads steadily since the early spring. Their campaigns spent a combined $18 million in the second quarter, with Casey holding an almost 2-to-1 edge, but outside super PACs are also flooding the airwaves.After McCormick won his primary in late April, the race had closed to a narrow 46-41 lead for the Democratic incumbent, according to the Times-Sienna poll. That grew to Casey receiving 50 percent against McCormick’s 39 percent in their poll released last week.Other, less reliable polls showed Casey with leads in a similar range after Biden’s debate flop.Meanwhile, Pennsylvanians have remained sour on Biden almost the entire year, favoring Trump 47 to 44 percent in the early May poll and almost identically 48 to 44 percent after the debate.Kaine saw a similar development in his race. “After the debate, for some weird reason, I’m going up and [the presidential race] went back to a dead head,” he said Wednesday.In Wisconsin, as Biden’s numbers moved up a bit in the spring into a narrow lead and then down again after the debate, Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) has maintained a steady lead over her GOP foe of about 5 percentage points or more.The Marquette poll, considered the state’s most reliable, showed that 41 percent of voters had a favorable view of Baldwin in the fall, versus 43 percent that viewed her unfavorably. By mid-June, after millions had been spent trying to tarnish her image, Baldwin’s favorability ratings had climbed to 45 to 44 percent unfavorable.That poll gave her a nine-point lead among likely voters, as independents favored her by 4 percentage points against banking executive Eric Hovde. Biden trailed Trump by 16 percentage points among independents in a head-to-head match.Democratic advisers working on Senate races said the most competitive races mirrored the relative steadiness of Democratic candidates in Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin, despite Biden’s own decline in many of these states.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, in a memo about the state of the race for the House majority, said that its top-priority incumbents in competitive districts — called “Frontliners” — had also maintained a political resiliency throughout the tumultuous spring and summer.They held steady leads into mid-July, along with top Democratic challengers to GOP House incumbents, according to the DCCC, which said it had “no poll showing atrophy in their support” after the debate.Democrats privately acknowledged that some states that have been steadily turning blue in recent elections — Biden won Colorado, Minnesota, New Mexico and Virginia by a range of 7 to 13 points — had instead become quite competitive in the 2024 cycle.And in some of those down-ballot races, incumbents such as Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), where the race has been slower to develop, began to see erosion in their standing back home.Democrats feared a similar dynamic was setting in for their relatively safe incumbents, who have not been running with the same level of intensity as the front-line lawmakers. In the debate aftermath, those Democrats started facing a tougher path to victory.“Most people were experiencing a dip of sorts,” said Houlahan, whose suburban Philadelphia district went from a battleground in 2018 to a likely Democratic seat.Senate Republicans have repeatedly told themselves to set their expectations properly ever since Democratic incumbents won every race two years ago.“These candidates, these incumbents, have their own name ID and being an incumbent is a pretty powerful position to run from,” Cornyn said.The key test in the weeks ahead will be whether Harris can position herself along the lines of those battle-tested incumbents like Casey and Baldwin, or if Republicans can turn her into another version of the unpopular Biden.Republicans want to keep voters focused on inflation and the Southern border in key states, making Harris answer for what they see as Biden’s failings, Cornyn said. “Those are going to be, I think, a real drag on her candidacy.”And Schatz has a lingering fear that, despite the quick unity around Harris, certain ideological factions will issue purity tests on liberal policy that are unpopular with undecided voters in key swing states.“There will be plenty of time for those arguments. None of that is possible if you lose,” Schatz said.But Democrats are at least relieved they won’t have to answer for Biden’s debate performance and an age issue that hung over the campaign for this entire year.Schatz, 51, who remained a steadfast Biden supporter until this month, said that the issue “never stopped” and crept into all of the other issues the president faced.It left Democrats perpetually on defense.“When you’re explaining, you’re losing,” Schatz said, “and we were doing a lot of explaining.”"
WaPo_42,The fight to make landlords turn down the thermostat,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/07/25/excessive-heat-renters-ac-cooling/,2024-07-25 18:00:02.702650,,"FRESNO, Calif. — On a 114-degree day, May Yang was seeking relief — from her own home.Her ground-floor, two-room apartment sits in direct sun for much of the day, making the inside unbearably hot, despite her air conditioner’s feeble attempts to cool it down.In California and many other states, renters like Yang are entitled under the law to heating that maintains a minimum temperature during the winter. But there are few mandates nationwide — including in California — that require residences to stay below a certain temperature in the summer.As heat waves intensify in a warming world and a growing body of research shows the deadly effects of extreme heat, some renters, politicians, tenant advocates and environmental health experts are pushing for stronger hot weather protections, such as requiring rental units to be cooled to a certain temperature.Gary Allen, the supervising attorney at the Harvard Tenant Advocacy Project, said cold has long been considered life-threatening, but only recently have many thought of heat in the same way. “The rationale for heating standards is that low temperatures are recognized to constitute a risk to health,” Allen said.Cold temperatures kill more people than hot temperatures. But the World Meteorological Institute says heat is the deadliest form of extreme weather — which the world is seeing more of due to human-caused climate change.The effects of extreme heat are severe and have been linked to heart, kidney and respiratory failure. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about a third of recorded heat-related deaths in the United States have occurred in people’s homes between Jan. 1, 2018, and July 13, 2024.Under many state laws, if a rental unit comes with an air conditioner, landlords are required to keep it in working order — but not cool the dwelling to a specific temperature. Most cooling policies exist on the city or county level.Phoenix, Dallas and New Orleans have ordinances that require landlords to keep residences cooled to certain temperatures. But Arizona, Texas and Louisiana do not have state-level laws mandating cooling.“We really haven’t thought about cooling as a basic right or basic need,” said David Konisky, a professor of environmental policy at Indiana University. “But I think it’s something that we need to take into consideration.”In some places that have been hit by major heat waves in recent years, officials are working toward enacting maximum temperature requirements or ensuring tenants have access to air conditioning.Oregon launched a program to subsidize air conditioning, but “when the number of applications exceeded the number of devices available, the state paused the application process to make sure all current requests could be fulfilled,” said Amy Bacher, a communications officer at the Oregon Health Authority.New York City Council member Lincoln Restler proposed legislation this month that would mandate air conditioning for tenants citywide. If passed, the bill would require landlords to provide air conditioning capable of keeping apartments at 78 degrees when the temperature outside exceeds 82 degrees.“A landlord is required to provide a safe and habitable home for their tenant,” he said. “There’s just no way that an apartment without a cooling device is safe or habitable.”In California, legislation to mandate a maximum safe indoor air temperature for residents stalled in 2022, but lawmakers are requiring the California Department of Housing and Community Development to craft policy recommendations on safe indoor temperatures. The department released draft recommendations in June that said the state “should consider a maximum safe indoor air temperature of 82 degrees Fahrenheit (27.8 degrees Celsius) for newly-constructed residential dwelling units”Tenant advocates feel more needs be to done, especially for low-income renters.“I am hearing more and more from people that fans and evaporative coolers do nothing at all,” said Phoebe Seaton, co-director of Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability, a community advocacy group that supported the California bill and opposed the draft recommendations.“If we fail to act, people will continue to get sick, miss school, work and other important life events, and even die due to prolonged heat exposure,” she said.Fresno does not require property owners to provide air conditioners. If a dwelling has an air conditioner, the owner is required to maintain it. The city declined to comment on whether it would support legislation that included temperature mandates.“I just wish that one year the city of Fresno will require people to change to cooler AC,” said Yang, 61, as she sat in a cooling center during record-breaking heat earlier this month. Temperatures in Fresno were an average of 10 degrees hotter than normal during the first half of July, according to National Weather Service data.Theresa Hollingsworth, who has lived in Fresno for more than 50 years, came to the cooling shelter with her two children and dog, Miley, who is named after Miley Cyrus. Their evaporative cooler, a system that uses water to make cool air and can be useful in climates with low humidity, like Fresno, wasn’t standing up to the heat that Sunday.Two days later, the cooler broke. “Sleeping is very rough,” Hollingsworth said. She had fans on but they were blowing nothing but hot air. The cooler was fixed within about 48 hours, she said.Eighty-nine percent of U.S. homes used some form of air conditioning as of 2020, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But if they, like Yang and Hollingsworth, live in one of the nearly one-quarter of American homes that use non-central cooling systems including window or evaporative units, they may not be getting effective use out of their devices, said C.J. Gabbe, an associate professor of environmental studies and science at Santa Clara University.“Just because you have some kind of AC, it doesn’t mean you’re going to be able to keep temperatures at a healthy level,” Gabbe said.He said some residents with working units also may not run them because of the cost.“People who live in lowest income households tend to spend a bigger share of their income on cooling costs,” Gabbe said.Julia Margarita Alonso, who lives in Cantua Creek, a rural community in Fresno County, has air conditioning in her home.“I don’t turn it on as often because of high energy bills,” she said. Once her bill was more than $300, she said. While a government program helped her partially pay the amount, she said she is still reluctant to run her air conditioner unless absolutely necessary.Energy costs could be an obstacle in trying to implement or enact these policies, experts said, and it’s not yet clear who will shoulder them.Tom Bannon, chief executive of the California Apartment Association, which represents apartment owners and developers, said he would support any cooling mandate that would be entirely or heavily subsidized by the government, because of the significant cost of retrofitting older buildings to run air conditioning.California has hundreds of thousands of structures that were built before 1939, he said. He estimated the cost of increasing the electrical capacity of an old, single-family house in the Central Valley to accommodate one window unit would run between two and three thousand dollars.The association did not support the 2022 cooling legislation because of its potential cost and worries that implementing a temperature mandate would open landlords up to lawsuits.“Am I going to find myself in court because I couldn’t get the temperature down because I had an electrical problem?” Bannon said. He added that the group is involved in advising the state’s housing department on its planned 2025 policy recommendations.Experts see other pitfalls with cooling mandates.“If a landlord is requiring AC, they might raise the rent,” said Sanya Carley, a professor of energy policy at the University of Pennsylvania. “Once the rent is raised [residents] may curtail the electricity even more.”Some advocates have decided not to push for maximum temperature rules.Roseann Bongiovanni, the executive director of Greenroots, an environmental justice organization based in Chelsea, Mass., said her group has been working with the city to obtain grant funding for air conditioners and to make buildings in the city just north of Boston easier to cool. But, ultimately, providing air conditioning isn’t a perfect fix, she said: Units are difficult to install, especially in older structures, and they are expensive to use.“We haven’t pushed for policy statewide or greater-Boston-wide to mandate air conditioning,” Bongiovanni said. State law requires owners to provide heating in the winter, but does not mandate air conditioning.In Fresno that Sunday, as the sun began to dip below the buildings, residents trickled outside, though the night offered little relief. Some sprayed themselves down with a garden hose. Others chatted with family on the outskirts of sprinkler mist.When the cooling centers close at 8 p.m., Yang goes home and takes a cold shower.In her apartment, she could feel the stickiness start to grip onto her bare arms and legs. It felt at least 10 degrees hotter than outside.“Sometimes it’s so hot that I get a headache or grow dizzy,” Yang said.She sleeps on her living room couch, where the heat is a little less oppressive.“When you sleep it’s suffocating,” she added. Her window unit rattled in the background, set to as cold as it could go. “So I really hope they change that soon.”Philip Cheung in Fresno and Jason Samenow and Dan Keating in Washington contributed to this report."
WaPo_43,She was a great artist. And a woman of privilege.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/art/2024/07/25/marie-cassatt-work-philadelphia-museum/,2024-07-25 18:00:02.702650,,"PHILADELPHIA — “Mary Cassatt at Work” is a large and mostly satisfying exhibition devoted to the career of the great American artist beloved for her sensitive and often sentimental views of family life. The “at work” in the title of the Philadelphia Museum of Art show references the curators’ interest in Cassatt’s pioneering effort to establish herself as a professional artist within a male-dominated field.Throughout the show, which includes some 130 paintings, pastels, prints and drawings, the wall text and the art on view stresses Cassatt’s fixation on art as a career rather than a pastime. She used images of women at work — nurturing children and doing handiwork such as knitting and embroidery to fill their spare time — to define a sphere of feminine labor independent from the one in which Cassatt actually operated, the salons, galleries and exhibitions through which the impressionists changed the course of art history.“By talking and writing so frequently about her work, she gave it definition and highlighted its importance as a source of income, independence, contentment, professional stature, and pride,” writes Jennifer A. Thompson, who co-curated the exhibition with Laurel Garber.Visitors will probably find the art itself more interesting than the focus on labor, which becomes diffuse by the end of the exhibition. The Philadelphia Museum of Art owns 84 works by Cassatt, including some spectacular paintings and pastels that show the artist at her most daring and experimental. Included are sunny views of bourgeois life, such as the 1896 “Maternal Caress”; problematic and awkward works like the 1881 image of a woman, child and male servant in “Driving”; and the magnificent play of reflection in the 1879 “Woman in a Loge.”These are complemented by major works from public and private collections, including the National Gallery’s “Little Girl in a Blue Armchair,” which closes the exhibition with a deceptively placid vision of a female child and a little dog, suggesting an ominous life for the girl as a thing to be owned and domesticated.That painting, and many others, suggests that work and autonomy are important prisms through which to understand Cassatt’s art. But a more rigorously intersectional approach would help — that is, a focus not just on feminist narratives but also on narratives of privilege. Cassatt was rich, and art made her richer. She was determined to make her way in a male-dominated world but wanted also to distinguish herself from painters she despised — amateurs, including women who made art as a pastime.Almost every work in the show is more interesting when considered the product of both a woman artist and a bourgeois artist. In a cogent catalogue essay, Dave Beech lays the groundwork for this, using biographical and cultural data to explore Cassatt’s contempt for amateurs. As a member of the upper middle class — her father was a successful investor, her mother came from a banking family, her brother became president of a railroad — Cassatt had to work against her own class strictures to become an artist. Women could paint but only as one of the refinements, including music and needlework, that were considered proper for their sex. Making money as an artist, competing in the market, was a violation of class dignity.Cassatt broke with the usual expectations, moved to France, made art and sold it with gusto. In part, she was forced to by her father’s reluctance to support her as an aspiring professional artist. If her contempt for women who made art as a pastime is understandable in this context, it was also ungenerous. Cassatt understood that the art world is about gatekeeping, allowing some in and others not. She earned the status of gatekeeper and could be prickly about it, expressing her displeasure in 1897 when her work was shown in the company of art by women she considered amateurs.For all the focus on work, many of the images in this exhibition, including some of the most interesting, are about leisure. Especially when she depicts women at the theater or opera, we get closer to the world of self-fashioning, fantasy and illusion that made their highly constrained lives psychologically bearable.And when Cassatt focused on the uncompensated work women do as mothers and caretakers, she frequently used models to create her family groupings. The rough hands of these women, which the curators see as a sign of Cassatt emphasizing their labor, might also be seen as a sign that a wealthy artist could afford to exploit the bodies of the working class.Cassatt wrote often about work, but there are no images of her at work, nor any images of her studio. When she allowed herself to be photographed, she presented as a very proper, upper-crust woman, including in the foreground of a picture of the 17th-century chateau she purchased in 1894.We speak too reflexively about the dignity and value of work. While celebrating the dignity and value of work that is too often discounted, including that which women do in the domestic sphere (and the work female artists such as Cassatt do representing that sphere), it’s worth pausing for reflection. The great promise of industrialization and mechanization, which helped families like the Cassatts grow rich, was supposed to yield leisure, not just huge piles of capital owned by a tiny sliver of the population. Yes, Cassatt was a pioneering female artist; she was also a member of the class that has kept most of the planet in thrall to work long after we might all do less of it.Portraits play a significant role in this show, and there’s something curious about Cassatt’s portraiture. Very often, her subjects look faintly miserable, as if they are barely able to conceal their boredom. Her brother, the railway baron, looks bored to stupefaction in an 1884 painting that depicts him with his son, a work that is another of Philadelphia’s important but flawed Cassatt holdings. So does her mother in a portrait (circa 1889) borrowed from the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.They hated idleness, a luxury few others could afford. Cassatt was a woman who painted women and who became an ardent champion of women’s suffrage. She also carried forth the values of the class from which she came, whose members built up the great art collections of the world. If you can spare a little time off from work, go see “Mary Cassatt at Work,” where you will also enjoy the company of others who have managed to salvage a little time for leisure in an overbusy world.Mary Cassatt at Work is on view at the Philadelphia Museum of Art through Sept. 8. philamuseum.org"
WaPo_44,Why almost everyone assumes Kamala Harris has to pick a White man as VP,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/25/harris-white-man-vice-president/,2024-07-25 18:00:02.702650,,"As soon as it became clear that Vice President Harris was going to emerge as the likely Democratic presidential nominee, a certain knowing joke emerged almost simultaneously on social media: images of various “whites” — white wines, white paint chips, white crackers — with captions implying that these were Harris’s vice-presidential choices.“Kamala’s VP options,” posted one user on X, above an array of cream-colored paint samples labeled “Trustworthy Whites: 40 of our best whites.” “Kamala looking for a VP,” wrote another, above a photo of bottles of supermarket white wines labeled with an “Interesting Whites” sign. “Kamala’s menu of potential VPs,” posted a third, above a menu featuring descriptions ranging from “light crisp dry whites” to “rich whites.”Even “The Daily Show” got in on the gag, repurposing the photo of Harris receiving the 2020 call from then-candidate Joe Biden that he had chosen her as his No. 2, with the caption: “Hello, is this the Midwest White Guy Emporium?”If the tone was wry, it also reflected the near-instantaneous assessment that hardened among lawmakers in Washington, strategists and operatives throughout the country, as well as ordinary voters: that Harris, who is Black and Indian American and if elected would make history as the first female president,  must choose someone White as her running mate — and preferably a White guy.It remains unclear who Harris will ultimately alight on as her No. 2. Though the list of would-be contenders is heavy with White men — Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, to name a few — a few more diverse options, such as Govs. Wes Moore of Maryland and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, have also appeared.But the degree and speed with which the conventional wisdom took hold — that if she wants to win, Harris must choose a White man as her vice president — reflects, at its most cynical, that the nation will tolerate only so much deviation from its White male founding, even as the overall political world is more diverse than ever.“It is not surprising that the conventional wisdom would be we’ll put a woman at the top of the ticket, but there has to be — and I’m putting it in quotes here — ‘balance,’ which is always part of the equation,” said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.When it comes to a barrier-breaking selection, however,  Walsh added that a sense of continuity with the past often becomes more important.“For decades, no one worried that there were two men at the top of the ticket. For decades, no one worried that the two people at the top of the ticket were White,” she said. “But in these moments when you’re looking at a first, I think it is the conventional wisdom to reassure people, to have them think maybe the world isn’t changing quite as fast, to at least see that kind of gender and race — again, in quotes — ‘balance.’”In interviews at Harris’s first major campaign rally Tuesday near Milwaukee, many of her supporters said they expected her to pick a White man as her running mate — reasoning that would give the ticket the broadest appeal.Betsy Rowbottom, 53, an interior designer from Milwaukee, said she would love to see Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.),who is Black, or Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who is gay, as her vice president, but she doesn’t think either has a shot.“I think it’s going to be a straight White man from a swing state. I think that’s the balanced ticket, if you will. I think that it’s something that people will want,” Rowbottom said.Colette Frederick, a 56-year-old registered nurse from Milwaukee, predicted that Harris would choose Shapiro — a choice that she would be happy with. She believes Harris will have to choose a straight White man.“I just look at what I see America looks like,” Frederick said. “They’re not going to like this; they’re not going to like that. That’s just my gut. She needs to pick someone that they consider to be acceptable.”Kimberly Peeler-Allen, co-founder of Higher Heights for America, a group focused on mobilizing and electing Black women, said that because of racism and sexism — both latent and overt — a “White statesman as a validator” can help buoy a historic first as the nominee. She pointed to Barack Obama’s selection of Biden as his running mate in 2008.“Regardless of the voter’s race — it is both White voters, voters of color — there is something comforting or reassuring about having something that looks familiar to what we’ve had for the last 250 years in our nation’s history of elected leadership,” Peeler-Allen said.The risk, she added, is that narrowing the candidate pool in that way omits a ton of potential talent.“It is, of course, unfortunate because that framework would rule out a good number of qualified people of color,” Peeler-Allen said. “I think there is a lot of excitement and interest in a possible all-woman ticket, but there is also the possibility that that would be unnerving to some, because we’ve never had a woman president, let alone a woman president and vice president at the same time.”Indeed, most unofficial lists of whom Harris should pick include few non-White men. There have even been whispers in some corners that Shapiro — one of the would-be running mates who many Republicans say they privately most fear — might not be an ideal choice because of his adamant support of Israel in the Gaza conflict, or that being gay could disqualify Buttigieg, who ran for president himself in 2020 and is widely considered one of his party’s best communicators.The Atlantic magazine cheekily dubbed this period “Kamala Harris’s White-Boy Summer,” offering readers a primer on potential No. 2’s like Democratic Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, and Tim Walz of Minnesota.Alex Castellanos, a Republican media consultant and co-founder of Purple Strategies, said Harris needs to broaden her appeal, and choosing someone different from herself as her running mate helps her do that.“If Kamala picked someone like her — another woman — the message it’s sending is that this campaign is only about this, and that’s too narrow,” he said. “She’s running for president for all of America, not just the women of America.”He added that her campaign should not be “a DEI commercial,” using an acronym for diversity, equity and inclusion, and noted that “I do think a little toxic masculinity would help her.”“She’s defined a great deal by women’s issues and Black issues, and that’s great, but is she more than that?” Castellanos said. “How does she make the case that she’s more? By broadening the appeal of her ticket, by adding a male, by adding centrist moderate Democratic credentials, like maybe a Mark Kelly or Josh Shapiro.”For some, the notion that Harris needs to choose a White male is a practical reality for a party that wants to appeal to a broad swath of voters and have its ticket reflect the entirety of the nation.Jennifer Palmieri, the communications director on Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, pointed to Biden’s pledge that he would choose a woman as his running mate, as well as his pledge during the same period to appoint a Black woman to the Supreme Court.“I think that it would bother me more if the calculus had been that Biden also could have picked a White guy, but you need to have balance these days,” Palmieri said. “I have been pleasantly surprised that a lot of male political professionals in the Democratic Party have said they think two women on the ticket would be powerful.”She concluded: “I actually don’t feel a lack of progress there. If it’s a guy at the top of the ticket, it has to be a woman, and if there’s a woman at the top of the ticket, it has to be a guy.”Wells reported from West Allis, Wis."
WaPo_45,Companies are reshaping operations to cope with a changing climate,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/20/companies-climate-heat/,2024-07-25 18:00:02.702650,,"Major utilities are relocating substations to escape rising waters and wildfires. Manufacturers are establishing redundant production lines to guard against storms that could idle their plants. And a top investment bank is stress-testing portfolios to see if they would survive a warming climate’s wrath.The moves illustrate how companies are changing the way they do business to cope with increasingly frequent episodes of extreme weather, such as the heat wave that broiled much of the United States this month. The global average temperature on Monday made it the hottest day on record, breaking a planetary mark established just one day earlier, according to Copernicus Climate Change Service, the European Union’s climate monitor.Executives are grappling with a range of climate-related threats to the bottom line, including droughts in Mexico and the Panama Canal, forecasts of an unusually active hurricane season, and record-setting heat from Sacramento to D.C.In Houston, a company called UPG, which makes precisely formed plastic parts, lost almost two weeks of production after powerful storms knocked out power three times in the last four months. For the company’s owners, the serial outages were the latest evidence that business as usual was no longer an option.“It’s getting to the point where the impacts are making us miss our forecasts. It’s hurting us financially and it’s affecting our customers,” said Scott Bekemeyer, co-chairman of the Partner Companies (TPC), a consortium that owns UPG and nine other manufacturers.Globally, last month was the warmest June since records began in 1850, according to Berkeley Earth, a data analysis nonprofit. The global steam bath explains why investors, regulators and credit-rating agencies are scrutinizing corporate plans for unrecognized climate risks.To increase its odds of all-weather operations, TPC has increased its product inventories and made sure that it can perform critical production tasks in more than one location.A medical-device component maker that TPC owns now carries larger stockpiles of surgical blades and biologic mesh while its aerospace manufacturer holds a greater “safety stock” of aircraft and missile components, according to Dan Brumlik, TPC co-chairman.TPC’s network of companies, which occasionally share resources, can etch metal in five locations. Two sites are equipped to perform plastic-injection-molding operations.With factories in several states, China and Wales, TPC’s financial performance is exposed to a variety of weather risks. Last winter, a heavy snow collapsed the roof of one of its buildings in Bozeman, Mont.“People would talk about the 100-year storm,” Brumlik said. “Now, the 100-year storm is happening twice a year. It needs to be part of our normal operational plan.”The changing climate also is affecting the nation’s airlines. Hot air is less dense, making it harder for aircraft to gain the lift they need to leave the ground. At often sweltering Phoenix Sky Harbor airport, the Embraer 175 model aircraft used by American Airlines’ regional affiliates could not fly last summer when temperatures exceeded 120 degrees.United Airlines has warned that the warming climate could cause greater turbulence for flights, especially in the Mid-Atlantic, and pose risks to flight attendants. United operations also could be affected by flooding at airports in Newark and Houston.These concerns appeared in voluntary filings that the airlines, like many corporations, submitted to the nonprofit Carbon Disclosure Project.Climate risks also are figuring in investment calculations. Charles Schwab warned retail investors last week that the municipal bond market is overlooking the potential impact of extreme weather events.Municipal bonds issued by airport authorities in Miami, Chicago and Denver each pay investors around the same 4.75 percent return. Yet the danger of a costly weather event, such as a hurricane and related flooding, is far greater in Miami, the firm said in a monthly newsletter.“Investors in Miami munis aren’t being compensated for the region’s greater weather-related risk,” Schwab said, advising clients to diversify their bond holdings geographically and to invest only in higher-rated issuers and short-term bonds.On Wall Street, JPMorgan said last year that it was stress testing its portfolios “with the worst outcomes” to guard against unforeseen climate impacts. Analysts evaluate the likely effects of severe weather on real estate holdings and commodity prices to determine how the firm’s clients and portfolios would fare, Michelle Scales, JPMorgan’s top climate risk executive, said last year.The epic heat wave that blanketed much of the United States with triple-digit temperatures and Hurricane Beryl’s lashing of Houston cap a recent flurry of extreme weather episodes.Since May, Colorado took a pounding from hail; tornadoes swept six central states; and several days of storms ravaged Iowa and other states, causing nearly $5 billion in damages, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.“The effect of extreme weather events and rapid climate change on businesses’ operations is slowly coming onto radar screens around the country. But it’s a slow evolution. I think the extreme weather events we’re seeing this summer are speeding up the intellectual uptake,” said Susan Crawford, a Harvard Law School professor.Along with safeguarding their own facilities, companies must monitor their suppliers’ climate resilience, according to Crawford, the author of a 2023 book about Charleston, S.C., and its struggle with rising seas.Resilinc, a supply chain management firm, has sent its clients 130 percent more weather-related alerts of potential disruptions this year compared with the first half of 2023, CEO Bindiya Vakil said. The company uses artificial intelligence to scour news reports and social media sites in more than 100 languages, searching for developments that could upend global trade flows such as the drought that limited traffic through the Panama Canal for much of the past year.“The frequency has gone up. And because of that, companies are making business continuity investments,” she said, noting purchases of on-site power generation and alternative water supplies.Indeed, an ongoing drought in Mexico’s Tamaulipas state affected the region’s petrochemical industry, leading some Mexican producers to declare force majeure, an unforeseeable development that prevents contracts from being fulfilled. The widespread nature of the months-long drought may prompt some buyers to switch to suppliers in China, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.The availability of adequate water supplies in Mexico’s industrial sector is also a worry for General Motors, which has four plants in the northern and central parts of the country producing engines and transmissions for vehicles such as the Chevy Silverado and Chevy Cruze.A future water shortage that interrupts production at one of those sites for one month could cost GM $50 million in profits, the company said in its annual filing with the climate organization.GM, which declined to make an executive available for an interview, said in its filing that it aims to cut its water consumption 35 percent by 2035. The automaker is spending $49 million over three years on a new wastewater treatment and water recycling system at its Ramos Arizpe facility, which produces the Chevrolet Blazer EV.Meanwhile, U.S. utilities are under pressure to ensure a reliable electric grid despite more frequent storms, flooding and fires.Duke Energy, in Charlotte, last year spent $4 billion to harden infrastructure, “strengthen the grid against storms and shorten restoration time when outages occur,” the company said in its annual report.The utility built flood walls around several substations and relocated others beyond the reach of once-in-a-century floods. Duke also replaced traditional wooden transmission poles with ones made of concrete and steel. The utility declined an interview request.In November, six New York utilities submitted to state regulators plans to spend a total of $8.7 billion to make the power system more resilient to climate change.Consolidated Edison, which serves 10 million customers in New York City and Westchester County, plans to devote $2.4 billion to “prevent, mitigate and respond” to climate risks over the next decade, according to the 228-page plan it filed with the state Public Service Commission.But the climate may be changing faster than the power grid.Con Ed now expects 17 days annually with temperatures above 95 degrees by the year 2030, a decade sooner than originally forecast, while rising sea levels threaten more frequent flooding. Top wind speeds in Manhattan by mid-century are expected to reach 110 mph, up from 80 mph today.To prevent power outages, Con Ed plans to make its systems more resilient, including by elevating substations and burying some “high-risk overhead electrical lines.”“Every time you turn the corner, there’s another event when you have this utility and extreme weather combination and people pointing fingers. It absolutely is getting attention up to the board level at utilities across the country because it’s an existential threat to these companies,” said Judsen Bruzgul, senior director for climate adaptation and resilience at ICF, a consultancy.In March, after the largest wildfire in Texas history burned more than 1 million acres, credit rating agency S&P Global Ratings downgraded Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries, citing their increased vulnerability to wildfire risks. The change will make it more expensive for the utility to raise money from investors.Some companies see profits in the need to adapt to the changing climate.In D.C., Xylem is helping industrial customers and utilities address their need for affordable water supplies. In Florida, rising sea levels mean salt water is contaminating aquifers that drugmakers rely on. In Texas, the industrial users face periodic shortages.Xylem can filter salt water to make it pure enough for a computer chip maker, pump out a flooded factory or provide temporary water trailers during a drought. The company’s technology allows facilities to recycle and reuse around 75 percent of the water they use, according to Snehal Desai, Xylem’s chief growth and innovation officer.Xylem told investors in May it expects to book around $8.5 billion in revenue this year, up from $7.4 billion in 2023, noting “a significant opportunity for profitable above-market growth.”This year, the company’s shares have gained more than 24 percent, outpacing the 19 percent increase of the S&P 500 index.“We’ve seen a change in behavior. We’ve seen a change in investment,” Desai said. “We think there’s an opportunity here.”"

WaPo_47,What is ‘gay and trans panic’? Michigan is latest to ban criminal defense.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/25/lgbtq-panic-defense-gay-trans-michigan/,2024-07-25 18:00:02.702650,,"Michigan is the latest state to ban the “gay and trans panic” criminal defense, making it unlawful to use “the discovery of a person’s actual or perceived gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation as justification for the commission of a crime.”States have increasingly outlawed the defense in recent years, starting with California in 2006. But it is still lawful in most states. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) signed the bill Tuesday.Advocates for outlawing the defense point to high-profile cases such as the 2015 murder of David Spencer in Texas, who was stabbed by a friend who said he tried to kiss him. James Miller was sentenced in 2018 to six months in prison after his murder charge was downgraded to criminally negligent homicide following a “gay panic” defense argument from his attorney.The American Bar Association has called for legislative action to “curtail the availability and effectiveness” of the defense, saying that “successful gay and trans panic defenses constitute a miscarriage of justice.”The legal defense is used when a defendant charged with a violent crime attempts to use the victim’s sexual identity as a mitigating factor in his culpability, with the goal of acquittal or reduced charges.A man accused of killing another man or trans woman, for example, might argue in court that the victim had either indicated interest in him, tried to sexually assault him or engaged in sexual behavior with him without disclosing their sexual identity.W. Carsten Andresen, an assistant professor of criminal justice at St. Edward’s University in Austin, has compiled a database of gay and trans panic defense cases from media articles, legal transcripts and academic writing. He found more than 700 instances of the defense being used in murder cases between 1970 and 2024 in the United States, including 18 in Michigan, he said in a phone interview. It was an effective tactic in reducing charges about a third of the time, his analysis of early data found.Andresen said there were four main ways the argument is used.The first is provocation, in which a defense attorney argues that a victim “hitting on” a defendant is “so upsetting, and it would be so upsetting to any man, that the violence is understandable,” Andresen said. He added this was used more often as a tactic to reduce charges, for example from first- or second-degree murder to manslaughter.The second is to bolster a self-defense argument in which the perpetrator of violence alleges the victim sexually assaulted him or attempted to assault him.The third is insanity, in which the defendant argues that he had such a strong reaction to the actions of an LGBTQ+ person that he broke with reality and used violence, which has typically not been successful in courtrooms, Andresen said.The fourth is diminished capacity, a lesser version of insanity that argues the victim’s sexual identity affected the perpetrator’s mental state.The Michigan law bans using a person’s real or perceived sexual identity in a provocation defense, a “heat of passion” defense or a reduced mental capacity defense.Andresen said it empowers judges and prosecutors to stop or object to defense attorneys using a victim’s sexual identity when making arguments to a jury. “There are still ways that the defense attorney will try to get around it,” he said. “But it allows you to be vocal in calling this out and identifying it for what it is.”“It’s been likened to rape shield laws with women, where if a woman is sexually assaulted, you’re not allowed to bring up her sexual history,” he added. “You hopefully are providing a little bit more context for what a defense attorney is trying to do when they try to insinuate that somebody … is somehow to blame or that the offender is less culpable for the harm that they caused.”Twenty states and the District of Columbia have some form of legislation prohibiting an LGBTQ+ panic defense: California, Illinois, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Nevada, New York, D.C., Colorado, New Jersey, Washington, Maryland, Oregon, Vermont, Virginia, New Mexico, New Hampshire, Delaware, Minnesota and Michigan, according to the National LGBTQ+ Bar Association.There is legislation pending in Pennsylvania, and it has been introduced but failed in Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Montana, Wisconsin, Georgia, Massachusetts, Nebraska, North Carolina and Texas, the group said.A federal bill was introduced by Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Chris Pappas (D-N.H.) in 2021 and reintroduced in 2023 but has not passed."
WaPo_48,Biden the anti-icon,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/2024/07/25/president-biden-address-television-analysis/,2024-07-25 18:00:02.702650,,"President Biden’s address to the nation Wednesday, in which he elaborated on his stunning announcement that he would no longer seek reelection, was brief, targeted and a little bit hard to watch. The president was characteristically decent and self-abnegating in his remarks. Speaking from the Oval Office, he repeatedly emphasized that the nation’s needs mattered more than his own ambition or the second term he believed he deserved. “I draw strength and find joy in working for the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our union is not about me, it’s about you,” he said, in a moment that radiated real conviction. “Your families, your futures.”The president was strikingly disciplined during the most consequential address of his term. Almost to a fault. Few were the flickers of the trademark spontaneity that once made Joe Biden a political powerhouse (and a liability, known for his gaffes). The guy who laughed with Jon Stewart about making up a coal miner ancestor, encouraged the “Uncle Joe” stuff during his vice presidency and billed himself as a “gut politician” seemed not just solemn but stiff during these momentous remarks on the end of his presidential ambitions. Even the movement of his hands felt choreographed. I exhaled in relief when he briefly broke eye contact with the camera to point, with his thumb, at a portrait of Benjamin Franklin behind him. There was just a hint of the Biden we knew — that old Ray-Ban-wearing, cackling ease.Sure, some of that is attributable to old age. But I’ve been thinking about Biden’s theory of television, as his reluctance to use it has been one of the stranger features of his presidency. Biden isn’t a newcomer to the small screen or to political stagecraft. He cut his teeth on television, and he was good at it. In interviews from the period immediately following his initial election as senator, he seems astonishingly comfortable, assured and far older than his 30 years. He wasn’t camera-shy as vice president. (It’s no coincidence that he did a guest spot on “Parks and Recreation.”) There’s a reason Donald Trump got himself impeached trying to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open an investigation into Hunter Biden’s activities there; he understood that Joe Biden was the greatest threat to his reelection.One of Biden’s advantages during 2020 — when the pandemic made in-person campaigning trickier — was his ability to channel his personal grief, on television, into the nation’s general despair. That weird, televised Democratic National Convention proved that Biden could connect with people using formats others couldn’t.It’s striking, therefore, that Biden elected to be a behind-the-scenes president. And that he made TV history by staying off it when he announced he wouldn’t seek a second term, opting instead to publish a written statement. Sure, that decision could have been justified by his illness. (He was sick with covid-19.) But the strangest feature of Wednesday night’s address, which should have been earthshakingly significant, was that it felt tacked-on, an addendum rather than the main event. One of Biden’s more obvious verbal crutches — his tendency to say “anyway” and drift off midsentence, often when he’s making a point about his legacy — feels like it might represent, in microcosm, a more general tendency to limit the public’s exposure to his decision to step down. That can’t help but mute the effect.In journalistic terms, it felt like the president had scooped himself.The debate over Biden’s legacy will be long and spirited, but my main impression, watching Biden last night — and it’s a thought I’ve had before, despite having no illusions about any career politicians’ essential narcissism — is that the man gets bored talking about his own achievements. Anytime Biden starts listing his administration’s wins, you can practically watch him glaze over. I don’t think that’s the main reason he’s had so much trouble making a case for his second term during this electoral season, but I do think the man had a built-in advantage when his job required him to talk about national grief rather than national prosperity.On paper, the president hit all the right notes. His many appeals to history were pointed and germane: “George Washington showed us presidents are not kings,” he said, in one of several references to Trump’s undisguised fondness for authoritarianism. His frequent reminders to the public that the power to determine the nation’s future rests with them were moving if a tad, well, rote. (The same can’t be said for his extremely surprising announcement that he intends to reform the Supreme Court during his remaining months in office.)Whatever the reasons, Biden ended his political career with an address that wasn’t as sad as it could have been — or as rousing or dramatic. Many of the president’s recent stumbles, including his disastrous debate performance last month, have stemmed from circumstances outside his control. But the temperate, low-key tenor of his appeal Wednesday night feels deliberate. Crafted. Maybe that’s a stage of life. Or maybe, given his opponent’s destructive thirst for attention at any price, it represents the culmination of a belated but considered rejection of the histrionics required to be an icon, rather than a president."
WaPo_49,"At Israel’s soccer opener, the Olympic spirit never felt so distant",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/25/israel-olympics-soccer-mali-protesters/,2024-07-25 17:00:02.702650,,"PARIS — The match couldn’t happen until armed guards escorted the Israelis to the grounds.Not until Police Nationale patted down every spectator before they entered Parc des Princes stadium. Not until cops on horses patrolled the perimeter and even more on motorbikes honked cyclists out of their way. Certainly not until the gendarmerie — several clutching weapons that seemed more appropriate for battlefields than the boulevards of Paris — made it clear that this meeting between Israel and Mali would not be a normal Olympic soccer match.And then, this event could not happen until the national anthems blared inside the open-air stadium, echoing into the night. After Mali’s national song played, the Israeli anthem began. So did the jeers. That’s when a group made its presence known. A group that occupied a front row of the stands because its members saw this Olympic soccer match as an attempt to whitewash the brutality of war. Each person in the group wore a white T-shirt with a single letter written boldly in black. When they stood together, their shirts spelled out “FREE PALESTINE.” Israel’s song played on; those in attendance who held up their white-and-blue flags with the Star of David just sang louder.When a peloton of police, men and women packing assault rifles and pro-Palestine protesters all show up to a soccer stadium, the Olympic spirit of unity seems distant, almost imagined. The games just feel like 90 minutes of distraction. The numbing effect prescribed because the volume of voices has only gotten louder since Hamas and other militant groups committed war crimes against Israeli civilians and since Israel’s response has drawn condemnation from the top court of the United Nations.Despite the war in Gaza, they played soccer here. In the first half, a small crew of people in front of the media area brought out their Palestine flags. A man wore a yellow sticker with a phrase that translated to: “Genocide is not a sport ... Boycott Israel at the Paris Olympics!” Men in purple and black “Securite” vests quickly appeared and told him to remove the sticker. Later, when Mali defender Hamidou Diallo kicked the ball into his own net, several Israel fans turned and cheered in the direction of the group that had sneaked their Palestinian flags past security. When  Cheickna Doumbia scored the equalizer, those fans jumped and screamed for Mali. Every chant, every celebration, every expression of passion seemed to be about more than soccer.The day before this match, a large group of anti-Israel protesters gathered in the Place de Clichy neighborhood, near a bookstore and a fast food place that featured a life-size image of former NBA star Tony Parker promoting “Le French Burgers.” A woman with white hair held the megaphone. As she spoke, a parade of women with somber faces pushed strollers that were all but empty, except for a photo of a dead or injured child.For those protesters, they do not see Liel Abada as the promising young forward. Nor the player who left his Scottish-based team for Charlotte FC after some Celtic fans demonstrated, holding a pro-Palestine banner at a home match. Because Abada was born in the central region of Israel and plays on the national team, they view him solely as a potential recruit for the Israel Defense Forces and a reason all those strollers are empty. (The country requires every citizen over 18 to serve in its army.)“We’ve been protesting every day for four weeks now,” said Soufiane M., a protester who requested to use only his first name after one of the organizers noticed he was giving an interview to a reporter. “Despite all of this, we still have the presence of all the Israel athletes here in France. And we have to be aware that in Israel, military service is mandatory. So all these athletes are also part of the IDF, they’re also part of the genocide happening now in Gaza, and this is what we’re fighting for.”Abada arrived at Parc des Princes under heightened security. He heard the booing during his country’s anthem. If he happened to gaze behind his team’s sideline and into the crowd, he would have noticed the presence of Palestine flags — and even a watermelon floatie, a nod to the popular symbol of pro-Palestinian protesters. Yet, Abada said he’s centered on just the games.“We don’t look about what’s going on outside in the stadium; we just want to play our football and to make our fans and our people in Israel proud,” Abada said. “We came here just to play football. The [team] staff speaks with us a lot about it, and we just need to be focused on football and that’s it.”The Opening Ceremonies aren’t until Friday night. Still, the Games didn’t need an official start before the geopolitical conflicts crashed the gates of the party. Every time the Israeli national team takes the field or a Palestinian athlete wears their national colors or a Russian or Belarusian competitor stands under a neutral flag, we’ll be reminded how the world doesn’t stop burning simply because we have lit the Olympic flame."
WaPo_50,Weather to heat up at Paris Olympics after chance of rain at Opening Ceremonies,https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/25/paris-olympics-weather-forecast/,2024-07-25 17:00:02.702650,,"Organizers, athletes and spectators are closely watching the weather forecast ahead of the Paris Olympics as intense heat lurks in portions of southern and eastern Europe. There are no signs of exceptional heat or heavy rain around Paris over the next week, but temperatures could soar in southern France and briefly near 90 (32 degrees Celsius) in Paris on Tuesday. The forecast beyond then is less certain.Should temperatures climb into the 90s (32 to 37 degrees Celsius), which is most probable in southern France, athletes and spectators would have to take more precautions to reduce the risk of heat illness. Paris and the rest of France have experienced multiple deadly heat waves in recent years as human-caused climate change has increased average temperatures and the frequency of hot days.Weather models show highs in Paris from 75 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (24 to 27 degrees Celsius) on Friday (the day of the Opening Ceremonies) and Sunday, with cooler highs in the low 70s (21 to 22 Celsius) on Saturday.Forecast temperatures trend warmer early next week, with highs possibly approaching 90 on Tuesday (32 Celsius), before pulling back into the 80s (27 to 32 Celsius) for the rest of the week. The average high at this time of year is near 80 (27 Celsius).Overnight lows are expected to be mostly in the upper 50s to mid-60s (14 to 19 Celsius).Temperatures: Soccer venues in southern and central France — in Marseille, Bordeaux, Saint-Etienne and Lyon — should be at least a few degrees warmer than Paris, with some models predicting significantly hotter highs in the 90s (32 to 37 degrees Celsius) next week. Overnight lows should be several degrees warmer in southern and central France, as well, in the mid-60s to low 70s (19 to 23 Celsius).Precipitation and clouds: Models predict minimal amounts of rain through the first week of the Games, although light showers are possible around Paris at times Friday and Saturday as a cool front moves through the region. Another chance of showers could arrive around the middle of next week. Models are tending to show more clouds on Friday into the weekend, and more sun during the weekdays that follow.Wind: No major windstorm is expected through at least the first week. However, gusty winds could affect the sailing competition in Marseille between Wednesday and Friday.It’s important to note that model forecasts a week or more into the future can sometimes have significant errors. MeteoFrance, the country’s national weather service, expects next week’s weather in France to be “generally dry with some wetter periods possible in the north” and above-normal temperatures, while “no dominant scenario” has emerged for the following week.Several international weather organizations, including the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research, are collaborating to provide Olympics organizers with detailed forecasts of weather and air quality. Meteorologists are keeping their eye on areas of intense heat that have boosted temperatures in Spain and southeastern Europe past 100 degrees (38 Celsius) in recent weeks.The potential for a heat wave during the Paris Olympics, being held during what are typically the city’s hottest weeks of the year, has drawn much attention from both scientists and athletes. Recent high temperatures on July 26, when the Games open, have ranged from 75 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit (24 to 39 Celsius).The average temperature in Paris during late July and early August has warmed by more than five degrees since 1924, the last time the city hosted the Olympics, according to a report published last month. In that time, the nonprofit Climate Central says, “scorching days” with highs of 86 (30 Celsius) or more have become nearly three times as frequent in Paris.France has experienced many deadly heat waves in recent years:Researchers have found that human-caused climate change is making heat waves in Europe and other parts of the world hotter than they otherwise would have been.Heat was a major factor at the 2021 Olympic Games in Tokyo, postponed from 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Tokyo was considered the hottest Olympics ever, with daytime highs in the 90s (32 to 37 degrees Celsius) and a heat index as high as 109 (43 Celsius) causing a Russian archer to collapse and a Spanish tennis player to retire early from a match, both because of heatstroke. To combat the heat, officials added extra break time during tennis matches and moved the marathon competition north to Sapporo.A publication on the Olympics website, titled “Beat the Heat,” warns that “hot and humid ambient conditions limit heat dissipation capacity during exercise, impairing endurance performance and increasing the risk of exertional heat illness such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke.” Athletes are encouraged to train in hot weather “before any event where hot and/or humid conditions are possible” to improve performance and reduce the risk of heat illness.It’s not just hot daytime temperatures that can cause problems, but also warm nights. Sweltering nights with low temperatures of 68 (20 degrees Celsius) or higher are 20 times as frequent in Paris now than they were 100 years ago, according to Climate Central.Concerned about a lack of air conditioning in the athletes village, the United States and several other countries are bringing portable units to ensure a comfortable sleeping environment for their athletes."
WaPo_51,The ordinary people risking everything to protect Venezuela’s vote,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/25/venezuela-vote-observers-monitors-maduro/,2024-07-25 17:00:02.702650,,"LA GUAIRA, Venezuela — In the sweltering patio of a private home, two dozen volunteers listened carefully as an organizer prepared them for the delicate, potentially dangerous job ahead.Intelligence agents of the socialist state circled the house. An outside wall bore pro-government graffiti identifying it as a meeting place for the opposition.Venezuela was less than a week away from the most important election the country has seen in a decade, one that could compel President Nicolás Maduro to at least share power with the opposition. The volunteers were among the thousands of citizen testigos — witnesses — who will try on Sunday to protect a basic tenant of democracy: a fair vote.The job was simple: watching polling centers to ensure all rules are followed. But in a country where the authoritarian president is accused of rigging elections — disqualifying challengers, barring international observers, harassing opponents, menacing voters — their work could be essential.And here in Vargas state, a stronghold of government support, the witnesses were taking on a significant risk. By showing their faces at their local polling places, they say, they are facing harassment and threats from their own neighbors. And in a place where many families live in government housing or depend on the state for a weekly ration of food staples, they could be risking their homes and livelihoods.Opposition organizer Mairim Arvelo Monroy urged them to be honest about whether they could commit to taking that risk.“Whoever has doubts must step to the side,” she said, and with a handkerchief dabbed sweat from her face. “Be clear, be firm, tell us if you can’t go, if you’re afraid. The fear is valid, and understandable.”Venezuela’s opposition says it has recruited witnesses to monitor more than 98 percent of 30,000 of the country’s polling tables — one per candidate per table. “For the first time, we are going to be one step ahead of them,” said one organizer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern for security.Maduro, who took power here after the death of Hugo Chávez in 2013, has presided over an economic collapse and violent repression that have driven more than 7 million people to flee the country. On Sunday, he faces the greatest challenge yet to his authoritarian rule: a unified, popular opposition running in what he has promised will be a fair election.Polls show opposition candidate Edmundo González would win a clean vote in a landslide. But few here expect Maduro to let that happen.“The worst scenario would be that the government steals the vote and we don’t have a way to prove it,” said one opposition politician, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern for security.The opposition had planned to send its most experienced witnesses to the centers most vulnerable to fraud — principally, those in strongly chavista, or pro-government, areas. But last month, the government announced new rules. Witnesses are limited to monitoring their own voting centers — meaning they will be watching their own neighbors.“They forced us to race, all over the country,” to recruit new members, Vargas organizer José Rafael Rolón Cedeño said.This has been especially tricky in historically chavista states such as Vargas, where 10 opposition organizers have been jailed this election cycle, Rolón said. In some areas, such as one near a military university, where most locals serve in the armed forces, the opposition is resigned to simply not having witnesses. “They did that on purpose, to block us,” Arvelo said.The government has also divided larger voting centers into smaller ones — some remote polling tables serve only 100 voters. Opposition organizers have sent teams on 5-hour motorbike rides into the mountains to knock on doors and ask — discreetly — for volunteers.The changes have led many witnesses to back out. But one 74-year-old man in Arvelo’s audience was steadfast.Organizers had struggled to recruit volunteers in Aciclo Requena’s housing “mission,” a dilapidated complex built by Chávez right across the street from Venezuela’s international airport. Requena and his family were given a small apartment here after they lost their home in devastating mudslides in 1999 that killed an estimated 190,000 people. In Maduro’s first election, he took 91 percent of the vote here.Requena’s wife has hypertension, diabetes and early signs of dementia. He has no legal title to their home, he says, and fears the government could take it away. They haven’t had running water in 15 days. They live off Requena’s salary from a food company; he’s paid not in money but food staples, and then sells packets of rice and pasta to neighbors for cash.On Sunday, he says, he is willing to risk it all. Requena expects to be his polling table’s only witness, with no substitute to fill in for him should he need a meal or bathroom break, for more than 12 hours straight.“If I have to hold on until dawn, I will hold on,” he said. “If we’re afraid, we lose.”He spoke with a young woman who will be the only other witness in his area. She looked nervous. Requena reached for her hand.“We have to put up with the fight,” he told her. “The process is uncomfortable for them, but not for us. Don’t be afraid, because I’m going. I’ll be close by. We will help each other out.”The volunteers spoke as if they were preparing for a battle.“There are hundreds of Venezuelans joining an army of brave men, brave women, willing to defend our vote, even with our lives,” witness Francisco Valderrama said. “As I have told my wife and daughters at home, you go out, vote, you return home, but I am going to be defending our vote at the polling station until the end.”“At 72 years old,” Inés Pinto said, “I have nothing more to lose.”They trained on the patio of the old, apparently empty house of an opposition leader. They had planned to meet in an office building, but it had been swarmed in recent days by intelligence officers. Scrawled outside the home was “Bolivarian Fury,” the name of a Maduro plan to thwart “terrorist and coup attempts.”Arvelo explained the steps involved in opening up, running and closing each voting center, and how to report any suspicious activity. If a witness notices, for example, someone who seems to be accompanying voters or pressuring them to vote for the government, she said, they should notify their witness captain.“If you see something, if you see that someone bumped the voting machine, or the military removed you arbitrarily — those are electoral crimes,” she said.A volunteer raised his hand. “The most important thing is that on Sunday,” he advised, “please, do not fall for any temptation.”In one large government housing mission, home to thousands of families, six witnesses have pulled out. Days before the vote, campaign organizers tried to recruit a retired firefighter and paramedic. The man, who spoke on the condition that he be identified only as Alex, agreed to sign up. But he was still weighing his concerns.The former public servant, a father of two, now fishes for a living. From his small home, he can see a mural of Chávez, the president for whom he once voted.On the one hand, he feared he might lose the little he has managed to hold on to, simply for supporting a fair vote.“For me, there are other risks,” he said. “The risk that Venezuela doesn’t change.”It was a gamble for democracy. Days before the election, he decided he wasn’t willing to take it."
WaPo_52,Pr. George’s school board member who resigned had been working in Missouri,https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/07/25/prince-georges-county-school-board-missouri-job/,2024-07-25 17:00:02.702650,,"A recently departed Prince George’s County school board member who frequently missed board meetings held since the beginning of the year had started a job in January as a high-level official in a Missouri school district.David Murray, who was first elected to the board in 2016 to represent District 1, resigned from his Prince George’s post last week, five months before the end of his second term. News of his position in Missouri and his subsequent school board resignation were first reported by WTOP.During the 2023-2024 school year, Murray often was absent from meetings and attended others virtually. A request for his removal from the board had been filed with the Maryland State Board of Education for “willful neglect of duty.” The spokesperson for the state department of education declined to release further details of that complaint, including who filed it. It was dismissed after Murray stepped down.Murray started his job as chief academic officer with the Ferguson-Florissant School District  on Jan. 4, said Onye Hollomon, a spokesperson for the Missouri school district. “He has had no issues with attendance and adhering to the in-person work requirement,” she said in an email. Hollomon did not respond to a question about Murray’s salary with Ferguson-Florissant.Prince George’s School Board members are required to be registered voters in the county, according to the school board’s handbook, and elected members are required to live in their district. The handbook also instructs board members to “attend all regularly scheduled Board meetings insofar possible” and allows virtual attendance up to four times in a fiscal year.The board roles are part-time jobs with an annual stipend of about $18,000, while the chair receives an additional $1,000. It is typical for members to have a full-time role or be a retiree.Prince George’s school officials did not respond to questions about how much of the stipend Murray has received this year. He had previously filed for reelection on Dec. 26, but he told WTOP he is no longer running for the seat.Murray declined to comment on his dual roles but said in a resignation letter last week, “I resign effectively immediately. I would like to sincerely thank District 1 for believing in me and supporting me over the years. God bless.” He did not mention his Missouri job.A spokeswoman for Prince George’s County Public Schools referred questions about Murray to Ryvell Fitzpatrick, the school board’s director. Fitzpatrick did not respond to requests for comment, nor did the school board chair.The complaint with the state board was considered moot after Murray stepped down and was dismissed Tuesday, according to a copy of the decision provided by Murray. A spokeswoman for the state department of education confirmed the action.Hollomon said the Missouri system was aware that Murray was a school board member for a district in Maryland, but was told he would be transitioning away from that role.The Prince George’s County school board oversees Maryland’s second-largest district. Over the past few years, it’s been a 14-member board with both elected and appointed board members, but in June, it transitioned to a fully elected school board, with nine elected members and a student member.Edward Burroughs — a former ally of Murray on the school board who now serves on the Prince George’s County Council — said that Murray met the legal residency requirement because he is still a homeowner, taxpayer and resident in the county. He added that Murray was in the final year of his second term and wanted to close out his responsibilities. The board was going through a transition this summer as the terms of the outgoing appointed members were set to expire. Murray decided to leave around the time the other members were, Burroughs said.“He was an incredible school board member full of integrity, full of expertise and a strong work ethic,” said Burroughs, who now represents District 8 on the county council.In addition to his part-time job as a Prince George’s County school board member, Murray served as an adjunct faculty member at American University in its Education Policy and Leadership department, according to his biography with the Missouri school district. He was also a literacy coach for the Children’s Literacy Initiative and worked as a learning specialist and bilingual special education teacher at schools in D.C.During his tenure on the school board, he was part of a group of millennial school board members who were previously students in the school system and at one point made up five out of the nine elected seats. He was a part of a voting bloc that focused on inflated graduation rates, large pay raises to executive staff and a nearly $800,000 contract payout to a schools chief whose tenure was marred by scandal. Several of those members have since left, citing a dysfunctional environment.In 2019, Murray was one of the most vocal critics of Patricia Eubanks keeping her District 4 school board seat when there were questions on whether she met the residency requirement, said Alvin Thornton, who served as chair of the school board at that time. Thornton said that Murray “prosecuted that as a board member more aggressively than anybody else.” Eubanks later resigned.Thornton says Murray should have resigned after he agreed to take the job in Missouri.“Whatever may have been the explanation for the dual employment, the dual residency in an important elective position, I have no interest in that. That’s his personal issue,” said Thornton, who served as chair four times and is respected in the education world for his work leading a state commission on education funding. “What I have an issue with is the duplicity, the lack of consistent ethics.” He said the school board and county council need to “learn from these examples.”Former school board chair Judy Mickens-Murray, whose term expired in June, said some members speculated that Murray’s residency may have changed because his attendance was spotty. She said she learned the state board of education was looking into Murray, and had wanted to wait for the outcome of that investigation to decide next steps. She said she found out about his job in Missouri after her term ended.Pamela Boozer-Strother, who represents District 3 on the school board, said she was one of the skeptical board members, noting Murray hadn’t been attending meetings in-person starting in January. But he would show up occasionally virtually, she said. She added she found out about his other job after he resigned.“He should have resigned at that time and allowed the process of replacement to proceed so that the students and school families of District 1 had representation,” she said.Typically when a school board member resigns, County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks (D) appoints a replacement to serve until the next election. Zipporah Miller (District 5) and Madeline LaSalle Frazier (District 8), were Alsobrooks’s choices to fill two recent vacancies."
WaPo_53,How Chappell Roan did it,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/2024/07/25/chappell-roan-rise/,2024-07-25 17:00:02.702650,,"There is something very unusual about Chappell Roan.No, not the Elizabethan white face paint and wire-thin brows. Not the outfits (the outfits!): those assless chaps, the barely-there pasties, the glitter (the glitter!). Not the lyrics, witty and raunchy (“knee-deep in the passenger seat”), coy when not vulgar (“I want this like a cigarette/ Can we drag it out and never quit?”), frequently unprintable in a family newspaper. Not that she refers to herself as a character, a drag persona she can put on and take off …Well, maybe some of those things. But what’s really unusual about Chappell Roan is that she has one of the hottest albums in the country — “The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess” — and it wasn’t a hit when it came out 10 months ago. Until suddenly it was.Here, in July 2024, no one could argue that Roan is anything but a megawatt pop star. Buoyed by her joyous, unabashedly fun (fun!) brand of singalong pop, the 26-year-old songwriter has experienced an intense and undeniable ascent in recent months. Last month, she had four concurrent hits on the Billboard Hot 100.In the first seven months of the year, Roan’s weekly U.S. streams jumped from 2.7 million to 82.6 million across all major platforms. (The entertainment data and insights company Luminate provided data for this story.) She has opened for Olivia Rodrigo’s sold-out Guts World Tour, performed at NPR’s Tiny Desk, headlined a national tour and performed at nearly every major music festival on the U.S. summer circuit. With each performance, it seems as if Roan’s fame — and chart ranking, and blanketing of TikTok feeds — has only grown.In some ways, Roan is the beneficiary of old-school hustle: relentless touring, well-timed singles and a meticulous focus on performance. But it’s also an internet story in which Roan spent years painstakingly building a presence on Instagram and TikTok to the point of exhaustion, a grind she described to The Washington Post last year. The algorithms love her. But she resonates with humans, too. Roan is the kind of queer pop star who seems ready-made for the moment: referential, silly in a messy way yet aesthetically precise, and one of a kind.“All pop stars are characters,” says Norma Coates, a pop-music-focused professor at Ontario’s Western University. But Roan is very explicit about her musical project being a performance of a kind of crass, bold femininity that’s often suppressed.Obviously, there are detractors. At one point earlier this year, the allegation that Roan is an “industry plant” — that her sudden virality was somehow concocted in a board room — became something of a meme. And, sure, she’s a major-label pop star working with proven hitmakers, including Rodrigo’s producer. But if you chart the rise and rise (and rise and rise) of this Midwest princess — and talk to the key players who were there — a stranger and more interesting story comes into focus.Start in 2015, perhaps, when the then-17-year-old born Kayleigh Rose Amstutz was signed to Atlantic Records after uploading dark and edgy originals to YouTube. Or in 2018, when she met songwriter and producer Dan Nigro, and in early writing sessions wrote the songs “California” and “Pink Pony Club” with him. Or in August 2020, when Roan was dropped from the label and broke up with her longtime boyfriend the same week. The next year, she left Los Angeles and moved back home to Willard, Mo., working part-time jobs as a nanny and donut-shop staffer while writing music and building a following on social media.But let’s look at April 2020, before Atlantic dropped her, when Roan put “Pink Pony Club” out into the world. It had become a glittery dance-pop song with a showtune undercurrent about leaving home to make it in Hollywood, and it foreshadowed more campy, peppy, often very personal material that she created with Nigro, by then known for his work producing for Rodrigo. Nigro signed Roan to his Amusement Records imprint (which is distributed by Island Records), on which Roan is the only artist.“When we wrote ‘California’ and we wrote ‘Pink Pony Club,’ and when we finished ‘Red Wine Supernova,’ I remember when we finally nailed the song, my body was tingling, … and I’d run home and play it for my wife,” Nigro says. He knew. Recording the songs that would become her debut, Nigro remembers thinking, “If I’m this excited about it, there’s no way other people won’t be as excited about it.”“The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess,” a 14-song sleeper hit, debuted on Sept. 22, 2023. Roan had built enough of a fan base to notch listens in the low millions on Spotify. Even so, the album did not chart on the Billboard 200.4.8 million U.S. weekly streams, week ending Sept. 28Two weeks after the album’s release, at a Jewish open stage event in Boston, the lights trained on local drag performer Ari Ola as they prepared to serenade a bottle of Manischewitz wine. They danced in a tight red dress and fishnets as they lip-synced to Roan’s “Red Wine Supernova,” a “Midwest Princess” single.The 23-year-old Ari Ola identified with Roan as a queer Midwesterner who felt drawn to the coasts, so they decided to ring in the Jewish new year with the song, which they had recently found on TikTok. “Everyone was like: ‘What song is that? Who is that? I’ve never heard of that artist before,’” Ari Ola says. (The performer spoke to The Post on the condition that only their stage name be used because they feared professional repercussions for their risqué performances.) “I definitely am not the earliest listener of hers, but it felt like somehow I was ahead of the curve by a few months.” Now, Roan’s kitschiest tracks are drag-show mainstays.You can hear why. Witty, vaguely filthy songs such as “Red Wine Supernova” — in which Roan jokes slyly to her romantic interest about having a “wand and a rabbit” (it’s a sex toy joke) — have become representative of Roan’s brand of pop.Among those into it: NPR music writer and Tiny Desk Concert co-creator Stephen Thompson, who first listened to Roan in 2022, when a colleague recommended the early single “Casual.” He fell in love with the track — a song about struggling through an unrequited situationship that Thompson calls a “perfect cocktail of … lustful yet bored.” When he heard all of “Midwest Princess,” he knew he had to book Roan for a Tiny Desk Concert.“She seemed to have really found who she is as an artist and how she wants to present herself,” Thompson says. About her Tiny Desk, he remembers thinking: “If her vocals are as on point as I think they’re going to be, I think she’s really going to hit it out of the park.”10.8 million weekly U.S. streams, week ending March 28At NPR’s Washington, D.C., headquarters, Roan showed up in a poofy pink prom dress, ghost-pale foundation, exaggerated blue glitter eye shadow, thin eyebrows and heavily lined lips. As she sings, pink lipstick carefully smeared on her teeth catches the light. She’s wearing a sky-high red beehive wig, accessorized with a tiara, butterfly clips and cigarette butts. Behind her, an all-femme band plays against the backdrop of crowded office shelves, black eyeliner smudged down their cheeks as though fresh from crying.Thompson likens the experience of filming Roan’s set to “capturing lightning in a bottle. I knew it was a special one.”“I was sitting there watching her Tiny Desk thinking, ‘People are going to absolutely love this,’” he says. “I felt like this was going to thrill her fans. The people who love her are going to point at this and say, ‘See!’”And those who didn’t know her already? Thompson says he noticed them in the set’s YouTube comments, writing that they’ve “fallen down a rabbit hole forever.”Since it premiered on March 21, Roan’s Tiny Desk entry has garnered 4.8 million views. But it also kick-started a broader shift into the mainstream for the artist, who had started to tour the country with Rodrigo only a month before. The week the Tiny Desk Concert premiered, Roan’s total weekly U.S. streams jumped from 7.1 million to almost 11 million. “It ended up being perfect timing, I think, for what she and her people had in mind,” Thompson says of the Tiny Desk Concert, which ended up being Stop 1 on Roan’s road map to the summer charts. When he introduced Roan to the NPR office before her concert started, Thompson told his colleagues that they would remember this moment when the Grammys rolled around. “Her people were like, ‘From your lips to God’s ears,’” Thompson says. “And I think that’s exactly how it’s playing out.”11.4 million weekly U.S. streams, week ending April 4During the spring, Roan played 24 sold-out shows from California to Boston, introducing herself to tens of thousands of new fans each night.That includes music industry veteran and Emerson College professor Kristin Lieb, who studies the relationships between gender and sexuality in music marketing. She attended Rodrigo’s April 2 show in Boston, Roan’s last on the tour. Lieb was blown away by Roan’s set, which she described as a “performance journey that is something like drag and something like a concert and something like a singalong.”“If you’re there for Olivia Rodrigo and you got there early, you’re seeing someone who is very similar, and she’s a great performer,” Lieb says. “And performance is really what converts people with her. … Seeing her makes you want to know more about her.”24.7 million U.S. weekly streams, week ending April 11With everything on the upswing, Roan released a new single, “Good Luck, Babe!” It’s a song about compulsory heterosexuality; it became yet another example of accidentally perfect timing, Nigro says. Originally conceptualized for “Midwest Princess,” the track didn’t feel complete to Nigro and Roan, so they continued working on it. By April, it was ready — in all of its homecoming-dance synth-pop glory. “I look at it as if it was all meant to be. That song was meant to wait,” Nigro says.The mid-album-cycle release gave Roan’s fans something to chew on in the lead-up to a jam-packed summer festival schedule.During the single’s release week, Roan’s U.S. streams more than doubled, according to industry data and insights company Luminate. That week alone, they jumped from 11 million to 25 million. It is now, by far, her biggest hit to date.36.6 million U.S. weekly streams, week ending April 25More than 10 million more weekly streams later, on April 12 and 19, Roan would perform at Coachella’s Gobi tent, usually reserved for smaller artists. During Weekend 1, she performed to a crowd that extended beyond the tent in a studded heavy-metal shirt and a latex top that read “Eat Me.” That performance marked the live festival debut of “Good Luck, Babe!” and soon went viral.#ChappellRoan performing ""Good Luck, Babe!"" live at #Coachella 😍 @chappell roan “Chappell roan performing at coachella you will be remembered for generations,” one user wrote on X, sharing a video of Roan’s performance. As she crawls along the floor and belts the song’s chorus — a warning to a missed connection, “And when you think about me, all of those years ago/ You’re standing face to face with ‘I told you so’” — the audience can be heard clearly, singing every word.Videos from her performance on the second weekend of Coachella show that, by the time she walked out in a massive pink butterfly suit (inspired by Lady Miss Kier of dance-music group Deee-Lite), the audience seemed even more excited. There were more cowboy hats, more glitter and more hands following the motions to Roan’s “Hot to Go!” dance, which she had first posted on TikTok months before.so grateful to witness this from the barricade, chappell roan the star you are😭💛 pink pony club at coachella weekend 2, just listen to the crowd and look at her smile🥰🥰 @chappell roan #fyp #fypシ #chappellroan #coachella #coachella2024 #goodluckbabe #casual #hottogo For the week ending April 20, “Good Luck, Babe!” became Roan’s first track to break into the Billboard Hot 100, at No. 77.38.9 million weekly U.S. streams, week ending May 30By the time Ari Ola, the drag performer in Boston, saw Roan at the Boston Calling festival on May 26, the singer was popular enough to attract one of the biggest crowds of the weekend — reportedly larger than that of some headliners. On a hot, sunny Sunday at 4:05 p.m., Roan played an early daytime set to more than 40,000 people. She did so in white face paint and Édith Piaf-style eyebrows, with a fire-engine-red burlesque bodysuit to match.“I would wager that a lot of people probably bought tickets to see Megan [Thee Stallion] and Hozier and the Killers, and then in the subsequent months found themselves becoming big fans of Chappell Roan,” says Boston Calling booking director Peter Boyd.Those new fans arrived early, he says, noting a “large contingent of pink hats in the line before we even opened the doors.”“It felt like something had clicked, and it felt like suddenly the crowd got it. They suddenly got her,” Ari Ola says. They had seen Roan play in Boston in October for the Midwest Princess Tour, but this was different. “Before, it still felt like she was pitching herself to the crowd,” they say. “Versus when she walked out in Boston Calling, it was: ‘You know who I am, and you know how great this is going to be. I don’t need to sell or pitch anything to you. You know what you’re getting already’”55.6 million weekly U.S. streams, week ending June 1366.7 million weekly U.S. streams, week ending June 20On June 9, Roan took the stage at Governors Ball in New York City inside of a giant apple, covered in green face paint and dressed as the Statue of Liberty, with an oversize joint lit in hand. “I was speechless,” says Katie Schantz, a Miami resident and longtime Roan fan who flew to New York for the festival. “The assless chaps? The green? In the apple? I was like, ‘She is the woman of the year.’”Hot To Gooooo #chappellroan #govballnyc #govball The videos of the Governors Ball performance went viral — virtually inescapable on TikTok and X for weeks afterward — and by the time Roan was set to perform at Bonnaroo in Manchester, Tenn., on June 16, festival organizers decided to upgrade her to a bigger stage.During a concert in Raleigh, N.C., shortly before Bonnaroo, Roan broke down in tears. “I just feel a little off today, ’cause I think that my career is going really fast, and it’s really hard to keep up,” she told the crowd. “... This is all I’ve ever wanted. It’s just heavy sometimes, I think.”“She has been rocket-launched into fame, and I feel like it might be overwhelming for her,” says Sydney Rose, a fan at Boston Calling, adding that Roan’s rise felt to many like an “overnight sensation.”“It’s been pretty incredible, to say the least,” Nigro says. “Kayleigh and I have worked on this record literally for years and years and years, so I always felt deep down in my heart that we were creating something really special and that it was just going to take a minute for the world to catch on to it. And so, to see it start to happen, it just feels insane.”“It’s kind of what I was always dreaming for her,” he added.Dreams are one thing, but numbers say another. For the week ending July 4, Roan had 82,683,704 U.S. streams — a more than 1,600 percent increase from the week she released “The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess.” There has been no fall yet."
WaPo_54,‘The Decameron’ is the best apocalyptic ensemble comedy since ‘Clue’,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/2024/07/25/decameron-netflix-black-comedy-review/,2024-07-25 17:00:02.702650,,"“The Decameron” is TV’s answer to “Clue.”That was my takeaway (as a superfan of the 1985 cult classic) after bingeing Kathleen Jordan’s piquant take on the 14th-century masterpiece by Giovanni Boccaccio, which drops on Netflix on Thursday.Granted, the parallels aren’t obvious. “Clue,” an implausible triumph based on a board game, managed to spin humor, several mystery plots and even some pathos out of its paper-thin source material. “The Decameron,” by contrast, draws from a rich text literally named for the hundred stories it comprises. Published in the aftermath of the Black Death, Boccaccio’s frame narrative features 10 wealthy young people (and some of their servants) sheltering in the countryside from the pestilence ravaging Florence. To wile away the hours, they tell each other stories, usually adhering to themes established by the person they’ve named king or queen for the day. Some stories are about tragic love. Some feature saucy nuns. There are tricksters and hucksters and genial spouse-swappers.But, like “Clue,” which delivered some genuinely fantastic theater while mercilessly lampooning detective-story clichés, this version of “The Decameron” takes a loose and expansive approach to adaptation. Sure, it’s satire. But the result is so joyfully unfaithful — so adept at rounding out characters that should be flat — that it wraps back around again to something like homage.The series wisely turns Boccaccio’s framing device into the main event. The guests in this version aren’t storytellers; they’re the ones driving the action. Still, 10 young people with competing agendas, financial interests and religious beliefs do end up hanging out at a luxurious estate (called Villa Santa in the series) to escape the plague. These include two of the villa’s surviving employees: Tony Hale plays Sirisco, a harried, semi-competent steward covering as best he can for his dead boss Leonardo’s absence as the guests he invited start to arrive. (Also like “Clue,” “The Decameron” is powered by the problem of a pivotal but absent host.) Sirisco’s co-worker Stratilia (Leila Farzad), the estate’s secretive, no-nonsense cook, participates in his ruse out of desperation; the roads are dangerous, and they have nowhere else to go.The guests include Leonardo’s insufferable fiancée, Pampinea (Zosia Mamet), an heiress whose fortune is her main attraction, as well as her slavishly devoted maid, Misia (Saoirse-Monica Jackson of “Derry Girls”). Panfilo (Karan Gill), a gay bon vivant in a marriage of convenience, persuades his extremely religious wife, Neifile (Lou Gala), to accept Leonardo’s invitation to Villa Santa partly to escape his family’s recent financial ruin. Licisca (Tanya Reynolds), a clever and humane maidservant forced to serve her master’s bratty and tyrannical daughter, Filomena (Jessica Plummer), ends up impersonating the latter to gain admission to the villa. And Douggie McMeekin plays a dim and tedious prig named Tindaro, who uses his riches to fund his hypochondria. He travels everywhere with his good-looking doctor, Dioneo (Amar Chadha-Patel), a Lothario who keeps his boss half-poisoned.It’s tempting to single out specific actors for praise: Mamet for her indelible portrayal of a repellent, love-obsessed narcissist. Or Gala for her sympathetic take on a character so absurdly religious it would be easy to make her a simpleton (or a joke). Or Reynolds for the feral gusto with which — dressed as a noblewoman and parrying a dreary man’s advances — she interrupts a speech about her favorite pope to scream “Fish!,” pluck one out and thwack it merrily against the fountain to kill it. (All while the two men in the scene debate whether women are evil.) Gill, whose character starts as a joke, is a standout, and it’s delightful to watch Hale’s take on petulant, codependent servility clash with Jackson’s as their characters squabble over turf.The strength of every one of these performances drives home how long it’s been since a series delivered a really stellar comedy ensemble. Not just a solid show, but a group effort marked by a shared and truly strange comedic sensibility. (Like “Clue”!)There are more recent precursors, of course. Christopher Guest’s films and “Arrested Development” come to mind. So do “Orange Is the New Black” and “Glow.” (It’s no coincidence that “The Decameron” is also executive-produced by Jenji Kohan.) “The Decameron” shares the blithe irreverence with which “Blackadder” and Monty Python approached history and abounds in contemporary touches we know from “Bridgerton” or “Dickinson.” The soundtrack does exactly what you’d expect from a series that scores a medieval text with contemporary songs.What really elevates the series, however, is its tactical restraint. The dialogue is awfully witty for a production this broad; these aren’t all buffoons. The satire is less savage than sad, and the apocalyptic backdrop lends even the silliest conflicts some gravitas. This is a sure-footed production that knows how to marry satire with seriousness.I didn’t expect that from a program that looks, on paper, like a dutiful if belated response to the coronavirus pandemic. If covid taught us anything about how humans process disaster, it’s that no one wants to talk about a pandemic once the worst is over. I think often about how many of us “rediscovered” the 1918 flu pandemic during the worst of the outbreak — and how surprised the non-historians among us were by how completely it seemed to have vanished from public consciousness. It’s no longer mysterious. Pandemics are horrible. They’re also, and this is key, embarrassing. The things we did in the name of self-preservation —  remember sanitizing groceries? The theories that turned out to be wrong. The hiding. The moralizing. The masking (in every sense).“Clue” and “The Decameron” both feature folks trapped in fancy estates who start seeing each other as threats as civilization and its rules melt away. In “Clue,” that was a potent but silly premise, obviously based on stories such as Agatha Christie’s “And Then There Were None.” “The Decameron” shares that antic sensibility, and it tells an equally compelling story. But I found myself watching with a different filter than the one I used to have for stories set during the bubonic plague. One does not feel above these characters as they stuff flowers in their noses, ward off the pestilence with onions, and flounder, amid the apocalypse, for pleasure and meaning. One feels, rather, a kinship.The Decameron premieres July 25 on Netflix."
WaPo_55,"Komodo dragons have iron-coated teeth to rip apart prey, scientists find",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/25/komodo-dragon-teeth-lizard/,2024-07-25 17:00:02.702650,,"Komodo dragons are compared to carnivorous dinosaurs for good reason. They are the largest living lizard on the planet. Their large, serrated teeth can tear apart almost any kind of meat, including water buffaloes weighing more than 1,000 pounds.On Wednesday, scientists announced a discovery that could add to the comparisons: Komodo dragons’ teeth are coated with iron to rip apart their prey. Aaron LeBlanc, a lecturer in dental biosciences at King’s College London and the lead author of the study, said in a news release that the findings give “new insight into how Komodo dragons keep their teeth razor-sharp and may provide clues to how dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex killed and ate their prey.”The study, published in Nature Ecology & Evolution, “demonstrates a striking and previously overlooked predatory adaptation in the Komodo dragon,” according to the authors.The Komodo dragons’ “iron-enriched coatings on their tooth serrations and tips” are evident from their orange pigmentation, according to the authors. This pigmentation has never been reported before in a carnivorous reptile, they added.Although other reptiles have iron on their teeth, the study suggests that “only some species have evolved prominent iron coatings along specific parts of their tooth crowns, presumably as feeding adaptations.”Indigenous to Indonesia, Komodo dragons are thought to be able to live up to 30 years in the wild. They are found on just a handful of islands in the archipelagic nation, including the one that lends the species its name.They are listed as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List, which assesses populations that are at risk of extinction. The organization estimates that there are fewer than 3,500 Komodo dragons alive worldwide.Komodo dragons share a common ancestor with dinosaurs — and, the authors said, the iron coating on the dragons’ teeth could shed light on how top dinosaur predators consumed their prey. Carnivorous dinosaurs’ teeth resemble those of their Komodo dragon cousins: They are serrated, curved and blade-shaped.Although the researchers could not confirm a similar iron coating on dinosaur fossils because of the effects of fossilization, they “want to use this similarity to learn more about how carnivorous dinosaurs might have ate and if they used iron in their teeth the same way as the Komodo dragon,” LeBlanc said in the news release.“With further analysis of the Komodo teeth we may be able to find other markers in the iron coating that aren’t changed during fossilization. With markers like that we would know with certainty whether dinosaurs also had iron-coated teeth and have a greater understanding of these ferocious predators,” he said."
WaPo_56,"As Netanyahu hails Gaza war effort, hobbled Hamas government clings to power",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/23/gaza-hamas-government-israel-netanyahu/,2024-07-25 14:00:02.702650,,"JERUSALEM — After nine months of Israel’s all-out war against Hamas, the group’s government remains a key source of civil authority across the Gaza Strip — a testament to the organization’s reach and resiliency, and the limits of the military campaign aimed at eradicating its influence.Thousands of airstrikes have killed not just fighters and commanders, but civilian police and employees from all echelons of government — from mayors and ministers to medical and municipal workers — as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to finish off the group. In an address to Congress on Wednesday, he said Israel “will fight until it destroys Hamas’s military capacities, and its rule in Gaza.”As law and order collapse, though, Hamas has retained pockets of power, analysts and residents say, and has been quick to reemerge in areas when Israeli forces withdraw. Local officials still exercise a degree of control over the economy, provide limited services to war-battered neighborhoods — and mercilessly punish their critics.“Hamas is part of our national fabric,” said Jabril Rajoub, a prominent figure in Fatah, Hamas’s main political rival.The movement’s durability has widened the rift between Netanyahu and the Israeli military, which says the group cannot be defeated. “Hamas is an idea,” Daniel Hagari, the top spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces, said last month. “Anyone who thinks we can eliminate Hamas is wrong.”The IDF said last week it had killed about “half” of the group’s military leadership, but it did not respond to a request for comment on whether civilian employees of the Hamas-led government were military targets. COGAT, the arm of Israel’s Defense Ministry in charge of administering Gaza, referred questions back to the IDF.“Civil workers, i.e. in water and sanitation, are never targeted,” government spokesman David Mencer said.But as the crisis in Gaza deepens, the governing arm of Hamas maintains its influence: Civil defense workers respond to the scene of airstrikes. Municipal employees work to keep public utilities functioning. Officials impose price controls on commercial goods, or ask for their cut on black-market deals, and the group’s feared Internal Security Service still crushes dissent.Since its founding in 1987, Hamas “built a network of schools, clinics, universities, NGOs, everything,” in the territory, contributing to its staying power, said political scientist Mukhaimer Abu Saada, who fled Gaza for Egypt late last year.And while Palestinians there are increasingly critical of Hamas, that is largely overshadowed by anger against Israel, who most blame for spreading disorder and deprivation, he said.“Israel has gone after the Palestinian civilian population and civilian infrastructure,” Abu Saada said.  “Whoever is fighting back is respected by the Palestinian people.”Composed of a political and a military wing — the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades — Hamas embedded itself in all facets of Gazan life over 17 years in power. The government employed around 40,000 people before the war; an additional 27,000 to 40,000 were estimated to belong to the Qassam Brigades.The militant group’s top operatives inside Gaza went into hiding Oct. 7, when Hamas-led fighters stormed southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostage.Yehiya Sinwar, the group’s military leader in Gaza, is thought to be running operations from the enclave’s extensive tunnel network and tops Israel’s most-wanted list. On Saturday, an Israeli strike targeted his second in command, the shadowy military commander Mohammed Deif. It’s not clear whether he was among the more than 90 people local health authorities said were killed in the attack.Hamas officials who were outside of Gaza when the war began, including the Qatar-based political leader Ismail Haniyeh, have not returned.Hamas established its own de facto government in Gaza in 2007, after violently ousting its chief rival, the Fatah party that dominates the Palestinian Authority in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.Under an Israeli land and sea blockade, the government often struggled to carry out basic functions. Most Gazans could not leave, and relied on the United Nations and other humanitarian groups for food, health care and education. Meanwhile, military leaders spent millions of dollars smuggling in rockets and other weapons.The war has badly hobbled Hamas’s governing infrastructure.Gaza’s Education Ministry suspended all schooling for the Strip’s 625,000 children, who make up about a quarter of the population. The U.N. estimated in April that more than 87 percent of Gaza’s schools, and all its universities, have been damaged or destroyed.Gaza’s Finance Ministry is also a shadow of its former self. Hamas cannot pay regular salaries, but periodically gives small cash handouts to some government employees, said Abu Sada said.Some ministries and agencies are still operating, though it “depends on the place,” said Wael Balousha, the Gaza Strip director of AMAN, the Ramallah-based chapter of Transparency International. He spoke by phone from Egypt, where he fled during the war.Gaza’s civil defense workers continue to provide emergency services, he said, rushing to the scene of strikes despite limited fuel for ambulances and the threat of Israeli attack.He also pointed to the Health Ministry, which has put out near-daily war casualty reports. More than 38,500 people have been killed, according to the ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says most of the dead are women and children.Despite the efforts, Gaza’s state health-care system has collapsed. Israel has repeatedly raided the strip’s main hospitals, alleging they are used by Hamas fighters, a claim denied by doctors and patients.Gaza’s municipalities were already cash-strapped before the war, relying on revenue from utilities and other local services, Abu Saada said. Now, many municipal buildings have been hit or evacuated. More than two-thirds of water and sanitation infrastructure and about two-thirds of all roads have been damaged or destroyed, according to U.N. estimates.City workers throughout the enclave are still trying to pick up trash, repair roads and keep water taps flowing,  local residents say, but many have been repeatedly displaced and their reach remains limited.On Monday, authorities in Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza, announced they had run out of fuel needed to power their 19 wells and water tanks, serving about 700,000 people. “The municipality is trying to resolve this problem as soon as possible,” they wrote on Facebook.In the war’s initial months, Gaza’s civilian police force, which is separate from the Qassam Brigades, were among the most visible remnants of Hamas authority, helping provide security for aid convoys.When Israel’s military began targeting police officers in the winter, they stopped guarding aid trucks, which became targets of widespread, and sometimes deadly, looting.“Hamas police is Hamas,” Col. Elad Goren of COGAT told reporters in March, adding that “we won’t allow Hamas to control the humanitarian assistance.”Plainclothes police are still operating in some places, including as guards at shelters for the displaced. But insecurity, alongside hunger and disease, is spiraling.“Clan fighting, robberies, shootings,” Abu Sada said. “All of that is happening and there is no one to intervene.”Hamas officials have tried in other ways to reassert their authority.When goods were coming through the Rafah crossing with Egypt, Gaza’s Economy Ministry monitored sales, set prices and collected taxes, Mohammad Abu Jiyab, the editor of a business newspaper in Gaza, said by phone.Israel’s seizure of the Rafah crossing in May has undercut Hamas efforts to control local commerce, he said. Plainclothes Hamas authorities have now resorted to extortion, according to merchants interviewed by The Washington Post, seeking a cut from cigarette smuggling and other black-market trade.Fear was always a hallmark of Hamas rule, and the group maintains the ability to silence its opponents.While many Gazans still support Hamas and its fight against Israel, open criticism has become more common as the war drags on and civilian suffering deepens.On July 8, Amin Abed, a prominent political activist and critic of Hamas, was on his way to deliver donations in Gaza City when a group of masked men with hammers and crowbars attacked him. He said they led him to an abandoned building and severely beat him for more than 20 minutes.“’You insult your masters from the resistance,’” Abed, 36, recalled the men saying. They identified themselves as being from the Internal Security Service, he said.“I heard the person in charge telling them, ‘Break the fingers on his hands that he uses to write and incite against us,’” Abed said. “And indeed they broke my fingers with the crowbar.”Beirut-based Hamas spokesman  Basem Naim said in a WhatsApp message that he had “no information” about the allegations.“Hamas takes advantage of people’s need for food,” Abed said, “and whoever objects, it attacks them only to say that we are here to stay and that we still control Gaza.”Israeli officials have said they are committed to replacing the Hamas government, but have offered no viable alternatives. Efforts to elevate local clans have been unsuccessful, and Netanyahu has bristled at a U.S.-backed plan to reinstall the Palestinian Authority in Gaza.“There is no clear scenario for us,” said Taghred Jumaa, a women’s rights activist and mother of three who has been displaced several times during the conflict.“There is fear that the next stage after the war will be a vacuum,” she said, resulting in more violence.Abu Saada said this political void could ultimately benefit Hamas.“The ‘day after,’ there isn’t going to be a smooth transfer, let’s be realistic here,” he said. “Hamas hasn’t lost complete control of the streets of Gaza.”Harb reported from London.

The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday.“This appears to be a new breakthrough for HIV prevention. If these injections can be widely distributed at low cost, it would dramatically reduce the risk of new HIV infections worldwide,” said Sarah Palmer, co-director of the Center for Virus Research at the Westmead Institute for Medical Research in Sydney, who was not involved in the peer-reviewed study. “It is especially encouraging this research focused on young women in Africa who are so highly at-risk for HIV infection.”Worldwide there are about 1.3 million new HIV infections every year, with women and girls accounting for 44 percent of them. In sub-Saharan Africa, that proportion is 62 percent.The shots were produced by drugmaker Gilead Sciences, which funded the trial, and some of the researchers were Gilead employees. Lenacapavir, sold under the brand name Sunlenca, is approved as a treatment for HIV infections in the United States. The goal of the trial was to prove its safety and efficacy for the prevention of infection in adolescent girls and young women. A separate trial for men is underway.When it became clear that the shots were more effective than daily pills — 1.5 percent to 1.8 percent of participants who received one of two daily pills as part of the trial contracted HIV from their partners — the trial was halted and all participants were offered the option of receiving the injections, the researchers said. The researchers also found the incidence of HIV was lower with the use of the shots than the usual rate of HIV in the community.HIV can be prevented through the use of protective measures such as condoms and daily pills that are in wide use in high-income countries around the world. But health experts say it can be difficult to maintain a daily pill routine in places like Africa, where limited access to health care and a dearth of educational programs put girls at particular risk for HIV.Doctors Without Borders and other groups are calling for global action to break Gilead’s monopoly on lenacapavir to allow mass production of the drug and reduce its cost. Gilead charges $42,250 per patient per year for lenacapavir in the United States.“Lenacapavir could be life-changing for people at risk of getting HIV and could reverse the epidemic if it is made affordable in the countries with the highest rate of new infections,” said Helen Bygrave, a chronic disease adviser at Doctors Without Borders.Gilead previously said it was committed to lowering the cost of its drugs in low-income countries."

I have brought up the subject with their mother and she agrees they need to see a dentist, but it has not happened. Their mother and father have excellent teeth and the children have inherited this, but I do worry about them.I have an excellent relationship with my daughter and try not to interfere in her parenting. I have offered to take them to the dentist myself, but she has declined.The younger one comes to my house before school every day so at least she brushes her teeth once a day. Should I just stay silent and let the children suffer the consequences?— Concerned GrandmaGrandma: Make one last direct ask to your daughter and then let it be. Tell her that you have major concerns and ask if there’s something getting in the way that you can help her with.You can make your case if you want — the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommends a checkup every six months. They also note that a child's dentist can tailor the frequency of visits based on a child's specific needs. Your daughter can't know what those needs are without seeing a professional.Take advantage of your excellent relationship by prying and pushing a little more, but if she resists, tell her you're going to drop the subject. Then really do drop the subject. To needlessly butcher an old saying — you can lead a person to dental insurance, but you can't make them floss.Dear Eric: I’m in my early 20s and just ended a five-year relationship with my boyfriend. I find myself really conflicted about whether to move back to the state I grew up in or stay where I am for another year.I work remotely for a company based there, so I'd be able to work in person after moving. All my close friends and family are back there. The only reason I originally moved to where I am now is because of my ex but there's something holding me back from just packing up and leaving.Part of it is that this place is on the coast. I love the water and how green it is. The lifestyle, while more expensive than back home, really agrees with me. I’ve also worked really hard over the past two years I’ve been here to build a life for myself. I’m actively involved in the local community and have some new friends, but I really long for my friends and family too. Do you have any advice on how to decide between two places?— Two HomesHomes: I’ve felt the push-pull of deciding between a place of origin and a new home. In fact, my last book of essays, “Congratulations, the Best Is Over!” followed the journey of moving back home after decades away.Here's what I learned: when you move to a new place and start your life over, you change a lot, you learn a lot about yourself, and you become more at home in your skin. Should you choose to move back home, you'll be bringing all that new knowledge back with you. This could be a perfect time to reset.Go back home and visit with the intention of moving. Really pay attention to what it would feel like to be a new person in this welcoming old space. You may find that you've outgrown your original home and the longing you feel is just nostalgia. But for now, listen to the longing and see what's underneath.Dear Eric: I’m a boomer working in an office environment. When new people are hired, they are often from different backgrounds with names I’ve never heard of. When introduced, I don’t know the name or can’t remember how it’s pronounced.As a first-generation immigrant, my last name is also different. Whenever I meet people for the first time, I slowly pronounce it and often spell it out and pronounce it again to make it understandable.Why do people assume others will understand their unusual names and not make any attempt to clarify them further? Any suggestions on how to politely ask them to do something similar to what I try to do?— Name GamesName: People’s so-called unusual names are often not so unusual to them. And who’s to say what any given person they meet is familiar with. When you don’t understand a person’s last name, ask them to help you. “I want to make sure I get your name right; can you spell it for me?”You’re taking an extra step by clarifying your name for folks; others may not feel compelled to do the same because it can make them feel, well, unusual.(Send questions to R.

We are both in our 50s. She can be hyper-verbal at times. She started volunteering information about many things — her salary, her poor upbringing, her marital details, her husband’s personal habits, her spirituality preferences, etc. — hoping, I believe, that I would do the same.It was a bit overwhelming, and started getting annoying when she began dissecting every statement I made. She would question me multiple times regarding the who, what, when, how and why about events and people that were completely irrelevant to her. I finally snapped when she got too inquisitive about a confidential issue. I told her to please not ask me so many questions as it makes me anxious. I categorically stated that what I do in my house is my business, and vice versa.I think I hurt her feelings, and now she will not talk to me. She openly ignores me in our office. I approached her once, hoping we could talk about it, and she did not even listen to me. I sent a happy text message a few days later, to which she did not respond. Her behavior seems extremely childish to me. I am not sure what I did here, except put a stop to some annoying, unnecessary inquisitions. What do I do now?One would have thought it became annoying when she started sharing personal information at work.Miss Manners does not mean to appear unsympathetic, but when she tells you that it is time to get back to work, she is doing that so that you hear it from her, rather than from your boss at this prestigious organization.Dear Miss Manners: When we arrive at a restaurant and we have reservations, my husband expects me/us to walk straight up to the host station (in front of all of the folks already waiting) and literally interrupt the host, who is speaking with another guest, to declare that we have a reservation.I find this embarrassing and incredibly rude. Others may be waiting for just the same thing: to tell the host that they have reservations. We actually got into an argument years ago after he insisted on doing this and I told him I was uncomfortable with it. We decided to leave after being seated because he got heated with me.He continues to do this, while I find it abhorrent!Interrupting a conversation in progress is, of course, rude.When the restaurant leaves diners to fend for themselves, fellow guests are often the best source of information: “Excuse me. We have reservations. Are you waiting to check in? Do you know if we have to?” Miss Manners finds this to be effective both in determining the best course of action and, occasionally, in embarrassing the restaurant into improving its signage.But then, if you fight so conspicuously that you have to leave, the restaurant may be relieved not to serve you.New Miss Manners columns are posted Monday through Saturday on washingtonpost.com/advice.

WaPo_60,Nationals’ Josiah Gray undergoes Tommy John surgery,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/24/josiah-gray-nationals-tommy-john-surgery/,2024-07-25 12:00:02.702650,,"Washington Nationals right-hander Josiah Gray underwent Tommy John surgery — including an internal brace procedure — on Wednesday and is expected to miss the rest of this season and probably most of the next, Manager Dave Martinez said after the team’s 12-3 loss to the San Diego Padres.Orthopedic surgeon Keith Meister performed the procedure in Arlington, Tex., to repair a partial tear of Gray’s ulnar collateral ligament. Martinez said he spoke with Gray, 26, before Wednesday’s game and the pitcher was in good spirits.Gray said last week it was uncertain whether he would need the internal brace procedure or Tommy John, which has a longer recovery time. Ultimately, he needed both.“He’s got a long road — he knows that,” Martinez said. “But knowing him, he’s going to work really hard to get back.”Gray arrived in Washington at the trade deadline three years ago as one of the headline prospects (along with catcher Keibert Ruiz) in the deal that sent Max Scherzer and Trea Turner to the Los Angeles Dodgers. After early struggles, Gray made massive strides in the first half of 2023 and was selected to the All-Star Game. He then earned the honor of being the Opening Day starter in Cincinnati this season.Gray made just two starts this season, pitching to a 14.04 ERA before landing on the injured list in April.Thus began a lengthy rehabilitation process with what was first believed to be a strained right flexor muscle. It took until June 9 for Gray to make the first of five rehab starts. And though he pitched well across starts No. 2, 3 and 4, a dip in velocity in his June 30 outing with Class AAA Rochester — in what could have been his final rehab start — prompted a closer look. Immediately thereafter, the Nationals shut him down and sought another medical opinion, ultimately waiting until the all-star break to seek an MRI exam.He is expected to remain around the team as he rehabs.“Hopefully he comes out of it and he’ll be a big part of us later on next year,” Martinez said.The previous Nationals starter to have Tommy John was righty Cade Cavalli in March 2023. He has yet to return to the majors."
WaPo_61,Judge blocks Biden administration’s ban on forced reset triggers,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/24/forced-reset-triggers-ban-blocked/,2024-07-25 11:00:02.702650,,"A federal judge on Tuesday struck down a Biden administration ban on forced reset triggers, devices that allow semiautomatic weapons to fire at faster rates, citing the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn a ban on bump stocks last month.Judge Reed O’Connor of the Northern District of Texas ruled in favor of guns-rights groups that had sued the U.S. Justice Department and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in 2023 challenging the ban.O’Connor’s ruling took the same approach that the Supreme Court’s conservative majority did in overturning the Trump administration’s ban on bump-stock devices in June by focusing on ATF’s interpretation of laws restricting the possession of machine guns. It stated that although forced reset triggers enable a user to fire weapons at a faster rate than normal triggers, they do not meet the statutory definition of a machine gun because they do not enable guns to fire multiple rounds with a “single function of the trigger.”Dudley Brown, president of the National Association for Gun Rights, one of the groups that challenged the ban, wrote in a statement that Tuesday’s decision — along with the Supreme Court’s ruling on bump stocks — forces ATF “to return to their Constitutional boundaries.”Attorneys for the Justice Department and ATF did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday evening.Forced reset triggers are devices that forcibly return the trigger of a firearm to its reset or ready-to-fire position after a bullet is fired, which allows a user to more quickly fire successive shots.In a 2022 letter to federal firearms licensees, ATF said that certain forced reset triggers, which were being marketed as replacement triggers for AR-style rifles, allowed shooters to “automatically expel more than one shot with a single, continuous pull of the trigger” and were subject to a ban.The National Association for Gun Rights and Texas Gun Rights, another advocacy group, sued the Justice Department and ATF in August 2023, arguing that the agencies had wrongly characterized forced reset triggers to ban them.In court filings, ATF said that its testing found that a semiautomatic rifle equipped with a forced reset trigger could fire at an average rate of 840 rounds per minute, and that guns with forced reset triggers can be fired with a “single, constant pull of the trigger.”In his ruling, O’Connor sided with the National Association for Gun Rights and Texas Gun Rights in arguing that forced reset triggers still only fire a single round with “a single function of the trigger.” He likened the characterization to the Supreme Court’s decision on bump stocks. The Supreme Court in June similarly ruled against banning those devices on the argument that they did not alter the semiautomatic action of firearms despite facilitating a much faster rate of fire.O’Connor’s ruling referenced the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas that spurred the Trump administration’s ban on bump stocks and a polarizing debate on the legality of devices that increase the rate of fire of semiautomatic weapons.O’Connor acknowledged the “tragic nature” of the shooting but said that “no matter how terrible the circumstances, there is never a situation that justifies a court altering statutory text that was democratically enacted by those who are politically accountable.”"
WaPo_62,Padres rough up Mitchell Parker and hammer the Nats again,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/24/nationals-padres-young-pitchers-innings/,2024-07-25 11:00:02.702650,,"The season’s first half was rosy enough that one could be forgiven for looking past the warning label stamped on the Washington Nationals’ pitching staff. For as promising as the team’s young core has looked at times, the grind of a full season is unforgiving, with its history of swallowing pitchers whole in the nascent years of their careers.In Wednesday night’s 12-3 loss to the San Diego Padres, the grind claimed Nationals left-hander Mitchell Parker. What did the grind look like? It looked like Parker’s sleeve, which he used to wipe sweat from his forehead throughout a 31-pitch first inning. It looked like a quick glance toward the bullpen on his walk back to the dugout to see that his night was, indeed, done after he allowed six earned runs on seven hits and three walks in three innings.For the Nationals (47-55), it also looked like another series loss. The only emotional reprieve came with a bit of levity in the ninth when 33-year-old utility infielder Ildemaro Vargas pitched a scoreless inning, ending the frame by stabbing a 91.4-mph comebacker (much to the delight of Vargas and the dwindling crowd of 23,323 at Nationals Park).If there was desperation by the end, the beginning brought optimism — and runs. Lane Thomas and Jesse Winker, staples in the heart of the order as well as in trade rumors, had back-to-back singles to give the Nationals a first-inning lead. Juan Yepez, who was brought up from Class AAA Rochester on July 5 and has a 1.043 OPS since, then hit a two-run homer to make it 3-0. And thus ended the run-producing part of the Nationals’ night.“We’ve played them tough, outside of today. I feel like we’ve been in every game,” Winker said. “It’s a good team. Sometimes you just have to tip your hat. They did everything tonight.”For the third time in seven games, the Nationals’ starter didn’t make it to the fourth inning. Two of those starts belong to Parker. In the 95 games that preceded this stretch, it had happened once.“It sucks,” Parker said. “It’s not in the game plan. Not how we envisioned it going. Just sucks.”A month ago, the Nationals’ starting rotation had a 3.82 ERA, which placed it in the top half of MLB. Over the past month, their ERA is 5.74, the worst in baseball. Parker was the model of consistency during his first 12 starts, when he conceded three or fewer runs in each outing and posted a 3.06 ERA. In the six starts since, his ERA is 7.48.“When he got ahead, he got guys out,” Manager Dave Martinez said. “When he didn’t get ahead, everybody got on base.”The staff fatigue as a whole has not gone unnoticed by Martinez. MacKenzie Gore, 25, is 36⅓ innings from his career high; Jake Irvin, 27, is 20⅓ away; DJ Herz, 23, has never topped 95⅓ innings and is already at 75⅔ between Rochester and Washington. Parker is 24⅔ innings away from his career high. The only starter to see his ERA improve during this stretch is 35-year-old Patrick Corbin, who has pitched nearly 2,000 innings in the majors.“It’s different, but it’s something you’ve got to get used to,” Parker said of the MLB schedule’s toll. “Hopefully it’s going to happen for a long time, so I just have to adjust and figure things out. Luckily, there’s enough guys here to ask questions that have done it for a lot longer than I have.”Parker’s regression cannot be blamed solely on fatigue. His stuff at the top of the strike zone, which once seemed nearly untouchable, has not held up. Martinez said the Nationals will have Parker throw a bullpen session in the next few days to address mechanical issues.After a scoreless first, Parker found trouble in the second, yielding a two-run single to Luis Arraez. Parker has left more pitches over the middle of the plate during his recent stretch, and Jurickson Profar took advantage after Arraez’s single, blasting a two-run homer that gave the Padres (54-50) a 4-3 lead. Even Parker’s splitter, a pitch that has mostly held up, was smoked by Kyle Higashioka for a double that keyed a two-run third and ended Parker’s night.“With the extra rest, everything felt good,” Parker said. “That’s why it’s even more frustrating. I was hoping to go out there and eat up a couple of innings for us and keep us in a ballgame, and it’s not how it worked out.”Jordan Weems replaced Parker in the fourth but offered little relief, yielding five runs — highlighted by a triple from Jackson Merrill, the standout rookie from Severna Park who finished a home run shy of the cycle — to raise his ERA to 6.59. Jacob Barnes entered for the fifth and allowed another run.“After a point with him, he just gets in his head, tries to overthrow,” Martinez said of Weems. “When situations like that arise, you just got to focus on that very pitch and don’t worry about the outcome.”Notes: The Nationals signed catcher Caleb Lomavita, the No. 39 pick in the draft. Their only picks who have not signed are New Jersey high school shortstop Luke Dickerson (second round), Florida State righty Yoel Tejeda Jr. (14th round) and Florida third baseman Colby Shelton (20th). The deadline to sign picks is 5 p.m. Aug. 1."

He was standing next to his teenage son, who was accused of driving 101 mph before hitting a truck last year — causing his 14-year-old passenger to fly out of the car and die at the scene.Behind Smith sat Keisha Francis, whose daughter, Fortune Williams, was the victim in that incident. While Francis said she accepted Smith’s apology, she was pleased that he and the driver’s mother, Deo Ramnarine, were being punished.Smith, who had bought his son a BMW when the teen had a junior driver’s license, and Ramnarine, whom prosecutors said was notified of her son driving illegally in New York City, were each charged in December with endangering the welfare of a child.A judge in a Queens criminal court sentenced the couple Monday. Smith, 40, was sentenced to three years of probation and a 26-week parenting class after he pleaded guilty to his charge in June. Ramnarine, 43, was sentenced to a 26-week parenting class after pleading guilty to endangering the welfare of a child and disorderly conduct the same month, prosecutors said.The Queens District Attorney’s office called the sentencing a “groundbreaking case” of parents being held responsible for their children’s actions. It came three months after Jennifer and James Crumbley — whose teenage son opened fire in an Oxford, Mich., high school in 2021, killing four students — were sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison on involuntary manslaughter charges.“A car is different than a gun, but both could be deadly,” Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz told The Washington Post.But lawyers for Smith and Ramnarine questioned how much responsibility the parents bore.“My client was charged and ended up taking a plea to a crime that he wasn’t present at and he had absolutely no knowledge that was occurring,” James Polk, Smith’s attorney, told The Post on Wednesday. “I think that’s a very far-reaching idea of criminal liability.”Randall Unger, Ramnarine’s lawyer, told The Post that civil action against his client would have been more appropriate. The criminal case set “the precedent of holding a parent responsible for actions by a child that I don’t think really were foreseeable,” Unger said.Francis told The Post that she would have liked both parents to face a year in jail, the maximum penalty for their charges.For more than two months after the crash, Francis, 37, struggled to eat, sleep, shower and work. She said she covered her Queens house with photos of Fortune, who wanted to be a doctor, so she could pretend to greet her every day.Each week, Francis visits her daughter’s grave in Farmingdale, N.Y., and leaves Fortune’s favorite flowers — red and purple roses. Francis said she continues to pay Fortune’s phone bill so she can hear her brief voicemail: “It’s Fortune.”“I’m going to be hurting still for the rest of my life,” Francis said.The 17-year-old driver, whom officials have not publicly identified because he’s underage, was arraigned in December on multiple charges, including second-degree manslaughter, third-degree assault, second-degree reckless endangerment and three counts of second-degree assault. He could face up to 15 years in prison if he’s convicted. He has not yet entered a plea, and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment.On May 17, 2023, the teen, who was 16 at the time, was driving a red 2005 BMW 325i about 70 mph over the speed limit in Queens with Fortune in the passenger seat, the prosecutor’s office said in a statement. The driver lost control of the BMW while switching lanes, crashing into the back of a parked UPS truck, the New York Police Department said at the time.Fortune was ejected from the vehicle, the prosecutor’s office said. Police said she suffered head trauma and was pronounced dead at the scene.The driver was taken to Cohen Children’s Medical Center in Queens with minor injuries, police said. He told police there that he had picked up Fortune at her home and was taking her to his grandmother’s house, according to the district attorney’s office. Smith told police that the BMW was registered in his name but that he had bought the car for his son, prosecutors said.The teen had a junior driver’s license, which prohibited him from driving in New York City but allowed him to drive without a supervisor in Upstate New York most hours of the day.Francis said she spoke to Fortune on the phone about 30 minutes before she died.“I’m going to call you back,” Francis recalled her daughter saying. “I love you, mom.”“I love you too, babe,” Francis said she responded.Fortune never called back. Francis said she heard that her daughter was in a car crash from police, who picked her up from the nursing home she works at in Woodmere, N.Y., and took her to a precinct station in Queens. Officers showed her two pieces of jewelry the victim was wearing — a white diamond necklace and a gold anklet — and asked if they were her daughter’s, Francis said.They were. Francis screamed, holding her stomach and falling to the floor crying, she said. She said she didn’t know the driver, who Fortune met at school.Investigators found that the driver had been ticketed in November 2022 for driving without a license and driving while using a portable electronic device, prosecutors said. The same month, an administrator at the teen’s high school had informed his parents that he had been driving to school, according to prosecutors.That evidence helped Katz build a case that the parents were aware of their son breaking the law, she said.“You can’t give a vehicle to someone who doesn’t have a license,” Katz said, “and then obviate all responsibility for that vehicle, especially if you’re a parent.”Authorities charged the driver and his parents in December after prosecutors investigated the crash.While Monday’s sentencing was rare, a similar case occurred in Nassau County, N.Y., in 2012, when two parents were charged with unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle after prosecutors said their son killed four people in a car crash while he was driving with a learner’s permit.The driver of the BMW in Queens is scheduled to appear in court again in September. Francis said she’s considering further legal action against his parents.“If they didn’t give their son that car, my daughter would be here right now,” Francis said. “ … She’d probably be watching TV right now or be in her room or be in my bed — because she loves to lie in my bed. She’ll be here living her normal life like every other kid.”"
WaPo_64,Biden’s Oval Office speech amounts to a wistful first farewell,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/24/biden-oval-office-farewell/,2024-07-25 12:00:02.702650,,"It had the feeling of a fond farewell. There wasn’t a heavy dose of bitterness, and there was more than a hint of pride.But the man who has probably given more eulogies than any other U.S. politician had a significant amount of wistfulness tucked inside his Oval Office address. A bit like he is starting to reconcile with the idea that he is soon exiting political life, something that has guided him for more than five decades. The man who entered political life as one of the youngest U.S. senators in history is coming to terms with leaving as the nation’s oldest president in history.“Nowhere else on earth could a kid with a stutter, from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as president of the United States,” Biden said. “But here I am.”But he’s here for only a little bit longer.The whole point of the address was to explain to the nation his decision Sunday to abandon his run for reelection and endorse Vice President Harris as his successor. In a way, he didn’t really accomplish that. There wasn’t a heavy dose of introspection in the speech, with emotions no doubt still raw over leaving a race that in his core he still felt he may have been able to win. He didn’t acknowledge the bitterness felt over those he considered friends stating publicly that it was time for him to go.Instead it was the first of what will be many farewells — and also the first attempt to claim credit for what he hopes will cement his legacy. He has long been frustrated by what he sees as the lack of credit he has received for his accomplishments, feeling that voters should have given him higher marks for steering the country through the pandemic, an economic fallout and entrenched political divisions.“I’ve come so far since my inauguration,” he said.During his remarks, he listed his accomplishments and laid out some of his priorities for the final months he has left. He pointed mostly to foreign-policy efforts, including strengthening NATO to fight Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, trying to secure a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in exchange for the release of the remaining hostages and bringing home Americans who have been detained abroad.He mentioned a series of domestic accomplishments, including a stronger economy, broader manufacturing base and a burst of computer chips manufacturing and science innovation.“We finally beat Big Pharma,” Biden said at one point. That was the bungled line he had during a June 27 debate with former president Donald Trump, when he instead confusingly said, “We finally beat Medicare!”It wasn’t the only problem in his confused, rambling performance during the debate, but it was that line more than any other that led party leaders to raise significant questions about the 81-year-old president, call on him to drop out and cause him to give the Wednesday night address. One reason that the decision was so hard for Biden was that he has genuinely felt that he has had a historically successful presidency, and he didn’t feel like he had completed the tasks he set out to do.He also hinted in the remarks that he himself felt he deserved a second term but acknowledged that the doubt about him within his party was growing too all-consuming for him to overcome.“I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America’s future — all merited a second term,” he said. “But nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition.”“So I’ve decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,” he added.He spoke from the Oval Office, a place that he called a “sacred space.” He referred to the portraits around him, of Thomas Jefferson (“wrote the immortal words that guide this nation”) of George Washington (“showed us presidents are not kings”) and Franklin D. Roosevelt (“inspired us to reject fear.”)“I revere this office,” he said. “I love my country more. It’s been the honor of my life to serve as your president.”There was no hint of second-guessing the decision he announced just three days earlier, and he has fully backed Harris.“I’d like to thank our great vice president, Kamala Harris,” Biden said. “She’s experienced. She’s tough. She’s capable. She’s been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country. And now the choice is up to you, the American people.”First lady Jill Biden sent out a handwritten note just after the remarks. She made clear that she was also backing Harris. But as a fierce defender of her husband, she also made clear that she was most appreciative of those who had avoided second-guessing a loyal party stalwart who thought he could still run.“To those who never wavered, to those who refused to doubt, to those who always believed, my heart is full of gratitude,” she wrote. “Thank you for the trust you put in Joe — now it’s time to put that trust in Kamala. Love, Jill.”Four years ago, Biden had said that he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else.” He pointed to a new generation of leaders that were the future of the country. For most of his time in office, though, he viewed that bridge as an eight-year one. He saw no need to step aside.His remarks on Wednesday night illustrated in the starkest of ways that the end of his bridge is in sight, and a new era has arrived.“There is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life,” Biden said. “There’s also a time and a place for new voices. Fresh voices. Yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now.”He tapped on the Resolute Desk for emphasis.Toward the end of his remarks, he seemed to take the tone of a man who had finished a race, of a college graduate reviewing an academic career, or of a worker getting ready to leave their station for the final time before retirement.“I gave my heart and my soul to our nation, like so many others,” he said. “I’ve been blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people. I hope you have some idea how grateful I am to all of you.”It’s still not goodbye exactly. He vowed to stay active for another six months, in what will be one of the longest lame-duck periods in recent memory.As he spoke, in a portrait just behind him, was a photo of his late son Beau, who died of cancer in 2015. It was Beau who urged his father to stay active in public life. It was Beau who was very much the inspiration to run for office. And it was Beau who still brings a tear to his eyes when he speaks about him. Biden never mentioned him, but his presence was clearly felt as he seemed to feel like he made good on the pledge to his son to remain active.He was, as he always has been, surrounded by family.Sitting nearby was his wife and some of his grandchildren. His son Hunter was along the curved oval wall, along with his daughter Ashley and granddaughter Finnegan.Toward the end of the remarks, Ashley reached for the hand of her mother, Jill Biden.When his remarks concluded, the family and staff in the room burst into applause.“This has been the honor of a lifetime,” Biden told the room.Yasmeen Abutaleb contributed to this report."
WaPo_65,The Great Salt Lake isn’t just drying out. It’s warming the planet.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/07/25/great-salt-lake-emissions/,2024-07-25 22:59:02.733472,,"Like some dystopian astronaut, Melissa Cobo would hike the searing flats of the dried-out Great Salt Lake every couple weeks, hauling a heavy backpack attached by a hose to what looked like the lid of a cake dome. What remained of the lake often seemed out of reach as she struggled through hot mud, clay and a weird crystalline layer that broke with her footsteps onto a greenish muck.“You see the water, but you never actually get to it, no matter how many hours you walk,” Cobo said.Through these grueling treks, the Utah State University graduate student and her adviser, Soren Brothers, discovered more disturbing evidence that dried-out lakes are a significant source of carbon dioxide emissions — one that has not been included in the official accounting of how much carbon the world is releasing into the warming atmosphere.In a new study in the journal One Earth, the researchers calculated that 4.1 million tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases were released from the drying bed of the Great Salt Lake in 2020, the year Cobo and others collected the samples. This would amount to about a 7 percent increase in  Utah’s human-caused emissions, the authors found.While other researchers have documented carbon emissions from dried-out lakes — including the Aral Sea in Central Asia — Brothers said that his study tried to calculate what part of the emissions from this major saline lake could be attributed to humans, as the Great Salt Lake has been drawn down for human use, a decline worsened by climate change and the West’s megadrought of the past two decades.“This is the first time we’re saying, ‘This is something that’s on us,’” Brothers said.Lakes around the world normally store carbon. Plant and animal life settle on the bottom over thousands of years as sediment, much of it in low-oxygen layers that degrade slowly.“When lakes are inundated with water, let’s say their useful state, they are kind of allies in our struggle for removing CO2 from the atmosphere,” said Rafael Marcé, a research scientist at the Centre for Advanced Studies in Spain, who has collaborated with Brothers on prior work but wasn’t involved in this study.When lakes dry out, oxygen can penetrate deep into the sediment, waking up microorganisms that start to feast on the organic matter, releasing carbon dioxide, said Marcé.“The first thing you do when you wake up is have breakfast, right?” he said. “Same for them.”Utah’s Great Salt Lake — the largest saline lake in the Western hemisphere — has been a buffet for microorganisms in recent years. Lake levels fell to record lows two years ago. It rebounded some after the past two wet winters but vast stretches of dry lake bed remain, and levels still lie below what state officials consider a healthy range. There are many dangers posed by its diminished state, including toxic dust, loss of habitat for birds and impact on brine shrimp and other industries.Brothers and his colleagues used a portable greenhouse gas analyzer to measure the amount of carbon dioxide and methane emerging from different areas of the dry lake bed or in the water.“As soon as you put that dome on the sand or exposed lake bed you start seeing that CO2 going up,” he said.Emissions were higher in summer than winter and tended to be lower in places that had been existing as dry land for longer. Marcé, who has been studying the lake bed of the Aral Sea, said some parts of the former lake bed exposed for 60 years are still emitting carbon dioxide. He expects that to continue.“It’s on the century scale, probably,” said Marcé, who has been working with a group of scientists documenting such emissions around the world.Both Brothers and Marcé said they wanted to build enough evidence to convince the United Nations to include these types of emissions as countries calculate their carbon inventories.“They must include the drying lakes in those inventories,” Marcé said. “Because in the case of very big lakes, they could be missing something which is very relevant.”"

He added that the operation “is not directed at any third party, complies with international law and practices, and is unrelated to the current international and regional situation.”Joint China-Russia military exercises are nothing new. However, U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks on Monday said China was seeking “greater influence” in the Arctic region, and that there was “growing cooperation between the PRC [People’s Republic of China] and Russia in the Arctic,” something she described as “troubling.”Hicks, who was unveiling a new Arctic strategy, described this as “a critical time in the region,” particularly as “climate change and the resulting shifts in the operating environment” had implications for U.S. defense missions.The strategy noted that China’s presence in the Arctic, “while limited, is increasing,” and said “while significant areas of disagreement between the PRC and Russia remain, their growing alignment in the region is of concern.” It added that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “has made it increasingly reliant on the PRC for financing energy export infrastructure in the Arctic,” where more than 80 percent of its natural gas production is located.Defense officials have stressed that, even as Russia-China military cooperation has increased in recent years, the operations still remain limited.“While we see this increasing collaboration, I think it’s also important to note that it’s somewhat superficial in nature still, especially from a military perspective,” Iris Ferguson, the Defense Department’s deputy assistant secretary for Arctic policy, said Monday.“We know what it takes to operate with our Arctic allies and partners,” she continued. “And so, you know, flying in circles with one another briefly or deploying alongside one another is maybe good for optics, but we know that that’s not the same kind of level of in-depth cooperation that we have with our partners.”Earlier this month, the U.S. Coast Guard said a patrol discovered several Chinese military ships in the Bering Sea, in international waters but within the U.S. exclusive economic zone. The Chinese vessels said they were conducting “freedom of navigation operations,” the coast guard statement added.Maham Javaid and Vic Chiang contributed to this report."
WaPo_69,"As the Summer Olympics dawn, Paris is divided by more than the Seine",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/25/paris-olympics-france-politics/,2024-07-25 22:11:02.733472,,"PARIS — This city can be breathtaking, from the dead of winter to the swelter of summer and everything in between. In unseasonably pleasant weather, it promises to shine Friday night. The Seine at sundown is spine-tingling with a glass of wine, a water-facing chair and a friend, let alone with 300,000 fans lining the banks and rafts of waving Olympic athletes wafting over the water.The Olympics can be about a host city and country seizing a moment, and that’s both athletically and culturally. Rise up and show off, France. When the cauldron is lit during Friday’s Opening Ceremonies in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, there should be a distraction — a memorable, photo-worthy distraction — from whatever daily worries Parisians carry around in their bicycle baskets.Yet the Paris Summer Games arrive at a particular — and peculiar — point in French history. The government of President Emmanuel Macron is in shambles after elections earlier this month left a once-popular leader without a majority of supporters in the General Assembly. The Games will be overseen by a country with only a caretaker government. There is no prime minister. The French confidence — not infrequently viewed as arrogance — is shaken.“Things are kind of stuck, which honestly, it’s very un-French,” said Matthias Matthijs, a professor of international political economy at Johns Hopkins’s School for Advanced International Studies. “… It’s very hard to see a way out of this. France looked like this very stable, progressive place — especially under Macron. They’ve lost that.”The instability won’t come across as NBC broadcasts these unprecedented Opening Ceremonies on Friday night, opulence against a backdrop that can’t be created anywhere else. It feels fitting. Matthjis said he jokes with his students that there are two countries remaining, globally, who see themselves as an example for the rest of the world: the United States and France. Stop snickering. It has been that way for generations.“They both think they’re exceptional,” Matthjis said. “They’re exceptional in their government institutions and their ideas. The French generally think they have it figured out when it comes to work-life balance, when it comes to making time for family, holidays, meals, sustainability, agriculture.”Or, as British academic Sudhir Hazareensingh wrote nearly a decade ago: “All great nations think of themselves as exceptional. France’s distinctiveness in this regard lies in its enduring belief in its own moral and intellectual prowess.”So get ready, at least viscerally, to become Francophiles. There is much that the Opening Ceremonies, and the Games themselves, can highlight about the host country that will resonate globally — France’s history, its culture, its ideas, its food and fashion, not to mention its strong beliefs in equality, liberty and diversity. But even as Macron vowed this week that the status of his government — not just without a prime minister, but without a schedule for the assembly to elect one — wouldn’t detract from the Games, it hovers over everything domestically.On Wednesday morning here, the International Olympic Committee bestowed upon France the 2030 Winter Games — albeit while adding language to the agreement that puts a burden on France to prove the Alpine villages will be capable of hosting the competitions.Macron, speaking at the IOC meeting, spoke confidently. It is his only way.“I confirm the full commitment of the French nation, and assure you that I will ask the next prime minister to include not only this guarantee but also an Olympic law in the priorities of the new government,” Macron said, failing to note that there is no way to know how that new government will be formed and which party — or coalition of parties, left or right — will hold power. “… Seven years ago, we made the same commitment, and we delivered. And we will do the same.”Such statements feed right into the frustration some French citizens have with Macron: that he views himself as a quasi-king rather than the leader of a democracy. His detractors — and they are legion — pounced.“The president lives in a parallel world,” wrote Olivier Faure, first secretary of the socialist party and president of the New Left group in the National Assembly, on social media, translated from French. “Reality escapes him: he still has not realized, after two elections, that he is now an arch-minority, disqualified by the French, and that he no longer has the possibility of acting as if he were Jupiter.”Let’s start the Games, please. Despite the political crisis, Parisians seem ready to move forward to the Olympics — and even beyond. The only traffic Monday afternoon along Cours de la Reine were a half-dozen police motorcycles, roaring out of a tunnel past the fences that guard the Seine. A pair of restaurants, Al Mankal and 6 New York, sit across little Rue Debrousse from each other. The menus look inviting. But instead of competing for diners, their doors are not just locked, but fenced off from the street. That’s true for so many businesses on both banks of the river, shuttered at least through the cauldron-lighting.“Sorry that Paris is not up to par for this first week for its welcome and its joie de vivre,” Jerome Gangneux, who owns 6 New York with his wife Cathy, wrote in an email. “… We are closing for five weeks, and see you on September 3 with a smile.”It’s fair to say that every Olympic host city wants to present the best version of itself during the Games. But the reality is that no Olympic host city is the best version of itself during the Games. Gangneux said the businesses closest to the Opening Ceremonies route — four miles along the Seine, with stands built to hold the fans — were informed only a month ago that their neighborhood would be on quasi-lockdown, with even residents needing QR codes to gain entry at checkpoints.“Hence the closing of our restaurant without even knowing if the Games will be a success,” he wrote, “knowing that hotels during this period are not full.”And yet there is undeniable excitement. The flame-lighting was still two days off when a sold-out crowd packed the 69,000-seat Stade de France for Wednesday’s opening session of rugby sevens competition. French flags flew, taking up entire sections of the lower bowl. After two straight spectator-free, pandemic-addled Olympics, energy is back.“Our excitement, it cannot be described,” said Thomas Vernoux, a French water polo player.Here we go. The French are a proud people collectively, but with a strong sense of individualism. Their country is in some ways on a precipice. The Olympics arrive with a mixture of joy and trepidation. They are supposed to unify. But whether a certain citizen feels more of the former or the latter is, in true French fashion, up to each and every one."
WaPo_70,Arlington and D.C. ranked as America’s fittest cities,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/25/arlington-dc-fittest-cities/,2024-07-25 22:00:02.733472,,"Arlington and D.C. rank as the top two fittest cities in America, according to a study released Tuesday by the American College of Sports Medicine in Indianapolis. Arlington ranked as No. 1 for the seventh year in a row, while D.C. secured the No. 2 spot for the second consecutive year, beating out Seattle, San Francisco and Madison, Wis.The annual study looks at the United States’ 100 most populous cities and evaluates their fitness using two main scores: a personal health score, which considers exercise frequency, smoking and heart disease; and a community environment score, which measures the accessibility of walkable trails, bike paths and parks. It draws from existing public data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tracks health risk behaviors such as whether people eat fruits and vegetables, exercise, and smoke.Arlington, which is technically a county, received the highest ranking for the community and environment score and the highest percent of people exercising in the previous month. D.C. earned the top spot in the health behaviors category for the number of residents consuming two or more fruits and vegetables a day, though it did trail in other categories, such as health outcomes for the percentage of people with poor mental health.Arlington’s accessible infrastructure is a major reason for its seven-year streak, said  Stella Volpe, president of ACSM and chair of the fitness index committee. “Arlington has great walking paths, great biking paths, great access to parks, so it is easy for people to be active,” Volpe said.These findings came as no surprise to some Arlington residents, who told The Post Tuesday afternoon that the city’s fitness-friendly landscape encourages an active lifestyle. Raymond Murry, a 28-year-old from Arlington, said he lives two miles away from a gym, and though he owns a car, often opts to walk.“A lot of people feel comfortable jogging, walking and stuff like that,” he saidCameron Bane, a 24-year-old environmental engineer, said he thinks Arlington’s high fitness ranking is due in part to intentional city planning to promote healthier lifestyles. “It’s a newer city as far as development terms go,” he said. “I think the urban planners had a lot of foresight as far as walkability is concerned.”Tripp Fussell, a 35-year-old who lives in North Arlington, said he’s surprised D.C. is not ranked higher. Fussell said he used to live in D.C. and noted it “seemed like a very fit city in the sense that people were walking more than driving,” because of the prevalence of public transportation.Pierre Marques, an engineering intern from France, says that he’s found everything he’s looking for when it comes to staying fit in D.C.Marques said that in France he would typically pay for a gym membership, but rather than spend money on gyms in D.C., he takes advantage of Rock Creek Park’s exercise course. On the trail, he typically rides his bike and uses the publicly available exercise equipment. He also enjoys the many basketball courts, running trails and parks for street workouts.“There are several outdoor places in the city for you to go when you can’t go to the gym, and it’s not like that everywhere,” he said.Similarly, Callum Wayman, a 30-year-old who lives in Mount Pleasant, often visits Rock Creek Park to use the exercise trail. When he lived in Northeast, Wayman said, he often went to his neighborhood’s free fitness centers.Volpe, of the American College of Sports Medicine, hopes cities take a look at the study’s outcomes. “The fact that we chose to do something like this that can really help cities take a look at maybe what they’re doing great, maybe what they could improve upon, and maybe if they have resources to put toward things like some parks or trails,” she said.As the rankings come out each year, each city has the opportunity to rise, and that’s the goal, she said."

WaPo_72,Divers discover 19th-century shipwreck laden with 100 champagne bottles,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/25/shipwreck-champagne-sweden-poland/,2024-07-26 00:45:02.777714,,"A team of divers dedicated to combing the Baltic Sea for shipwrecks said they finally have reason to celebrate after discovering a 19th-century vessel laden with about 100 sealed bottles of champagne.“I think we have a treasure,” Tomasz Stachura, leader of Polish diving group, Baltitech, posted to Facebook after the team’s discovery on July 11.The wreck was located about 20 nautical mile south of the Swedish island of Öland.Stachura, who specializes in underwater photography, said the ship was in “very good condition” and “loaded with champagne, porcelain wine and mineral water.”After analyzing some of the items on board, the divers estimate that the ship capsized in the second half of the 19th century.The divers did not initially expect the wreck to be “anything significant,” Stachura said in an email to The Washington Post Thursday, adding that the team “even hesitated for a moment whether to dive at all.”But two of the team’s crew, Marek Cacaj and Pawel Truszynski, were determined to check out the wreck, Stachura said, adding that the pair were gone for almost two hours.Stachura said he knew, in that moment, that the team had likely located something special.While the Baltitech team have found “numerous wrecks” in the Baltic sea, it is unusual to find a shipwreck “loaded to the brim” with champagne, Stachura said.“I have been diving for 40 years, and it often happens that there is one bottle or two... but to discover a wreck with so much cargo, it’s a first for me,” he said.The team also discovered clay water bottles on the wreck, with the German brand name “Selters” stamped onto them.During this time period, the German brand was “highly valued” and “often reserved for royal tables,” Stachura said. The water was “considered almost medicinal.”Selters, which appears to still be producing water, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Developments regarding the team’s discovery will be shared at the Baltictech 2024 Conference, which be held in November in Poland.While the divers notified Swedish regional authorities about their finding, they might not be able to crack open the ancient champagne just yet.Further exploration and the possibility of hauling the cargo to the surface “will take time due to administrative restrictions,” Stachura said, though he didn’t seem to fazed about waiting to review the treasure above water.“It had been lying there for 170 years, so let it lie there for one more year, and we will have time to better prepare for the operation,” he said."
WaPo_73,"Senators subpoena Steward Health CEO, open investigation into company",https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/07/25/steward-health-care-senate-investigation/,2024-07-26 00:45:02.777714,,"A Senate committee Thursday opened a bipartisan investigation into Steward Health Care, the nation’s largest physician-led hospital system, and voted to subpoena the company’s CEO, alleging that Steward executives had mismanaged the system’s finances and put patient care at risk.Steward, a for-profit company that owns 31 hospitals across the country, is in bankruptcy proceedings and has been seeking to sell its hospitals. Community leaders and health workers in states served by Steward’s facilities, such as Massachusetts, have blamed Steward leaders for extravagant paydays even as hospitals struggled to meet mortgage payments and cover other expenses.Senators on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee echoed those concerns Thursday and said Steward warranted a national spotlight on Capitol Hill, accusing the hospital system’s leaders of “outrageous corporate greed” that harmed access to medical services, such as spending nearly $100 million on a pair of private jets.“At a Steward-owned Massachusetts hospital, a woman died after giving birth when doctors realized mid-surgery that the supplies needed to treat her had been repossessed due to Steward’s financial troubles,” said Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), a physician who is the panel’s top Republican. “Patients’ lives are at risk. Americans deserve answers.”The committee previously sought testimony from Ralph de la Torre, the company’s CEO and founder, but had been rebuffed, prompting Thursday’s vote to subpoena him. It is the first time in the panel’s 154-year history that senators have subpoenaed a witness to testify, aides said. The committee scheduled de la Torre’s testimony for a hearing on Sept. 12.Steward did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the Senate vote and whether de la Torre would testify. A prominent cardiac surgeon in Boston, de la Torre had been hailed as a visionary after founding the hospital system in 2008 and promising to use his new organization to better coordinate care for patients.Senators on Thursday alleged that de la Torre’s decisions resulted in new threats to patient care, rather than improving it. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who chairs the committee, said the system’s leaders spent tens of millions of dollars on luxury purchases — such as de la Torre’s acquisition of a $40 million yacht and a $15 million fishing boat, the Boston Globe reported — even as their hospitals struggled to stay afloat.“It is time for Dr. de la Torre to get off of his yacht, and to explain to Congress the financial chicanery which made him extremely wealthy, while the hospitals he managed went bankrupt,” Sanders said.At Senate HELP committee right now: bipartisan vote on subpoening Steward Health Care CEO Ralph de la Torre.Senators allege de la Torre put profits — and his purchases — over patients as system went bankrupt.@SenSanders: ""The greed we are seeing here is quite extraordinary."" pic.twitter.com/mYzUQGvvVWDemocrats have argued that private equity ownership helped fuel Steward’s troubles, after a private equity firm in 2010 bought the then-struggling hospital system, took on new liabilities such as selling the company’s real estate holdings, and then sold Steward back to physicians in 2020, leaving the system burdened with new debts.Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Edward J. Markey, the panel’s two Massachusetts Democrats, introduced legislation this year to target owners who “loot health care entities” for profits. Markey and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) on Thursday also introduced legislation that would impose new transparency requirements on private equity firms and for-profit companies that own health-care entities.“This is a story of private equity, with no constraints, taking over a massive hospital system and then looting it for their own personal wealth,” Markey said at Thursday’s hearing.Cassidy said private equity was not to blame for Steward’s problems. “Robust private equity investment kept the hospitals afloat in 2010,” Cassidy said.The Senate committee voted 20-1 to open the investigation into Steward, with the lone dissenting vote coming from Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). The panel voted 16-4 to subpoena de la Torre, with Paul and fellow Republican Sens. Tommy Tuberville (Ala.), Markwayne Mullin (Okla.) and Ted Budd (N.C.) voting against the measure, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) not voting."
WaPo_74,"Netanyahu to meet with Biden and hostage families, then with Harris",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/25/netanyahu-biden-harris-hostages/,2024-07-26 00:31:02.777714,,"President Biden and Vice President Harris will hold separate bilateral meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday, as U.S. leaders say they are in the final stages of closing a deal that will pause the fighting in Gaza and release hostages.The meetings, part of Netanyahu’s hours-long visit to the White House, come a day after the Israeli leader delivered a defiant speech to a joint meeting of Congress. Netanyahu rejected criticisms from international organizations about Israel’s conduct, asserted without evidence that Iran was funding pro-Palestinian protesters and vowed Israel would settle for nothing less than “total victory.”Biden, who announced this weekend he would drop out of the presidential race, has signaled ending the war in Gaza remains a top priority in his final months in office. He has repeatedly said a cease-fire deal was imminent, even though the U.S. and other negotiating partners have been frustrated for months by the lack of an agreement. The first phase would include a six-week pause in fighting and the release of some hostages. The second phase of the deal would continue a cessation of hostilities while Hamas and Israel negotiate a permanent cease-fire, determining the withdrawing of Israeli forces from Gaza.Biden’s meeting on Thursday will be his first face-to-face encounter with Netanyahu since the president traveled to Israel in the days after the Oct. 7 attacks.“I’m going to keep working to end the war in Gaza, bring home all the hostages, and bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war,” Biden said Wednesday during his Oval Office address.Biden tightly embraced Israel in the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attacks, but as Netanyahu has continued an all-out assault on Gaza, he has become more critical, calling on Israeli leaders to allow more aid into the territory, where nearly 2 million civilians are suffering from widespread starvation and a collapsed health-care system.A senior U.S. administration official said Biden and Netanyahu will discuss a range of issues, including ongoing threats to Israel, developments in Gaza, the humanitarian situation and the ongoing negotiations over releasing hostages and implementing a cease-fire. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the president’s meeting, reiterated that the framework of a deal is largely agreed upon, and the leaders are now focused on the implementation phase.The official, who did not watch Netanyahu’s speech to Congress and declined to comment on it, expressed optimism that a deal remains within reach, though refused to put a timeline on when it would be completed.After Biden and Netanyahu hold a bilateral meeting in the Oval Office, the two leaders will meet with families of Americans held hostage by Hamas. By including the families, the White House is hoping to elevate their message that Netanyahu needs to stop making new demands and agree to the hostage cease-fire deal on the table, officials familiar with the matter said.Netanyahu’s government is negotiating for the release of more than 100 Israeli hostages, though of that number, many are believed to be dead.“Not bringing home the hostages will amount to a total failure,” Jon Polin, the father of American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin, told The Washington Post in an interview.Polin reiterated that message to Netanyahu during a meeting with the Israeli prime minister earlier this week at the Watergate Hotel in Washington. Netanyahu’s message to the families then was that his government is moving nearer to a cease-fire and hostage-release deal, a message they said was unsatisfactory.“He did say we’re getting closer. I have no idea if he thought that that would appease us but for most of us, it did not,” Polin said.Since the start of the Gaza War, Netanyahu has come under criticism for putting his military objectives related to the total destruction of Hamas ahead of the urgency of securing the release of hostages.Earlier this summer, the United States placed blame on Hamas for adding new demands to the deal, but that outlook shifted earlier this month when Netanyahu directed Mossad Chief David Barnea to place new demands that moved the goal posts, said diplomats who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations.Under the new conditions, Israel would not agree to withdraw its forces from the Philadelphi Corridor along the Egyptian border, the diplomats said. Israel would also not allow unrestricted access for Gazans seeking to return to their homes in the north — insisting that its forces be permitted to establish checkpoints to monitor the movement of the displaced.A senior administration official said on Wednesday that the United States was looking for both Israel and Hamas to move on certain things to conclude a deal, but he did not spell out the details.The State Department has used much less confrontational language toward Israel when describing its negotiating position in the talks.When asked about Israel’s negotiating position, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said, “We have been engaged with them over the course of the past few weeks trying to bridge the final differences. And what they tell us and what they continue to show is that they are working to try to get a deal.”This is a developing story. It will be updated."

U.S. Figure Skating officials have planned for months to have a medal ceremony in Paris, but those arrangements have been held up by Valieva’s appeals.“We are especially excited that the beautiful city of Paris will join us in this celebration,” Hirshland said in her statement.The Valieva saga has been a particularly frustrating ordeal for the IOC and doping officials. They were stymied by Russian anti-doping officials, who dragged out the investigation of her positive test for the heart medication trimetazidine, eventually concluding she had accidentally ingested the substance. CAS sided with the World Anti-Doping Agency and suspended Valieva for four years dating from December 2021.The International Skating Union then recalculated the results of the Beijing team event, which had been won by Russia, and moved the United States from second place to first and Japan from third to second. Russia was dropped to third, triggering an appeal to CAS by fourth-place Canada.CAS has not ruled on Canada’s appeal, but the IOC’s statement said the U.S. and Japan will receive their medals in Paris."
WaPo_76,"What to know: A map of Oregon’s Durkee Fire, the largest in the U.S.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/25/durkee-fire-oregon-map-spread-updates/,2024-07-26 00:58:02.777714,,"Hot weather, gusty winds and extreme lightning activity have spread critical fire conditions across parts of Oregon, fueling the Durkee Fire in the eastern part of the state, the nation’s largest active fire.Lightning sparked the fire about five miles southwest of Durkee, Ore., in the morning hours of July 17. Since then, winds of up to 60 mph have blown the fire across more than 268,000 acres, or about 419 square miles, near the Oregon-Idaho border.The about 500 residents of the city of Huntington, Ore., had been urged to leave as the fire moved in Sunday, and utilities shut off power, gas and cellphone service. But by Wednesday night, the evacuation alert had been reduced to a level one out of three, indicating residents should remain ready to flee, if necessary. Sheriff Travis Ash of Baker County, which is home to about 17,000 people and includes Huntington, said rain falling on the Durkee Fire on Wednesday evening was a “godsend.”But rain was not reaching enough of the state.  More than 100 active fires across Oregon, the Cow Valley, Lone Rock and Falls fires had also each burned more than 100,000 acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.After more than a week of firefighting efforts with a crew of more than 500 people, the fire remained zero percent contained as of Thursday morning, and evacuation orders were in effect along the Interstate 84 corridor of northeastern Oregon. Evacuation orders were also in effect in northern parts of Malheur County, which is home to about 31,000 people.No deaths had been reported, but dozens of structures, including some homes, were destroyed.“We are facing strong erratic winds over the region that could impact all fires,” Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek (D) said in a statement. “Rain is not getting through. Some communities do not have power.”The Durkee merged with the Cow Valley Fire as fires multiplied across the region. Some 2,800 lightning strikes observed Wednesday caused more than 60 new fire starts, satellite imagery showed, according to the National Weather Service.It was one of Oregon’s most extreme days of lightning ever observed, with the most strikes recorded in a single day since 2000 and the ninth-most recorded during July, the Weather Service said.Conditions are not expected to ease until Sunday or Monday, according to firefighting reports that warned new ignitions from more storms will be “difficult to contain.” Officials said fire suppression efforts “are expected to moderate perimeter growth” along the fire’s southeastern and southwestern flanks by Sunday.Red flag warnings, indicating high fire risks from strong winds, high heat and low moisture, were in effect across parts of southern Oregon and southern Idaho.Temperatures are forecast to reach the triple digits across the region’s valleys, the Weather Service said, amid what has been a historically unrelenting heat wave. Boise was poised to set a record for consecutive days at or above 100 degrees Thursday, at nine days and counting.“We are working with every tool we have to protect people and property,” Oregon State Fire Marshal Mariana Ruiz-Temple said in a statement. “The Oregon structural fire service, our out-of-state firefighters, and our wildland partners are working relentlessly around the clock.”Air quality alerts were in effect across the eastern half of Oregon as wildfire smoke brought high levels of particulate matter. Smoke was likely to get trapped in valleys Friday and Saturday, meteorologists warned."
WaPo_77,The Ravens hope Derrick Henry can help Lamar Jackson reach a Super Bowl,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/25/derrick-henry-lamar-jackson-ravens/,2024-07-26 00:01:02.777714,,"OWINGS MILLS, Md. — The disappointment and frustration from their loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in last season’s AFC championship game have been filed away, available to be accessed as a motivational tool or as a cautionary tale come January. A new season is nearing, and the slate, for now, is clean. For the Baltimore Ravens, it is time to start over and try again.They must try again to be the dominant team they were last season, only better at the biggest moment. They must try again to give quarterback Lamar Jackson the resources to be the NFL’s most breathtaking player. And they must try again to make all of that translate, finally, to the first Super Bowl appearance of Jackson’s career.“We had a great season last year,” wide receiver Zay Flowers said Sunday after the Ravens completed their opening practice of training camp. “We want to improve on that and get to the ultimate goal.”It’s not exactly Super Bowl or bust. No one around here suggests that Coach John Harbaugh’s job security depends on taking that recently elusive next step or that Jackson, a two-time league MVP at age 27, is anywhere close to his last, best title chance. But the Jackson-led Ravens have reached the point at which the success of their season probably will hinge on whether they’re among the final two teams playing in February.“Super Bowl,” wideout Rashod Bateman said Sunday. “Super Bowl. It’s not about me. I need to do what’s best for this team, whatever that is, whatever my role is.”Harbaugh said the central theme of his opening training-camp address to his players had to do with “vision and … standards and the ability to meet the standard and raise the standard.”Harbaugh also spent the final 2 minutes 43 seconds of his opening news conference defending his quarterback against any and all criticism for the team’s inability to turn such a promising 2023 season into a championship. He said the Ravens “take it personally” when Jackson is criticized, adding that “the vision for Lamar Jackson” involves all-time greatness.""I believe it like I've already seen it."" Harbs with powerful words about @Lj_era8 pic.twitter.com/jmizhXndtp“It’s a vision,” Harbaugh said. “It’s something you see it like it’s already happened. You can see it like it’s already been done. The victory has already been won when you pour into a vision. And the vision that we have together is that Lamar Jackson is going to become and be known and be recognized as the greatest quarterback ever to play in the history of the National Football League. … And I believe it like we’ve already seen it.”Six seasons into his NFL career, Jackson already has become the league’s 11th multiple-time MVP. He joined Patrick Mahomes, Kurt Warner, Steve Young and Joe Montana as two-time winners. Tom Brady, Brett Favre, Jim Brown and Johnny Unitas won three MVP awards each. Aaron Rodgers has won four and Peyton Manning five.But to secure a spot as prominent in the sport’s history as Harbaugh envisions, Jackson will have to reach some Super Bowls. And that means starting with one.The Ravens were well positioned in 2023. They were the NFL’s best team for much of the season, beating very good teams in lopsided fashion and securing the AFC’s top seed. But for the second time in five years, they failed to turn the No. 1 seed — and an MVP season by Jackson — into a Super Bowl appearance. They lost the AFC championship game at home to the Chiefs, 17-10. It was a mistake-filled performance in which Flowers, after an often-impressive rookie season, committed two key gaffes: a costly taunting penalty and a lost fumble near the goal line.He and the Ravens get an immediate opportunity for a tiny measure of redemption when they face the Chiefs in the NFL’s season-opening game Sept. 5 in Kansas City. But Flowers said he isn’t fixated on last season’s painful ending.“It’s over now,” Flowers said. “I get to see them the first game. We’ll go play there. What’s in the past is already in the past. It already happened.”The Ravens had more than their share of offseason turnover. Defensive coordinator Mike Macdonald was hired as the coach of the Seattle Seahawks and was replaced by inside linebackers coach Zach Orr. The prominent players to depart included wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., running backs J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards, guards Kevin Zeitler and John Simpson, offensive tackle Morgan Moses, linebacker Patrick Queen, safety Geno Stone and pass rusher Jadeveon Clowney.“That is part of how it works in the National Football League,” Harbaugh said. “And we embrace it. … I like our guys, and I’m very optimistic that they’ll do very well.”QB1 is back ‼️ pic.twitter.com/ovAR1XuuYTThe most meaningful addition came with the free agent signing of Derrick Henry, the former 2,000-yard rusher for the Tennessee Titans. The Ravens hope he has enough left, at age 30 and more than 2,000 carries into his NFL career, to punish any defense that focuses too heavily on containing Jackson.“You seen him before?” Flowers said. “You see him in person? You’ve got to stop that first before you worry about somebody of my stature.”Jackson missed the first three days of training camp because of an illness. He was on the field Wednesday but failed to finish the practice before exiting. He and the Ravens probably will not enter the season as the team to beat, with the Chiefs attempting to become the first team to win three straight Super Bowls. But they certainly should be a factor, and the pairing of Henry and Jackson will make their offense even more captivating.“I’m excited to see what it looks like,” Bateman said. “I don’t really know either. … At the end of the day, you’ve got Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry. So, I mean, I’m kind of like everybody else: I’m just excited to watch it.”"
WaPo_78,China doping allegations threaten to cast pall over Olympic swim meet,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/25/olympic-swimming-china-doping-allegations/,2024-07-26 00:00:02.777714,,"PARIS — If swimming’s global leaders expected the stain of this year’s Chinese doping controversy to fade away once the world’s best swimmers converged for the Paris Olympics, those hopes have been exposed as premature and wishful, if not naive.Asked during a news conference Thursday whether he feels the nine-day meet will be a clean one, American sprint superstar Caeleb Dressel replied flatly, “No, not really. I don’t think [the authorities] have given us enough evidence to support” that belief.Australian breaststroker Zac Stubblety-Cook went even further, saying the drug-testing system has “failed” and suggesting he might make a public protest on the medal stand at La Defense Arena outside of Paris should he lose to China’s Qin Haiyang, who already took down Stubblety-Cook’s world record at last year’s world championships.Qin, 25, is one of 23 Chinese swimmers who tested positive for the banned heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ) in January 2021, but who were nonetheless allowed to compete, with their positive tests kept from the public, after the World Anti-Doping Authority (WADA) accepted China’s explanation of environmental contamination. Eleven of the 23, including Qin, competed at the Tokyo Olympics.“I’m a clean athlete, and I’m trying to abide by the rules,” said Stubblety-Cook, 25, the gold medalist in the 200-meter breaststroke at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, “and I just hope my competitors do the same.”The existence of the positive tests was reported in April by the New York Times and German public broadcaster ARD. WADA’s actions, or inactions, in the case have come from intense international scrutiny, particularly from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). WADA, meantime, has said an independent review vindicated its processes — though that has done little to restore the faith of athletes, with many of those implicated swimmers set to compete in Paris.“That news when it came out was incredibly disappointing and incredibly frustrating,” Bronte Campbell, a veteran Australian sprinter, said Thursday. “[But there’s] nothing we can do about it two days before an Olympic games.”The scandal shows no signs of abating, as Friday’s Opening Ceremonies and Saturday’s start to the Olympic swim competition approach. On Wednesday, the International Olympic Committee’s awarding of the 2034 Winter Games to Salt Lake City was made contingent upon the requirement that American officials block an FBI investigation into the affair — a move widely viewed as a heavy-handed attempt to silence critics.But while the backlash against WADA and the IOC over the Chinese doping saga has been viewed in some parts of the world as a shrill and moralistic American crusade, Australia’s Stubblety-Cook delivered what was arguably the most powerful statement by an athlete yet over the handling of the case.“It’s obviously disappointing to hear that news and hear about the … athletes testing positive — some multiple times,” he said. “And for me, racing someone that was one of those athletes and finding out he was one of those athletes was disappointing. It’s less about what country they came from and more about the system and how … ultimately it feels like it’s failed. And that’s the truth.”Stubblety-Cook cited by name the stipulation in the Olympic charter prohibiting protests by athletes on the medal stand: Rule 50, which states, “No kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas.”Despite that, he said, he said he likely will defer a decision on whether to make a protest against Qin on the medal stand until the day of their race, the final for which is slated for July 31.“I think, potentially, we could see protests in other events, as well,” he added.Officials from World Aquatics — swimming’s international governing body, which largely has backed WADA’s handling of the Chinese doping case — revealed last week that its athletes (in disciplines that include not only swimming, but also diving, water polo and artistic swimming) have undergone a total of 4,774 pre-Olympics drug tests this year, with no confirmed positives. China’s Olympic swimmers, according to World Aquatics, have been tested the most, undergoing an average of 13 tests apiece.Still, Brent Nowicki, World Aquatics’ executive director, acknowledged the organization has been stung by the criticism from its athletes, particularly that of Dressel, a seven-time Olympic gold medalist who will be seeking to defend his 50-meter freestyle and 100-meter butterfly titles in Paris.“When you hear someone like Caeleb say that, obviously it’s not what you want any athlete to say,” Nowicki said. “But that said, we have to … regain his trust, and [that of others] who share that same opinion. I would invite you to ask that same question to Caeleb in L.A. [at the 2028 Olympics], and my goal or my hope is that his mind changes.”"

On TikTok, people are snapping up “Cat ladies for Harris 2024” stickers.There’s a movement pic.twitter.com/TBSUHmsBqnThe vociferous response to the resurfaced Vance comments — which have been shared widely and amassed nearly 28 million views on an X post shared Monday — only underscores how female reproductive rights including access to abortion, birth control and in vitro fertilization will be a major drivers in the 2024 race. Gender and racial attacks like the ones she experienced as a primary candidate in the 2020 race are poised to accelerate now that she’s the likely nominee.For the record, Harris, 59, became a stepmom of two when she married Douglas Emhoff in 2014 and has been deeply involved in the lives of stepchildren Ella and Cole. And Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, whom Vance also singled out in his comments describing how “the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,” became a parent of adopted twins.Harris spokesman Ammar Moussa said that “unlike Donald Trump and JD Vance, Vice President Harris understands that every single American has a stake in this country’s future.”Vance’s campaign is pointing to a different speech from the July 2021 in which he targeted the “childless left” but added a caveat: that “there are people, of course, for biological reasons, medical reasons that can’t have children. The target of these remarks is not them.”Yet many women are reminding Vance that there are plenty of reasons they may not have children.“I truly can’t believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States,” actress Jennifer Aniston wrote Wednesday, slamming Vance in an Instagram story. “Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,” wrote the “Friends” star.“I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.” (While Trump has declared support for in vitro fertilization, Senate Republicans last month blocked consideration of a bill to protect IVF access — and the issue erupted in February when the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos are people and that a person could be liable for destroying them.)Reproductive health issues, especially conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and endometriosis can impact women’s ability to conceive and carry a pregnancy. Female fertility declines with age and lack of adequate health-care services or child support services can also be factors influencing the decision to have a child.Aniston has previously been candid about the challenges of trying to get pregnant — and has previously written about how “we don’t need to be married or mothers to be complete.”‘The View"" host Whoopi Goldberg also weighed in on the show Wednesday: “Sir, there are people who have chosen not to have children for whatever reason,” she said. “There are people who want to have children who cannot. How dare you. You never had a baby; your wife had a baby ...  you know nothing about this.”Meghan McCain, talk show host and daughter of the late GOP senator John McCain of Arizona, posted on X that “I have been trying to warn every conservative man I know — these JD comments are activating women across all sides, including my most conservative Trump supporting friends.” The remarks “have caused real pain and are just innately unchristian. This is not who we are,” she said.Buttigieg in a CNN interview, said Vance’s remarks came on the heels of their difficult journey to adoption. “He couldn’t have known that, but maybe that’s why you shouldn’t be talking about other people’s children,” Buttigieg said.Vance, in his 2021 comments, called out “childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.” Women online blasted the assumption that those who are without children are unhappy.“I had absolutely no idea I was miserable,” actor Liz Vassey, known for her role on “CSI,” wrote on X. “Thank God there was a man around to tell me.”Hey! I'm a childless cat lady and I'm only miserable when I think of what miserable men like this might do to our country and our lives.  Therefore, I will fight with all my might to keep these #MiserableMen from winning.  Thank you @JoeBiden with all my heart & let's elect… https://t.co/RDsakyC3awVance’s comments came as more Americans are choosing not to have children. A Pew Research Survey in 2021 found that the childless U.S. adults aged 18 to 49 who said they were unlikely to ever have children rose by 7 percentage points in the previous three years to 44 percent. About 56 percent said they did not want children, 19 percent stated a medical reason for not having kids, and financial reasons stopped another 17 percent from becoming a parent.As some on social media put it: Childless cat ladies vote, too — and some, even, are cultural icons. “It’s bold, for someone seeking votes, to hone in on ‘childless cat ladies’ when the leader of Childless Cat Ladies is TAYLOR SWIFT,” author Caitlin Moran posted. Swift, 34, has three cats and has described them as some of her biggest influences.Sure enough, Swifties were entering the chat in droves. One TikToker added Swift’s Time cover to the soundtrack of “Who’s Afraid of Little Old Me?”Another posted a video of Swift riding a giant rendering of her cat Olivia dressed as a unicorn, with the text: “Childless cat ladies riding to polls in November to vote for Harris.”Replying to @Life Happens Therapy & Travel #harris2024 #childlesscatladies #jdvance #democrat #catladiesoftiktok #vote #kamalaharris #kamalanomenon #taylorswift Legal fellow and Lawfare correspondent Anna Bower pointed out on X: “hell hath no fury like a certain childless cat lady who has yet to endorse a presidential candidate.”"
WaPo_80,Harris addresses teachers ahead of meeting with Israeli prime minister,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/25/harris-address-teachers-ahead-meeting-with-israeli-prime-minister/,2024-07-26 00:57:02.777714,,"Vice President Harris addressed an influential teachers union in Houston on Thursday morning before traveling to Washington to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the afternoon, a preview of the delicate political and policy terrain she must navigate during her shortened and frenetic presidential campaign.Calling herself a “proud product of public education,” Harris extolled the “noble” work of educators and attacked Republicans who have called for arming teachers to prevent school shootings.“Just think about it. We want to ban assault weapons, and they want to ban books,” she said during the speech, which wrapped in a range of issues such as collective bargaining, abortion, gun violence and same-sex marriage under the broader theme of “fundamental freedoms.”The address to the American Federation of Teachers, a 1.8-million-member group that has endorsed Harris’s candidacy, was the latest in a string of events that have demonstrated support for her bid to defeat Republican nominee Donald Trump. After a rally in Milwaukee on Tuesday and a speech to thousands of Black women at a sorority convention in Indianapolis on Wednesday, Harris’s speech to teachers was yet another foray into friendly territory with large, adoring crowds. The events, featuring boisterous crowds, have showcased how swiftly she has united much of the Democratic Party behind her candidacy since she jumped into the presidential race on Sunday.However, after Harris’s trip back to Washington, her planned a one-on-one meeting with Netanyahu is likely to be a more staid setting. In her first sit-down with a foreign leader since launching her campaign for president, Harris will have to confront the rifts that have emerged between the United States and Israel over the war in Gaza, which she has often described with forceful and empathetic language about Palestinian suffering. Voters who had vowed not to vote for Biden over his handling of the war will be watching Harris closely as she publicly deals with a thorny foreign policy matter for the first time since Biden’s exit from the presidential race.Earlier Thursday, Harris released her campaign launch video in an attempt to introduce herself to the country during the 100-plus-day sprint to Election Day. The video aimed to draw a sharp distinction with Trump and amplify the pro-freedom theme that has become central to Harris’s pitch.“In this election, we each face a question: What kind of country do we want to live in?” Harris says in the video, which campaign officials said would air across social media platforms beginning Thursday. “There are some people who think we should be a country of chaos. Of fear. Of hate. But us? We choose something different. We choose freedom.”Meanwhile, Trump and his allies have criticized Harris more directly in recent days, aiming to define her before she has an opportunity to introduce herself more broadly to the public.At a rally in North Carolina on Wednesday, Trump referred to Harris as a “lunatic” and “incompetent,” attacking her on immigration and painting her as incredibly liberal.“If Kamala Harris gets in, she would be the most radical, far-left extremist ever to occupy the White House, times 10,” Trump said.Harris’s campaign shot back Thursday by describing Trump as a “78-year-old criminal,” responding to the former president’s appearance on Fox News, in which he accused Harris of staging a “palace coup” against Biden.“After watching Fox News this morning we only have one question, is Donald Trump ok?” the campaign said, offering Harris as “an alternative.”Harris has largely focused on domestic policy in her appearances this week, while Biden has indicated he would spend the final six months of his term leaning into foreign policy objectives.But groups like the American Federation of Teachers, while mostly focused on issues like educator pay, recruitment, school funding and collective bargaining, have also taken interest in the war in Gaza, calling for a cease-fire and debating whether to divest from companies linked to Israel’s military campaign. The conflict has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and created a humanitarian calamity in which thousands of children have been out of school for months.Biden also plans to meet with Netanyahu on Thursday and speak privately with the families of hostages who were among the 250 taken captive during Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack, which Israel estimates killed about 1,200 people. During an address to the American people on Wednesday evening, Biden pledged to use his remaining months to bring resolution to the long-running conflict.“I’m going to keep working to end the war in Gaza, bring home all the hostages and bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war,” he said.Hours earlier, Netanyahu had delivered a defiant speech to Congress — one that Harris skipped — in which he described pro-Palestinian protesters as “useful idiots.” Thousands of protesters took to the streets to decry Netanyahu’s visit, and some burned an American flag near Union Station in Washington.Harris issued a statement Thursday condemning the protesters who engaged in property destruction or hateful rhetoric, saying the flag “should never be desecrated in that way.”“I support the right to peacefully protest, but let’s be clear: Antisemitism, hate and violence of any kind have no place in our nation,” she said.Harris steered clear of the issue during her speech in Houston, instead speaking out in favor of unions and the public education system and contrasting her positions with Trump’s views.Hundreds of teachers and other attendees lined up at the American Federation of Teachers national educators’ union convention in Houston’s cavernous downtown convention center to hear Harris speak.Some wore Biden-Harris shirts and said they were excited to hear her speak about education, particularly public schools and teacher recruitment. “It’s a special opportunity, being part of the democratic process,” said Eric Sutz, 45, an elementary school teacher from Long Island. Sutz said he’s an independent but a Harris supporter, and was wearing a Biden-Harris T-shirt. He was pleased to see so many Democrats endorsing Harris. “It should be whittling down to the best people,” he said, and if Harris becomes the nominee, he considers that “the best outcome.”In describing various freedoms she says are at risk in the coming election, Harris has often listed key issues that Democrats hope will drive voter turnout, including gun safety and abortion.“The freedom not just to get by, but get ahead,” Harris says in her campaign launch video. “The freedom to be safe from gun violence. The freedom to make decisions about your own body.”At one point in the ad, when Harris says that “no one is above the law,” an image of Trump’s mug shot flashes on the screen. But during her speech in Houston, she did not mention Trump’s felony convictions, a departure from recent events in which she has contrasted her record as a prosecutor with the former president’s long list of indictments.Harris is continuing to ramp up her travel schedule. She plans to hold a campaign event in Atlanta on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the trip who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview an event that has not been publicly announced. The visit will be Harris’s first campaign stop in the battleground state of Georgia as a 2024 presidential candidate.Although Georgia was once more reliably Republican, the state helped deliver the presidency to Biden in 2020. That year, Georgia voters also elected two Democrats to the Senate.Maegan Vasquez contributed to this report."
WaPo_81,Will we ever be ready for Jeremy O. Harris?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater/2024/07/25/jeremy-harris-slave-play-black-out-london/,2024-07-26 00:00:02.777714,,"LONDONEight newspapers had just been delivered to Room 26 at the Chiltern Firehouse hotel. Every morning after an opening night, playwright Jeremy O. Harris rings the front desk of wherever he’s staying and asks for all the papers they have. He prefers to read his reviews in print. He spread the papers across the table of his room, sliding aside bouquets of flowers from well-wishers and silver buckets of ice covered in their sweat.“I think I had an image of Tennessee Williams doing it,” he said, of the ritual. Harris has updated it with his own stylistic touches, including a purple do-rag. Eventually, he gently unraveled the two-strand twists in his hair. Fresh from the shower, he wore a peony-pink linen pajama set by Turnbull & Asser. When a photographer arrived, he asked if Harris would like to change. “Oh, no,” the American playwright said, shaking his head. “These are the same pajamas Prince wore.”The description “influencer playwright” feels jarring, even pejorative. But what else to make of a man who gets recognized on the street as often as Harris does, a man who balances Gucci partnerships and texts from celebrity friends like Rihanna with the actual work of writing plays?In person, Harris is dinner and a show: loquacious, feisty and entirely self-possessed, with a diamond-hard sense of self, forged by years of having to defend it. He performs well in traditional late-night television interviews and TikTok, endearing himself across generations. Social media extends his persona as readily as a selfie stick: Harris is a consummate poster, giving voice to his glamour. (His post on X the day that President Biden announced he was dropping out of the presidential race: “In a Catholic Church in Italy texting with @Madonna when I found out that Biden dropped out. Let me light a candle this feels like catholic Jesus might be real.” He followed up with photos of Madonna backstage.)He knows how to capture attention. Sometimes, it’s with his physical presence (he is 6 feet 5 inches tall, as glittery as a skyscraper, with an eye for fashion). This helped him — as a former struggling actor in Los Angeles — differentiate himself from the other cool kids on the club scene. More often, though, it’s with his insistence. In his 20s, he worked as a salesman at Barneys, and he has retained that power to convince. “Knowing how to sell a dad in Santa Monica a Thom Browne suit in 2007 feels as difficult as selling an experimental play about slavery to, like, Bob Wankel of the Shuberts,” he has said, referring to the head of the Shubert Organization, which operates multiple Broadway theaters.
Harris prompts questions of readiness, as if he’s a walking arbiter of progress or acceptance. He was staying at the Chiltern as “Slave Play,” his celebrated work about interracial couples working through their sexual apathy with antebellum role-play, had just premiered on the West End. (Last month, a documentary about the Broadway production — “Slave Play. Not A Movie. A Play.” — directed by Harris premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival.)Six years earlier, it opened in New York, a flashbulb of controversy and acclaim. The debasement of the Black partners is the point, which is why New York Times coverage first asked, “Is Broadway ready for ‘Slave Play’?” (it originally premiered at downtown’s New York Theatre Workshop). Then, after 19 weeks and 12 Tony Award nominations (winning none): “Was Broadway ready for ‘Slave Play’?”Is London ready for “Slave Play”? The question was inflamed by then-British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s condemnation this February of the show’s Black Out nights, in which only Black patrons are encouraged to populate the theater. It’s a concept invented by Harris in 2019: For us, by us (as the ’90s Black clothing brand FUBU put it), and with us. A spokesperson from Sunak’s office said, “Restricting audiences on the basis of race would be wrong and divisive.” Black and White objectors pounced, describing the concept as akin to apartheid.Never mind the facts: that people of color make up just 7 percent of theater audiences in England, or that Black Outs were two nights out of close to 100, or that advertising stated that no one would be turned away on the basis of race, or that — most critically — Black Outs had been done before in Britain, without a peep from No. 10 Downing Street. Harris’s follow-up to “Slave Play,” “Daddy,” featured one in 2022, and Dave Harris (no relation), another Black American playwright, had held two for his show, “Tambo & Bones,” in 2023. Former cabinet minister Damian Green called the “Tambo & Bones” move “misguided and a bit sinister.”Months later, Sunak was voted out of office in a snap election, “Slave Play” was well into previews, and Harris posted to X, “Every tongue that rises up against me shall fall.”So he had one major win under his belt. That morning at the Chiltern, Harris said of the reviews: “my sense is that they’re good.” Two stars in the Times — “Oh, they gave me the worst review last time,” for “Daddy” — four in the Guardian, Time Out, the Independent, the Standard. What pleased him most was that his play seemed to be reaching both younger and more traditional — whiter, older and wealthier — theater audiences.“What’s cool about having four stars is that it makes it harder for those classic people to dismiss it.” He trailed off, momentarily lost in his phone for a moment. He had gone to sleep only about six hours earlier. “Sorry, Travis Scott came to a party last night” — Harris had thrown two — “and he wants me to come to the concert.”Harris grew up in Martinsville, Va. “The thing I like about Southern people, White or Black, is that they weren’t able to deny that racism is real,” he said, a few nights earlier over dinner. “They’d be like, ‘Sorry if that was weird, Jeremy, you know my mama hates Black people — you’re one of the first I ever met.’ It’s almost nicer, sometimes, to be around people like that, who could say the thing.”He was raised by his mother in a working-class home and attended private schools on scholarship. The schools were mostly White; for a while, Harris was encouraged to play basketball. Instead, he turned to the arts: studying dance and theater in high school, and majoring in the latter at DePaul University in Illinois. DePaul had a competitive theater program, and when Harris was cut after the first year, he dropped out and moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting. It wasn’t nothing, but a few acting gigs here and a web series there did not a career make. Jaded, he started writing plays.“Xander Xyst, Dragon: 1” came after an inspiring date with a porn star, which led to Harris’s 2015 fellowship at the MacDowell contemporary arts organization.  There, he finished “Daddy,” about the relationship between a young Black artist and his wealthy, older White lover. In 2016, Harris enrolled in the Yale School of Drama, where his fascination with power dynamics further coalesced. A year later, he staged “Slave Play” for the first time with director Emil Weinstein.So what’s the most controversial part of “Slave Play,” anyway? Is it the primary couple — Black American Kaneisha and White Briton Jim, now played by Olivia Washington, daughter of Denzel, and “Game of Thrones” actor Kit Harington — who fail at their slave-overseer role play because Jim hates calling his wife a “nasty Negress” when he would rather call her a queen? Is it “I’m-not-Black-I’m-just-Phillip,” or is it the dildo wielded by Alana, Phillip’s older White female partner whom he met in a cuckolding scenario with her ex-husband? Is it racially ambiguous Dustin and his dark-skinned partner, Gary, who has his first sexual emission in years after forcing his partner to do manual labor for two hours?Leading up to opening night, I had asked Harris if he thought he would be nervous. He did not. “I know exactly every positive thing you can say about it and every negative thing you can say. Nobody’s  going to surprise me with any take on it.”There are two main schools of thought about “Slave Play.” The first is that this is an empowering, thought-provoking work that takes the darkness buried in interracial relationships and lays them plain, creating a productive discomfort for audience members of all races. Sam O’Sullivan, a White man, loved the show – “I liked the ambiguous ending that seemed to say that we don’t know if this is the answer but we’re not going to cure trauma by ignoring it, so we may as well at least try putting it under the spotlight in all its ugliness and taking a really, really good look.” So did Sabrina Fearon-Melville, a Black social media coordinator, who said “sometimes we aren’t okay with being uncomfortable, and I think that’s what Jeremy set out to do.”The other take is that it’s a thin, overzealous farce that commercializes pain, especially that of Black women. One Black woman I spoke to, who did not want to be identified, wondered if Harris had been paid by right-wingers to undermine critical race theory by writing a play full of Black caricatures. The brutal — and frustratingly, even irresponsibly ambiguous — third act consists of a violent sexual encounter between Kaneisha and Jim. Is it a fulfillment of Kaneisha’s initial request to be denigrated, or has the violence that she worries is embedded in her White husband finally come out of its hiding place?On opening night, the Noël Coward Theatre alternated between raucous laughter and tense, uncomfortable silences. The show is undeniably funny, paced as quickly as  a high-intensity interval training exercise class. Harris watched the show from a box while wearing a black KN95 mask. (He and the cast had been sick all week.) He made his own second row, dragging an extra chair behind his fiancé, TV executive Arvand Khosravi, and a group of friends.Harris was most excited by the sheer fact that “Slave Play” was showing in London: “I want to be one of the Black writers that is done in Europe, on the West End, because so few of us have been there,” he said. Now, at 35, Harris could say he had done it, “so that I can do it again.”There were too many people for Harris to hug — actor friends, cast members, old classmates, “those girls over there” — on the last night of previews, so by the time he left the theater, he had to rush to dinner before the restaurant’s kitchen closed. Still, he stopped to chat with the two young Black men who flagged him down across the street from the theater. They thanked him, with puppy dog eyes, for “Slave Play,” for his representation, for just being himself.Earlier that day, an employee of the theater told Harris that his play drew the most diverse crowd they had ever seen. Harris has joked that he’s a theater supremacist, but more fitting might be a theater proselytizer: Have you heard the good word about the stage? In his eyes, theater should be as much a part of the American story as music is: “Music has figured out a way to really brand itself as necessary, because people can see the tangible links to profit.”The role models are evident: If my kid learns how to play guitar, maybe they could be the next Taylor Swift! “But when you say, ‘Oh, my kid might be the next Kenny Leon’” — the Tony Award-winning director of “A Raisin in the Sun” — “people are like, ‘Well, who is that?’ You should know that Kenny Leon is one of the most celebrated Black directors of our moment,” just as fundamental to the formation of culture as any pop star is, Harris says.Every Wednesday morning, the West End production releases 30 pay-what-you-can tickets, a concept dreamed up by producer James Bierman. Some people pay as little as a pound (about $1.30). “You get hooked on theater the same way you get hooked on any drug — you have to give it to them in a way that’s affordable,” says Harris.At dinner, conversation eventually turned to how the production was being received, whether “Slave Play” is “too American,” and if its racial traumas can be more readily written off by British audiences. Harris had heard the “false idea” that Britain is a country that revolves around class, not race. He had encountered plenty of people in London who maintained that widespread, racialized discrimination was a distinctly American problem.Dave Harris, of “Tambo & Bones,” has also encountered the class-versus-race divide. “The arguments around representation have always been the same, but the unifying point in America is American slavery,” he said, whereas many Black Brits can trace their lineage back to a country of origin in just a few steps. “So the unifying point becomes class, even though the dynamics of race and racism are exactly the same.”Jeremy O. Harris pointed out that though antebellum history is distinctly American, the performance of the era has always been rife with Brits. He rattles off a list: The film producers for “Gone With the Wind” considered virtually every big-name American actress — Lana Turner, Bette Davis, Katharine Hepburn, Lucille Ball — before settling on the British Vivien Leigh; British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor starred in the best-picture-winning “12 Years a Slave.” “There’s an argument to be made that our most celebrated — or best — slave movie was made by a Black Brit,” Steve McQueen. Now, Harris was getting worked up, words sputtering out like a motor. “Michael Fassbender” — not a Brit, but a White European — “is the main guy in that movie!” It didn’t make sense for British audiences to write off the ills of slavery and racism as simply an American phenomenon, he said.That Black theater, British and American, is on the upswing in London helps make those connections, and shows that the audience is there. Harris pointed to “For Black Boys Who Have Considered Suicide When the Hue  Gets Too Heavy,” Ryan Calais Cameron’s masculine riff on Ntozake  Shange’s choreopoem “For Colored Girls,” which sold out three runs and received glowing reviews in 2021. “People are obsessed — it’s a super enthusiastic Black audience, the sort of thing you only see in America for ‘MJ the Musical.’”Though Harris has been dabbling in TV and film for a while — he has a role in the Netflix hit “Emily in Paris”;  he co-wrote the 2020 A24 film “Zola”; and the next project from his production company, bb², is “The Wives,” an A24 and Apple murder mystery starring Jennifer Lawrence — theater still reigns supreme. He is finishing “Spirit of the People,” a play about tourism, gentrification and the liquor industry, based in Oaxaca, Mexico. He is anxious to relaunch “A Boy’s Company Presents: Tell Me if I’m Hurting You,” a revenge tragedy inspired by a bad breakup, after its 2020 New York run was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. He pulled out his phone and showed me videos from rehearsals, queer teenage boys of color swaying their bodies to classical music. It bothered him that the production had not gotten its day in the sun.“I’ve been very specific in how I use my funds as a producer,” he said. “But now it’s come to a point where I’m feeling so crazy about this play being out that if someone doesn’t commit to it, I’m just going to do it myself.”A week later, and after much fanfare, the first Black Out night came and went without much issue. Israel Soares, an usher for the Abba Voyage show, appreciated the safe space to express himself. “I’m someone who goes to the theater a lot, and I felt like it was a breath of fresh air to be able to be around so many people who look like me and who can relate to stuff the way I do.”Harris posted to X that the evening “was an amazing success and lots of great people showed up bc it was a non story and not an exclusionary event.” He reposted a negative cartoon an artist had made, showing a race bouncer stationed outside of a theater, checking people’s skin color before allowing them inside. Harris offered notes for improvement."

WaPo_83,‘End of the people’s airline’: Southwest abandons open seating after 53 years,https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2024/07/25/southwest-ends-open-seating/,2024-07-26 00:00:02.777714,,"Southwest Airlines announced Thursday that it will do away with its longtime practice of open seating, abandoning a feature that helped establish its egalitarian identity in the name of boosting revenue and adapting to evolving customer tastes.The carrier, long known for its unique model of having passengers board in groups of 30 and then choose their seats once on board, said it will now assign seats and unveil “premium seating options” that offer more legroom. In its announcement, the carrier said it expects that about one-third of seats across its fleet will have extra legroom.Bob Jordan, Southwest’s chief executive, said the carrier expects to roll out the new seating and boarding options sometime in 2025. He said one thing won’t change: The carrier has no immediate plans to implement bag fees.Southwest has long prided itself on what sets it apart from other players, but Jordan said it must evolve to meet shifting demand. He emphasized that the decision was “not made lightly” but is the product of extensive consumer surveying and research.“The answer is clear: There is more demand for Southwest Airlines with an assigned seating model,” he said.The move quickly drew negative reaction from die-hard Southwest fans who say the airline is jeopardizing its identity, and from analysts who see the airline abandoning some of the practices that helped cement its reputation as a maverick among carriers.Saty Reddy, a lawyer who lives in the Bay Area and flies Southwest frequently with his family, said the shift marks “the end of the people’s airline.”Benét J. Wilson, a veteran aviation journalist and Southwest superfan who lives in Baltimore, said she woke up to “a ton of texts and messages from friends giving me this news.” The new policies will inevitably make Southwest feel different — but also more like its competitors, she said.“It’s like another airline, any old plain airline,” Wilson said. “Southwest has swag and personality, bon vivant. Part of that was the open seating. Now I just feel like it will kind of change how the airline feels to me.”Southwest fan Grant Goodman, 24, sent a message to a reporter Thursday morning saying he felt betrayed. The Atlanta-based actor described himself as “a dedicated front row, middle seat enthusiast.”“My favorite endurance hobby was checking in at the 24-hour mark,” he said in an interview. “The button — I got it down.”Goodman said he appreciated how passengers could book a flight 48 hours before departure, check in 24 hours in advance and still have a shot at a seat upfront.“It was basically like a democracy,” he said.Kerry Tan, a professor of economics at Loyola University Maryland, said Southwest has built a loyal following among those who embraced the quirky approach to travel that set it apart from its competitors.“Southwest has made its reputation and has been successful at being a maverick,” he said. “Now it’s just following the pack.”While the carrier has portrayed the changes as a win for its customers, Tan has his doubts.“It’s hard for me to see this as a win for passengers, especially long time loyal Southwest Airline passengers,” he said. “The only reason to do this is to appease shareholders. This is not a win for passengers — this is a win for shareholders.”Southwest’s stock price rose more than 5 percent Thursday.The company acknowledged that changing the seating policy is a fundamental shift for the airline, which boasts that its goal was to “democratize the sky” with low-cost travel when it began offering service in 1971 connecting three Texas cities — Dallas, Houston and San Antonio. As Southwest lore goes, the original business plan for the upstart carrier was sketched out on a cocktail napkin by Herb Kelleher, the company’s late founder, whose office is still preserved at its Dallas headquarters.Kelleher was determined to build an airline with a unique culture that valued employees who had a sense of humor and weren’t afraid to have fun. Southwest flight attendants are known for their corny jokes and oddball stunts like offering prizes to passengers with holes in their socks. In the early days, the carrier’s focus on smaller, less-trafficked airports enabled it to keep costs and fares low.There were other benefits. Researchers found that when Southwest entered a market, competitors would lower their fares, a phenomenon they described as the “Southwest effect.” Despite the carrier’s storied history, it has sometimes stumbled. In December 2022, Southwest suffered a major meltdown after freezing weather hit much of the country shortly before Christmas. While other airlines were able to bounce back, Southwest struggled for more than a week to restore its operations.On Tuesday, the Federal Aviation Administration announced it would conduct a special review of Southwest’s flight operations and flight training after several incidents involving the carrier’s jets. Earlier this month, a Southwest flight flew as low as 150 feet over water as it prepared to land at Tampa’s airport. In June, a low-altitude alert was triggered as a Southwest flight was preparing to land at Oklahoma City’s airport.Jordan said Thursday that the carrier expects to have more details in September on its seating changes, including how they might impact Southwest’s A-List members, who already receive perks such as special check-in lines and priority boarding.Southwest said its research showed that 80 percent of its customers and 86 percent of “potential” customers prefer an assigned seat. Jordan said data also showed that travelers cited the open-seating policy as the chief reason they stop flying on Southwest or choose to book with another airline. Ending the scrum of open seating will ease concerns among families, Jordan said.“In the new world of assigned seating, you would have the assurance that you’d be able to sit together,” he said. “A lot of these changes are about taking the stress out of the boarding and seating process.”Ryan Fisher, a digital marketing analyst and frequent Southwest flier based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said Southwest’s seating changes are not a surprise but still disappointing.“If people are willing to pay up for that seat guarantee, I get it,” Fisher said in a direct message on X. “I’m just not that person … so this news overall is disappointing for a Southwest loyalist like myself.”Southwest fan Goodman anticipates that the airline’s changes will result in higher prices for passengers. He expects Southwest to continue offering free checked bags, a differentiating perk the company’s leadership has promised to keep.

WaPo_84,"California’s Park Fire blows up, engulfs 45,000 acres",https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/25/california-park-fire-chico-butte-tehama/,2024-07-26 00:13:02.777714,,"A wildfire that started Wednesday in Northern California blew up overnight and has now consumed more than 45,550 acres, prompting evacuation orders in several parts of Butte and Tehama counties.The blaze, dubbed the Park Fire, has quickly grown to become the largest wildfire in California this year, according to Cal Fire. It was only 3 percent contained as of Thursday morning. Temperatures in the area were expected to top 100 degrees in the afternoon.Fire personnel are “focusing on evacuations and structure defense” while “building direct containment lines,” the Butte County Fire Department said. The cause of the fire is under investigation, and an evacuation center has been set up in Chico, according to Cal Fire.While there have been no official reports of structures burned, video shows at least one home in flames amid what appears to be a leaking gas line.Butte County has endured an active fire season this year. Earlier this month, more than two dozen structures in the county were destroyed as the Thompson Fire burned more than 3,700 acres. And several other wildfires have been reported in the county, including the Junes Fire, which burned more than 1,000 acres in June.Jamie Grettum, a Salesforce instructor, lives in Chico and said she could see plumes of smoke all afternoon from her neighborhood. Wednesday evening, she joined hundreds of locals at a nearby park to watch the fire on the horizon and get a sense for “how nervous we need to be right now,” she told The Washington Post.Chico is less than 15 miles west of Paradise, which was ravaged by the Camp Fire, the deadliest fire in California’s history, in 2018. Grettum said she could sense the anxiety in the air on Wednesday night. “We know for sure we’re standing out there with survivors of that,” she said, referring to the Camp Fire. “It was tense and silent and sad.”Grettum is also a wildfire survivor — the 2007 Witch Fire burned down her neighborhood in San Diego County. On Wednesday, she was “doing a little mental checklist” of what to take with her if she has to evacuate, she said. “When you’re packing and evacuating, you never think your house will burn. … I know better than that now.”"

WaPo_86,Bankruptcy judge threatens to force Giuliani to testify about finances,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/25/rudy-giuliani-bankruptcy-finances/,2024-07-26 01:43:02.809136,,"The federal judge overseeing Rudy Giuliani’s bankruptcy proceedings threatened to force the former New York mayor to testify under oath about the state of his finances after Giuliani failed to explain how he plans to pay roughly $350,000 in administrative fees incurred in the case.U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane in the Southern District of New York said in a written order Thursday that he is holding off on finalizing his decision to dismiss Giuliani’s bankruptcy case and may decide to keep the proceedings going after Giuliani claimed “he does not have the ability to pay such fees” — which must be resolved before the case can be closed.But Lane, who has been critical of Giuliani’s lack of financial transparency throughout the proceedings, was skeptical of the former mayor’s claim that he doesn’t have the money, citing Giuliani’s ownership of two apartments that are of “considerable value.”“What little we know about the Debtor’s financial situation makes his stance here more troubling,” Lane wrote. “Even assuming that the Debtor does not have the funds on hand to immediately pay these bankruptcy expenses, he certainly has considerable assets upon which he can draw to pay such expenses.”Echoing his remarks in a hearing last week, Lane said the “most obvious path forward is to initiate proceedings to assess the details” of Giuliani’s “current financial circumstances” with an evidentiary hearing that would potentially include “the disclosure of documents” and “testimony under oath” by Giuliani.A spokesman for Giuliani did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The order comes two weeks after Lane threw out Giuliani’s bankruptcy case, paving the way for numerous creditors, including two former Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation claim against the former mayor, to pursue and potentially seize his assets.But the case can’t be dismissed until Giuliani explains how he plans to pay fees in the case, including expenses his creditors incurred when they retained an investigative accounting firm made up of former CIA and FBI officials to probe his finances.That hiring came after Giuliani repeatedly failed to fully disclose his cash and assets, including information about his businesses and other holdings that is required in bankruptcy proceedings — a lack of transparency the judge has called “troubling.”On July 12, an attorney for Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, former Georgia election workers Giuliani falsely accused of helping to steal the 2020 presidential election, filed a motion asking the judge to order Giuliani to immediately turn over all of the cash in his bank account. They also pressed that Giuliani be ordered to sign over control of his New York apartment to a trustee appointed by the group to manage its sale — all to resolve costs related to the bankruptcy proceedings.Lane declined to immediately take up the issue, calling it “premature.” But in a hearing last week, Rachel Strickland, an attorney for Freeman and Moss, urged the judge to take action quickly, accusing Giuliani of financial “shenanigans” and continuing to spend freely without authorization from the court.Strickland said records from the only bank account Giuliani had disclosed to creditors showed that in recent days he had burned through more than half of the $60,000 in the account — including $39,000 in fees related to his Florida condo and New York apartment. Giuliani also spent money on travel and other expenses related to the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, she claimed.Giuliani did not appear at the virtual hearing. And his attorneys, Heath Berger and Gary Fischoff, told Lane they’d had trouble reaching their client — an answer that frustrated Lane, who ordered them to file a plan by noon last Thursday about how Giuliani would pay. He warned if they didn’t, he’d summon Giuliani to the “witness box” to explain himself.But at the deadline, there was only a letter from Berger, who told the judge that Giuliani’s legal team had been in “extensive negotiations” with attorneys for the creditors but there was not yet an agreement. “The parties are still talking, and I am hopeful a joint resolution will be forthcoming shortly,” he wrote.A short time later, Strickland faxed her own letter in challenging Berger’s claim of “extensive negotiations.” “Much of the day has been spent with Debtor’s counsel trying to reach his client,” she wrote.The next day, Berger filed a letter disputing Strickland’s claim, telling the judge he “had been in contact all day” with Giuliani, who had authorized him to make “numerous offers to try to resolve” the dispute over court fees. The letter did not say what those offers were.On Tuesday, attorneys for Giuliani sent another letter to the court defending their client’s spending on travel to Milwaukee for the GOP convention. The filing included a letter from My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell, a fellow election denier and Trump associate, who told the court his media company, FrankSpeech, paid for Giuliani’s “first class airfare and hotel” for the RNC.Lindell had previously been subpoenaed by creditors in the Giuliani’s bankruptcy case amid questions about Giuliani’s finances and income.The back-and-forth comes nearly seven months after Giuliani sought bankruptcy protection after he was ordered to immediately pay millions in damages to Freeman and Moss for the false claims he made about them in the aftermath of the 2020 election when he was serving as former president Donald Trump’s personal attorney.In court documents, Giuliani has listed roughly $153 million in debts to at least 20 people and businesses, including Freeman and Moss. A list of top creditors filed in February said Giuliani owes more than $3.7 million in unpaid legal fees to three law firms — though he is disputing some of those bills — and more than $1 million in state and federal taxes.The former federal prosecutor has claimed about $11 million in assets — including an estimated $5.6 million New York apartment and his Palm Beach, Fla., condo, which is valued at $3.5 million. While Giuliani has put his New York property on the market, he has so far successfully resisted selling his Florida home, with one of his lawyers claiming the sale could render the 80-year-old former mayor “homeless.”A financial disclosure report filed last month said Giuliani had less than $100,000 in the bank at the end of May and was funding his living expenses through a rapidly diminishing retirement account. But creditors have repeatedly complained that Giuliani has not filed a complete picture of his net worth and have accused him of hiding money and assets.In recent weeks, Giuliani repeatedly shifted legal strategies in the case. In December, he sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which allows an individual to reorganize and file a plan to pay off debts. But on July 1, Giuliani changed course, asking a judge to reclassify his case under Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which would hand control of his personal and business finances to an outside trustee to liquidate. The request prompted immediate objections from the election workers and other creditors who accused Giuliani of more delay tactics.On July 10, an hour before a hearing on the matter, Giuliani abruptly changed position yet again, asking the judge to dismiss the bankruptcy case altogether. While some of the creditors pressed the judge to appoint a trustee, Freeman and Moss supported the dismissal and Lane ultimately agreed — saying there was no evidence that Giuliani’s “uncooperative conduct will change.”A dismissal would allow Freeman and Moss and other creditors to pursue legal remedies to collect money owed to them by Giuliani. It also allows other pending lawsuits against the former mayor that had been frozen by the bankruptcy proceeding to resume, including defamation suits by the voting machine companies Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic and a sexual harassment and wage theft claim by former Giuliani associate Nicole Dunphy.All are part of a committee of “unsecured creditors” that had sought relief in the bankruptcy case.But last week, Lane threatened to hold off on finalizing that order to dismiss Giuliani’s bankruptcy, to press him to pay the creditor costs first — a requirement by law but also an acknowledgment that it may be the only money that any of the creditors see in the near future as they seek to collect what Giuliani owes them.“There are a lot of bad things that can happen,” Lane warned Giuliani’s attorneys if their client didn’t comply. “There are a lot of things your client doesn’t want to happen that will happen.”On Thursday, Lane reiterated that warning in writing and said the court may have to reconsider whether closing Giuliani’s bankruptcy case is the “appropriate course of action.”The judge suggested he could re-entertain the appointment of a trustee who would oversee Giuliani’s finances and “promptly liquidate” his assets but said he wanted to hear from attorneys for Giuliani and his creditors by next week before “determining the path forward.”"
WaPo_87,D.C. cleans up vandalism and graffiti in wake of anti-Netanyahu protests,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/25/dc-protest-vandalism-netanyahu-speech/,2024-07-26 01:31:02.809136,,"National Park Service staff launched a cleanup effort Thursday around Union Station in downtown D.C. a day after demonstrators protesting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu graffitied and vandalized monuments in the area.Thousands of Palestinian supporters and critics of the Israel-Gaza war protested Wednesday before and during Netanyahu’s address to Congress. Most of the demonstrators walked and chanted peacefully, but some set an American flag ablaze, along with an effigy of Netanyahu, and spray-painted the Christopher Columbus fountain and adjacent Liberty Bell reproduction with messages including “Israel bombs hospitals,” “Free Gaza” and “Free Palestine.”The cleanup, led by the Park Service’s monument preservation crew, is expected to take three days, though about 80 to 85 percent should be completed by the end of Thursday, according to a Park Service spokesperson.The Park Service crew also replaced American flags that were taken down from flagpoles during the protests.The statue is expected to take longer to clean than the bell because of its marble finish, the Park Service spokesperson said. Only remnants of the bright red words spray-painted on the Freedom Bell remained after its first treatment Thursday morning.Vice President Harris described the damage as “despicable acts by unpatriotic protesters” and condemned the graffiti, along with protesters burning the American flag.“I support the right to peacefully protest, but let’s be clear: Antisemitism, hate and violence of any kind have no place in our nation,” Harris said.D.C. police and Capitol Police said they arrested 15 people in total. The U.S. Park Police arrested eight people."
WaPo_88,"Climate change challenges winemakers, but some are benefitting from it",https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2024/07/25/climate-change-wine-winners-losers/,2024-07-26 01:29:02.809136,,"Climate change is transforming wine. We’ve seen devastating wildfires threaten or destroy recent harvests in California, Australia, Chile and Portugal; harsh winters decimate vineyards in British Columbia’s Okanagan Valley and the Eastern United States; and spring frosts, an age-old enemy of vignerons, increasingly menacing as warmer average temperatures nudge vines to send out their tender shoots earlier in the spring.It might seem strange to suggest climate change has produced any winners, but if we look to higher latitudes and higher altitudes, we find surprises. It’s hard to imagine England’s delicious sparkling wines rivaling Champagne’s without an increase in average temperatures in recent decades. Colder regions where grapes have traditionally struggled to ripen are enjoying more consistent results.Germany is another oft-cited example. Rising temperatures shorten the growing season, so the traditionally late-ripening riesling reaches maturity earlier, making it less vulnerable to the onset of colder weather in the fall. While the grandfathers of today’s winegrowers may have experienced two or three above-average or exceptional vintages per decade, that level of quality is more consistent today. We consumers can taste with more confidence, without stressing over vintage variation. There is also growing excitement over German red wines and chardonnay. (The country’s wine regions have also felt the flip side of climate change, with destructive floods in 2021, drought in other years, frigid winters and devastating spring frosts.)In March, I attended Grands Jours de Bourgogne, a week-long trade fair held every two years to highlight that famous French wine region. (English-speaking attendees were asked to use the French name rather than the anglicized “Burgundy,” which, as a color, translates back into French as “Bordeaux.”) Effects of climate change were most evident in the north of the region. Wines from 2022, a warm vintage, were on display. Chablis, where chardonnay thrives on a knife’s edge of cool climate acidity, were riper than normal. Not bad by any means, but lacking their usual energy.Meanwhile, wines from Chablis’s less-heralded neighbor appellations were exciting. Bourgogne Côtes d’Auxerre, Chitry, Irancy and Saint-Bris offered vibrant whites from chardonnay and sauvignon blanc, and bright, fruity and earthy reds of pinot noir. At a tasting in the cloister of the iconic abbey of Saint Germain in the city of Auxerre, a fellow writer who regularly attends these events marveled, “This is the best these wines have ever been!”Is it a warming climate? Improved viticulture? A lucky vintage? Probably all of the above. Unfortunately, most of the wines I tasted are not currently in U.S. markets. (Importers, take note!) Domaine Felix has three U.S. importers (though none in the Washington, D.C., area), while Domaine Sorin Coquard reaches shelves in New York and California. The gentleman pouring a racy chardonnay by Bailly Lapierre, a co-op best known for sparkling wines, had just two words for me: Trader Joe’s.But the winery website doesn’t even mention they make still wines, and a search of Trader Joe’s website proved fruitless.Throughout the week, I heard buzz about the pinot noir from the Hautes Côtes de Nuit and Hautes Côtes de Beaune, areas on higher slopes or just over the hill from the storied grand cru and premier cru vineyards of the Côtes d’Or. For whites, Saint Romain and Saint Véran are two minor regions poised to gain prominence as the climate warms.Frédéric Drouhin, director of Maison Joseph Drouhin in Beaune, told me his family-owned winery had recently purchased vineyards in both Saint Romain and Saint Véran, including some from longtime suppliers.“These areas are typically cooler than the heart of the Côtes d’Or and can struggle in some years, so we are seeing more consistent quality and richness the past several vintages,” Drouhin said.The famous wines of Bourgogne remain largely aspirational in price and availability. These lesser-known areas offer value and increased quality. Wines from the Haute Côtes, Saint Romain and Saint Véran typically retail between $25 and $40, while Côtes d’Auxerre, Chitry, Irancy and Saint-Bris are less expensive.There are opportunities elsewhere, too. Gabriele Gorelli, Italy’s first master of wine, argues that Italian wines in general are becoming “more approachable” because of a combination of increased ripeness from the warming climate and stylistic changes by winemakers. He is especially excited about “mountain nebbiolo” from higher-altitude vineyards in northern Piemonte or from Valtellina, a mountainous area of Lombardy better known for ski resorts than wine.“Valtellina is not really a category, but it should be,” Gorelli said. “The wines are chillable, super drinkable and interesting.”Here at home, Napa Valley vintners wonder if cabernet sauvignon will be sustainable in the long term. Meanwhile, hybrid grapes gain favor in other parts of the country because they require fewer chemical treatments than European vinifera varieties. Some of these are new varieties developed to be hardy in severe winter conditions and northerly climes. They won’t be in wide distribution, but if you’re traveling, keep an eye out for local wines made from marquette, frontenac, frontenac gris, regent, louise swenson, brianna, chardonel and other grapes. You’ll find these throughout New England and the Midwest where you might not expect local wine but, with climate change rewriting wine’s atlas, you may be pleasantly surprised."
WaPo_89,"Martin Indyk, veteran diplomat who pursued Mideast peace, dies at 73",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/07/25/martin-indyk-dead/,2024-07-26 01:15:02.809136,,"Martin S. Indyk, a diplomat, historian and educator who helped steer Middle East policy under two presidents, advocated for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and served as a director of multiple think tanks, died July 25 at his home in New Fairfield, Conn. He was 73.The cause was esophageal cancer, said his wife, Gahl Hodges Burt.Born in England and raised in Australia, Mr. Indyk moved to Washington in his early 30s, founded an influential research institute focused on Middle East policy and joined the Clinton administration shortly after becoming a U.S. citizen. “I like it when you’re around, Martin,” President Bill Clinton, a former Arkansas governor, once joked in his Southern drawl, “because you and I both have funny accents.”Mr. Indyk became the first Jewish U.S. ambassador to Israel, serving from 1995 to 1997. He assumed the post again from 2000 to 2001 at a time when Clinton was trying to forge a settlement between the Israeli government and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.From 2013 to 2014, Mr. Indyk served as President Barack Obama’s special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. He was a key figure in those peace talks, but their breakdown dashed his dreams of achieving a durable Middle East peace.“He’ll be remembered for his commitment to the cause of Israeli-Palestinian peace, which in the end broke his heart,” said David Ignatius, a Washington Post columnist who knew Mr. Indyk for nearly four decades. “All of his efforts had basically been spurned by both sides. … His life’s work had ended up not producing the thing he dreamed of.”Mr. Indyk had been consulted by the Biden White House as a key strategist on efforts to achieve normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia — overtures sidelined by the deadly October 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas militants, and then by Israel’s retaliatory war in Gaza.At various times, Mr. Indyk drew indignation from opposite ends of the Israeli political spectrum and from voices outside Israel. He was “too pro-Israeli in the eyes of Israel’s critics, and at the same time too tough on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for many Israelis,” as the Forward newspaper put it in 2013.He largely blamed Arafat and the Palestinians for the collapse of the 2000-2001 talks, but he also faulted the Israeli policy of building and expanding settlements in the occupied West Bank. Some Israelis and U.S. Jewish groups were particularly incensed by his call in late 2000 for Israel to share control of Jerusalem with the Palestinians.“One way or the other, Israelis and Palestinians will have to find a way to coexist,” Mr. Indyk wrote in December 2001 in an online chat with readers on The Post’s website.“The best way for both sides to work this arrangement out is through negotiations that lead to an agreement, if not for a marriage, then at least for an amicable divorce,” he continued. “But that can’t happen unless the basic principle is reasserted by the Palestinian side: no resort to violence in the effort to resolve the issues in dispute. [Arafat] has not fulfilled that obligation.”More recently, in an interview with Foreign Affairs magazine on Oct. 7 — the day Hamas launched its cross-border rampage that killed about 1,200 people — Mr. Indyk criticized “a total system failure” by Israel to anticipate the attack.He also blamed underlying Israeli “hubris” for a mistaken belief “that sheer force could deter Hamas, and that Israel did not have to address the long-term problems,” even though “many people told the Israelis that the situation with the Palestinians was unsustainable.”Now, he said, “I fear that Hamas’s intention is to get Israel to retaliate massively and have the conflict escalate: a West Bank uprising, Hezbollah attacks, a revolt in Jerusalem.”In a 2009 memoir, “Innocent Abroad: An Intimate Account of American Peace Diplomacy in the Middle East,” Mr. Indyk acknowledged some hubris of his own in thinking the Middle East peace process in the mid-1990s was “irreversible.” He wrote: “The climb up that mountain seemed so natural and destined that I never thought of looking down to contemplate how easily and how far we could fall.”He was especially critical of what he viewed as the naiveté of President George W. Bush, whom he slammed for a misguided attempt to stabilize the Middle East through a disastrous U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. The result, he wrote, was to strengthen the hand of terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda.Mr. Indyk, who served under Democratic presidents and aligned most closely with liberal Israeli leaders, also wrote a diplomatic history, “Master of the Game: Henry Kissinger and the Art of Middle East Diplomacy” (2021), which offered a generally admiring look at the 1970s Arab-Israeli peace efforts of the Republican former national security adviser and secretary of state.Unlike Kissinger, Mr. Indyk was largely an “implementer” of policy, “rarely a principal,” Ignatius said. “But because he was a strategic thinker, he ended up shaping the view of the principals to an unusual extent.”Martin Sean Indyk was born in London on July 1, 1951, to a family of religiously and politically liberal Jewish immigrants from Poland. He moved with his family to Australia and grew up with two siblings in the Sydney suburb of Castlecrag. His father was a surgeon.He graduated from the University of Sydney in 1972, writing his political science thesis on the domestic and external factors affecting U.S. policy toward Israel, then moved to that country to attend the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.After returning to Australia, he received a doctorate in international relations from Australian National University in 1977 and worked as a Middle East analyst for Australia’s intelligence service, during a period when Israel and Egypt signed a landmark peace treaty and the shah of Iran fled an Islamic revolution.He was increasingly unhappy in Australia, where he saw colleagues mesmerized by a prominent horse race just as the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel were nearing completion.“It’s pathetic,” Mr. Indyk told a colleague, according to the Australian Financial Review. “The Middle East is being transformed, and all they’re interested in is the Melbourne Cup.”After teaching foreign policy at Macquarie University in Sydney, Mr. Indyk immigrated to the United States in 1982 and went to work in Washington as a research director for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israeli lobbying group. Three years later, he founded the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and spent eight years as its executive director.A prolific writer who was quick to grasp the significance of developments in the Middle East, Mr. Indyk raised the influence of his think tank, in part by recruiting a bipartisan group of luminaries to its advisory board, including Democratic former vice president Walter Mondale and senior Republican diplomat Lawrence Eagleburger. He also became a fixture on television and in foreign policy journals.Even before Clinton announced his candidacy for president, Mr. Indyk offered to advise him on Middle East policy, and he ended up briefing both President George H.W. Bush and Clinton during the 1992 campaign, the Australian Financial Review reported.In 1993, a little more than a week after becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, Mr. Indyk joined the White House National Security Council, serving as an adviser to Clinton on Arab-Israeli issues. His two stints as ambassador to Israel began under Labor Party governments, with which Mr. Indyk had greater affinity. In the interim — from 1997 to 2000, partly coinciding with Netanyahu’s first term as prime minister — he served as assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs.In September 2000, when he was ambassador to Israel, Mr. Indyk was stripped of his security clearance and investigated by the FBI after he was accused of improperly handling classified information, including by typing up confidential reports on an unclassified laptop during airplane flights. There were no indications that any secrets were compromised, and his clearance was restored the next month.Mr. Indyk also drew scrutiny in 2014 when the New York Times reported that Qatar, an oil-rich Persian Gulf emirate that has hosted Hamas’s leader and helped fund Gaza’s government, had made a $14.8 million donation to the Brookings Institution the year before, when Mr. Indyk was on hiatus from the think tank and working as the Obama administration’s special envoy for Middle East peace. The donation was for a Brookings affiliate in Qatar and a project on U.S. relations with the Islamic world.The think tank denied that Mr. Indyk benefited personally from the donation or that it compromised the institution’s scholarship in any way. After his turn as special envoy, he served as executive vice president of Brookings.At the time of his death, he was the Lowy Distinguished Fellow in U.S.-Middle East Diplomacy at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.His first marriage, to Jill Collier, ended in divorce. In 2013, he married Gahl Hodges Burt, a former aide to Kissinger and a White House social secretary during the Reagan administration. In addition to his wife, of New York, survivors include two children from his first marriage, Jacob Indyk of Fair Haven, N.J., and Sarah Indyk of Denver; two stepchildren, Christopher Burt of McLean, Va., and Caroline Burt of Los Angeles; a brother; a sister; and five grandchildren.When he was first named ambassador to Israel, Mr. Indyk told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that maintaining a strong relationship between Israel and the United States had been his “life’s work.” The need for that bond became clear, he said, when the 1973 Yom Kippur War broke out while he was preparing to study in Jerusalem, and he ended up volunteering on a kibbutz in southern Israel.“It taught me just how fragile Israel’s existence was,” he told the committee, “and how central the United States is to war and peace in the Middle East.”"
WaPo_90,"Led by Simone Biles, this U.S. team is in Paris for redemption",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/25/simone-biles-paris-us-chances/,2024-07-26 01:11:02.809136,,"PARIS — The arena is mostly empty. The gymnastics competition has yet to begin. But Simone Biles has already delivered a jaw-dropping performance.During a quiet training session here Thursday, the U.S. star launched her body off the vault, reaching a height no other woman can match, then flipped twice in a pike position. It’s the hardest vault in women’s gymnastics, and Biles planted her feet into the mat, not taking even a tiny step.When describing that vault, Coach Cecile Landi said: “Perfect. We would take this one in a heartbeat.”This vault lasted just a few seconds of one practice before Sunday’s qualifying round, but soon each of Biles’s flights will highlight the competition. When Biles executes one of these wildly difficult elements, it’s a reminder of her dominance, and of why massive expectations follow her everywhere.In Paris, the spotlight will be perhaps brighter than ever. Biles has been consistently excellent over the past two seasons, but the last time she performed on the Olympic stage, a disorienting mental block derailed her performances, and she withdrew from several events.Three years later, she’s back at the Games, and after the U.S. team finished a strong training session, Landi said, “We’re all breathing a little bit better right now.” All of the U.S. gymnasts declined interviews after Thursday’s practice.This team of five American women includes four gymnasts who competed at the Tokyo Games. As soon as they earned spots on this year’s team, they began referring to these Games as their “redemption tour.”“Honestly, we’ve been talking about it for the past three years — all of us,” Jade Carey said after the Olympic trials. “Not a single one of us had the whole experience that we wanted.”Biles’s struggle was the most severe: In the team final, she felt lost in the air during her vault and didn’t complete her intended number of twists. She cited a dangerous mental block, known in gymnastics as “the twisties,” that emerged amid the pressure she faced during those Games. Biles withdrew from the team final after the first rotation, then opted out of the all-around vault, bars and floor finals. She returned for beam, changed her dismount to one that didn’t require twisting and earned a bronze medal.Carey finally gets to fully be part of the U.S. team. She earned an individual berth in Tokyo and didn’t contribute to the team score. She had to wear a different leotard during the training session and the qualifying round — a visible reminder of how her role differed from the others. Carey won the floor gold medal but tripped as she approached the springboard in the vault final. She had entered as a medal contender but had to bail out of the skill and finished in last place.Jordan Chiles, who trains alongside Biles, headed into the last Olympics with consistency as her strength. But in Tokyo, she struggled on bars and beam in the qualifying round, then fell on floor in the team final. She didn’t advance to any individual finals.Sunisa Lee won the coveted all-around gold, but she was disappointed with a bronze on bars, her signature event. In Paris, Lee said, she wants to win gold on beam and with the team. She admitted that on bars, she just wants a medal, citing how strong Algeria’s Kaylia Nemour has been on that apparatus. China’s Qiu Qiyuan, the reigning world champion, also is excellent. Lee dealt with kidney-related health issues last year, but she has steadily progressed and upped the difficulty of her routines.To ease the stress of competition, Biles, 27, reminds the group that “our normal is enough,” Carey said.The fans who watch gymnastics just every four years last saw Biles struggling in Tokyo. They watched her vault go awry and how she exited the arena, returning only to cheer on her teammates. They didn’t see her at national-level competitions over the past two years as she held steady through complex routines. They didn’t see her at world championships last fall, when she won four gold medals and won silver. Biles said recently that she knows her critics will continue to ask: “Oh my gosh, are you going to quit again?”“Everybody probably looks at the team as, ‘Okay, they went to Tokyo and this, this and this happened. And what are they going to do here in Paris?’” Biles said after the Olympic trials. “But for us, I know we’re stronger than what we showed in Tokyo.”Carey could medal on vault and floor. Lee is a contender on bars and beam. Chiles could challenge Carey for a spot in the floor final or Lee for a chance to compete for an all-around medal. Similar to three years ago, Biles has the potential to win five gold medals — in the team and all-around competitions, as well as on vault, beam and floor.All four of the veterans can lean on their experience; in addition to Biles’s 37 world and Olympic medals, the other three athletes have combined to earn 18. Hezly Rivera is the lone newcomer, and she is “a breath of fresh air,” Landi said, referencing the 16-year-old’s wide-eyed enjoyment of the Olympic experience. Nobody will endure more pressure than Biles, but it helps that she’s surrounded by gymnasts with whom she’s competed for years and ones who share the same objective: Accomplish what they did not in Tokyo.“We all have more to give,” Biles said. “And our Tokyo performances weren’t the best. We weren’t under the best circumstances either. But I feel like we have a lot of weight on our shoulders to go out there and prove that we’re better athletes.”"
WaPo_91,"Former Uvalde school officer pleads not guilty, faces families in court",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/25/uvalde-adrian-gonzales-charged/,2024-07-26 01:05:02.809136,,"Former Uvalde school district police officer Adrian Gonzales pleaded not guilty Thursday to multiple child-endangerment charges stemming from the botched response to the Robb Elementary School shooting that killed 19 schoolchildren, two teachers and injured many others.It was the first time any law enforcement officer has faced the families of the victims in court since the 2022 massacre. Co-defendant Pedro “Pete” Arredondo, the former school district police chief, waived his appearance and was absent from court. He has also pleaded not guilty.A Uvalde County grand jury indicted Gonzales and Arredondo late last month. Prosecutors allege that both men, by their inaction and actions, were among the first to arrive at the scene but left children vulnerable to the attack by a lone shooter. The charges are unprecedented in Texas.“We are in uncharted territory,” said Gonzales’s attorney Nico LaHood, who added that he has yet to see the state’s evidence against his client. “All he did was show up to help those children.”Inside the courthouse, security was tight and those attending the hearing had their bags checked twice. A framed painting of the 21 people who were killed in the shooting hung from the wall at the north entrance, where deputies rifled through purses and passed a wand over attendees. Inside the courtroom, the families and their attorneys filled six rows.The much-criticized Uvalde County District Attorney Christina Mitchell was not present.It took more than 70 minutes after the shooter first opened fired on the school for law enforcement to confront the gunman. About 40 minutes of that was spent looking for keys and equipment, evacuating adjacent classrooms and trying to negotiate with the shooter.The U.S. Justice Department issued a scathing 575-page report that singled out local police commanders and state law enforcement for not immediately entering the classroom and killing the gunman. Attorney General Merrick Garland said that “lives would have been saved” if officers had responded quickly.Gonzales never approached the classroom where the shooting was occurring, prosecutors allege.The state will have to prove that the former officer knowingly acted or failed to act in a way that led to the deaths of 19 children and injuries of 10 others. Arredondo is charged with 10 counts — or one for each wounded child.No other officers, including city police who arrived seconds after the two defendants, have faced any charges. Arredondo’s attorney did not respond to a request for comment.State Judge Sid Harle, based in San Antonio, presided over the hearing as Gonzales said little more than a soft “not guilty” during the proceeding. He was flanked on either side of the gallery by a battery of attorneys and security personnel including Texas Rangers and Uvalde County Sheriff’s deputies.Gonzales’s legal team said after the hearing that they don’t know how the special prosecutor singled out their client and tied the evidence to the charges. They are hiring additional investigators to review an extraordinary amount of evidence, they said.The defense team also did not discount the possibility of requesting a venue change if they believe their client cannot get a fair trial in Uvalde. But they said they do not have enough information yet.“There is a horrible monster responsible for the deaths of these children,” LaHood, Gonzales’s attorney, said in front of a gaggle of reporters and cameras. “And it’s not Adrian Gonzales.”Most of the families quickly left the courthouse after the hearing, but a few stayed to listen to Gonzales’s attorneys.Brett Cross, whose son, Uziyah Garcia, was slain in the shooting, said he looked Gonzales in the face as he walked by him outside the court. All he saw, he said, was cowardice.“If you put your life higher than that of children, then you’re a monster as well,” Cross said."
WaPo_92,This new stamp honors Alex Trebek and looks like a ‘Jeopardy!’ clue,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/25/alex-trebek-jeopardy-stamp/,2024-07-26 01:03:02.809136,,"Who is Alex Trebek?That is the correct response to a new “Jeopardy!” clue — one that now appears on U.S. postage stamps in honor of the game show’s late host.Trebek, who hosted “Jeopardy!” for decades and died of pancreatic cancer in 2020, is being honored with a Forever stamp, the U.S. Postal Service announced this week. The stamp was issued Monday, which would have been Trebek’s 84th birthday.The stamp looks like a clue from the quiz show, with a blue background and white text: “This naturalized U.S. citizen hosted the quiz show ‘Jeopardy!’ for 37 seasons.” The correct response, “Who is Alex Trebek?” is printed underneath, upside-down.The full sheet of stamps is designed to look like the show’s game board, with categories above each column of stamps: Entertainment, Game Show Hosts, Famous Alexes and Forever Stamps.“It’s so appropriate that the stamp illustration commemorates Alex with a ‘JEOPARDY!’ clue,” Ken Jennings, the show’s current host, said in a statement released by the Postal Service. “He loved the game so much, and he always insisted the clues were the true star of the show.”For more than three decades, Trebek helmed “Jeopardy!,” helping to make the intellectual program one of the most popular game shows in history, and one with remarkable staying power.Born in Ontario, Trebek started his career in Canadian broadcasting. He hosted his first game show in the United States in 1973 and first appeared on “Jeopardy!” in 1984. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1998.Trebek was diagnosed with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer in 2019 but continued hosting the show even as he underwent treatment. He taped new episodes until days before his death Nov. 8, 2020, at 80.“Millions of Americans invited Alex Trebek into their living rooms each weeknight,” Michael Elston, secretary of the Postal Service’s board of governors, said. “After thousands of shows over 37 seasons, he was someone we trusted and felt like we knew.”Trebek’s family was surprised by the Postal Service’s honor, said Jean Trebek, his widow.“Alex would be over the moon about this distinctive honor and he’d feel very humbled,” she said in the Postal Service’s statement.Forever stamps — whose price went up to 73 cents on July 14 — are available at post offices and on the Postal Service’s website. The Trebek stamps are sold in sheets of 20."
WaPo_93,"Netanyahu meets with Biden, then with hostage families and Harris",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/25/netanyahu-biden-harris-hostages/,2024-07-26 01:40:02.809136,,"President Biden met Thursday afternoon with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as U.S. leaders say they are in the final stages of closing a deal that will pause the fighting in Gaza and release hostages.The meeting, part of Netanyahu’s hours-long visit to the White House which will include a separate meeting with Vice President Harris later Thursday, comes a day after the Israeli leader delivered a defiant speech to a joint meeting of Congress. Netanyahu rejected criticisms from international organizations about Israel’s conduct, asserted without evidence that Iran was funding pro-Palestinian protesters and vowed Israel would settle for nothing less than “total victory.”Biden, who announced this weekend he would drop out of the presidential race, has signaled ending the war in Gaza remains a top priority in his final months in office. He has repeatedly said a cease-fire deal was imminent, even though the U.S. and other negotiating partners have been frustrated for months by the lack of an agreement. The first phase would include a six-week pause in fighting and the release of some hostages. The second phase of the deal would continue a cessation of hostilities while Hamas and Israel negotiate a permanent cease-fire, determining the withdrawing of Israeli forces from Gaza.Biden’s meeting on Thursday was his first face-to-face encounter with Netanyahu since the president traveled to Israel in the days after the Oct. 7 attacks.“I’m going to keep working to end the war in Gaza, bring home all the hostages, and bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war,” Biden said Wednesday during his Oval Office address.Biden tightly embraced Israel in the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attacks, but as Netanyahu has continued an all-out assault on Gaza, he has become more critical, calling on Israeli leaders to allow more aid into the territory, where nearly 2 million civilians are suffering from widespread starvation and a collapsed health-care system.Ahead of the meeting, a senior U.S. administration official said Biden and Netanyahu would discuss a range of issues, including ongoing threats to Israel, developments in Gaza, the humanitarian situation and the ongoing negotiations over releasing hostages and implementing a cease-fire. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the president’s meeting, reiterated that the framework of a deal is largely agreed upon, and the leaders are now focused on the implementation phase.The official, who did not watch Netanyahu’s speech to Congress and declined to comment on it, expressed optimism that a deal remains within reach, though refused to put a timeline on when it would be completed.After their bilateral meeting in the Oval Office, the two leaders will meet with families of Americans held hostage by Hamas. By including the families, the White House is hoping to elevate their message that Netanyahu needs to stop making new demands and agree to the hostage cease-fire deal on the table, officials familiar with the matter said.Netanyahu’s government is negotiating for the release of more than 100 Israeli hostages, though of that number, many are believed to be dead.“Not bringing home the hostages will amount to a total failure,” Jon Polin, the father of American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin, told The Washington Post in an interview.Polin reiterated that message to Netanyahu during a meeting with the Israeli prime minister earlier this week at the Watergate Hotel in Washington. Netanyahu’s message to the families then was that his government is moving nearer to a cease-fire and hostage-release deal, a message they said was unsatisfactory.“He did say we’re getting closer. I have no idea if he thought that that would appease us but for most of us, it did not,” Polin said.Since the start of the Gaza War, Netanyahu has come under criticism for putting his military objectives related to the total destruction of Hamas ahead of the urgency of securing the release of hostages.Earlier this summer, the United States placed blame on Hamas for adding new demands to the deal, but that outlook shifted earlier this month when Netanyahu directed Mossad Chief David Barnea to place new demands that moved the goal posts, said diplomats who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations.Under the new conditions, Israel would not agree to withdraw its forces from the Philadelphi Corridor along the Egyptian border, the diplomats said. Israel would also not allow unrestricted access for Gazans seeking to return to their homes in the north — insisting that its forces be permitted to establish checkpoints to monitor the movement of the displaced.A senior administration official said on Wednesday that the United States was looking for both Israel and Hamas to move on certain things to conclude a deal, but he did not spell out the details.The State Department has used much less confrontational language toward Israel when describing its negotiating position in the talks.When asked about Israel’s negotiating position, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said, “We have been engaged with them over the course of the past few weeks trying to bridge the final differences. And what they tell us and what they continue to show is that they are working to try to get a deal.”This is a developing story. It will be updated."
WaPo_94,Who could replace N.J. Sen. Bob Menendez after his resignation?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/25/bob-menendez-senate-seat-replacement-new-jersey/,2024-07-26 02:47:02.862759,,"Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) announced Tuesday that he plans to resign effective Aug. 20, creating a Senate vacancy in the wake of his federal bribery conviction.Gov. Phil Murphy (D-N.J.) subsequently said he plans to exercise his duty as the state’s governor to make a temporary appointment to fill the Senate vacancy “to ensure the people of New Jersey have the representation they deserve.”At a news conference on Wednesday, the governor called Menendez’s resignation “a sad end to what was a very productive career in public service.”Senate resignations stemming from ethical scandals are rare. Only four other senators left the chamber in the post-World War II era under corruption clouds, the most recent being Al Franken (D-Minn.) in 2017.Now, Murphy must pick an appointee to fill the position until Jan. 3 — the end of Menendez’s Senate term. Here are some of the prospective candidates who have been floated to temporarily replace Menendez in the Senate.In June, Kim won the New Jersey Senate Democratic primary for Menendez’s seat. If Kim wins in November, he will replace Menendez in the Senate for a full term beginning in 2025.Kim, a former State Department official who joined the House in 2018, has indicated that he would accept the temporary appointment to the Senate if the governor asks. But the Republican candidate running against Kim in the Senate race, Curtis Bashaw, has urged Murphy to “appoint a caretaker to this seat, as is the long-standing New Jersey tradition, and not give either [Senate] candidate the advantage of incumbency in this election.”Kim’s potential appointment is also complicated by the fact that he ran in the competitive Senate Democratic primary against the governor’s wife, Tammy Murphy.Tammy Murphy, who dropped out of the Senate race before primary votes were cast, has also taken herself out of consideration for the temporary Senate appointment.Way was appointed by Murphy to be the state’s lieutenant governor in 2023, one month after the death of the then-lieutenant governor, Sheila Oliver. She is also New Jersey’s Secretary of State.She previously was an administrative law judge for the state of New Jersey. Among her other local New Jersey government roles, in 2006 Way was elected to the Passaic County Board of Chosen Freeholders — a term in the state that was a precursor to what’s now referred to as county commissioners.Campos-Medina is a labor activist who serves as executive director of The Worker Institute at Cornell University. She told Politico that she would be willing to serve if the governor asked.As one of the Democratic candidates who ran in the Senate primary in New Jersey. she came in second in the race, after Kim, with 16 percent of the vote.Salas, who was appointed to her current role in 2011, was floated as a potential Senate contender last year. She’s a former Hispanic Bar Association of New Jersey president and federal magistrate judge.In 2020, Salas and her family were the target of an attack at their home by a self-declared men’s rights activist who had filed a case before Salas. Her son was killed and her husband was critically wounded in an attack. Following the incident, Salas called for tighter restrictions on the personal information of judges.Wells was New Jersey’s Secretary of State from 2006 to 2010 under then-Gov. Jon Corzine (D). She’s married to Ted Wells, a prominent defense attorney who has mentored House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.).Watson Coleman has been in Congress since 2015 and, before that, she served in the New Jersey General Assembly.When asked about the prospect of the Senate appointment, Watson Coleman’s spokesperson, Mike Shanahan, told the New York Times that she “would gladly continue to serve New Jersey in whatever capacity is asked of her.” But Shanahan conceded that the congresswoman “doesn’t expect that call.”"
WaPo_95,"Then-AG Barr’s role in discarded ballots probe was troubling, Justice IG says",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/07/25/william-barr-luzerne-ballots-trump-justice-inspector-general/,2024-07-26 02:46:02.862759,,"The Trump administration’s Justice Department broke with longstanding norms during the 2020 election cycle by publicly commenting on an ongoing investigation into nine military mail-in ballots tossed into a dumpster in Pennsylvania, according to a report released Thursday by the agency’s inspector general.The discarded ballots in Luzerne County became fodder for election conspiracies, with then-President Donald Trump using the investigation to sow doubt into whether the election could be conducted fairly. Trump later relied on such doubts to fuel his false claims that he had defeated Joe Biden in the election — claims he has continued to repeat during his current campaign for the White House.On Sept. 24, 2020, U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania David Freed took the unusual step of stating publicly that federal officials had launched an inquiry into the discarded ballots and that all nine ballots were cast for Trump. His statement was later retracted and amended to say that seven ballots were cast for Trump and the votes of the remaining two were unknown.Then-Attorney General William P. Barr encouraged Freed to make the statement, according to the report issued Thursday, even though Justice Department policy generally prohibits such comments on ongoing, uncharged investigations.The purpose of the policy is to protect the privacy of people who are ultimately not charged with a crime and ensure that cases are only pursued based on evidence that would be allowed in a courtroom.The Justice Department also releases an Election Year Sensitivities Memorandum during major election cycles reminding employees about the seriousness of making statements about election-related investigations during an election year. Barr had issued that memorandum to his employees months before encouraging Freed to make the statement, the report said.Still, the inspector general concluded that Barr did not violate Justice Department policies, citing the “ambiguity regarding the applicability” of those policies. The report notes that the attorney general has the discretion to comment on ongoing criminal investigations “in the interest of the fair administration of justice.”Barr met with Trump before Freed made his statement, according to the report, and told Trump the discarded ballots were votes for him — details that had not yet been made public. The next day, Trump repeated that information on a national radio show.While Barr’s briefing to the president was unusual — there is generally supposed to be a wall between the White House and Justice Department when it comes to criminal investigations to ensure they are not politically motivated — it also didn’t violate the department’s policies, the report said.“Although we were troubled by the investigative facts about the Luzerne County matter that Barr relayed to President Trump in the briefing, we concluded, for reasons described below, that the policy appears to leave it to the Attorney General’s discretion to determine precisely what information can be shared with the President where a communication is permissible under the policy, as we found was the case with Barr’s briefing,” the report states.Freed, however, violated department policy multiple times, the report says, failing to coordinate with the FBI before he issued his statement and making public a letter that he sent to the Luzerne County Bureau of Elections providing more details about the investigation than his statement did.Freed, who was interviewed for the report, said he didn’t think about coordinating with the FBI in this instance since he had been dealing with Barr, the top person in the Justice Department.Barr declined to be interviewed by the inspector general but sent a letter about the investigation, parts of which were included in the report. “I considered this was a matter in which the public interest could likely be best served by getting out in front of the story by recounting the basic facts that prompted the investigation,” Barr wrote.The report was the second issued this week by the inspector general’s office, both dealing with Barr-era controversies that happened nearly four years ago. A report released Wednesday examined the softening of the sentencing recommendation for Trump confidant Roger Stone after he was convicted of lying to Congress.Barr also declined to be interviewed for that report, which called his intervention in the case “extraordinary” but found no evidence of direct interference by Trump.Freed got involved in the case after the Luzerne County district attorney’s office learned that a county elections employee had discarded completed mail-in ballots in a dumpster. The DA’s office said in a public statement at the time that it had discovered “issues with a small number of mail-in ballots” and that federal authorities were now leading the investigation.Barr called Freed twice and “encouraged and authorized” him to issue a statement, including that the ballots were cast for Trump, the report says.Freed’s initial statement suggested that the person who discarded the ballots did so intentionally and could be charged with a crime. But according to the report, Freed and top Justice Department officials knew early on that the suspect had mental health issues and appeared to have discarded the ballots by mistake.In other words, the report says, Freed issued the statement with Barr’s encouragement knowing that the suspect would likely not be criminally charged.“Indeed, the Department determined before Election Day that no charges would be brought in the matter, although it failed to inform the public of that fact until well after the election,” the report states.The report recommends that the Justice Department update its policies to spell out what information employees may include in statements about investigations when they deem a public statement is necessary; and make clear whether the attorney general is exempt from any department policies."
WaPo_96,The 10 best breakfast sandwiches in the D.C. area,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/interactive/2024/best-breakfast-sandwiches-dc-area-review-2024/,2024-07-26 02:45:02.862759,,"Forty-nine years ago, during the sweltering summer of 1975, McDonald’s introduced diners across America to the Egg McMuffin, which quickly became the most famous, if not the first, breakfast sandwich in the land. The dish had been developed a few years earlier by Herb Peterson, a McDonald’s operator in Santa Barbara, Calif., whose savvy extended to a special tool he designed for this morning glory: a Teflon-coated ring that forms the perfectly round egg at the center of the Egg McMuffin.
Ray Kroc, the guy who made McDonald’s a household name, knew the item would be a hit. The Egg McMuffin was originally served open-faced, which Kroc thought kooky. “But then I tasted it, and I was sold,” Kroc wrote in his memoir, “Grinding It Out: The Making of McDonald’s.” “Wow! I wanted to put this item into all of our stores immediately.”
Four short years after its introduction, the Egg McMuffin was already imprinted on the public imagination. Phyllis C. Richman, then food critic for The Washington Post, glowed about the sandwich (and its accompanying oval of crispy hash browns) in a 1979 roundup of fast-food breakfast options.
“McDonald’s isn’t on top of the heap for nothing,” Richman wrote. “Its Egg McMuffin — English muffin, fried egg, cheese and Canadian bacon — and its golden hash browns are high on the list of historic American inventions.”
This project started in earnest in April, when I put out a call on social media for breakfast sandwich suggestions. Within days (hours, actually), I had a working list of more than 60 sandwiches to try. The list would grow as colleagues, chefs and readers sent even more recommendations. By the time I was done in late June, I had sampled more than 90 sandwiches at restaurants, farmers markets, bagel shops, diners, doughnut shops and coffeehouses around the greater D.C. area. As with all guides like this, my top 10 list is an exercise in personal tastes. I selected the sandwiches that not only appealed to my particular palate, but captured my imagination. I stressed over the ones that made the final cut. But I also didn’t get to every place on my list. No doubt I missed one of your favorites. Click here to tell me about it. Who knows where it might lead?
For at least two generations, this fast-food mashup — its English and Canadian influences name-checked in its very ingredients — was America’s idea of a breakfast sandwich, even if we had been consuming handheld stacks in the morning long before the Golden Arches came along. In the 1970s, the Egg McMuffin’s name rolled off our tongues as easily as those CB radio hits that inexplicably dominated the airwaves back then.
A half-century later, the Egg McMuffin has so much more competition, some from chefs who still appreciate the streamlined architecture of this fast-food legend, whose lingering appeal whispers a message to those willing to listen: Don’t overthink things in the morning. Use only a few building blocks, but perfect each one.
As I embarked on this hunt for the best breakfast sandwiches in the D.C. area, I wasn’t exactly conscious of the Egg McMuffin’s influence. I was more interested in learning how chefs had deviated from earlier norms — and how they were using the breakfast sandwich as a way to express themselves and their identity. But an interesting thing happened along the way: Many, if not all, of the sandwiches below ultimately followed the keep-it-simple formula of the Egg McMuffin, which I noticed only after consuming more than 90 specimens to identify the 10 standouts.
The major difference? Most of these 10 sandwiches draw from the rainbow blaze of cultures that make up this country of ours. Some can trace their inspiration back to Mexico. Others to South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Colombia and the Palestinian territories
If Herb Peterson was trying to reimagine eggs Benedict with the Egg McMuffin, some of the chefs here are now trying to redefine this portable meal for a new generation that wants to see itself reflected in the food it eats. These inventions don’t just cross cultures, expanding the flavors available for our morning repast. They confirm a fundamental truth about America: We’re far stronger when we come together, even with just a breakfast sandwich.
As a teenager, Gina Chersevani worked at a bagel shop in the Elmont area of Long Island. The experience left a mark. “I swore that I would never, ever, ever make bagels again,” said Chersevani, founder of Buffalo & Bergen, a growing chain of freewheeling dinettes. “And here I am.” The bagel at the base of her breakfast bandit has a direct connection to her youth: The dough is prepared daily at A&S Bagels in Franklin Square, N.Y., not far from the streets where Chersevani developed a taste for a bagel and schmear. The kitchen at Buffalo & Bergen adds seasonings to the raw dough and bakes every bagel fresh, ready to load for this sloppy, indecent, irresistible sandwich. The Bandit is layered with housemade carnitas, slow-braised with lager and tomatoes, followed by avocado, manchego cheese and a fried egg, its yolk set to pop. A trio of pickled hot peppers — Fresno, poblano, jalapeño — cuts the richness like a hot knife through butter, adding equal parts acid and heat. Your choice of bagel is important: An everything round can lend a bitter edge to the Bandit. Chersevani prefers an onion bagel, and once again, she’s right on the mark.

One of Javier Fernandez’s favorite dishes as a child was the bistek his mother made. For her beef, Gwen Fernandez relied on the grilled rib-eye that her husband would bring home from his job as a personal chef in Bethesda. It added an unmistakable smokiness to a Philippine dish that traditionally leans on soy sauce, calamansi juice and sauteed onions for flavor. Javier considers his mom’s bistek last-meal-on-earth good. At Lapu Lapu in the Kentlands neighborhood of Gaithersburg, the chef has developed a version that’s not just a nod to his mom; it’s a riff on something perhaps more familiar to Americans: the Philly cheesesteak.
“When you think about it,” Javier Fernandez says about the word “bistek,” “it’s almost like saying ‘beef steak.’” Perhaps you think eating a cheesesteak in the morning is a crime against breakfast? Let me disabuse you of that idea. This preparation — sliced rib-eye braised in soy sauce, beef bouillon and lemon juice, then tricked out with lettuce, pickled red onions, white American cheese sauce, garlic-adobo mayo and a sunny-side-up egg on a pandesal bun — is steak and eggs of the finest order. Even if Fernandez’s mother doesn’t agree. “She likes hers more,” the chef says.

The shattering crackle of bacon. This sensuous pleasure — the sound and the fury of teeth against crispy pork belly — shouldn’t come as a surprise, but it does when you bite into this bacon, egg and cheese beauty from Meats and Foods, the cramped custom-sausage shop in Shaw. Years of experience have trained my brain to expect bacon to release from a breakfast sandwich in one long, rubbery strip, perhaps dragging other ingredients along the way, like a drowning victim.
Scott McIntosh and Ana Marin, the husband-and-wife partners behind the business, employ a multistep process to ensure their bacon renders into strips that crack and rattle with the force of good brittle. They cure and smoke their own pork belly, but here’s the key: The couple slices the bacon thin, then crisps up the strips on a flattop before finishing them in the oven. When piled onto the bottom half of a housemade biscuit — built with three types of flour and lard — the bacon realizes every single gram of its potential. You remember why you fell for bacon in the first place. Now the bad news: This biscuit-based sandwich is available on Sundays only, though you can order it on a roll other days.

About a year ago, a customer approached Cagla Onal-Urel to ask whether the chef and owner of Georgetown’s Green Almond Pantry could whip up a quick breakfast sandwich. Looking at her available ingredients, Onal-Urel fried up a pair of eggs — loose enough for the yolks to release their nectar at the slightest prick. She paired the eggs with pesto and smoked Gouda, all layered between slices of the chef’s housemade focaccia, which occupies this gossamer space between air and Earth’s crust. The customer returned, the chef recalls, and “said that that was the best sandwich she ever had, but it was like, maybe she was just hungry.”
The anecdote reminds me of what I admire about Green Almond and its perpetually worried founder: Her ego never seems to catch up to her creativity. Her palate is impeccable, and this sandwich, now a permanent fixture here, shows off her skill at coaxing flavor from just a few ingredients, including her bread, which radiates rosemary and garlic even though you’d be hard-pressed to find traces of either on the focaccia. The bonus? The sandwich comes with cut tomatoes, to pop at your pleasure, a reminder of how Onal-Urel used to eat breakfast in her native Turkey.

For a hot minute, I considered adding a breakfast taco to this list, partly because I love them but mostly because I had an opening: In May, an Indiana judge ruled tacos are “Mexican-style sandwiches” in a Fort Wayne, Ind., zoning battle. In the end, though, I understood that tacos inhabit their own world. Besides, I had another Mexican option: the breakfast sope at Taco Bamba, the rapidly expanding chain from chef Victor Albisu. Sopes are their own thing, too, I suppose, but in this particular case, I am the judge and jury. I ruled that this elongated masa cake — slathered with refried beans; sprinkled with chorizo and cotija cheese; topped with pickled jalapeños and avocado; drizzled with crema; and made complete with a fried egg, its yolk still wobbly — is an open-faced breakfast sandwich. One that I would eat anytime — and can because Taco Bamba serves it all day. After talking to Albisu, I learned there’s an unidentified element smuggled onto his sope: a salsa verde, blended from roasted tomatillos, pickled jalapeños and cilantro. It’s available only on the chef’s sope, a singular breakfast sandwich by any measure — and any name.

Katsuya Fukushima lived for a spell in New York, where he learned that the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich is the spark that jump-starts the city every morning. He wanted to create his own version of the bodega classic, but within the conceptual boundaries of Tonari, the Penn Quarter restaurant where the chef injects Japanese flavors into pizza and pasta as part of a cuisine known as wafu Italian. Fukushima tried some of the obvious subs for bacon — prosciutto and mortadella among them — but it wasn’t until he landed on pepperoni that he found a meat that clicked. The kitchen warms the pepperoni just enough to release its oil and aromatics, which envelop the soft curds of the Jacques Pépin-style omelet at the center of this weekend-only sandwich. The finishing touches are a housemade condiment — part tonkatsu sauce, part mayo, part ketchup — and a slice of Kraft American cheese. Fukushima makes no apologies for the processed cheese or ketchup. “I love ketchup over eggs, so I wanted to sneak that into it.” Then he laughs, amused by the secret that all good chefs keep: Delicious ingredients come in many forms.

In Paul Carlson’s memory, his mom made arepas all the time when he was a boy. Sometimes — maybe when she was homesick or just wanted to give her children a taste of her native Colombia — Gloria Carlson would serve the corn cakes as part of a breakfast spread with avocado, fried eggs and fresh, crumbly costeño cheese. Some assembly was required. When the Carlson family — Gloria and her husband, Ronald; Paul and his sister, Katrina — opened Royal in LeDroit Park in 2015, they paid homage to Gloria’s Colombian foodways with, among other plates, this breakfast arepa, already stuffed for your convenience.
This arepa is unlike any other cradle for a breakfast sandwich; its griddled exterior ruptures with a kind of waxy crackle, revealing softer, lusher ingredients inside the cake: avocado, cotija cheese, a slice of tomato and a fried runny egg. The grace note here is the ají, a condiment common to every Colombian household. Royal’s ají is assembled with cilantro, vinegar, scallions, tomatoes and a wee bit of chili to electrify every bite. Add it liberally to your egg arepa and notice how it comes alive.

When done right, the Taiwanese scallion pancake is one of life’s great pleasures, a street snack that revels in both texture and the sweet, deeply savory aroma of warm green onions. Rosie Nguyen is not Taiwanese. She’s a Vietnamese American who grew up in Philadelphia, but her Rose Ave Bakery in Woodley Park seeks inspiration throughout Asia to reimagine doughnuts, pastries and, yes, breakfast sandwiches. Her scallion, egg and cheese sandwich can trace its roots back to Taiwan, but only after a layover in France.
After she has laminated the dough for her croissant, she will sprinkle fresh scallions, garlic powder, salt and pepper while rolling out the sheets, so that the seasonings and green onions infiltrate every layer. Once the croissant is baked, Nguyen will coat the pastry with butter and toss it with fried garlic, furikake and more seasonings. A thick brick of baked eggs, topped with cheddar, is tucked into this Taiwanese-inspired croissant. When you take that first bite, you’re showered with buttery shards, the errant flakes of a croissant facing imminent destruction. You’re also left with an unmistakable impression: This is one ingenious breakfast sandwich.

The Egg Drop chain — or EGGDROP, as the South Korean company prefers to holler its name — has been around for just seven years. But in that time, Egg Drop has become a cultural phenomenon in Korea and beyond, opening hundreds of shops that specialize in diner-style sandwiches served between thick slices of brioche, everything sprinkled with granulated sugar, not unlike the Korean hot dogs now rolling through America. Danny Lee — one half of the team responsible for the hot, heavenly mess that is Capitol Hill’s I Egg You — finally tried an Egg Drop sandwich in Korea last year after scrutinizing photos on social media, wondering where these bites rate on a spectrum between toothsome and nasty. He was blown away, enough so that he built his own version. His interpretation, dubbed DL’s Egg Drop, leans into marinated bulgogi meat, the Korean barbecue staple that always activates a drool response. The thin ribbons of beef are paired with a fontina cheese egg scramble, chives and a spicy gochujang aioli that balances out the sweet, toasted milk bread that holds the sandwich together. Barely holds it together, I should say. To eat this beast, you’ll need a fork to chase down every last morsel.

Before the pandemic, when Albi chef and owner Michael Rafidi was sketching out plans for a casual daytime cafe, he envisioned a place where diners could luxuriate over a traditional Middle Eastern breakfast. Maybe a spread of hummus, labneh, olive oil, meat pies and lots of warm pita bread to dip into the sundry bowls. Such a feast, of course, would require time around a table with friends, an everyday indulgence that was cut short when covid-19 entered our lives. Out of necessity, Rafidi’s Yellow cafe instead embraced our American obsession with grab-and-go breakfast fare, snacks custom-built for a society too stressed out to stop and smell the hummus. But Rafidi found ways to inject Palestinian flavors into his morning pastries and sandwiches, none more successful than his za’atar egg croissant at the Yellow cafes in Georgetown and Union Market. This striking specimen of the sandwich-making craft so thoroughly smothers a croissant in za’atar that you’d be hard-pressed to realize there’s a pastry underneath that tight sweater of herbs and spices. The kitchen tucks smoked piquillo and pickled Fresno peppers into the croissant before adding a sunny-side-up egg and labneh. The sandwich exudes smoke. It provokes curiosity. It radiates innovation and identity. It’s clearly the best breakfast sandwich out there.

WaPo_97,Watergate residents irked by their temporary neighbor: Netanyahu,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/25/watergate-residents-security-netanyahu/,2024-07-26 02:34:02.862759,,"A car wove between the looming black fences and concrete street barricades that stretched for blocks to reach the white tent. Beneath the canopy, a car stopped so one police officer could search the trunk while another popped open the hood. A third questioned the driver while a fourth lead a police dog around the vehicle.For the hundreds of residents, guests, employees and business owners at the storied Watergate complex in D.C., this is what entering and exiting their home or place of work this week looks like. Their routines have been upended by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s stay at the Watergate Hotel and — whether it be because of political disagreements or daily inconveniences — many are upset the hotel allowed the embattled world leader to stay at the complex.Resident Lisa-Joy Zgorski, 59, said the Watergate is no stranger to VIP guests. In fact, her neighbors used to include Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and former Senate majority leader Robert J. Dole. She remembered President Biden coming to pay Dole a visit, but said she could not remember the complex or law enforcement ever going to this length to protect a visitor.“The political pursuits that are embodied in the visit are on the backs on those of us thousands of Americans that live or work in or around the Watergate,” Zgorski said.Netanyahu arrived in Washington this week and addressed a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday as his government approaches its tenth month of war in Gaza. Dozens of lawmakers refused to attend his speech, in which he brushed off criticisms that the Israel’s government has committed war crimes. His presence in Washington has been met with mass protests condemning the Israeli leader’s “genocide” against Palestinians.In addition to assembling near Union Station and inside the rotunda of the Cannon House Office Building, demonstrators gathered outside the Watergate and some claimed to be responsible for releasing swarms of maggots, mealworms and crickets at the hotel Tuesday night.By Wednesday evening, at least 30 police vehicles lined the streets near the complex. Both D.C. police and Secret Service officers stood guard. One passerby asked a nearby police officer which roads were closed.“All of them,” the officer replied. “Avoid the area at all costs.”Among the street closures were parts of Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway, Virginia Avenue, Jamal Khashoggi Way, F Street and 27th Street, according to a D.C. police press release.Residents received an email Thursday stating that, because of an extension to Netanyahu’s stay, the fencing and barricades will remain up until Sunday — meaning the heightened security will have lasted an entire week.The historic Watergate complex, best known for housing the Democratic National Committee office where burglars connected to President Richard M. Nixon’s reelection campaign were caught bugging the offices, consists of six buildings. The 10 acres include the five-star hotel, three luxury apartment buildings and two office buildings. The complex has its own restaurants, bakery, dry cleaner and salon.Public safety officials said some portions of the complex have remained open for businesses, residences and guests, potentially explaining how people were able to enter the hotel to release vermin and pull fire alarms in the building in protest on Tuesday.But the area has generally been under tight security this week. Residents of the Watergate complex said U.S. Secret Service and D.C. police set up checkpoints over the weekend to vet anyone entering the property.Zgorski took her car Sunday to pick up a prescription for her mother, who lives with her. She said she was stopped three times when trying to reenter the complex.Since then, things have only worsened, she said. She has had to cancel her mother’s physical therapy appointments and, after hearing from a colleague whose commute tripled due to the road closures, has spent the week working from home. She said she wondered why the hundreds of Watergate residents could use Zoom to do their work but Netanyahu could not.She said residents of Watergate South, Zgorski’s apartment building, did not receive word from Watergate management of any heightened security until Sunday, when the barricades had already been erected.Representatives for Watergate apartments and the hotel did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.Zgorski acknowledges that living in D.C. often means tolerating street closures for motorcades or heightened security to protect foreign dignitaries.“I don’t want to convey that we at the Watergate are a bunch of whiners, especially because these are minor inconveniences compared to everything else going on in the world.”However, she said feels much more upset at the complex for sacrificing its residents’ peace for a polarizing figure  than she did about any interruptions caused by the NATO summit earlier in the month.“It would have felt differently to undergo this much security for 28 world leaders engaging in peacekeeping, engaging in preserving traditions and moving forward and solving issues than it does protecting one of the world’s most controversial figures,” Zgorski said.For other residents, the heightened security measures has posed accessibility issues. Patricia Broderick, 74, said she had to wheel her wheelchair nearly three blocks from where she parked her car to reach the security checkpoint. Even then, she said the security checkpoint was not wheelchair accessible.Although there were only a couple steps for officers to lift Broderick’s wheelchair down, she said “one step for a wheelchair might as well be Mount Everest.”Broderick said she felt “captive” inside the complex. She made it clear she did not blame any of the protesters for exercising their rights. However, she said she wished she felt confident she could leave her home and be able to return without relying on others to assist her.“Why is their right to protest — which I fully agree they have — higher than my right to my home?” Broderick said.Broderick said she understood the need for security but wished the complex had taken steps to mitigate disruptions to residents’ lives, especially those with health conditions.“I understand the risk and I appreciate the measures being taken,” Broderick said. “I can live with all the noise and I can live with security but I can’t live with not being able to go home. And right now I’m afraid to leave my house.”"
WaPo_98,"For returning Commanders, a new regime is ‘what a lot of guys needed’",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/25/phidarian-mathis-john-ridgeway-commanders/,2024-07-26 02:24:02.862759,,"For more than 12 hours on Monday, Phidarian Mathis sat in a small regional airport near his hometown of Wisner, La., praying a flight — any flight — would get him closer to the D.C. area. The global IT outages that canceled thousands of flights worldwide cost Mathis an easy trip east and left him scrambling while on deadline.The Commanders’ third-year defensive tackle had to be at the team’s facility for the start of training camp, the team’s first under new coach Dan Quinn. Check-in started at 11 a.m. Tuesday and the first team meeting began at 1 p.m.Mathis wasn’t willing to risk anything, so after finally getting on a flight to Atlanta and then another to Roanoke, he hopped in a car and drove the remaining 225 miles to Ashburn, arriving around 3 a.m.“I just had to get here on time,” he said. “I didn't want to be late on the first day.”Mathis may have been groggy, but his circuitous journey spoke volumes to Quinn.“I think that shows where he’s at in terms of how badly he wants to make his mark and to make an impression,” the coach said. “He would’ve been here on time — probably would’ve gotten here at 11:30 that morning. He wasn’t having it. He wasn’t leaving anything to chance.”Mathis and other returning players who experienced the ups and downs of the last couple of seasons in Washington are starting anew with Quinn and his staff. Many have lauded the “energy” around the team and the competition on the field.But the clean slate also means some of the 43 players who spent at least part of last season with the Commanders have to prove themselves all over again to earn their spots and a future in the new scheme.“I feel like everything's on the line right now, especially for me basically missing two years,” Mathis said. “So I got to take care of my body, try to be healthy and stay on the field, because I just want to contribute.”Mathis, a second-round pick out of Alabama in 2022, lost his entire rookie season to a knee injury, then missed more time last season because of a calf injury. He played 10 games in 2023 but averaged only 19 defensive snaps and recorded a total of eight tackles.The road back was physically and mentally trying, he said, noting how he gets emotional even thinking about the last two seasons. But he expects this year to be different, in part because of his offseason, which he described as his best as a professional. Mathis worked with veteran defensive linemen around the league, including Green Bay Packers defensive end Rashan Gary. The two trained together at Sports Academy at The Star in Frisco, Tex., giving Mathis a chance to draw from Gary’s regimen and pick his brain about his approach to the position.Mathis’s goal for 2024 is simple.“I'm going to dedicate this year just to proving all the haters wrong and why they really brought me here in the first place,” he said.Fellow Commanders defensive tackle John Ridgeway, who played for Quinn briefly in Dallas before Washington signed him in 2022, feels similarly, and found his own way to stand out: by slimming down.Ridgeway dropped nearly 20 pounds since offseason practices to improve his conditioning and find more ways to get on the field, especially on third downs.“I’m a big fan of Italian food, so I try not to eat that as much,” he said. “And when I did eat, I just made sure I had a big plate of chicken or red meat and a little bit of carbs or vegetables. It’s kind of like a carnivore diet a little bit. I still try to enjoy stuff. But I tried to eat clean and get on the treadmill.”No more McDonald’s. No more Five Guys. What he gets instead is about 45 minutes of walking at a 3.5 mph clip on a level 10 incline to burn close to 500 calories a workout.“Action Bronson does that stuff,” Ridgeway said of the rapper, chef and TV personality. “He was a big dude and lost a bunch of weight, so I said, 'Let me try it.'”Ridgeway’s methods worked; he was down to around 318 pounds at the start of training camp after starting OTAs at 338.Although it took him some time to get his footing with his new size, Ridgeway said he notices a difference on the field, which he hopes will lead to more playing time on third downs and consideration for a bigger contract when his rookie deal expires in 2026.“Those guys are thirsty,” Commanders defensive line coach Darryl Tapp said. “I couldn't be happier with Phil and with Ridgeway, and even with Daron [Payne] and Jon [Allen]. Being older guys, they've done a lot of things in this league. They have a beginner's mindset too. They're not too big for the moment we're in right now.”The players, he said, have accepted Washington’s new philosophy and want to be taught.Tapp’s teachings can be seen and heard. In individual pass-rushing drills during the early portion of Thursday’s practice, Tapp instructed Ridgeway on his hand placement, and assistant defensive line coach Sharrif Floyd adjusted Ridgeway’s feet in his four-point stance.Ridgeway has length and power, Tapp said, but some finesse could make him even more effective. The slight tweaks to Ridgeway’s hands and feet created a significant difference from rep to rep as he pushed back a teammate, who was standing in as an offensive lineman, with seeming ease.A teaching moment on the D-Line: In between these two reps from John Ridgeway, DL coach Darryl Tapp showed him a technique with his hand placement and asst. DL coach Sharrif Floyd adjusted his feet. You see the difference immediately. pic.twitter.com/JD3fiu4hqMThose smaller details could be critical for Ridgeway, who became a key piece of Washington’s defensive line rotation last season but starts anew with Quinn this season — while also chasing his first career sack.Mathis knows the feeling.“I just really feel like this is what a lot of guys needed, especially myself,” he said. “Just a new coaching staff that really just pushes us, man. I think they bring it all out of us. They make it exciting to be here every day. You can tell there’s a new standard around here.”"
WaPo_99,Did JD Vance say women should stay in abusive marriages?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/power/2024/07/25/jd-vance-marriage-abuse-comment/,2024-07-26 02:07:02.862759,,"Depending on how online you are, you might have seen a claim related to JD Vance on the social media account of your favorite feminist or left-leaning activist: that the Republican vice-presidential nominee believes women should stay in marriages with men who abuse them. This week, the allegation got a boost from Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear (D), who told CNN hosts: “He suggests that women should stay in abusive relationships. Listen, a domestic abuser isn’t a man, he’s a monster.”Is the claim true? Did Vance say that? “Suggest” is a vague word that can cover anything from an assertion to an implication to a wink. It’s worth unpacking exactly what comments on the subject Vance has, or hasn’t, made.Let’s get some context:Every “JD defends domestic violence” claim I’ve seen has linked back to remarks he made in 2021 at a Christian high school in Southern California. Speaking on the evolution of no-fault divorce, Vance told the audience: “This is one of the great tricks that I think the sexual revolution pulled on the American populace, which is the idea that, like, ‘Well, okay, these marriages were fundamentally, you know, they were maybe even violent, but certainly they were unhappy. And so getting rid of them and making it easier for people to shift spouses like they change their underwear, that’s going to make people happier in the long term.’” He went on to speculate that, “maybe it worked out for the moms and dads, though I’m skeptical. But it really didn’t work out for the kids of those marriages.”The even violent clause is the one that perked listeners’ ears. Certainly, couples of all political persuasions have decided to gut out unsatisfying marriages for the sake of the children. But encouraging spouses to remain in a union that is dangerous rather than merely disappointing is where reasonable people draw the line.Let’s get some more context:It’s both surprising and not surprising that Vance might have a confused perspective on healthy marriages. The entire point of his 2016 bestseller “Hillbilly Elegy” is that he was raised in a dysfunctional family. His grandparents’ relationship is affectionately euphemized as “chaotic,” but the anecdotes he recounts are downright scary. He describes how his mother and aunt used to play a game as children of watching their father come home from work and park his car in the driveway. If he parked normally, all was well. But if the car was askew, it meant he was drunk, and the night would be bad: “Sometimes they’d run out the backdoor and stay with Mamaw’s friends.”As for his grandmother, Vance writes that after one “particularly violent night,” Mamaw warned her husband that she would kill him if he came home drunk again. A week later when he did, she poured gasoline over his sleeping body and lit a match. He escaped with minor burns.Vance portrays his grandparents as equally at fault for their volatile relationship (“Mamaw,” he writes, “devoted herself to making his drunken life a living hell.”) The scenarios he describes, though, don’t sound to me like an ornery woman giving as good as she got. They sound more like a desperate woman trying to stop the violence perpetuated by her alcoholic spouse, by whatever means she can think of. Are her strategies good ones? Absolutely not. A better strategy might have been for her to leave the man, but Vance seems to think that would have been wrong. “They never got divorced,” he approvingly told the high school audience in 2021. “They were together to the end, till death do us part.”His grandparents aren’t the only example of domestic violence in “Hillbilly Elegy.” Vance writes that his sister, Lindsay, describes seeing their biological father “push Mom aggressively.” But, he says, his father denied physical abuse. “I suspect that they were physically abusive to each other the way that Mom and most of her men were,” Vance eventually adjudicates: “a bit of pushing, some plate-throwing, but nothing more.”In addition to the eyebrow-raising assertion that “a bit of pushing” is no big deal, I’ll note something else: As with Mamaw and Papaw, Vance seems to view his parents’ alleged domestic violence as a both-sides problem. So what if Lindsay says she saw their dad push their mom? he seems to be asking. Their mom probably pushed him, too. That’s not true assault, that’s just … passion? Messiness? Hillbilly-ing?However he would define it, Vance seems to differentiate between this familial behavior — you come home drunk, I light you on fire — and what he views as more serious infractions. He writes that his aunt Lori ended up in an “abusive marriage,” and rather than suggest she should have stayed in it, he praises Mamaw and Papaw for helping her escape.Vance has repeatedly said that his 2021 remarks were taken out of context. “I have seen siblings, wives, daughters, and myself abused by men,” he told Vice in 2022. “It’s disgusting for you to argue that I was defending those men.”And so I wonder whether some of the distance between what Vance thought he was describing and what liberal listeners heard is due to a discrepancy that Vance himself perceives between “actual” abuse — in his mind, the horrid kind that might send a woman like Aunt Lori rightfully fleeing from her husband — and mere “chaos” — in his mind, the kind where both men and women end up being violent, but honoring marital vows is the goal that should supersede all others.Vance didn’t say he was talking about violent men, he says he was talking about violent marriages. He doesn’t say that women should stay behind, he said that couples should stay together — that till-death-to-us-part should bind us all. It sounds more like he was advocating for equal-opportunity misery, bizarre and misguided as that might be.I’m not saying this is logic that any sentient person should accept, and I had to break my brain a little to get there. But if I’m trying to imagine Vance’s brain, I don’t think he thinks  that women, specifically, should stay in marriages in which they are brutalized.Now. Let’s have even more context.The fact of the matter is that domestic violence disproportionately affects women. In the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s most recent National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, researchers found that 32.5 percent of women and 24.6 percent of men were victims of “severe physical violence” from a partner in their lifetime. The subcategories provide a more sobering gap. While about the same proportion of women and men (18.9 percent vs. 16.9 percent) report being “hit by a fist or something hard,” three times more women than men report being threatened with a gun. Three times more women than men report being beaten. Four times more women than men report being choked or suffocated. Twenty times more women than men report being raped. And, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, women are five times more likely than men to be killed by an intimate partner.So, when Vance says that people should be more willing to stay in “even violent” marriages, he is de facto saying that women should be willing to stay, simply because women are the ones who more often experience the violence. Statistically, it’s not a both-sides issue, it’s a much-more-often-this-side issue.The other fact of the matter is that divorces are overwhelmingly — 70 percent of the time, according to a 2017 Stanford study — instigated by women. The researcher who conducted the study didn’t know why this was the case, since breakups between nonmarried heterosexual couples are evenly instigated. He speculated that “marriage as an institution has been a little bit slow to catch up with expectations for gender equality.” He wondered whether married women might, in part, just get tired of being expected to do the bulk of the housework and child care.So, again, when Vance says that people shouldn’t divorce just because they’re unhappy, he’s de facto speaking to women. Because women are the ones who are unhappy enough to want to leave.Add to this the fact that ending no-fault divorce has become a pet project of certain right-wing figures and that many women hear it as a dog whistle for supporting misogyny. See, for example, podcaster Steven Crowder, who became vocal on the subject when his own wife left him. Later, alleged footage leaked of Crowder berating his then-pregnant wife, yelling at her for failing to “respect men” and behave in a sufficiently “wifely” way.Add into it the fact that the Republican Party has been busily working to curtail women’s rights on multiple fronts: abortion, access to birth control, etc.When listeners heard and reacted to Vance’s comments, that is the context they were bringing into it. Even violent is not a concept that exists in a vacuum. It’s a concept that exists in the context of all in which you live and what came before you. Do you think you just fell out of a coconut tree?Back to our original question: Did Vance say that women should stay in violent marriages?The short answer is that he didn’t.The longer answer is that he did, in the sense that women represent one-half of the heterosexual couples that he was jointly sentencing to misery.The even longer answer is that it’s complicated, and requires more of a knowledge of statistics and sociology than Vance might have had on hand at the moment he made those comments — although, frankly, how much knowledge do you need to have to understand that intimate partner violence is a major issue for women? An aspiring senator, as Vance was at the time, should know that.The final answer is that if I were him, I would address the matter head-on now. I would explain in detail exactly whatever it was that I was trying to say. I sense that his answer (He just meant pushing was okay, not hitting? He has categories of acceptable violence?) would be ... uh ... illuminating.Anyway. If I were Vance, would clarify what I said. And then I would apologize for what I implied."

WaPo_101,Polls show some good early signs for Kamala Harris,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/25/harris-polls-trump-young-black-hispanic-voters/,2024-07-26 03:58:02.815182,,"Welcome to The Campaign Moment, your guide to the biggest developments in a stubborn 2024 race that’s showing some signs of being shaken up.(Make sure you’re subscribed to this newsletter here. And also listen to Campaign Moment podcast at Apple Podcasts, Spotify and elsewhere. We had a brand-new episode Wednesday on Kamala Harris’s VP search!)It’s the question that’s been on everyone’s minds since 1:46 p.m. Eastern time Sunday: How much did the 2024 election actually just change?A literal criminal conviction of one of the candidates, after all, had a muted impact. And President Biden’s stumbling June 27 debate performance appeared to move the needle only slightly against him — often within polls’ margin of error.Well, we’ve now got some real data on the race, post-Biden’s exit from the presidential contest. And the short answer is: The switch to Vice President Harris appears to have improved Democrats’ chances modestly. But it’s still very early to draw too many conclusions.On the plus side for Harris, she appears to be pulling in some key, Democratic-leaning voters groups that had soured on a Biden-led Democratic ticket, and her poor image seems to have improved. She’s also gained at least somewhat in most polls. On the plus side for Trump, his image numbers appear as good as they’ve been in a long time, potentially narrowing Harris’s opening.The toplinesWhile an NPR/PBS/Marist College poll showed a slight gain for Trump, three others this week showed the Democratic ticket gaining at least a few points. Democrats gained four points in a Reuters/Ipsos poll, three points in a CNN poll Wednesday and five points in a New York Times/Siena College poll Thursday.All show the national race is now neck-and-neck — between a three-point Trump lead and a two-point Harris lead.The Marist poll was probably a bit of an outlier at the time — it actually showed Biden ahead by two points earlier this month — and it’s worth noting that the pollster changed its methods for the quick-turnaround poll. So the results aren’t strictly comparable. The other surveys, meanwhile, suggest some movement toward Harris.And those aren’t the only encouraging signs for Harris and the Democrats.The key groupsOne of the big ones is young voters. The CNN poll showed the Democratic ticket gaining five points among voters under 30 since April and June. The Times/Siena poll showed it gaining 11 points since earlier this month. The Marist poll showed fewer young people ditching the ticket for third-party candidates in a crowded race.Another is Black and Latino voters. The CNN poll showed Democrats gaining seven and six points with those groups, respectively. The Marist poll showed Trump’s vote share among non-White voters dropping by eight points. (But the Times/Siena poll actually showed Trump gaining among Black voters.)These are important numbers, because these were perhaps the three most troubling groups for a Biden-led Democratic ticket. The groups have favored Democrats by substantial margins for decades, but Biden was performing historically poorly among them. And notably, the Marist poll showed significant increases in enthusiasm among all three — higher than most any other group.Beyond that, Harris appears to have gained some popularity. The Reuters/Ipsos poll showed her image going from 14 points underwater (39 percent favorable, 53 percent unfavorable) last week to just six points underwater (44 to 50). The Times/Siena poll showed her favorable rating rising 10 points since February. And the CNN poll showed her with her highest favorable rating since 2021.The caveatsBut even that latter number was far from sterling — 39 percent favorable vs. 52 percent unfavorable. For all the Democratic talk about the game being changed, they still have a likely nominee who is more disliked than liked in all of these polls.There are also conflicting findings on how older and White voters might have shifted, raising the possibility that Harris could lose ground with some voters while gaining with others.And in the meantime, Trump’s own image appears to be improving. The CNN poll (43 percent favorable) and a recent ABC News/Ipsos poll (40 percent) showed more Americans had a favorable opinion of Trump than at any point since 2020. And a Quinnipiac University poll (46 percent) showed that number higher than at any point since Trump launched his first campaign in 2015.It’s possible that’s temporary and owes to the recent assassination attempt and last week’s Republican National Convention. (Conventions usually provide a boost.) But so too is it possible that Harris is benefiting from her own honeymoon period that might not hold up over time as scrutiny increases — particularly of the left-wing policies she embraced in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries.If there’s a plus side for Harris, it’s that she’s less defined and has more room for growth. For now, she’s benefited from that and appears to have expanded the appeal of the Democratic ticket. Democrats have gone from fearing that 2024 is lost to at least having reason to believe.But the 2024 script has proven difficult to rewrite before. And we’re dealing with lots of significant factors converging all at once. That means it’ll take some time to shake out.There has been debate within the Democratic Party about just how much they should feature Trump’s criminal conviction, which as noted doesn’t appear to have impacted the race much thus far.The early signs are that Harris intends to drive it home early and often:NEW: We just launched the first video of our campaign.“We choose freedom.”pic.twitter.com/AJ2WCAupRtWhile Biden made reference to Trump’s conviction at times, and the campaign even ran some advertising featuring it, it hasn’t been a huge centerpiece of the campaign so far.Harris stepping forward could change the dynamic somewhat. She’s more active on the campaign trail, for one. But more than that, it’s arguably a better line of attack with a former prosecutor atop the ticket and given these issues were somewhat uneasy for Biden to talk about, possibly due to his son’s own recent conviction.29 percent, 32 percent, 33 percentThose are the percentages of respondents who said Biden should resign from the presidency right now in the CNN, Marist and Reuters/Ipsos polls. In each, around twice as many or more said he should stay.That’s notable for a couple reasons.One is that after Biden pulled out, Republicans set about arguing that he must resign, too. Another is that a huge majority of Americans have said for a long time that Biden is too old and not mentally sharp enough to serve as president.The lesson: Americans seem to see a difference between Biden not being up to the job for four more years and being able to serve out the next six months.It’s also, notably, far lower than the percentage of Americans who said Trump should resign at various points in his presidency. After Jan. 6, as many as 53 percent of Americans said Trump should resign. And half said he should resign early in his term, amid allegations of sexual harassment."
WaPo_102,"Chipotle promises ‘generous portions,’ denying shrinkflation claims",https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2024/07/25/chipotle-shrinkflation-bowl-tiktok-burrito/,2024-07-26 03:59:02.815182,,"Chipotle Mexican Grill’s CEO on Wednesday denied social media rumors that the company has quietly shrunk its portion sizes while keeping prices the same.CEO Brian Niccol told shareholders that the company is committed to “generous portions,” rebutting accusations by people on TikTok and other sites that its burritos and bowls have gotten smaller. Rumors even swirled online that the company directed its employees to serve up bigger scoops if they saw a customer recording their work.“I want to take a minute to address the portion concerns that have been brought up in social media,” Niccol said. “There was never a directive to provide less to our customers. Generous portions is a core brand equity of Chipotle. It always has been and always will be.”Since opening in 1993, Chipotle has been the target of eaters seeking ways to game its assembly line for bigger bowls and burritos, from batting their lashes at employees to changing up the sequence of ingredients in their orders.A new phenomenon has complicated the game for those trying to maximize their caloric yield.Over the last few years and across industries, consumers have become more attuned to — and irritated by — “shrinkflation.” That happens when companies quietly cut the size of products but don’t reduce their prices.Niccol reiterated during Chipotle’s second-quarter shareholder meeting this week that the company is committed to “generous” portions in its burritos and bowls. He showed that by using the word four times in 88 seconds.The internet criticism had been swelling for months, but it reached a new level when wildly popular internet food reviewer Keith Lee, a onetime Chipotle collaborator, backed the burrito-bowl betrayal claims.Lee has earned 16.4 million TikTok followers by traveling around the country to review restaurants. Many have benefited from a jump in popularity dubbed the “Keith Lee effect.”Lee collaborated with Chipotle to introduce the “Keithadilla” last year. But his stance shifted in a TikTok review he posted May 3.“I used to love Chipotle,” he began by saying. “Lately, Chipotle has not hit the same, in my opinion.” He went on to dig through his chicken bowl and found little poultry. “See, I don’t see no chicken at all,” he said. He even rated his formerly favorite steak quesadilla a 2½ out of 10, saying it “tastes like Steak-umms.”Some people made their displeasure known by leaving one-star reviews on Chipotle’s app. Others took it to the streets, posting videos of themselves starting an order but walking out of the restaurant midway if they felt they weren’t getting their money’s worth.Niccol told investors that the backlash prompted soul-searching. He said the company, which has 3,500 restaurants, will retrain staff at locations where customer surveys showed inappropriate servings.“We have also leaned in and reemphasized generous portions across all of our restaurants, as it is a core brand equity of Chipotle,” Niccol told investors. “Our guests expect this now more than ever, and we are committed to making this investment to reinforce that Chipotle stands for a generous amount of delicious, fresh food at fair prices for every customer, every visit.”Customers have already responded positively to the changes in surveys, he said.“We still continue to listen to and treasure our guests to earn every transaction,” Niccol said."

U.S. officials have offered a $10 million reward for information leading to his capture.Officials say the Rim case is just the latest example of a kind of hybrid crime model that North Korea uses to engage in espionage — conducting for-profit cyberattacks and using the money from those crimes to fund further hacking and data thefts from sensitive targets that could help North Korea’s military and nuclear ambitions.In the ransomware scheme, Rim allegedly encrypted files on the computers of a Kansas hospital, among other businesses, and then demanded large payments so the organizations could regain control of their files.That ransom money, in turn, “funded the Conspirators’ computer intrusions into government agencies, military bases, and companies supporting the military, including with missile, aerospace, and uranium processing technology,” an indictment filed Wednesday in Kansas charges.In February 2022, Rim and his co-conspirators were able to gain and retain access “for more than three months to NASA’s computer system, specifically the portal for its Office of Inspector General, and extracted over seventeen gigabytes of unclassified data,” according to the indictment.U.S. authorities allege that Rim and his associates also hacked into Randolph Air Force Base in Texas, Robins Air Force Base in Georgia, and defense companies in the United States and South Korea.U.S. officials said they have seized dozens of accounts used in the alleged scheme, which together held more than $600,000 in virtual currency. That money will be returned to victims, law enforcement officials said."

WaPo_107,Who could replace Sen. Bob Menendez of N.J. after his resignation?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/25/bob-menendez-senate-seat-replacement-new-jersey/,2024-07-26 03:00:02.815182,,"Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) announced Tuesday that he plans to resign effective Aug. 20, creating a Senate vacancy in the wake of his federal bribery conviction.New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) subsequently said he plans to exercise his duty as the state’s governor to make a temporary appointment to fill the Senate vacancy “to ensure the people of New Jersey have the representation they deserve.”At a news conference on Wednesday, the governor called Menendez’s resignation “a sad end to what was a very productive career in public service.”Senate resignations stemming from ethical scandals are rare. Only a handful of other senators have left the chamber in the post-World War II era under clouds of misconduct, the most recent being Al Franken (D-Minn.) in 2017.Now, Murphy must pick an appointee to fill the position until Jan. 3 — the end of Menendez’s Senate term. Here are some of the prospective candidates who have been floated to temporarily replace Menendez in the Senate.In June, Kim won the Senate Democratic primary for Menendez’s seat. If Kim wins in November, he will replace Menendez in the Senate for a full term beginning in 2025.Kim, a former State Department official who joined the House in 2019, has indicated that he would accept the temporary appointment to the Senate if the governor asks. But the Republican candidate running against Kim in the Senate race, Curtis Bashaw, has urged Murphy to “appoint a caretaker to this seat, as is the long-standing New Jersey tradition, and not give either [Senate] candidate the advantage of incumbency in this election.”Kim’s potential appointment is also complicated by the fact that he ran in the competitive Senate Democratic primary against the governor’s wife, Tammy Murphy.Tammy Murphy, who dropped out of the Senate race before primary votes were cast, has also taken herself out of consideration for the temporary Senate appointment.Way was appointed by Murphy to be the state’s lieutenant governor in 2023, one month after the death of then-Lt. Gov. Sheila Oliver. She is also New Jersey’s secretary of state.She previously was an administrative law judge for the state of New Jersey. Among her other local New Jersey government roles, in 2006 Way was elected to the Passaic County Board of Chosen Freeholders — the state’s precursor to what are now referred to as county commissioners.Campos-Medina is a labor activist who serves as executive director of the Worker Institute at Cornell University. She told Politico that she would be willing to serve if the governor asked.As one of the Democratic candidates who ran in the Senate primary in New Jersey. she came in second in the race, after Kim, with 16 percent of the vote.Salas, who was appointed to her current role in 2011, was floated as a potential Senate contender last year. She’s a former Hispanic Bar Association of New Jersey president and federal magistrate judge.In 2020, Salas and her family were the target of an attack at their home by a self-declared men’s rights activist who had filed a case before Salas. Her son was killed and her husband was critically wounded in the attack. Following the incident, Salas called for tighter restrictions on the personal information of judges.Wells was New Jersey’s secretary of state from 2006 to 2010 under then-Gov. Jon Corzine (D). She is married to Ted Wells, a prominent defense attorney who has mentored House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.).Watson Coleman has been in Congress since 2015 and, before that, she served in the New Jersey General Assembly.When asked about the prospect of the Senate appointment, Watson Coleman’s spokesperson, Mike Shanahan, told the New York Times that she “would gladly continue to serve New Jersey in whatever capacity is asked of her.” But Shanahan added that the congresswoman “doesn’t expect that call.”"

WaPo_109,Who should Kamala Harris choose as her vice president?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/25/kamala-harris-vp-candidates-ranking/,2024-07-26 03:00:02.815182,,"You’re reading the Prompt 2024 newsletter. Sign up to get it in your inbox. The so-called Veepstakes are Washington’s favorite reality show — like “Love Island” without the attractive people. But we’ve seen over the past few decades that the vice presidency can actually be a pretty consequential job. Dick Cheney ran national security policy. Joe Biden oversaw massive spending programs and served as an ambassador to the Hill.So we asked 20 Post columnists how they would rank Kamala Harris’s options. I also joined my awesome colleagues Eugene Robinson and Perry Bacon Jr. to skip ahead to the governing part and discuss what Harris would need in her vice president.First, the ranking. The columnists were asked to choose six candidates and put them in order of who would be Harris’s wisest choice. Here are the results of our very scientific survey:Matt Bai: Leaving aside electoral strategy for the moment, what kind of vice president would benefit a President Harris most, and why?Eugene Robinson: Well, I guess I’ll start with something she doesn’t need. George W. Bush needed Cheney’s experience in foreign policy (although I question whether that’s what the country needed). Harris has had a first-rate education in international affairs over the past 3½ years, so she doesn’t need someone to shore that up. Which is good because none of the principal contenders could help much on that score.Perry Bacon Jr.: I live in a red, rural state, and I felt at times that the Biden-Harris administration was not very plugged into what was happening outside of Washington, elite college campuses and a few regions of the world (Europe, Middle East). Project 2025 has already been happening in about half the country. Govs. Andy Beshear (Ky.), Tim Walz (Minn.) and Roy Cooper (N.C.) have been governing in states that I doubt Harris or her top aides (or Biden’s) have spent much time in. They have not spent their careers largely in D.C. They know the importance of state and local government and policy and where the feds can help. And they would bring knowledge of rural America.Matt: Yeah, I would say something similar, Perry. I do think it would help her to have a veep who has experience implementing policy on the ground and knows the politics of divided states. California isn’t exactly the rest of America, and neither, of course, is Washington. That would argue for a governor, right?Perry: Governor, yes. Maybe there is an nonprofit executive or business leader, too. In terms of governing, Pete Buttigieg would be good — running a small city, running an important Cabinet agency, doing a policy area that is not in the news all the time but really matters (transportation).Gene: I would point out that as California attorney general, Harris did have experience on the state level — and that California has rural areas, too.Matt: Gene, who’s your top pick?Gene: My first pick is Beshear, actually. A Democrat who got reelected as governor in Kentucky obviously knows how to relate to people who might not warm to Harris.Matt: That makes a ton of sense. I like a few of the governors. I guess my fear would be that they aren’t nearly as well-vetted or covered by the media as they were, say, 25 years ago. It’s no longer like jumping from AAA to the majors, in terms of the national spotlight. More like High A to the majors. (I like baseball metaphors.)Gene: That lack of vetting makes any pick a risk, doesn’t it? That’s one reason I like Beshear over, say, Josh Shapiro. Beshear at least has been governor for a while and been through two election cycles. Shapiro just got to the governor’s mansion in Pennsylvania.Matt: What if I suggested to you that she might need a bridge to the business community? Businesses matter, and I don’t think they necessarily trust her. That was a problem for Barack Obama, in my view.Gene: I, too, wonder if somebody who really understands the business community might be very helpful to Harris. She just doesn’t have that experience, and I think business types are likely to be wary of her.Matt: So here’s an out of the box idea, along the lines of a Lloyd Bentsen pick in 1988: How about Sen. Mark Warner (Va.)? Someone older with serious policy cred, ties to business and governing experience in a purple state. Plus fundraising ability. (Leaving aside that you’d have to win back the seat.) Or Sen. Michael Bennet (Colo.), who’s sort of like Warner but younger and from a state with a Democratic governor.Perry: This is an ideological statement but I think business will always have access to the government and the president. They get two Cabinet appointments (Treasury and Commerce) essentially designated for them. I would much rather have a person who is a real spokeswoman for nonurban people, who have a powerless secretary (Agriculture) and not much else. Beshear acts like a kind of mayor for Appalachia, and I think that is useful.Gene: I don’t know if you can leave aside the fact that choosing Warner would guarantee losing the Senate, because Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin would appoint a replacement, right? Bennet is an interesting idea. Perry is right, though, about speaking to nonurban people. That may be the Democratic Party’s biggest weakness, and there are so few Democrats who really understand life in America outside the metropolitan areas.Matt: That is a huge risk. And Perry, you make a persuasive point. If you choose strong Cabinet secretaries, as I think Biden did, then you should already have your liaisons to business. (Provided you don’t undermine them with your rhetoric.) How do we feel about Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker? He knows business and has a strong record. Plus I’d kind of like to see a billionaire mock Donald Trump’s business acumen.Perry: One other thing: Illinois, Minnesota and Michigan in particular have passed a lot of legislation the past two years. I get that senators in theory know their colleagues, but there is a real skill in setting priorities, working with the whole caucus and passing an agenda that appeals broadly. Walz and Whitmer have done that. So has Pritzker, although Illinois has bigger margins in the legislature, so it is easier.Gene: The only problem with Pritzker is that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) would have to point at him when he inveighs against “billion-yahs.”Matt: I consider that a plus. I think we all agree, anyway, that Harris seems best served by a governor. Which leads me to a trivia question: Who was the last sitting governor to become vice president? Was it Spiro Agnew?Gene: Wasn’t Mike Pence still governor of Indiana when he was elected?Perry: Yes, true.Matt: Oh, yes, I completely forgot about Pence. He’s quite forgettable these days.Perry: Well one other thought: Is the vice president in theory a really smart person who knows a lot of stuff and can give good advice? Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) are really, really knowledgeable. I know they won’t get picked, but I would want them in the room to ask a sharp question or push back on a lazy ideaGene: Harris should put Klobuchar and Warren in her “kitchen cabinet,” at least. She can have them on speed dial.Matt: I won’t argue with you guys about Warren. But I do think there are different kinds of advice, and what we seem to be saying is that having governed in a complicated state might make you the most valuable voice in some of these discussions.Gene: Agreed. And I totally endorse Perry’s point about someone who knows a lot about rural and small-town America.Matt: Also, it would be nice to have a White House where not all the advisers come from the Hill. I don’t think that’s helping anyone see beyond the general balkanized mindset of Washington."
WaPo_110,Future Forward launches a $50 million pre-convention ad blitz for Harris,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/25/harris-future-forward-ads/,2024-07-26 04:59:02.840804,,"The Kamala Harris ad blitz has launched.Future Forward, the largest Democratic-leaning super PAC, will spend $50 million on advertising in six states over the next three weeks to introduce the vice president and establish her candidacy before the Democratic nominating convention in Chicago begins, the group announced Thursday.American Bridge 21st Century, the second largest independent advertiser for the Democratic presidential campaign, will restart its advertising Friday in the northern battlegrounds of Michigan, continuing a direct-to-camera testimonial campaign that began in May before taking a break, according to a person familiar with that spending, who requested anonymity to describe the plans. Women Vote, the ad spending arm of the Democratic leaning Emily’s List, also announced Thursday a $2 million digital effort for Harris aimed at younger women in four of the states.“We’re ready to hit the ground running to make sure voters know that Kamala Harris will be a President that fights for them,” Future Forward president Chauncey McLean said in a statement Thursday. “She is focused on improving the lives of all Americans, while Donald Trump is only focused on himself.”The ads will begin airing Saturday, with a positive biographical spot about Harris.That ad describes Harris as “the district attorney who protected children from sexual predators,” “the attorney general who stood up to the big banks to protect homeowners and won,” “the senator who fought to defend a woman’s right to make her own medical decisions,” and “the vice president who fought to cap the price of insulin at $35 a month.”The Harris campaign also launched its first ad on Thursday, aiming to draw a sharp distinction with Republican nominee Donald Trump and amplify the pro-freedom theme that has become central to her pitch.“In this election, we each face a question: What kind of country do we want to live in?” Harris says in the ad, which campaign officials said would air across social media platforms beginning Thursday. “There are some people who think we should be a country of chaos. Of fear. Of hate. But us? We choose something different. We choose freedom.”The new ad backup for Harris counters a short-term advantage Republicans have had in swing states since Sunday, when President Biden announced he was dropping out of the race and endorsed Harris. MAGA Inc., a group supporting Trump, spent $2.9 million on ads between Sunday and Thursday, according to AdImpact, a tracking firm. That included a spot that alleges, “Kamala was in on it. She covered up Joe’s obvious mental decline,” before blaming her for increased immigration and inflation.The Harris and Biden operation spent just under $2 million during the same period, according to AdImpact. The Harris campaign has separately launched a massive digital ad campaign through her affiliated victory fund to raise money this week, spending $4.8 million, according to Ad Impact, over five days. In the five days before Biden’s exit, the same victory fund spent $1.6 million on digital ads.MAGA Inc. is also adding $32 million in ads attacking Harris between now and Labor Day, bringing the group’s planned total for that period to $72 million, according to a super PAC official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss their plans. Politico first reported the new MAGA Inc. spending Thursday.The attack ads will be focused in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona, the MAGA Inc. official said. Spots are expected to criticize Harris’s handling of the southern border — for instance, her past comments that “the border is secure” — as well as her record as a prosecutor.Future Forward’s ad-makers have produced more than 50 potential spots for Harris since Sunday, when President Biden announced he was withdrawing from the presidential race, said a person familiar with the strategy, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.Those spots will form the basis for the coming campaign, with more than half of the spending occurring alongside Olympics coverage, when the group’s strategists expect many of their targeted voters, including those less engaged with politics, will be watching.Future Forward announced a $250 million post-convention advertising commitment in January, the largest single purchase in political history. But the group, which spends through a committee called FF PAC, did not rule out additional spending, either before or after the convention. Discussions of launching ads earlier in July were put on hold after Biden stumbled in a June 27 presidential debate, raising questions about whether he would stay in the race.Future Forward USA Action, an affiliate of Future Forward that does not disclose its donors, has already been one of the biggest spenders of the cycle. The group spent nearly $25 million on broadcast, cable and digital spots last year on its own, and an additional $40 million in partnership with Climate Power. Those spots focused on Biden’s policy achievements as president.Women Vote released two ads on Thursday, both contrasting Harris’s work to ensure abortion access with Trump’s record on the issue. American Bridge has said it plans to spend $140 million in the northern battleground states through November on voter testimonial ads warning about another Trump term in office. The ads focus on attacking Trump for on issues like democracy, his own criminal convictions and members of his own administration distancing themselves from him.Hannah Knowles and Toluse Olorunnipa contributed to this report."

Negotiations began October 2022 for SAG-AFTRA members working at Activision-Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Insomniac Games, Take 2 Productions, WB Games, Blindlight, Disney, Formosa Interactive, Llama Productions and VoiceWorks productions.While the union says headway was made on many issues, the companies “refuse to plainly affirm, in clear and enforceable language, that they will protect all performers covered by this contract in their AI language.”“We’re not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough,” said SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher in a statement. The strike begins Friday.A lobbying firm for the game companies said bargaining was in good faith and that agreements were made in a majority of proposals.“We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions,” said Audrey Cooling, executive vice president of Lot Sixteen, a Washington, D.C. firm. “Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA’s concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the Interactive Media Agreement.” She said it would be “among the strongest in the entertainment industry.”In September last year, more than 34,000 members voted 98 percent in favor of a strike. The guild’s last strike against gaming companies lasted 183 days from 2016 to 2017.The fear of talent being replaced by AI is especially acute in the games industry, where digitized faces and voices are the standard. An investigation in WIRED this month revealed game companies like Activision-Blizzard are already using generative AI tools to help create games.Various voice talents in the games industry spoke up in support of the strike.“Fellow gamers, let’s hear your support for the union actors and stunts and more who help bring awesome games to life,” wrote actor Sean Astin.Our Union @sagaftra Represents Many Performers.

WaPo_112,How Paris made the city the stage for the 2024 Olympics,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/25/paris-olympics-2024-legacy-opening-ceremonies/,2024-07-26 04:46:02.840804,,"PARIS — From Beijing’s Bird’s Nest stadium to the Olympic Park in London, host cities have typically set the stage for the Olympic Games with ambitious new construction that demonstrates their engineering prowess and permanently transforms their skylines.There will be little of that when the world tunes in to the Olympics here this week. The best stage for “Paris 2024,” organizers concluded, was Paris. They hope the city will look and feel like the best version of itself.In a first for the Summer Olympics, the Opening Ceremonies on Friday will take place outside a stadium. Athletes will float down the Seine in a parade of more than 100 boats. Along the way, they’ll pass the expanse of Place de la Concorde, set up for skateboarding competitions; Pont Alexandre III bridge, the finish line for triathlon and marathon swimming; the glass-roofed Grand Palais, the site of Olympic fencing; and the Eiffel Tower, which will serve as a backdrop for beach volleyball.The Olympic organizers selected venues that allow Paris to showcase its distinctive monuments and its rich history — while avoiding the cost and carbon footprint of major construction projects.Organizers also want visitors to appreciate how green-minded the French capital has become. They are promoting their efforts to use sustainable materials and reduce single-use plastics at the venues. They want people to know that the Olympic sites within Paris are all reachable by bicycle, via a vast network of dedicated bike lanes and a newly expanded inventory of rentals.Officials have emphasized, too, that these are socially conscious Olympics. They have tried to spur urban renewal by putting the athletes’ village and a new aquatics center in one of the most impoverished areas of the city, with plans to turn the facilities over to the community after the athletes leave.“The Olympics are accelerators of public policies,” said Patricia Pelloux, deputy director of the Paris urban planning agency Apur.The Paris 2024 strategy, though, has its drawbacks. Embedding the Games in the heart of the city has introduced new complications and security risks. To protect the Opening Ceremonies, authorities have placed much of the city center under lockdown for the past week, causing confusion and frustration for tourists, resulting in disruption and economic losses for Paris residents, and eliciting comparisons to pandemic-style restrictions.But French President Emmanuel Macron has encouraged everyone to wait: “We will all see starting Friday why it was worth it.”Paris 2024 organizers say these will be the most sustainable Olympics in the history of the Games, with half the planet-warming emissions produced by recent Summer Games in London and Rio. At the venues, plant-based food will be served at counters made of reused timber pallets. Spectators are encouraged to bring reusable bottles and make use of water fountains.Some analysts are skeptical about how climate-friendly an event can be when it involves athletes, officials and more than 11 million spectators coming in from around the world, in many cases via carbon-heavy air travel. But there is no question that being named the host city for these Olympics helped Paris go green.“The city of Paris is doing a lot to get prepared for the impacts of climate change,” said Vincent Viguié, a climate change adaptation researcher. “It’s one of the most advanced cities.”The city government, under Mayor Anne Hidalgo, has used the influx of money and attention associated with the Olympics to advance efforts to reduce car traffic, extend bike lanes and open more space for pedestrians — including turning a highway along the right bank of the Seine into a park. City officials claim their policies have reduced air pollution by 40 percent.While the plan to hold swimming competitions in the notoriously dirty Seine appeared laughably impossible when Paris submitted its Olympic bid, Hidalgo triumphantly swam in the river last week — one decade and $1.5 billion later. After the Games, city officials have promised to create river-water pools for the public.The Olympics are also allowing city planners to experiment with temporary road closures that could become permanent. La Concorde is usually one of the city’s most congested squares. But it has been closed to traffic while it serves as a competition venue. Officials hope enthusiasm may grow for parts of the square to be converted into a park space.“It allows us to trigger a lasting evolution of these places and to transform their use,” said Pierre Rabadan, the deputy mayor responsible for the Olympics.But the city government’s climate-oriented drive is not uncontroversial. Conservatives view it as overreach that is prioritizing the interests of wealthy urban dwellers at the expense of Parisian businesses. Some researchers worry that Hidalgo’s policies have only pushed the city’s pollution problem out of the city center. The closure of roads has led to more congestion in the outskirts, thus worsening pollution in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas.In Aubervilliers, on the outskirts of Paris, some residents are frustrated that Olympic preparations resulted in the bulldozing of an acre of a community garden to make way for a swimming pool — not the main aquatics center residents lobbied for, but a lesser training facility.“It’s a disaster,” said Gérard Muller, 70, deputy secretary of the community’s governing council. “It caused a lot of sorrow.”A court ruling that the garden should be kept intact came after parts had already been destroyed.Four miles away, in Île-Saint-Denis, people who spoke with The Washington Post said the Olympics were finally pushing their community in the right direction.Perched on an island in the Seine, this suburb of 8,500 inhabitants feels like a world away from the sparkling Eiffel Tower that residents can see in the distance. Île-Saint-Denis has struggled with drug dealers, high crime rates and dilapidated public housing estates. One third of people here live in poverty.But French officials have hoped to give the area a boost by situating the Olympic Village in a way that it crosses three underserved communities: Île-Saint-Denis, Saint-Denis and Saint-Ouen.Over the course of the Olympics and Paralympic Games, as many as 22,250 athletes will be staying here. Afterward, the plan is to transform the village into a neighborhood with offices, shops and 2,500 mixed-income apartments.Some residents have already moved into new buildings nearby. Their balconies tower over houseboats, new parks and construction sites. A new bridge connects the island with Saint-Denis, where an extended metro line has brought central Paris and its opportunities closer. Officials hope to open a public beach in the newly swimmable Seine.Mohamed Gnabaly, the mayor of Île-Saint-Denis, said the Olympics have served as a catalyst for projects that were long delayed. “We had these projects. The vision has not changed. What has changed is the ambition,” Gnabaly said.On an April afternoon, Gnabaly stood in a school gymnasium wearing a sash in the colors of the French flag to announce finalized plans for “Station Afrique,” where African athletes, fans and local residents can watch broadcasts of Olympics events. The viewing area, Gnabaly said to applause, “will be a place of pride.”Many people appear to share the mayor’s enthusiasm about the impact of the Olympics. “We have new people moving in, new businesses, a new restaurant,” said Isaia Danican, 16, who is part of a break-dancing association and was practicing next to the Olympic Village.“I hope the Olympics will change the image of our neighborhood,” said Maria Pasquato, 31, a Paris tour guide who was born in Ethiopia and moved to France eight years ago.The changes that have come with the Olympics could also make life more expensive, however. Pasquato said she has already noticed a rise in rents, as the area becomes more attractive to central Paris residents who are looking for bigger or cheaper places.The social commitments of these Olympics have also been thrown into doubt by a rise in evictions and removals of homeless people — many of them migrants. A collective of 90 organizations accused authorities of expelling thousands of homeless people from the city center and around Olympic venues as part of a “social cleansing” ahead of the Games.Mayor Gnabaly rejected accusations that his town has suffered such negative impacts. He said buildings from which residents were relocated in Île-Saint-Denis were dilapidated and without working elevators. Moving residents elsewhere is also a new beginning for them, he said.Anthony Ikni, a social worker, disagreed. When families are moved, they lose access to education, work and health care. “Evictions have consequences,” he said.Paris is already one of the most visited cities in the world. Tourism contributes $36 billion annually to the region. But French officials hope to remind Olympic viewers of all there is to see — and not just in the heart of Paris. Equestrian events will be held on the grounds of the Palace of Versailles. Sailing races will take off from the Mediterranean port of Marseille. Farthest away, surfing competitions are happening in Tahiti, part of French Polynesia.Lorick Joseph, who works with the organizing committee, said the choice of Versailles, with its “unique and fantastic backdrop,” was an easy one.Versailles conservation architect Raphaël Gastebois said the Olympics are a good fit for the former royal hunting grounds, which have long been a “laboratory” for efforts to portray France from its best side.“The risk for a place like Versailles is to look only like a conservative place,” Gastebois said. He cited the use of local soil for the competitions, and the long-term opening of a new gate for Versailles residents as examples of how the Olympics will benefit the community.But many Versailles residents appear unconvinced of the benefits.“We’re going to flee — the crowded transport network is going to be hell, and everything will be extremely expensive,” said Paul Charmeil, 21. He worries that the organizers are not creating enough incentives for tourism to truly change.“Many tourists just come to see the palace and then they leave,” he said.Versailles’ Equestrian Academy is only a few hundred meters away from the palace, but on most days the view is blocked by dozens of parked tour buses and streams of visitors.Academy spokeswoman Laura Geisler says the town needs to create new tourism habits. “What’s necessary is to also attract them to Versailles as a city,” she said, so that local retailers and events — such as the academy’s shows — benefit, too.Stéphane Pinon, 37, a wine seller in central Versailles, said he anticipates little additional business from the Games.But having grown up in one of Versailles’ poorer neighborhoods, he hopes the Olympics will show the world that there’s more to France than centuries-old palaces and monuments.“The image of Versailles is wealth and chic,” Pinon said. “But not all neighborhoods here are rich.”"
WaPo_113,California Gov. Gavin Newsom orders homeless camps cleared,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/25/gavin-newsom-homeless-supreme-court/,2024-07-26 04:43:02.840804,,"SAN FRANCISCO — California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday ordered agencies to remove homeless encampments on state land and urged local officials to follow suit, citing a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last month allowing cities to enforce bans on sleeping in public spaces.“In the past, the courts have denied the ability for local government, including the state, to clean up many of these encampments,” Newsom said in a Facebook video discussing his executive order. “ … We have now no excuse with the Supreme Court decision.”California is home to more than 180,000 unhoused people — nearly a third of the country’s total — and almost 70 percent of them live without shelter outside, a larger share than any other state, according to federal statistics.Under Newsom’s order, state agencies — including parks and transportation workers — must prioritize clearing encampments that pose safety risks, such as those along waterways. Newsom urged cities and counties, where most homeless encampments are located, to adopt similar policies.“It’s time to move with urgency at the local level to clean up these sites,” Newsom said Thursday.Newsom, a Democrat with national aspirations, has like other politicians in the state been dogged by complaints over homelessness. He has in turn tangled with leaders of the state’s largest cities over efforts to clear encampments.“No more excuses,” Newsom posted on X. “ … It’s time for locals to do their job.”Newsom’s executive order cannot force localities to act, although he could withhold state money until they comply. It could spark a standoff between his administration and some of the state’s largest cities, also run by Democrats, where homeless encampments are largely concentrated.On Thursday, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass balked at Newsom’s order, noting that an annual count of the city’s unhoused showed their ranks had decreased 10 percent.“For the first time in years, unsheltered homelessness has decreased in Los Angeles because of a comprehensive approach that leads with housing and services, not criminalization,” Bass said in a statement condemning the clearing of encampments.Newsom has expended both political capital and billions in state funding trying to solve the crisis that has only seemed to deepen, and he was part of an unusual coalition of liberal and conservative state leaders who urged the Supreme Court to make it easier for localities to dismantle homeless encampments.Responding to those entreaties, the Supreme Court ruled last month that cities may ban homeless residents from sleeping outside, a sweeping decision that broke along ideological lines and rejected the argument that regulations against camping violate the “cruel and unusual punishment” clause of the Eighth Amendment.In the case, City of Grants Pass v. Johnson, the court’s conservative majority cleared the way for regulations that penalize people for sleeping in public spaces such as parks and streets, even when a community lacks indoor shelter and its unhoused residents have nowhere else to go.Advocates for the unhoused and some local officials warned the ruling would have a devastating impact on some of the nation’s most vulnerable residents. Instead of solving the problem, they argued, the decision criminalized homelessness and would only exacerbate the crisis.But some California mayors, like London Breed of San Francisco, have taken a more aggressive stance, promising to begin clearing encampments in coming weeks.“San Francisco is already doing what the Governor is calling for, with efforts well underway since long before the Grants Pass ruling,” Breed posted on X Thursday. “We’ve made significant investments in shelter and housing, and consistent daily outreach continues to offer services and support. This proactive approach has led to a five-year low in our street tent count.”Breed wrote that she expects the Ninth Circuit court to lift an injunction next week that has limited the city’s response.“More needs to be done to ensure our streets are safe and clean,” Breed wrote. “As we wait for this final step from the courts, our outreach work hasn’t slowed. Our teams are going out every day to bring people indoors and clean up encampments.”In Los Angeles, the epicenter of the epidemic, Bass warned cities against using the Supreme Court ruling as a pretext to “arrest their way out of this problem or hide the homelessness crisis in neighboring cities or in jail.”“Strategies that just move people along from one neighborhood to the next or give citations instead of housing do not work,” Bass said.Jim Sullivan, an economics professor at Notre Dame who studies poverty and homelessness, agreed.“Clearing encampments is not going to reduce homelessness. It’s shifting it around,” Sullivan said. “The presence of encampments speaks to the need for more efforts to both prevent and reduce homelessness.”Research shows that the two most effective ways to prevent and reduce homelessness are emergency financial assistance and permanent supportive housing, which includes services to help with substance abuse or other issues, Sullivan said. While such approaches are expensive, he said, they’re more effective than clearing encampments because “if you’re not providing a path to housing stability for those who are homeless, you’re just moving the issue around.”Hennessy-Fiske reported from Houston."
WaPo_114,Justice Kagan calls for a way to enforce Supreme Court ethics code,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/25/supreme-court-kagan-ethics-code-reform/,2024-07-26 04:40:02.840804,,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Justice Elena Kagan said Thursday that she would support the creation of a committee of judges to examine potential violations of the Supreme Court’s new ethics code, speaking out as President Biden and others are increasingly calling for reform at the high court.In an interview before a crowd of judges and lawyers at a judicial conference, Kagan suggested that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. could appoint an outside panel of highly respected, experienced judges to review allegations of wrongdoing by the nine justices.Last fall, in response to criticism from Democratic lawmakers and outside experts about perceived ethics violations, Roberts announced that the court for the first time had agreed to abide by an ethics code specific to the justices. But the policy did not include a way to examine alleged misconduct, or to clear or sanction justices who might violate the rules. Since then, a new round of ethical questions, and the court’s rulings this term, have increased calls for change.Kagan said the court’s code of conduct, embraced by all the justices, is a “good one,” but said criticism about the inability to enforce it is “fair.”“Rules usually have enforcement mechanisms attached to them, and this one, this set of rules, does not,” she said, adding that “however hard it is, we could and should try to figure out some mechanism for doing this.”Kagan emphasized that the high court does not have such a plan in the works and that she was speaking only for herself.“This is one person’s view, and that’s all it is,” she said.Kagan, one of three liberals on the high court, spoke at the 9th Circuit conference less than a month after the conclusion of a momentous Supreme Court term in which the conservative majority greatly expanded presidential power while making it more difficult for government agencies to regulate vast areas of American life.The court split along ideological lines in two major decisions: granting former president Donald Trump — and all future presidents — broad immunity from prosecution for official actions, and overturning a 40-year-old precedent that had required judges to defer to government agency experts to determine how to implement ambiguous legislation passed by Congress.In the case involving Trump, two justices — Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr.— dismissed calls to recuse themselves because of perceived potential conflicts of interest involving political activity by their wives.Public confidence in the high court is at historic lows. Seven in 10 Americans think the justices make decisions based on their own ideologies, rather than serving as an independent check on the government, according to an Associated Press-NORC poll released in June.Biden is preparing to endorse proposals for legislation to establish term limits for the justices and an enforceable ethics code, The Washington Post reported this month. He is also considering whether to call for a constitutional amendment to eliminate broad immunity for presidents and other constitutional officeholders.In his speech from the Oval Office Wednesday night, Biden said the issue would be a priority during his final months in office. “I’m going to call for Supreme Court reform, because this is critical to our democracy,” Biden said.Many conservatives have opposed such changes, however, accusing liberals of trying to disrupt a court that has shifted dramatically to the right with the addition of three justices nominated by Trump. The changes Biden is talking about would be highly unlikely to pass unless Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress and the White House."
WaPo_115,New U.K. state company to develop offshore wind on seabed owned by Charles III,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/25/britain-wind-power-crown-estate/,2024-07-26 04:23:02.840804,,"LONDON — A new state energy company, set up by Britain’s fledgling Labour government to promote clean, sustainable power sources, has found a partner for its first venture: the king.The Crown Estate, the monarchy’s property firm, owns much of the seabed surrounding Britain. Great British Energy will work with the firm to develop offshore wind and other clean energy projects, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Thursday.“This new partnership … will unleash a tidal wave of public and private investment to drive the low-carbon transition, create good secure jobs and supply chains across Britain,” Starmer said at a wind turbine factory in the northwest of England.Labour, in government for the first time in 14 years, is taking a more interventionist approach than the outgoing Conservatives in reaching the state’s climate targets and promoting economic growth. It hopes to reduce reliance on climate-threatening fossil fuels while promoting Britain’s energy independence — the value of which has been made stark by Russia’s war on Ukraine and its impact on international gas markets.“We will be doing our duty to the planet and to the next generation,” Starmer said, while also “taking [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s boot off our throat once and for all.”Britain is already a world leader in offshore wind, and royal-owned land has long been used for offshore wind farms. Further development could boost the state’s coffers — and the royal family’s, too.Existing seabed leases have contributed to soaring profits for the Crown Estate. Much of the firm’s $1.4 billion profit last year came from offshore wind.Great British Energy is the centerpiece of the government’s green policy. The Crown Estate, which is owned by the royal family but run independently, manages the royals’ sprawling property holdings. The portfolio, valued at some $20.6 billion, boasts some of the priciest properties in central London, including Regent Street.Because it also owns a large part of the continental shelf around the United Kingdom, the Crown Estate is a “key partner” for the new state-owned firm, said Bob Ward, a specialist in climate policy and communications at the London School of Economics.“The government set out this very ambitious plan, a massive acceleration of offshore and onshore wind,” he said. It has scrapped a ban on onshore wind. Ward expects the partnership with the Crown Estate to speed licensing, help with technical surveys and allow access to more of the seabed for offshore turbines.The government said the effort has the potential to deliver up to 20 to 30 gigawatts of extra offshore wind seabed leases to the market by 2030.Great British Energy, based in Scotland, is to be backed by $10.7 billion in public funding over the next five years. It will invest in wind power on land and at sea, carbon capture and nuclear power. The government is hoping that private investors can be persuaded to pour in another $77.3 billion in support.Ward said the state contribution to Great British Energy was “not nearly enough to achieve the ambitious target of decarbonizing the power sector by 2030,” but it’s hoped it will “reassure the private-sector investors.” Before the election this year, when Labour was still in opposition, the party ditched a pledge to spend $36 billion a year on green projects.Britain has developed offshore wind along the country’s east coast, where the relatively shallow waters of the North Sea make it easier to build turbines. But there remain opportunities elsewhere, said Stuart Dossett, a policy adviser at the London-based think tank Green Alliance. He cited the deeper Celtic Sea, where there is interest in launching floating turbines.Profits from the Crown Estate go to the state treasury. Twelve percent then goes to the royal family as the “sovereign grant,” to pay for the operating costs of the royal household, including official travel and entertainment, property upkeep and staff salaries."
WaPo_116,Ex-janitor sues Frito-Lay over Flamin’ Hot Cheetos origin story,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/25/flamin-hot-cheetos-janitor-lawsuit/,2024-07-26 04:10:02.840804,,"A former janitor claimed he invented Flamin’ Hot Cheetos more than 30 years ago after a factory machine broke down and he took home an unflavored batch of the knobby sticks of puffed corn, sprinkling them with bright red chili powder.Frito-Lay, the snack company that makes Cheetos, said he had nothing to do with it.Those clashing origin stories are now the subject of a lawsuit. Last week, Richard Montañez sued Frito-Lay and its parent company PepsiCo, accusing them of defamation by writing him out of the history of how Flamin’ Hot Cheetos came to be.In a 62-page complaint filed Thursday in San Bernardino Superior Court, Montañez accuses PepsiCo and Frito-Lay executives of lying about his indispensable role in the snack’s origin story and feeding that disinformation to the Los Angeles Times, which used it to publish a “defamatory and misleading article” with the headline “The Man Who Didn’t Invent Flamin’ Hot Cheetos.”Montañez claims the article was the start of the decimation of his career as a public speaker and consultant, work he took up in 2019 when he retired from a 43-year career at Frito-Lay and PepsiCo. As a public speaker, he was booking 35 engagements a year at $10,000 to $50,000 a pop, but because of the companies’ “open racism and blatant lies,” those have all but dried up, he alleges in his lawsuit.“I created Flamin’ Hot Cheetos not only as a product but as a movement and as a loyal executive for PepsiCo,” Montañez said. “PepsiCo believed in me as a leader because they knew people would follow me, and they did because they knew my soul is my community. We built this into a $2 billion industry, and I cannot let them take away my legacy or destroy my reputation. I will not let them silence me,” he said in a statement.PepsiCo and Frito-Lay declined to comment on the lawsuit. The L.A. Times, which is not a named defendant in the lawsuit, also declined to address the allegations.Montañez’s rags-to-riches story starts in a Southern California migrant labor camp where he grew up sharing an 800-square-foot, one-bedroom apartment with his parents and 10 siblings, according to his lawsuit. Then, while working at a car wash in the mid-1970s, he got a job as a janitor at Frito-Lay’s plant in Rancho Cucamonga, just east of Los Angeles, it says.Montañez worked there for more than a decade until, inspired by a combination of a company program paying workers $1 for helpful ideas and CEO Roger Enrico encouraging all his employees to “act like owners,” he started experimenting with his wife in their kitchen to create new snack flavors, his suit states. Of Mexican heritage, Montañez focused on flavors that he thought would appeal to Latinos like him, among them lime, chiles and cinnamon, according to the suit.Then, one day in the 1980s, a Cheetos machine broke down, and Montañez took home an unseasoned batch of the puffed corn snacks, the suit says. Instead of neon orange cheese dust, Montañez sprinkled a neon red chili powder inspired by elote, a Mexican dish of grilled corn slathered in a mayo cream sauce and seasoning, it adds.Montañez eventually found himself pitching his spicy creation to Enrico as a snack that would appeal to the growing yet untapped market of Latinos, the suit says, and Enrico was sold.Flamin’ Hot Cheetos became a sensation and a billion-dollar brand in its own right, transcending Cheetos to inspire other chile-flavored snacks including Fritos, Funyuns and Doritos. Meanwhile, the snack often referred to as “Hot Cheetos” embedded itself into the zeitgeist, inspiring rap songs, memes, clothing and even Katy Perry’s Halloween costume in 2014.Montañez kept coming up with snack ideas and climbed the corporate ladder from janitor to Frito-Lay’s Southern California business manager and eventually PepsiCo’s vice president of multicultural marketing and sales, the suit says. He published two memoirs about his journey, including “Flamin’ Hot: The Incredible True Story of One Man’s Rise from Janitor to Top Executive” in 2021.And last year, Searchlight Pictures released “Flamin’ Hot,” a biopic about his life directed by Eva Longoria.Frito-Lay capitalized on Montañez’s rags-to-riches story for decades, sending him across the country to talk about inventing the snack with high-powered politicians, captains of industry and elite academics, the lawsuit states. In doing so, they allegedly allowed him to highlight how at Frito-Lay a literal janitor could become an executive with great ideas and a little pluck.“For decades, [Frito-Lay] recognized Mr. Montañez as the creator of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos,” according to the lawsuit.But in 2018, a former Frito-Lay employee contacted the company to challenge Montañez’s account, claiming she had led the effort to develop the Flamin’ Hot Cheetos, the Times reported. Frito-Lay launched an investigation and, after interviewing former employees and reviewing internal records, found no evidence that Montañez had been involved in developing the product, according to the L.A. Times.“That doesn’t mean we don’t celebrate Richard,” the company said in a 2021 statement, “but the facts do not support the urban legend.”On May 16, 2021, the Times published a 5,500-word article based on that internal investigation. Business reporter Sam Dean spoke with 20 people who worked at Frito-Lay’s divisions responsible for creating new products in the late ’80s and ‘90s and none of them remembered anything like the pitch meeting between Montañez and Enrico.“If that story existed, believe me, we would have heard about it,” Ken Lukaska, who worked as a product manager for the core Cheetos brand when Flamin’ Hots were rolling out nationally, told the Times. “This guy should run for office if he’s that good at fooling everyone.”Frito-Lay told the Times in 2021 that its investigation revealed that the effort that culminated in the creation of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos started in 1989 with a team of snack food professionals at the company’s headquarters in Plano, Tex. Six former Frito-Lay employees told the newspaper they remembered that the product was meant to compete with smaller regional competitors’ spicy snacks that were flying off the shelves at corner stores in Chicago and Detroit.But Enrico’s executive assistant of more than 20 years attests that the meeting did occur, Montañez’s lawsuit states. After the story ran, Patti Rueff allegedly sent an email telling Montañez detractors that she took the then-janitor’s call more than 30 years ago and, inspired by his pitch, patched him through to Enrico, who then asked her to set up a meeting with Montañez.“And the rest is history,” the email reads.A history that remains hotly contested."

WaPo_118,Dylan Cease no-hits the Nationals as Padres complete sweep,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/25/dylan-cease-padres-nationals-no-hitter/,2024-07-26 05:51:02.894226,,"All no-hitters are improbable, but the one San Diego Padres’ right-hander Dylan Cease spun Thursday afternoon was especially unlikely at around 12:14 p.m. It was then that the skies opened over Nationals Park, a deluge that forced a 76-minute rain delay in the top of the first with the visitors in the midst of a three-run first inning.Cease had not yet thrown a pitch, but had already warmed up. Now, everything was on hold as the tarp was rolled onto the field. For Padres Manager Mike Shildt, a decision loomed: Did he transition to a bullpen game to be cautious with his starter’s health, or would he let Cease figure things out?Shildt stuck with his pitcher. Cease warmed up on a mound inside, under cover, managing his arm and biding time until the weather cleared. And three-and-a-half hours later, Cease completed just the second no-hitter in franchise history, methodically dismantling the Nationals in a 3-0 win to complete San Diego’s three-game sweep.Two years ago, Cease was one out from a no-hitter. This time, the ball with the best chance to drop was the last — a line drive from CJ Abrams off a fastball near triple digits, a rare pitch that the righty left over the plate, but one that found San Diego right fielder Bryce Johnson right in his tracks for the final out.“Think I had a little flashback right there,” Cease said. “Man, off the bat right there, it looked kind of like a bloop hit. I saw it stay up. Just screaming and yelling. That was awesome.”“Hit that — I guess hard, but not hard enough,” Abrams said.Cease was the first to celebrate, his index finger toward the sky as euphoria coalesced at the mound, catcher Luis Campusano the first to embrace the right-hander. Luis Arraez, who broke up the no-hit bid in 2022 and now plays for the Padres, was the one who handed Cease the ball from the final out.“Magnificent performance,” Shildt said. “Start of the game was interesting enough, gets hot, then has an hour 15 minute rain delay. … First inning, he comes in and says ‘I’m not quite there.' Second inning, ‘getting there.’ Third inning, he just hit his stride.”The no-hitter capped a dazzling run of starts for Cease, who has allowed just two hits over his past 22 innings. It also marked the second time the Nationals have been no-hit in franchise history. The first was Aug. 9, 2023, by the Phillies’ Michael Lorenzen.Cease, who was traded to San Diego (55-50) from the White Sox in a spring training blockbuster that sent three top Padres prospects to Chicago, avoided hard contact all afternoon, nibbling around the zone. He threw 114 pitches, 71 for strikes and struck out nine. He walked three.“He had to warm up as well and sit through a delay as well, so to sit through that plus the no hitter is pretty remarkable,” said Nationals lefty Patrick Corbin, who allowed three runs in seven innings.“I’ve been on both sides of no-hit, perfect games,” Nationals Manager Dave Martinez said. “This is the 10th one I’ve seen live. Every one, it’s something special.”The first rumblings of history coming cane in the fourth inning when one of the 20,755 in the crowd yelled from the upper deck behind home plate that Cease was throwing a no-hitter, a blatant attempt to jinx the 28-year-old. No such luck.After striking out Jacob Young with a 100 mph fastball to end the sixth, Cease spun toward the direction of his second baseman. After he was done watching Juan Yepez ground out to finish the seventh, he turned toward the dugout and spun his finger before shaking Shildt’s hand, making it all the more evident that he wanted to finish the game — but perhaps wouldn’t be given the shot, with lefty Adrian Morejon warming in the bullpen.Indeed, Sildt said after the game, the plan was to pull Cease after the frame. There was a debate. For only the second time in Shildt’s career, he was talked out of a decision to remove a starter.“Thankfully, they let me talk him into it,” Cease said. “And then, he we are.”Cease came back out for the eighth and needed just nine pitches to dispel James Wood (strikeout), Keibert Ruiz (groundout) and Luis García Jr. (groundout). As he returned to the dugout, he pumped his fist softly by his chest.Cease’s go-to pitch against the Nationals (47-56), just as it was when he one-hit them June 26, was his slider. In that previous start, the Nationals managed all of one hit. Thursday, they barely sniffed a knock. Abrams pulled a long fly out to right field in the fourth, but that needed another 10 feet to clear the wall. Ruiz nearly poked one through the infield in the eighth, but Xander Bogaearts corralled it, bobbled it, then narrowly got the Nationals’ slowest runner at first base.“His fastball’s got the ride and the slider bites, so he gets a lot of swing and miss or weak contact,” Abrams said. “You saw that today.”“In every no-hitter there are a couple of plays that save it,” Cease said. “I think there were a couple right there. Made it happen.”He struck out Wood three times, twice on a fastball and once on a slider. Only Lane Thomas and Abrams reached base, the former walking twice and the latter once. The Nationals scored in just one inning during the entire series — a three-run first Wednesday in what turned into a 12-3 loss. The team continues to struggle against strong sliders.“He kind of just picks around the plate,” Thomas said. “Props to him. Just a good day.”In the ninth, the Milton, Ga., native came out to applause from behind the visitors’ dugout, briefly allowing the umpires to check his glove. They didn’t find anything nefarious.And so Cease went to the rosin one final time for a bit more grip. Ildemaro Vargas made him work for an eight-pitch groundout, bringing his pitch count to 111, his dugout now at a standstill. Young grounded out on the next pitch and a roar went up inside the park. The Padres dugout clapped. Then Abrams slashed a liner to right that found Johnson’s glove. That fan who tried to jinx him back in the fourth? He was right — Cease had a no-hitter.“It’ll set in even more as time goes,” Cease said. “But I’ve been close, and to finally get it done, it’s one of those things that’s just — it feels so remarkable and hard to believe. To be able to do it and go out and experience it, I really don’t even know how to feel, I’m just happy.”Notes: Before Thursday’s game, the Nationals signed second-rounder Luke Dickerson, a high school shortstop from New Jersey, to a $3.8 million bonus, a pool-era record for a player drafted in the second round or later. The slot value for his pick, No. 44, is $2,122,200 — he signed for roughly the equivalent value of pick No. 22 ($3.802 million). Because Washington traded for pick No. 39 in the Hunter Harvey deal, the Nationals had more bonus pool money to work with, and therefore could negotiate to pay well over slot value for a player they regarded highly.The Nationals have signed 19 of their 21 picks, with only Florida State righty Yoel Tejeda Jr. (14th round) and Florida third baseman Colby Shelton (20th) left. The deadline to sign picks is 5 p.m. Aug. 1."
WaPo_119,"The USWNT, under new boss Emma Hayes, races to an Olympic triumph",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/25/uswnt-zambia-mallory-swanson-trinity-rodman-olympic-soccer/,2024-07-26 05:46:02.894226,,"NICE, France — The U.S. women’s national soccer team arrived at these Olympic Games without a major trophy or medal to its name for five years — an eternity for a program that set the gold standard decades before most of the world discovered the wonders of the women’s game.Almost one year since their worst performance at a premiere tournament, the Americans arrived here under the direction of a new coach and with a troupe of new performers aiming to set a fresh course in an increasingly competitive environment.On the eve of the Opening Ceremonies, almost 600 miles from Paris, the four-time gold medalists opened a new chapter Thursday with a display that, at times, conjured memories of their brightest days.They scored three early goals — two in a 70-second span by Mallory Swanson — and routed shorthanded Zambia, 3-0, in the Group B opener for both sides.Greater tests await: Germany — a perennial titan that raced to a 3-0 victory over Australia — is Sunday’s opponent in Marseille, followed by a meeting with the Aussies on Wednesday in that port city. Two teams will receive automatic berths in the quarterfinals and the third-place finisher could also advance.The outcome was a triumph for Emma Hayes, the renowned Chelsea FC coach who took over the U.S. program in earnest last month. Her broad ambition is to position the team to win the 2027 World Cup in Brazil, but at the Olympics, a medal is also in her thoughts following the team’s semifinal elimination at the 2021 Toyko Games and a round-of-16 ouster at the World Cup last year.It was also a triumph for Swanson, the immensely talented winger, who missed the World Cup with a severe knee injury and returned to the squad this spring.The U.S. team’s first game in a major competition since the World Cup marked a turning point following the retirement of Megan Rapinoe and Julie Ertz, among others, and the omission of veteran forward Alex Morgan from the Olympic squad.While several veterans remain pivotal to Hayes’s efforts, a new wave is beginning to put its stamp on the program. That includes Swanson, Sophia Smith and Trinity Rodman, the Washington Spirit star whose scoring gem got things started Thursday.The Copper Queens, as the Zambian team is known, are ranked No. 64 — 59 places behind the United States. Down three goals, they played the last 57 minutes with 10 players because of a red card.The Americans had one defensive objective: Stop Barbra Banda, who in her first season with the Orlando Pride is tied for the NWSL scoring lead with 12 goals in 12 matches. She showed flashes of danger but did not have the supporting cast to make an impact.On the women’s soccer calendar, the Olympics have fallen well behind the World Cup in importance as the latter has swelled with participants and popularity. The Olympics are a sprint: up to six matches in 17 days with 18 active players — five fewer than at the World Cup.With just 12 teams, there are few, if any, easy matches. Based on FIFA’s rankings, the United States is the fifth-best team in the tournament, behind Spain, France, England and Germany.With Germany and Australia looming, the U.S. team was in an almost must-win situation Thursday in the first meeting between the programs. Zambia qualified for its third consecutive major tournament following appearances at the 2021 Olympics and 2023 World Cup. Much of the roster plays in the low-level domestic league, but two have gone to the NWSL and another will join the circuit after the Olympics.Banda displayed her attacking prowess in the opening moments when Tierna Davidson was forced to take her down just outside the penalty area. Before and after that, the United States threatened inside the box, only to encounter the same glaring issues that tarnished the two Olympic tuneups (one goal overall).Shot placement was off and Rodman chipped the ball off the crossbar. Swanson hit the crossbar with a six-yard header and Lindsey Horan’s side volley was cleared off the goal line by a defender.Zambia’s good fortune did not last much longer.The breakthrough came in the 17th minute on Rodman’s special goal. Smith beat Esther Siamfuko along the sideline and supplied Horan in a pocket of space. Rodman collected Horan’s service in stride and, with two defenders closing, used a clever touch and spin to free herself and slot home a 13-yard shot.Swanson then scored twice in rapid succession. Horan set up the first, from almost the same spot as her first assist. Swanson pointed to where she wanted the ball. Horan delivered. After one touch, Swanson expertly drove a rising shot into the near side.After the restart, a Zambian giveaway allowed Rose Lavelle to trigger the attack. She sprayed the ball wide to Smith, who targeted Swanson roaring into the box. Swanson danced around advancing goalkeeper Ngambo Musole and scored into the open net for her 36th goal in 95 appearances.She became the sixth U.S. player to record multiple goals in an Olympic match.Zambia’s dim outlook grew worse in the 33rd minute when defender Pauline Zulu was red-carded for taking down Smith on the edge of the penalty area. After video replay confirmed the seriousness of the infraction, Zulu left the field with her hands hiding tears.Despite the advantage, the U.S. team reverted to early-match form and squandered numerous chances.Notes: Smith departed in the 43rd minute with an injury, giving way to Lynn Williams. Smith was being evaluated, a team spokesman said. … Lavelle left at halftime as part of Hayes’s effort to manage her minutes in the tournament. Korbin Albert entered. … Attacker Jaedyn Shaw was unavailable because of an injured leg muscle. Croix Bethune, the Washington Spirit’s rookie standout, was promoted to the matchday roster from the alternate squad. It remains unclear whether Shaw will return for the Germany match Sunday. …The first U.S. matches after the Olympics will come in friendlies against Iceland on Oct. 24 in Austin and Oct. 27 in Nashville, the U.S. Soccer Federation announced. The opponent and venue for an Oct. 30 game is close to being finalized."
WaPo_120,His fixer-upper wasn’t perfect. Now the city wants to auction it off.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/25/vacant-blighted-real-estate-tax-auction-dc-housing/,2024-07-26 05:28:02.894226,,"He was startled by the roar of a lawn mower right outside his window.Which was strange, because Richard Jaskiewicz doesn’t have a lawn.“By the time I got to the window and looked outside, they were done. Just chopped it all off. There were eight guys and two trucks out there,” said Jaskiewicz, 63, showing me the piebald, postage-stamp front yard that had once been covered in ivy (and some weeds, he readily admits) outside his townhouse in Northwest Washington.“Then the city sent me a bill for $2,000,” he said.That wasn’t the worst of it.The retired mechanic is about to lose his home because someone determined it wasn’t as well-maintained as the other townhouses being snapped up and remodeled in his neighborhood. It’s in a pretty hot neighborhood, between the city’s Target shopping center at Columbia Heights and around the corner from one of our food critic’s favorite restaurants.The city’s Department of Buildings — most likely prompted to action by complaint calls from residents — declared the aging five-bedroom beauty as vacant and blighted. Jaskiewicz began getting notices that his biggest asset, which was built in 1908 of brick and Indiana limestone and which he bought in 1997, was headed to a tax auction.“It was a little worn when I bought it,” he said. “But I’ve been working on it for years. Was planning to keep fixing it up.”There are almost 350 properties that the District has declared vacant and blighted, among nearly 3,500 residential properties that are deemed vacant, according to the Department of Buildings database.Housing in D.C. is consistently ranked as some of the nation’s most expensive, fueled by an ongoing housing shortage and a waiting list for affordable housing that was 40,000 people long last year.So a city agency aggressively making unused housing usable is generally a good thing.In some cases, neighbors are clamoring for the city to get rid of the decaying properties that attract rodents and interlopers doing sketchy things.“They need to do something about this, it’s a danger to the neighborhood,” said a neighbor of 1616 E St. NE; a small apartment building on the vacant and blighted list that is boarded up, fenced off and falling apart.But this is not the case with Jaskiewicz.“This is my home. I live here, I’ve lived here for decades,” he said.True, his neighbors told me they see him come and go most days as he heads out for groceries or to yoga class.But his house doesn’t look like the Pinterest renovations happening in the gentrifying parts of the city, no sans-serif house numbers, Pottery Barn lounge furniture or burbling fountain out front.It’s not an eyesore either, though. I visited some of the other houses that got on the “vacant” and “blighted” list, like that building on E Street. The ones I saw are crumbling and hollow-eyed — the ones you avoided or tried to explore as a kid, depending on the kind of child you were.The government tried to regulate this problem through taxes.Normally, D.C. properties are taxed at 85 cents for every $100 of assessed value. If a home is vacant, it jumps to $5 for every $100, and if it’s blighted, it goes to $10 for every $100 of assessed value, a smart tactic by the city to prevent absentee owners or developers from tying up D.C.’s valuable housing stock.Jaskiewicz bought his townhouse in 1997 for $127,273 and owns it free and clear. He’s paid his property taxes on time every year. But he faced a monster tax bill that increased tenfold to nearly $52,000 from his usual rate because the property assesses at more than $1.1 million.“He will have to decide between forfeiting refilling his medications, getting another job, selling assets or other draconian measures just to pay bills that shouldn’t be there,” said Randy Alan Weiss, a friend of Jaskiewicz who is also an attorney and has been helping him with the issue.Weiss and Jaskiewicz tackled the vacancy issue, gathering enough documentation from water bills and neighborhood testimony to convince the city inspectors that Jaskiewicz lives in the house.That got the city to change the property status to “occupied,” according to documents. The bill, however, is still more than $26,000, according to the latest letter Jaskiewicz received. He doesn’t have that kind of cash, he said.He’s also receiving notices that the house is headed to a tax auction.The Department of Buildings wouldn’t comment on Jaskiewicz’s case specifically.“Through a task force with ANC and other community leaders, we are working to ensure that DC’s regulations remain transparent, accessible, and responsive to changing circumstances,” the department said in a statement when I asked for details. “Code violations can be dangerous, and we urge anyone in violation of DC code to respond in a timely manner to communication from DC government, and to work with our team to ensure that issues are quickly addressed.”The case “metastasized” all the way to tax auction because Jaskiewicz hadn’t responded to earlier notices and attempts to reach him, a department official told me.Jaskiewicz is not a social guy. He’s taciturn, a bit of a curmudgeon. After spending a career repairing and restoring classic cars, he withdrew into his lifetime project — his house. And when he got the blighted sticker on his home and the city began sending him notices, he started fixing up his windows, pulling the remaining weeds.“It was confusing, all the stuff they sent me,” he said.He’s had a rough go of things as the notices piled up. His fiancé died of cancer, his parents died.“I wasn’t totally together after that, you know?” he said.The building officials I talked to all said the situation is resolvable if Jaskiewicz just gets in touch with them.But Jaskiewicz insists that he has called them and has made little progress.“I just didn’t realize what the implications of all this were,” he said. “I thought I was just dealing with cleaning up the yard a bit.”"
WaPo_121,New York prosecutor files opposition to reversing Trump’s conviction,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/25/bragg-trump-new-york-trial-immunity/,2024-07-26 05:17:02.894226,,"NEW YORK — Donald Trump’s falsifying business records conviction should not be reversed because of the Supreme Court’s recent presidential immunity ruling for reasons including a wealth of incriminating evidence, prosecutors said in a court filing made public Thursday.Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office wrote that the Supreme Court’s decision giving broad meaning to presidential immunity involving formal duties does not have any bearing on the May jury verdict that found Trump guilty on 34 felony counts for illegally trying to conceal the nature of a hush money payment to an adult-film actress shortly before the 2016 election.Trump’s lawyers have argued that jurors were improperly exposed to witness testimony and records that were generated in 2017, his first year in office, that were extensions of the former president’s official duties. Prosecutors said the nation’s highest court did not hand down any finding that should disturb the verdict or see the case dismissed.“The Supreme Court’s recent ruling thus has nothing to say about defendant’s conviction,"" lawyers for Bragg’s office wrote. “But even if that decision required the exclusion of all of the evidence that defendant cites here, there would still need be no basis for disturbing the verdict because of the other overwhelming evidence of defendant’s guilt.""New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan delayed Trump’s sentencing more than two months until Sept. 18 to give defense lawyers time to formally argue that evidence used by Bragg’s trial team was not admissible under the immunity doctrine which prohibits prosecution based on a president’s official acts.The U.S. Supreme Court issued its controversial ruling July 1. The court ruled 6-3 along ideological lines that a president can’t face prosecution for official acts or through the use of evidence related to official conduct. Private conduct is not covered by that protection.With the new timeline, the Republican presidential nominee could receive a jail sentence less than two months before the November election. He could also get a non-jail sentence or a sentence that is stayed pending the outcome of his appeal.If Merchan upholds the verdict, the matter could be locked up in appeals until well after the election. An appeals court could stay enforcement of Trump’s sentencing.Defense lawyers have argued that a significant amount of the evidence used against Trump at trial was collected in the course of presidential actions and should have been excluded. The indictment should be dismissed altogether, they said, because the district attorney’s case has been intertwined with prohibited evidence since the case was presented to a grand jury last year.Bragg’s reply to Trump’s motion said that “evidence that [Trump] claims is affected by the Supreme Court’s ruling constitutes only a sliver of the mountains of testimony and documentary proof that the jury considered in finding him guilty of all 34 felony charges beyond a reasonable doubt.”"
WaPo_122,"OpenAI is testing web search features for ChatGPT, challenging Google",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/25/openai-search-google-chatgpt/,2024-07-26 05:01:02.894226,,"SAN FRANCISCO — ChatGPT maker OpenAI showed off a new web search product Thursday, directly challenging search giant Google and laying out its vision for how chatbots may change the way people interact with the broader web.The free tool, called SearchGPT, consists of a search box similar to that of a traditional search engine. Users can ask follow-up questions in a conversational tone to get more specific answers. SearchGPT will initially be available to a small group of users and publishers before eventually being integrated into ChatGPT, OpenAI said in a blog post Thursday.Since ChatGPT’s launch in November 2022, tech analysts have suggested that chatbots could upend the way people surf the web. The bots are trained on huge amounts of information scraped from the internet, which they can draw on to answer questions. But the technology also constantly makes up information, making the tools unreliable in terms of accuracy. AI companies have tried to fix the problem by plugging their chatbots into search engines. ChatGPT already searches Bing, Microsoft’s search engine, to find up-to-date information for some queries. Perplexity AI, an AI search start-up, uses AI to search the web, read articles and provide summaries that it aims to make more direct and conversational compared with regular Google search results.OpenAI’s push into search comes after Google in May jumped heavily into using generative AI in search. After ChatGPT’s launch, the company began testing its own AI search features, and in May it put AI answers at the top of search results for most people in the United States. The results have been mixed, with some of the search answers being nonsensical or just plain incorrect, such as Google’s bot telling people to put glue on pizza. A spokesperson for Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.It’s unclear whether the new OpenAI tool also works with Bing. Microsoft uses OpenAI’s technology as part of a licensing agreement. A spokesperson for OpenAI said its search tool draws on information from “third-party partners and direct feeds.”Publishers, from newspapers to one-person bloggers, have raised concerns that the move to AI answers over search results could undermine or even destroy their businesses. Web publishers rely on traffic from Google to stay afloat and make money, and they have had a long and uneasy relationship with the search giant, which often disrupts web publishers with tweaks and changes to the way search results work.OpenAI has tried to position itself as more of an ally to publishers by signing deals with such news organizations as News Corp., the Atlantic, the Associated Press and Politico’s parent company, Axel Springer. The new search tool gives the source of the information and links back to it, according to images provided in OpenAI’s blog post. The announcement featured positive quotes from the chief executives of News Corp. and the Atlantic.News organizations have also began developing their own AI-driven tools to keep up with tech companies. The Washington Post launched a “Climate Answers” bot in July that uses generative AI to answer readers’ questions about climate change, based on information from Post stories.Individual news workers, including at some companies that have signed deals with OpenAI, are more skeptical. Some journalists have said they are worried that AI trained on their work will eventually be used to replace them. The union representing workers at the Atlantic said in May that it was “deeply troubled” with the company’s deal with OpenAI.OpenAI also said it would be “improving the experience” in areas such as commerce, signaling that the tool could have advertisements, another direct challenge to Google’s dominant business model of showing ads on search results."
WaPo_123,"Netanyahu meets with Biden, Harris, as they try to close cease-fire deal",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/25/netanyahu-biden-harris-hostages/,2024-07-26 05:31:02.894226,,"President Biden and Vice President Harris held separate bilateral meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday, as U.S. leaders say they are in the final stages of closing a deal that will pause the fighting in Gaza and release hostages.Biden and Netanyahu, who have known one another for decades, appeared genial at the start of their meeting, despite deep underlying tensions over the ongoing conflict and a path forward. U.S. officials signaled that Biden was expecting to press the prime minister to agree to the outstanding issues holding up the agreement.“Well, welcome back, Mr. Prime Minister,” Biden said before the meeting began in the Oval Office. “We’ve got a lot to talk about. I think we should get to it.”Biden has repeatedly said a cease-fire deal was imminent in recent weeks, even though the United States and other negotiating partners have been frustrated for months by the lack of an agreement.The meetings, part of Netanyahu’s hours-long visit to the White House, came a day after the Israeli leader delivered a defiant speech to a joint meeting of Congress. Netanyahu rejected criticisms from international organizations about Israel’s conduct, posited without evidence that Iran was funding pro-Palestinian protesters surrounding the Capitol and vowed Israel would settle for nothing less than “total victory.”Harris’ solo meeting with Netanyahu, meanwhile, took on greater importance after she became the presumptive Democratic nominee this week following Biden’s stunning decision to withdraw from the presidential race. She has not publicly diverged from Biden’s approach to the war, but she has pushed the administration to more heavily consider Palestinian suffering in its response and often been the highest profile official to speak emphatically about civilian casualties.“She’s been a full partner in our policies in the Middle East, particularly with our policies towards Israel and the war in Gaza,” John Kirby, a White House spokesman, said of Harris before her meeting with Netanyahu.He added that she has “been involved in nearly every conversation that the president has had with the prime minister and very much engaged throughout.”Since announcing his decision not to seek re-election, Biden has said ending the war in Gaza remains a top priority in his final months in office. “I’m going to keep working to end the war in Gaza, bring home all the hostages, and bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war,” Biden said Wednesday during his Oval Office address.Kirby told reporters Thursday that the negotiating parties are closer “than we’ve been before” to a deal, though he emphasized there are still important gaps to bridge.“We need to bring the war to an end and one of the principal things that the president is going to talk to the prime minister about today is how we get there, how do we end this war, and the best way in his view is to get this deal in place,” Kirby said.The first phase of an agreement would include a six-week pause in fighting and the release of some hostages. The second phase would continue a cessation of hostilities while Hamas and Israel negotiate a permanent cease-fire, determining the withdrawing of Israeli forces from Gaza.Biden’s meeting on Thursday was his first face-to-face encounter with Netanyahu since the president traveled to Israel in the days after the Oct. 7 attacks.Biden tightly embraced Israel in the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attacks, but as Netanyahu has continued an all-out assault on Gaza, he has become more critical, calling on Israeli leaders to allow more aid into the territory, where nearly 2 million civilians are suffering from widespread starvation and a collapsed health-care system.In his brief public remarks, Netanyahu spoke warmly about Biden, though after leaving the White House, the Israeli leader will head to Mar-a-Lago to meet with former president Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president.“From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,” Netanyahu said to Biden.Despite the ongoing tensions, Kirby said Biden and Netanyahu have “healthy relationship,” though he did not know if the president had watched Netanyahu’s speech on Wednesday.“And by healthy, I mean they’re not going to agree on everything.” Kirby said. “They haven’t, through the long political lives that both of them have enjoyed, always agreed on everything. They come from two different political traditions, but they know one another.”After their bilateral meeting in the Oval Office, the two leaders met with families of Americans held hostage by Hamas. By including the families, the White House hoped to elevate their message that Netanyahu needs to stop making new demands and agree to the hostage cease-fire deal on the table, officials familiar with the matter said.Netanyahu’s government is negotiating for the release of more than 100 Israeli hostages, though of that number, many are believed to be dead.Following their meeting with Biden and Netanyahu, the hostage families said they were now “more optimistic” than at any other time since November, when Hamas released more than 100 people in the war’s first — and only — negotiated hostage release, said Jonathan Dekel-Chen, father of American hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen.Speaking in front of cameras outside the West Wing, Dekel-Chen said the families were given “absolute commitment from the Biden administration and from Netanyahu that they understand the urgency of this moment now to waste no time and to complete this deal as it currently stands, with as little change as humanly possible within it.”The families also emphasized the convergence between Biden, Harris and Trump in supporting an immediate deal.“We’ve got a rare moment now where the current president of the United States, and anybody who might become president of the United States — both Vice President Harris and Donald Trump — are all aligned in saying this deal must get done now,” said Jon Polin, father of American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin.Since the start of the Gaza War, Netanyahu has come under criticism for putting his military objectives related to the total destruction of Hamas ahead of the urgency of securing the release of hostages.Earlier this summer, the United States blamed Hamas for adding new demands to the deal, but that outlook shifted earlier this month when Netanyahu directed Mossad Chief David Barnea to negotiate further stipulations that moved the goal posts, said diplomats who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations.Under the new conditions, Israel would not agree to withdraw its forces from the Philadelphi Corridor along the Egyptian border, the diplomats said. Israel would also not allow unrestricted access for Gazans seeking to return to their homes in the north — insisting that its forces be permitted to establish checkpoints to monitor the movement of the displaced.A senior administration official said on Wednesday that the United States was looking for both Israel and Hamas to move on certain things to conclude a deal, but he did not spell out the details.The State Department has used much less confrontational language toward Israel when describing its negotiating position in the talks.When asked about Israel’s negotiating position, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said, “We have been engaged with them over the course of the past few weeks trying to bridge the final differences. And what they tell us and what they continue to show is that they are working to try to get a deal.”"

WaPo_125,Judge in Washington state dismisses safety violation allegations at Amazon,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/25/amazon-workers-safety-washington-dismiss/,2024-07-26 06:54:02.830449,,"A Washington state judge decided in favor of Amazon in a major workplace safety case, a significant win for the e-commerce giant, which has grappled with allegations that it sets a grueling pace for warehouse workers, exposing them to injury and illness.The judge threw out four serious safety violations Amazon had been charged with by state workplace safety officials in recent years, according to court documents shared with The Washington Post by Amazon.“Amazon presented persuasive evidence it has a robust safety and health program. It fully communicates safety and health policies to its employees,” said Judge Stephen Pfeifer in the decision issued Wednesday.“We appreciate that the court took a close look at the facts about how we prioritize employees’ health and safety, recognized the progress we’ve made, and vacated all the citations at the heart of this case,” Amazon spokesperson Maureen Lynch Vogel said in an email statement.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.The court’s decision was filed with Washington’s Department of Labor and Industries on Wednesday. Officials are working to redact the document, and plan to officially release it Monday, state officials said. The labor department did not immediately respond to request for comment on the case.The Amazon case in Washington began last summer, stemming from allegations by state labor regulators that the company had created an unsafe working environment. The state alleged that Amazon put warehouse staff at unnecessary risk of ergonomic injury and musculoskeletal disorders, and willfully continued to do so after state intervention. Amazon appealed those citations, which have now been dismissed.In the case, the state had argued that Amazon’s warehouses failed to comply with the rules of ergonomic science, and that the layout of the facilities would have to be altered in order to protect workers. Amazon said its process is unique, and that workplace standards for typical warehouses don’t apply. In his decision, Judge Pfeifer said the state’s argument failed to convince him that “there were economic and technically feasible means to eliminate or materially reduce the alleged hazards beyond which Amazon had already implemented.”Former Occupational Safety and Health Administration director Debbie Berkowitz said that Washington labor officials can appeal the decision.“The state clearly showed that Amazon’s warehouse workers have suffered very high numbers of musculoskeletal injuries and that Amazon had not implemented the ergonomic changes needed to prevent these injuries,” she said in an email statement. “Sadly, Amazon still fails to take responsibility for designing the jobs that caused these injuries.”The federal OSHA has also been investigating reports of alleged ergonomic injuries at Amazon, and could pursue a companywide settlement strategy, though fines so far have been limited, former OSHA officials previously told the Post.This month, preliminary results from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)'s senate committee investigation into Amazon worker injuries were released, including findings that during peak periods in 2019 as many as 45 percent of Amazon workers sustained injuries. Amazon disputed those findings. The U.S. Attorney General for the Southern District of New York announced an investigation into Amazon’s workplace injury rate and recordkeeping in 2022, but no findings have been released and the agency has declined requests for comment on its status.Lawmakers and labor regulators, including OSHA and the National Labor Relations Board, are increasingly under pressure to take action on Amazon workplace issues before the presidential election.Earlier this year, the state of California fined Amazon $5.9 million for violating a new law limiting workplace productivity quotas, or rules that require employees to complete work at a certain rate of speed. Similar quotas exist in New York, Oregon, and Minnesota, and Sen. Markey (D-MA) has introduced federal legislation."
WaPo_126,Maryland-based online education giant files bankruptcy,https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/07/25/2u-online-education/,2024-07-26 06:20:02.830449,,"Maryland-based 2U, one of the nation’s largest online education companies, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Thursday and will go private, after years of explosive growth and debt.Since 2008, the company has partnered with 260 colleges and universities, including Georgetown University, Morehouse College and the University of Southern California, to build online courses and degree programs. Growing competition and a highly leveraged balance sheet began to weigh down the company in recent years, resulting in multiple rounds of layoffs since 2022.To turn the company around, 2U is entering into a deal with lenders and noteholders that will cut its debt load by 50 percent to $459 million, extend the maturity of its loans and provide $110 million in new capital. The company is seeking court approval to tap $64 million of that new capital to keep the doors open during the bankruptcy proceedings, which it expects to complete by the end of September.2U will emerge from those proceedings as a private company backed by its existing lenders and noteholders, including funds managed by Mudrick Capital Management, Greenvale Capital and Bayside Capital.The company said the restructuring process will not disrupt services for students or colleges.“New capital and a healthier balance sheet will enable us to continue our long-standing mission,” Paul Lalljie, 2U’s chief executive, said in a statement Thursday. “The steps we are taking today will enable us to continue investing in our offerings, services, and world-class team to deliver unparalleled online learning to meet the needs of students.”At its peak, 2U was valued at $5 billion in 2018, but the company — now valued at $11.5 million — has lost money every year since going public a decade ago. It spent many of its resources on technology and production, and strategic acquisitions. 2U made news in 2021 when it bought edX, a platform developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, for $800 million. That deal delivered more than 230 education partners to the company but also plunged 2U into debt.Around the same time, the company began facing intense criticism of its revenue-sharing agreements and program quality. In 2021, the Wall Street Journal reported that a $115,000 online master’s program in social work at the University of Southern California, where 2U recruited students, left enrollees with high student loan debt relative to their earnings.A year later, three graduates of USC’s Rossier School of Education sued the school and 2U, alleging the two conspired to mislead prospective students with doctored U.S. News & World Report rankings data. They claimed the profit-sharing agreement USC had with 2U, which receives a share of tuition revenue, incentivized both parties to peddle false claims about the education school.The pair denied the charges, but USC — once 2U’s largest client — began to pull away from the company. In November, 2U told investors that USC was paying $40 million to the company to end the partnership, a revelation that sent shares plummeting.With business in a downturn and looming debt payments, 2U has refinanced loans, cut costs and tried negotiating with lenders since last year. Still, the company has struggled to stabilize its balance sheet. After Nasdaq warned 2U that it was at risk of being delisted from the exchange, the company initiated a reverse stock split in June.Shares of 2U plunged nearly 64 percent to $1.51 following the Chapter 11 announcement Thursday."

WaPo_128,"Trump botches Kamala Harris’s first name, again and again and again",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/25/trump-mispronounces-kamala-harris-name/,2024-07-26 06:04:02.830449,,"CHARLOTTE — In his first mention of the likely Democratic presidential nominee, Donald Trump told a Wednesday night crowd here that “KAH-mala” Harris was the “new victim we have to defeat.”A short time later, tying her to the war in Ukraine, he went with a different variation of her first name: “KUH-mala.”And about halfway through his speech, he promised to name migrant crime after “Kah-MAL-a.”Again and again at Trump’s campaign rally, the former president invoked her by first name. His 90-minute speech included about four dozen references — and in many of those, he botched the pronunciation. It wasn’t a first for Trump — he similarly botched it in 2020, even cracking jokes in the process.With Vice President Harris now expected to head the Democratic ticket this fall, political figures are saying “Kamala” more and more. Often, instead of the correct “COMMA-la,” they’re saying it wrong.Trump and other prominent Republicans are the most public offenders, with Harris’s supporters accusing them of intentionally bungling the pronunciation or using it as a racist dog whistle about the first Black woman and the first Asian American woman named to a major party’s ticket.At the GOP national convention last week, nearly half of the speakers who uttered Harris’s first name blew it. Bob Unanue, the chief executive of Goya Foods, mockingly uttered “Que mala” — which translates as “so bad” in Spanish. Among the speakers who offered a correct pronunciation: former Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley and Usha Vance, the wife of Trump running mate JD Vance — both of whom are Indian American.Harris’s campaign has placed a special emphasis on her first name — which in Sanskrit means “lotus flower,” an important symbol in Indian culture — by relabeling “BidenHarrisHQ” social media channels to “KamalaHQ” and handing out white and navy blue signs that declare “KAMALA” in a bold san-serif on one side and “USA” on the other.Asked Wednesday about Trump’s latest flub and whether it was intentional, campaign spokesman Steven Cheung texted “Hahahahaha!”“Kamala Harris has even pronounced her name in different ways,” Cheung added. When asked for evidence to support that claim, he did not respond.Aimee Allison, founder of She The People, a group that supports women of color seeking political office, said Trump’s voters have hardened to the rhetoric he uses, but it has the potential to turn off others or trigger people’s feelings about not belonging.“He’s going to continue his strategy of name calling and dehumanization, to attempt to rally his base, and this is just another way he’s actually message testing,” she said. “Mispronouncing a name is a common tactic used by people who try to do what we call other, to other someone.”Other women of color, such as Haley, have used Anglicized names to appeal to a broader base of voters. She was born as Nimarata Nikki Randhawa but adopted her middle name as her first before she went into politics and then dropped her maiden name because it “wouldn’t fit on a yard sign,” as she told the Charlotte Observer in 2010. Yet neither moved stopped Trump from repeatedly referring to her as “Nimbra” when the two faced off in the primaries this cycle.Trump also taunted his immediate predecessor in the White House, referring to the 44th president as “Barack Hussein Obama” with an emphasis on that middle name. He also shared false conspiracy theories that Harris and Obama, as well as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), have questionable citizenship claims — despite each having been born in the United States.The crowd at Wednesday’s rally in Charlotte jeered Trump’s repeated mentions of Harris. Afterward, some said they didn’t notice him saying her name wrong. Others excused him.The Republican candidate for state education superintendent, Michele Morrow, who has made her own controversial statements calling for violence against Democrats, said she didn’t hear any mispronunciation by Trump. And, like Cheung, she claimed Harris had stumbled over her own name in the past.“I’ve heard she actually used to pronounce her name ‘Camela’ like “Pamela” back in the day,” she said, citing a local Caribbean newspaper that ran an incorrect headline of “It’s Kamala, Rhymes With Pamela” in 2020. Pressed further, Morrow blamed a friend for telling her it was Harris who got her own name wrong.Trump’s incendiary attacks aren’t just happening on a national scale. Nadia Brown, a Georgetown University political scientist, said that she has heard similar stories while holding focus groups with Black women in politics. But Brown said Harris is pushing back in a unique way by fully embracing her first name.“This is a conscious decision to use her full ethnic name,” she said. “Kamala is [in] a league of her own compared to her peers.”"
WaPo_129,"Youngkin appoints two more to education board, including Scalia daughter",https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/07/25/virginia-education-board-new-members/,2024-07-26 06:02:02.830449,,"Gov. Glenn Youngkin named two new members to the Virginia Board of Education this week, including Meg Bryce, a daughter of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. The additions mean eight of nine board members have now been appointed by the Republican governor.Bryce, who attended the board’s meetings this week, unsuccessfully ran for a seat on the Albemarle County School Board last year. Bryce campaigned on issues such as restoring transparency, raising standards and bringing back “common sense” to the school district. Bryce, a cognitive psychologist with a PhD from the University of Virginia, has previously taught and now serves as a capstone mentor at the university.“Having an expert in psychology on the board with teaching experience is a great addition for navigating the most critical issues facing our public schools and youth today,” Board of Education President Grace Turner Creasey said during Thursday’s meeting.Bryce couldn’t be immediately reached for comment.Youngkin also appointed to the board Ida Outlaw McPherson, an attorney from the Hampton Roads region, Creasey announced at the meeting. McPherson is a former president of the Suffolk chapter of the NAACP and had been appointed by then-Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) as director of Virginia’s Department of Minority Business Enterprise, now the Department of Small Business and Supplier Diversity, and she also has held other government roles.McPherson will join the board for its August meetings.Youngkin spokesman Christian Martinez said in a statement that the governor was thankful to have Bryce and McPherson step into the positions.Martinez said Bryce’s “extensive background in education, her advocacy for student-centered policies, and her commitment to restoring common sense in education for all Virginia students will be instrumental in ensuring that every parent, student, and teacher receives the essential resources and support needed to thrive.”Of McPherson, he said, “Her immense expertise, dedication to community work, and commitment to ensuring high-quality education for every child will be invaluable as we work to restore excellence in education.”During her 2023 run for office, Bryce, in a blog post responding to a campaign sign being vandalized with “SCALIA” painted across it, addressed her relationship to the late justice, who was an outspoken opponent of abortion, affirmative action and what he termed the “so-called homosexual agenda.” She said she chose to distance herself from the name while campaigning because she wanted people to get to know her as an individual.“I knew the opposition would paint a caricature of me and they have done exactly that, in a most unoriginal and unimaginative way, and often with outright lies. They make it clear that they do not see me as a capable, intelligent, independent woman; I am not worthy of their respect,” Bryce said in the post. “… It is increasingly apparent that many in this town have become so consumed by groupthink that they are unable to engage with anyone who holds differing views.”During the race, Bryce also received criticism for removing her children from the public school system and enrolling them in private school. At a candidate forum, Bryce said she made the move in 2020 when she lost faith in the school system, according to the Daily Progress.“I’m so invested that rather than walking away and not looking back, I came back to fight,” Bryce said at the time. “I’m fighting to represent the people that feel that the district has lost its way.”Bryce and McPherson mark Youngkin’s seventh and eighth appointments to the state education board, leaving Anne Holton, who was first appointed by Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) in 2017, as the only member not appointed by Youngkin. Holton, a former Virginia education secretary, is married to U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.).At Thursday’s meeting, the board moved forward with a proposal for a new school accreditation system, an overhaul that came in part from Youngkin’s criticism that too many schools have been reaccredited despite declining student performance. The new system will be based on “mastery, growth and readiness” metrics, and schools will then be categorized into one of four tiers: Distinguished, On track, Off Track or Needs Intensive Support. The plan is up for final approval at the board’s August meeting. board approval in August. "

WaPo_131,Mars rover discovers an ancient rock with a ‘potential biosignature’,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2024/07/25/mars-rover-life-nasa/,2024-07-26 07:56:02.751872,,"Ancient life on Mars? Maybe, could be, might be. But this is going to require a much closer look.That’s the boiled-down message from NASA, which revealed Thursday that the Perseverance rover had found a rock with compelling evidence of organic molecules and with intriguing markings that, if they were seen on Earth, would be consistent with biological activity in the past.The announcement came framed with cautionary notes. Organics can have both a biological or non-biological origin, a fact NASA scientists emphasized. Mars rocks have fooled scientists before.But they’re pumped about this vein-filled rock that they’ve dubbed “Cheyava Falls.” NASA said the rock was sampled July 21 on the edge of an ancient, wide river valley carved by water rushing long ago into Jezero Crater, before Mars lost most of its atmosphere and surface water and became a cold, parched world with dust storms and no sign of anything alive.“We cannot say right now that we have discovered life on Mars,” said Katie Stack Morgan, the deputy project scientist. “But what we are saying is that we have a potential biosignature, which is a set of features that could have a biological origin but do need further study and more data.”The reddish rock is covered with white patches known as “leopard spots.” These spots are produced by chemical reactions that on Earth are often associated with biological activity, Stack Morgan said.“This is the kind of feature if found on Earth, life would probably be involved with it,” she said. “At the same time, these are chemical reactions that don’t require life.”The rover has been traversing an ancient river delta in Jezero Crater, and pocketing samples of rock and soil as part of the ambitious but troubled Mars Sample Return mission. Cheyava Falls is an arrowhead-shaped rock that measures 3.2 feet by 2 feet, and is named after a waterfall in the Grand Canyon, NASA said.The rover took a sample of the rock, the 22nd sample obtained so far. The general plan has been to send another spacecraft to the surface of Mars to be met by Perseverance for the sample transfer. Then the new lander will launch the material into orbit, where it will be transferred to yet another spacecraft — one provided by the European Space Agency — for the journey back to Earth.But fears of cost overruns and delays have called into question whether NASA and its European partners can finish the job. In 2020, a review board estimated that Mars Sample Return would cost $3.8 billion to $4.4 billion. A review last year jacked that estimate to $8.4 billion to $10.9 billion, with samples not getting back to laboratories on Earth until 2040.NASA officials said that wasn’t acceptable, and earlier this year put the mission on a bare-bones budget. They also asked the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory as well as outside contractors to propose new mission architectures that could bring down the cost and operational risk.The rover does not have the kind of advanced technology necessary to tell if the leopard spots and organic molecules are biological or non-biological in origin, said Andrew Steele, an astrobiologist at the Carnegie Institution for Science who is part of the Perseverance scientific team.But the rock’s environment, the presence of organics and the surface features are all compelling and make Cheyava Falls the most important sample obtained so far, he said.“It just ticks all the boxes,” Steele said. “It’s very interesting chemistry with the iron and phosphate concentrations. It shows aqueous activity. It’s a great place for habitability.”He is eager to see the new rock up close, back here on Earth."
WaPo_132,"Father Eugene Brake, activist priest and food bank leader, dies at 89",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/07/25/eugene-brake-capital-area-food-bank/,2024-07-26 07:03:02.751872,,"Father Eugene Brake, a Catholic priest who co-founded the Washington area’s largest food bank and spent decades championing social justice, demonstrating on behalf of Soviet Jews, the antiwar movement and incarcerated people in Virginia, died July 20 at his home in Frederick, Md. He was 89.His partner Lynn Brantley, with whom he helped start the Capital Area Food Bank, said the cause was multiple myeloma, a rare blood cancer. Father Brake had left the priesthood around the late 1980s, in part because of their relationship.Formed through a partnership between the United Planning Organization and the Interfaith Conference of Metropolitan Washington, the Capital Area Food Bank opened in 1980 as a bridge between local agencies feeding the hungry and grocery stores looking to offload extra food.It was initially based out of a leaky warehouse in Northeast Washington, where it distributed just over 1 million pounds of food in its first year, including slightly dented cans and unwanted frozen dinners salvaged from wholesalers.As Congress and the Reagan administration slashed funding for the food stamp program, now known as SNAP, the food bank grew to help fill the void, eventually moving into a bigger warehouse, opening a second location in Lorton, Va., and partnering with local organizations to pair food with health care, job training and educational programs. The group said it distributed 73 million pounds of food last year, half of which was fresh produce.Father Brake “was the heart and soul of the place,” said Brantley, who served as the organization’s president and chief executive before retiring in 2012. “He was a gentle soul, but he knew how to go at things.”When a room in the warehouse needed to be expanded because of all the food coming in, Father Brake tore down the wall himself, even though he had recently fallen off his bike and broken his arm. He built a makeshift desk out of particle board when more workspace was needed. He organized the shopping area and ran errands and hauled potatoes. For a time, Brantley recalled, he picked up cans in a run-down pickup that had more than 500,000 miles on it.“He had this funny, conspiratorial tone about him — he never took himself too seriously, even though he took the work of social justice very seriously,” said Hilary Salmon, a spokeswoman for the food bank.Friends joked that he subsisted entirely on peanut butter and crackers, washed down at times with a Diet Pepsi. He seemed to bike or walk everywhere he went.“Life had a kind of beautiful simplicity for Gene,” said Grant P. Thompson, a consultant to the food bank. “He was one of those people who was a little bit easy to underestimate. Not highly educated, not sophisticated in any kind of way. But to be around him caused you to say to yourself, ‘How can I be better?’ His view on life was, we can all be better.”Activism and advocacy were essential to his ministry. Although he was based for a time at Holy Name Catholic Church, off H Street NE, he also worked at McKenna House, a shelter for men transitioning out of homelessness, and served as a volunteer chaplain at Lorton Reformatory. For years, he rode his bike 30 miles each way to meet with inmates at the Virginia prison, whom he helped find jobs and housing upon their release.When two inmates were hospitalized in 1984 with severe burns from a gas explosion, Father Brake helped draw attention to their plight, demonstrating for three days outside a neighboring landfill. Authorities said the blast was triggered by methane gas that had seeped through sewer lines and phone cables from the dump.The Washington Post reported that Father Brake, “clad in clerical collar and standing before a bulldozer,” delayed a half-dozen garbage trucks operating at the landfill, where he called for the men’s sentences to be commuted. “They have suffered enough,” he said. “Their punishment is going to be for life. They look like victims of nuclear fallout.”One of the men, Anthony Johnson, 25, soon died from his injuries. Father Brake successfully advocated on behalf of the other, Arthur Moody, who had been serving a sentence for unauthorized use of a car and receiving stolen property. He was granted clemency by President Ronald Reagan the next year, at age 27. “Justice has been done,” Father Brake declared.By then, Father Brake was an old hand at using dramatic demonstrations to advance his cause. He was arrested four times during antimilitary protests at the Pentagon, including a 1977 demonstration in which he was said to have joined Father Philip Berrigan and other activists in throwing “human blood and ashes on the floor, the doors and the ceiling” of the Pentagon concourse, according to United Press International.Father Brake was later detained in Moscow while trying to aid Soviet Jews known as refuseniks, who had been denied permission to emigrate, and was arrested outside the Soviet Embassy in Washington in 1985 during a protest marking Yom Kippur.The Catholic hierarchy bristled at some of Father Brake’s advocacy, including an anti-apartheid demonstration he held outside the residence of future Cardinal Pio Laghi, Pope John Paul II’s official representative to the United States. The Post reported in 1989 that Cardinal James A. Hickey, the archbishop of Washington, refused a request to appoint Father Brake the official Catholic chaplain at Lorton.“He’s kind of a prophet, and we need people like him a lot,” the Rev. Richard Fowler, Hickey’s secretary for social concerns, said at the time. “But he feels responsible only to God, and in a church like this, when you have people not willing to cooperate, it makes the cardinal very uncomfortable.”Before long, Father Brake left the ministry and moved in with Brantley. “It was a tough decision to make, because he was very dedicated,” she said, adding that their relationship “definitely played a role” in his decision to stop preaching.For the next two decades, his advocacy continued unabated, including at the food bank, where he remained known by his priestly title.“All I ever wanted was the same opportunities for everybody,” he said, according to a tribute from CEO Radha Muthiah. “That’s what drives me. It’s the very nature of Christianity.”The second of 12 children, Eugene Francis Brake was born into an Irish Catholic family in Wilmington, Del., on July 24, 1934. His mother managed the home, and his father worked for nearly 50 years at a men’s clothing factory. “I was poor,” he said of his childhood, “but I never felt poor.”He and his siblings went to parochial schools — two of his sisters became nuns — and after working as an upholsterer he professed his vows with the Oblates of St. Francis de Sales, who operated his Wilmington high school. He graduated in 1962 from Niagara University, studied at the De Sales Hall School of Theology in Hyattsville, Md., and was ordained to the priesthood in 1965.The next day, he celebrated his first public Mass, not at a church but at the New Castle Correctional Institution, a Delaware prison where a whipping post still stood as a deterrent to crime.In addition to Brantley, his partner of more than three decades, survivors include five sisters and three brothers.Father Brake remained a regular presence at the Capital Area Food Bank until around 2012, when Brantley retired, shortly after the organization opened a new $37 million distribution center.The group had come a long way, Father Brake noted at the dedication ceremony.“We got this far by faith,” he said, “and we will move forward in hope. This building is proof.”"
WaPo_133,"Harris calls for cease-fire and hostage release, after Netanyahu meeting",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/25/netanyahu-biden-harris-hostages/,2024-07-26 07:13:02.751872,,"Vice President Harris implored Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday to accept a cease-fire deal that would pause the fighting in Gaza and release hostages, as U.S. leaders say they are closer than ever to an agreement.“Let’s get the deal done so we can get a cease-fire to end the war,” she told reporters in brief remarks after her bilateral meeting with Netanyahu at the White House. “Let’s bring the hostages home, and let’s provide much-needed relief to the Palestinian people.”Harris’s decision to give her full backing for the deal and explain its general outline appeared designed to add pressure on Israel and Hamas to close the remaining gaps in reaching an agreement to at least temporarily end more than nine months of conflict.That it was the vice president, not President Biden, giving public remarks after they each held separate bilateral meetings with the Israeli leader reflected how much has changed in Washington in recent days. Biden announced Sunday he was exiting the presidential race; by Tuesday, Harris had become the likely Democratic nominee.In her remarks, Harris reiterated she remains a firm backer of Israel, reflecting on collecting funds to plant trees in Israel as a young girl, while also expressing serious concern about some of Israel’s conduct in its unrelenting military campaign in Gaza. As Harris moves forward in the presidential race, she will find herself needing to further define her positions on key issues, especially the controversial Israel-Gaza war, and where, if any, there is daylight between her and the president.Harris has not publicly diverged from Biden’s approach to the war, but she has pushed the administration to more heavily consider Palestinian suffering in its response and often been the highest-profile official to speak emphatically about civilian casualties.“Israel has a right to defend itself, and how it does so matters,” Harris said, adding she has “serious concern about the scale of human suffering in Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians,” and “images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety.”“We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering, and I will not be silent,” she said.John Kirby, a White House spokesman, said Harris has “been a full partner in our policies in the Middle East, particularly with our policies toward Israel and the war in Gaza.” He added that she has been involved in nearly every conversation between Biden and Netanyahu since the conflict began.On Thursday morning, as part of that continuing balancing act, Harris — not Biden — released a strongly worded statement about the protests near the U.S. Capitol, while Netanyahu was delivering an address to Congress, calling out “despicable acts by unpatriotic protesters and dangerous hate-fueled rhetoric.”“I condemn any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organization Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate the State of Israel and kill Jews,” she said. “Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent, and we must not tolerate it in our nation.”Before he met with Harris, the Israeli leader met with Biden, whom he has known for decades, in the Oval Office. The two leaders appeared genial at the start of their meeting, despite deep underlying tensions over the ongoing conflict and a path forward.“Well, welcome back, Mr. Prime Minister,” Biden said before the meeting. “We’ve got a lot to talk about. I think we should get to it.”Biden has repeatedly said a cease-fire deal was imminent in recent weeks, even though the United States and other negotiating partners have been frustrated for months by the lack of an agreement.The meetings, part of Netanyahu’s hours-long visit to the White House, came a day after the Israeli leader delivered a defiant speech to a joint meeting of Congress. Netanyahu rejected criticisms from international organizations about Israel’s conduct, posited without evidence that Iran was funding pro-Palestinian protesters surrounding the Capitol and vowed Israel would settle for nothing less than “total victory.”Since announcing his decision not to seek reelection, Biden has said ending the war in Gaza remains a top priority in his final months in office. “I’m going to keep working to end the war in Gaza, bring home all the hostages, and bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war,” Biden said Wednesday during his Oval Office address.Kirby told reporters Thursday that the negotiating parties are closer “than we’ve been before” to a deal, though he emphasized there are still important gaps to bridge.The first phase of an agreement would include a six-week pause in fighting and the release of some hostages. The second phase would continue a cessation of hostilities while Hamas and Israel negotiate a permanent cease-fire, determining the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.Biden’s meeting on Thursday was his first face-to-face encounter with Netanyahu since the president traveled to Israel in the days after the Oct. 7 attacks. Thursday marked only the second time Harris met with Netanyahu, a White House official said. They met once in 2017 when she was in the Senate; since the Oct. 7 attacks, she has been on more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu.The president tightly embraced Israel in the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attacks, but as Netanyahu has continued an all-out assault on Gaza, he has become more critical, calling on Israeli leaders to allow more aid into the territory, where nearly 2 million civilians are suffering from widespread starvation and a collapsed health-care system.In his brief public remarks, Netanyahu spoke warmly about Biden, though after leaving the White House, the Israeli leader will head to Mar-a-Lago to meet with former president Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president.“From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,” Netanyahu said to Biden.Despite the ongoing tensions, Kirby said Biden and Netanyahu have a “healthy relationship,” though he did not know if the president had watched Netanyahu’s speech on Wednesday.“And by healthy, I mean they’re not going to agree on everything.” Kirby said. “They haven’t, through the long political lives that both of them have enjoyed, always agreed on everything. They come from two different political traditions, but they know one another.”After their bilateral meeting in the Oval Office, the two leaders met with families of Americans held hostage by Hamas. By including the families, the White House hoped to elevate their message that Netanyahu needs to stop making new demands and agree to the hostage cease-fire deal on the table, officials familiar with the matter said.Netanyahu’s government is negotiating for the release of more than 100 Israeli hostages, though of that number, many are believed to be dead.Following their meeting with Biden and Netanyahu, the hostage families said they were now “more optimistic” than at any other time since November, when Hamas released more than 100 people in the war’s first — and only — negotiated hostage release, said Jonathan Dekel-Chen, father of American hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen.Speaking in front of cameras outside the West Wing, Jonathan Dekel-Chen said the families were given “absolute commitment from the Biden administration and from Netanyahu that they understand the urgency of this moment now to waste no time and to complete this deal as it currently stands, with as little change as humanly possible within it.”The families also emphasized the convergence between Biden, Harris and Trump in supporting an immediate deal.“We’ve got a rare moment now where the current president of the United States, and anybody who might become president of the United States — both Vice President Harris and Donald Trump — are all aligned in saying this deal must get done now,” said Jon Polin, father of American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin.Since the start of the Gaza War, Netanyahu has come under criticism for putting his military objectives related to the total destruction of Hamas ahead of the urgency of securing the release of hostages.Earlier this summer, the United States blamed Hamas for adding new demands to the deal, but that outlook shifted earlier this month when Netanyahu directed Mossad Chief David Barnea to negotiate further stipulations that moved the goal posts, said diplomats who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations.Under the new conditions, Israel would not agree to withdraw its forces from the Philadelphi Corridor along the Egyptian border, the diplomats said. Israel would also not allow unrestricted access for Gazans seeking to return to their homes in the north — insisting that its forces be permitted to establish checkpoints to monitor the movement of the displaced."

Future Forward, the largest Democratic-leaning super PAC, will spend $50 million on advertising in six states over the next three weeks to boost Harris, the group said Thursday.The dueling efforts to tarnish and burnish Harris’s record were announced as the vice president was aiming to outline her vision on domestic and foreign policy. After addressing the teachers, Harris returned to Washington on Thursday to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a preview of the delicate political and policy terrain she must navigate during her shortened and frenetic presidential campaign.The developments Thursday reflected the unsettled state of the presidential race four days after President Biden abruptly ended his reelection bid and endorsed his vice president. Though Harris has succeeded thus far in uniting and energizing Democrats behind her presidential bid, the impending onslaught of ads and the complex politics of U.S.-Israel relations threaten to complicate her sprint to Election Day.“Israel has a right to defend itself — and how it does so matters,” Harris said after her meeting with Netanyahu, which she described as “frank and constructive.” She named each of the Americans held hostage by the “brutal terrorist organization” Hamas and addressed the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.“I also expressed with the prime minister my serious concerns about the scale of human suffering in Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians,” she said, again speaking about the plight of Palestinians in more forceful and empathetic terms than Biden has.“We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies,” Harris said. “We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering. And I will not be silent.”Harris’s address to the American Federation of Teachers on Thursday morning was the latest in a string of events that have demonstrated support for her bid to defeat Trump. After a rally in Milwaukee on Tuesday and a speech to thousands of Black women at a sorority convention in Indianapolis on Wednesday, Harris’s speech to the AFT, a 1.8 million-member group that has endorsed her candidacy, was yet another foray into friendly territory with large, adoring crowds.Harris’s one-on-one meeting with Netanyahu was more staid. In her first sit-down with a foreign leader since launching her campaign for president, Harris confronted the rifts that have emerged between the United States and Israel over the war in Gaza. Voters who had vowed not to vote for Biden over his handling of the war have said they will be watching Harris closely as she publicly deals with a thorny foreign policy matter for the first time since Biden’s exit from the race.Earlier Thursday, Harris released her campaign launch video in an attempt to introduce herself to the country during the 100-plus-day sprint to Election Day. The video aimed to draw a sharp distinction with Trump and amplify the pro-freedom theme that has become central to Harris’s pitch.“In this election, we each face a question: What kind of country do we want to live in?” Harris says in the video, which campaign officials said would air across social media platforms beginning Thursday. “There are some people who think we should be a country of chaos. Of fear. Of hate. But us? We choose something different. We choose freedom.”Meanwhile, Trump and his allies have criticized Harris more directly in recent days, aiming to define her before she has an opportunity to introduce herself more broadly to the public.At a rally in North Carolina on Wednesday, Trump referred to Harris as a “lunatic” and “incompetent,” attacking her on immigration and painting her as incredibly liberal.“If Kamala Harris gets in, she would be the most radical, far-left extremist ever to occupy the White House, times 10,” Trump said.The new ads from MAGA Inc. are expected to criticize Harris’s handling of the southern border — for instance, her past comments that “the border is secure” — as well as her record as a prosecutor. The MAGA Inc. official said the group plans to spend tens of millions of dollars on commercials from now until Labor Day on Sept. 2, which often ushers in a ramped-up final stretch of campaign activity. Politico first reported the new ad spending.The attack ads will be focused in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona, the MAGA Inc. official said.Voters in those states and others will also see pro-Harris ads from Democratic-leaning groups, including Future Forward, American Bridge 21st Century and Women Vote. Future Forward’s will begin airing Saturday, with a positive biographical spot about Harris.During a Thursday interview on Fox News, Trump previewed the attacks he will use to paint a more negative portrait of Harris, calling her “nasty” and accusing her of staging a “palace coup” against Biden.Harris’s campaign shot back Thursday by describing Trump as a “78-year-old criminal” and calling him “old and quite weird.”“After watching Fox News this morning, we only have one question: Is Donald Trump OK?” the campaign said, offering Harris as “an alternative.”Harris said Thursday she was eager to debate Trump directly, arguing that voters deserved to see a “split screen” between the two candidates.“I’m ready to debate Donald Trump,” Harris told reporters Thursday. “I have agreed to the previously agreed upon September 10 debate. He agreed to that previously. Now, here he is backpedaling.”Trump has suggested he is having second thoughts after agreeing to a Sept. 10 debate against Biden on ABC. After Biden dropped out, he has said the debate should take place on Fox News.Some Republicans are still searching for the best way to attack Harris, who has entered the race with momentum in the form of record donations, growing crowds and a series of polls showing her closing the gap with Trump. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has asked GOP lawmakers not to make comments about Harris’s identity after some members referenced it in challenging her credentials.More than two dozen Democratic female lawmakers gathered on Capitol Hill on Thursday to show support for Harris, forcefully pushing back on GOP attacks on her credentials. Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) called Harris a “DEI vice president” — referring to the “diversity, equity and inclusion” initiatives in federal programs — and Rep. Harriet Hageman (R-Wyo.) said in a local news interview that Harris was “a DEI hire.”“These are no longer dog whistles. These are full on bullhorns, and it’s predictable,” Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) said.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the attacks were “disgusting.”Harris has largely focused on domestic policy in her appearances this week, while Biden has indicated he would spend the final six months of his term leaning into foreign policy objectives.But groups like the American Federation of Teachers, while mostly focused on issues like educator pay, recruitment, school funding and collective bargaining, have also taken interest in the war in Gaza, calling for a cease-fire and debating whether to divest from companies linked to Israel’s military campaign. The conflict has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and created a humanitarian calamity in which thousands of children have been out of school for months.Biden met with Netanyahu on Thursday and spoke privately with the families of hostages who were among the 250 taken captive during Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack, which Israel estimates killed about 1,200 people. During an address to Americans on Wednesday evening, Biden pledged to use his remaining months to bring resolution to the long-running conflict.“I’m going to keep working to end the war in Gaza, bring home all the hostages, and bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war,” he said.Hours earlier, Netanyahu had delivered a defiant speech to Congress — one that Harris skipped — in which he described pro-Palestinian protesters as “useful idiots.” Thousands of protesters took to the streets to decry Netanyahu’s visit, and some burned an American flag near Union Station in Washington.Harris issued a statement Thursday condemning the protesters who engaged in property destruction or hateful rhetoric, saying the flag “should never be desecrated in that way.”“I support the right to peacefully protest, but let’s be clear: Antisemitism, hate and violence of any kind have no place in our nation,” she said.Harris steered clear of the issue during her speech in Houston, instead speaking out in favor of unions and the public education system and contrasting her positions with Trump’s views.Calling herself a “proud product of public education,” Harris extolled the “noble” work of educators and attacked Republicans who have called for arming teachers to prevent school shootings.“Just think about it. We want to ban assault weapons, and they want to ban books,” she said during the speech, which wrapped in a range of issues such as collective bargaining, abortion, gun violence and same-sex marriage under the broader theme of “fundamental freedoms.”Hundreds of teachers and other attendees lined up at the American Federation of Teachers national educators union convention in Houston’s cavernous downtown convention center to hear Harris speak.Some wore Biden-Harris shirts and said they were excited to hear her speak about education, particularly public schools and teacher recruitment. “It’s a special opportunity, being part of the democratic process,” said Eric Sutz, 45, an elementary school teacher from Long Island Sutz said he’s an independent but a Harris supporter, and he wore a Biden-Harris T-shirt. He said he was pleased to see so many Democrats endorsing Harris. “It should be whittling down to the best people,” he said, and if Harris becomes the nominee, he considers that “the best outcome.”In describing various freedoms she says are at risk in the coming election, Harris has often listed key issues that Democrats hope will drive voter turnout, including gun control and abortion.“The freedom not just to get by, but get ahead,” Harris says in her campaign launch video. “The freedom to be safe from gun violence. The freedom to make decisions about your own body.”At one point in the ad, when Harris says that “no one is above the law,” an image of Trump’s mug shot flashes on the screen. But during her speech in Houston, she did not mention Trump’s felony convictions, a departure from recent events in which she has contrasted her record as a prosecutor with the former president’s long list of indictments.Harris is continuing to ramp up her travel schedule. She plans to hold a campaign event in Atlanta on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the trip who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview an event that has not been publicly announced. The visit will be Harris’s first campaign stop in the battleground state of Georgia as a 2024 presidential candidate.Although Georgia was once more reliably Republican, the state helped deliver the presidency to Biden in 2020. That year, Georgia voters also elected two Democrats to the Senate.Michael Scherer, Hannah Knowles, Maegan Vasquez and Maeve Reston contributed to this report."
